Since coming to Congress, I have visited with business leaders across my district, such as Cindy, the plant manager at Train in Charlotte, and educators at local colleges like Central Piedmont Community Each stressed the importance of educating our workforce to fill existing available jobs and to train for jobs of the future.  We must close the skills gap through innovation and work-based learning opportunities such as those provided through the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century  CTE improves collaboration between secondary and postsecondary schools, employers, industry, and community partners, giving students, regardless of their background, access to quality job training and the opportunity to earn well-paying jobs without having to complete a 4-year degree. This training is critical to closing the opportunity gap that exists in communities like mine in Mecklenburg  IBM, which employs more than 1,300 people in the 12th District, wrote to me just last week to remind us that jobs in growing technology fields demand candidates with high-tech skills that don't always require a traditional degree.

4182,topic-id,1354,"Madam President, here is the scorecard on 557 Presidential nominations during the first 100 days of the Trump administration, through April 29. According to the Partnership for Public Service, in collaboration with the Washington Post, on Cabinet appointments, President Trump did his job, but Senate Democrats did not do their job. The President announced all of his Cabinet nominations before he was inaugurated on January 20, but Democrats delayed confirmation of Cabinet nominations more than those of any other recent On sub-Cabinet appointments, President Trump did not do his job. He was slower than any other recent President to send his nominations to the  So here is what could happen. If Democrats continue their delaying tactics, when President Trump does send sub-Cabinet nominees to the Senate, the President would have every excuse to stop nominating and simply appoint acting officials to about 350 of the remaining key positions.  An administration managed by acting Presidential appointees who have not been confirmed by the Senate would be a first in American history. Delaying the inevitable approval of nominations of a President you oppose might sound to your political base like good politics, but it would be supremely bad governing. Senate Democrats would actually diminish their influence and shoot themselves in both feet. They would be turning over to a President they don't like an excuse to staff the government with about 350 key appointees who are unconfirmed and unaccountable to the Now, this 350 number does not even include the Ambassadors in embassies all around the world, where there may be acting heads of the embassy.  Now, what difference would it make to have an administration mostly unexamined and unconfirmed by the Senate? Well, it would mean that the Senate would be giving the Executive more power at the expense of the legislative branch.  This undermines the checks and balances created by our Nation's Democrats complained that Republicans delayed some of President Obama's nominees, and that is true. In fact, that has always been true. My own nomination for U.Education Secretary in 1991 was delayed for 2 months by a Democratic Senator who put a hold on my nomination for unexplained reasons.  President Ford's nomination of Warren Rudman to the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1976 was blocked by Democratic New Hampshire Senator John  The rest of the story is that Rudman eventually asked President Ford to withdraw the nomination, ran against Durkin, and defeated him in the next election. That is how Warren Rudman got to be a U.There is a better way to resolve differences between Senators and the  In December of 2015, President Obama seemed content to allow John King of New York to serve as his Acting Secretary of Education for the last year of President Obama's term. I told the President I thought it was inappropriate for a President to have an acting Cabinet member for so long and that, while I disagreed with Mr.King on many points, I urged him to nominate King and, if he did, I promised that I would hold a prompt hearing and see to it that he was confirmed.  President Obama nominated John King on February 11, 2016. John King was confirmed by the U.Senate on March 14, 2016. I disagreed with Secretary King often, but the Secretary was confirmed. He was confirmed by and accountable to the U.Senate, as he should have been and as our Constitution envisions.  All of President Trump's Cabinet nominees are now confirmed, but this is how long it took compared with his three immediate predecessors: All of President Trump's nominations were announced before his inauguration, but the Senate confirmed only two of those nominations on day one because Senate Democrats would not agree to any more than that. A third Cabinet nominee was confirmed on January 31st. To compare, by January 31st in prior administrations, President Obama had 10 nominees confirmed, and George Bush and Bill Clinton each had 13 confirmed.  Please keep in mind that it is impossible for Democratic Senators by themselves to defeat a Trump nominee. Confirmation requires only a majority voting to be present; that is usually 51 There are 52 Republican Senators and, in addition, Vice President Pence can vote in the case of a tie. There is no 60-vote filibuster available to block nominees because Democrats, when they were in the majority in 2013, changed Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster on nominations. So by their obstruction, Democrats are only delaying the inevitable, using various tactics to require the Senate to use nearly a week of floor time to approve even noncontroversial nominees.  We don't know how Democrats will treat President Trump's more than 350 remaining key nominees because the President has made so few of those. For example, I am chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Aside from the Cabinet secretaries who come to our committee, of the 557 key positions identified by the Washington Post, 35 of them within the Cabinet agencies require recommendations to the full Senate by the HELP committee. In the Department of Health and Human Services, we have eight. In the Department of Education, we have 14. In the Department of Labor, we have 13.  At the end of the first 100 days, April 29th, our committee had received just one sub-Cabinet nomination from the Trump administration--that of Scott Gottlieb for FDA commissioner. He was promptly confirmed on May 9th.[[Page S3111]]  Compared with President Trump's one sub-Cabinet nomination sent to our committee in his first 100 days, President Obama made 13 sub-Cabinet nominations in his first 100 days, President George Bush made 10, and President Clinton made 14 to our committee.  There are actually nearly 700 more Presidential nominees requiring Senate confirmation who aren't considered key by the Washington Post analysis, so you can see this adds up to be a pretty big number of Presidential nominees whom we have a responsibility to consider and to confirm if we approve them.  Unfortunately, there are ominous signs about how Democrats will treat non-Cabinet nominees. As the Presiding Officer is especially aware, Democrats required the Senate to take nearly a week of floor time to consider the nomination of Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to serve as Ambassador to There was absolutely no excuse for this other than obstructionism.  Governor Branstad is the longest serving Governor in American history. He has a well-documented relationship with the Chinese He was one of the first appointees that the President announced. He was approved by a voice vote by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and ultimately approved by the full Senate earlier this week 82 to 13.  Yet, as a delaying tactic, Senate Democrats forced us to use nearly a week of our floor time to consider Governor If Democrats treat other noncontroversial Ambassadors and sub-Cabinet members the same way they treated Governor Branstad, requiring nearly a week of Senate floor time to consider a nominee, then I think President Trump would almost certainly bypass the Senate and name hundreds of acting heads of sub-Cabinet departments. Under our Constitution, he may do that whenever he chooses. There are flexible limits on the time one may serve in an acting position, but if that time expires, the President can simply appoint someone else.  Hopefully, President Trump will speed up his nomination of sub-Cabinet members, and hopefully Democrats will return to the common practice of routine floor approval of Presidential nominations when the confirmation process has determined that the nominee deserves to be approved.  Our Founders created a system of government based on checks and balances of the three coequal branches of government. There has been much complaining recently about the rise of the executive branch at the expense of the legislative branch. Having an executive branch and embassies mostly staffed by acting personnel not confirmed by or accountable to the U.Senate undermines the principle of three coequal branches of government.  The President should want his team in place and should speed up recommending key nominees to the U.And Senators, especially those in the minority, should want to have a say in the vetting and accountability that come with the Senate confirmation process.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3106-3.txt,1695,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,24.0,June

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century  Last week, President Trump laid out a plan to expand educational opportunities for American workers. President Trump's dedication to workforce development is admirable, and I am glad we have a President who has made this a priority.  As someone who has worked in the construction industry for my entire career, I know firsthand how difficult it can be to find skilled workers. In fact, I spoke at the Associated Builders and Contractors breakfast this morning, and they reported that there will be over 1 million job openings in the construction industry in the next few years.  I have met with many industries in my district. The workforce is aging. There aren't enough people who currently have the skills to take over, and it can take nearly 2 years for people to be fully trained for these positions.  First and foremost, it is our responsibility to make sure that young people today are equipped for the job market of tomorrow. Getting an education is essential, but it is equally important that our education efforts are aligned with the in-demand jobs in our communities.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

4142,topic-id,595,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support of Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals  This Saturday, July 1, marks 2 years since the tragic death of 32-year-old Kate Steinle, who was shot and killed by an illegal immigrant who had seven prior felony convictions and who had also been deported five times.                              {time}  1315  Kate's death is a clear reminder that we must do more to stop the abuse of our immigration laws by criminals who repeatedly flaunt the rule of law by illegally reentering the United  Kate's Law puts in place new guidelines for stiffer penalties for criminal aliens who continue to reenter the United States illegally. Kate's Law is desperately needed to protect the residents of the State of  Nicodemo Coria-Gonzalez--who had been deported five times to Mexico for crimes, including three DWIs--reentered the United States illegally and was charged with committing multiple sexual assaults and kidnapped a woman solely for the purpose of setting her on fire.  Current policy enables criminals to roam American streets--no matter[[Page H5313]]where they come from--with little fear of arrest and deportation. Kate's Law imposes stronger consequences and is an important step in restoring law and order. It will protect American lives.  Sadly, there are local and State officials in our great Nation who put the interests of criminal aliens before the safety of American citizens. These officials should take the time to meet with the families of the many victims of these criminal aliens, like I have. They will see the resulting tragedy of sanctuary city policies.  To rein in such States and localities, we need to pass the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which will impose consequences on State and local jurisdictions that ignore Federal immigration law by refusing to work with Federal immigration officials to remove criminal aliens from the United  In the first month of the Trump administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued over 3,000 detainers. These are orders for local authorities to keep criminal aliens in custody for 48 hours to enable ICE agents to come and get them for deportation. Remarkably, 206 of these detainers were declined by sanctuary city jurisdictions. In other words, local authorities deliberately ignored ICE's detainer request and released these dangerous individuals onto American streets.  These weren't just petty criminals, folks. Their crimes included homicide, rape, assault, domestic violence, indecent exposure to a minor, sex offenses against a minor, aggravated assault with a weapon, vehicle theft, kidnapping, driving under the influence, hit and run, and sexual assault.  Passing the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is common sense, as it cuts off certain Federal Department of Justice grants to these sanctuary cities. Our bill redirects these funds to States and localities that are cooperating with Federal immigration authorities and making America safer.  The message of this legislation is clear: American taxpayers are tired of footing the bill for States and localities that threaten their safety.  Criminal aliens with final deportation orders make up more than 50 percent of foreign-born inmates sitting in our prisons right now. Our streets will be made safer by deporting these criminal aliens, rather than letting them loose onto American streets.  Local law enforcement officials should work with Federal law enforcement agencies to keep criminals out of our country and off of these streets. This is why we must pass Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act to prevent other deaths like Kate Steinle's.  I am proud to support these two commonsense, law and order bills, and strongly urge my House colleagues to vote in favor of them today.

BASIS OF ESTIMATE       For this estimate, CBO assumes that 512 will be enacted      near the start of fiscal year 2018 and that amounts estimated      to be necessary will be provided at the start of each year.      Estimated outlays are based on historical spending patterns      for affected activities.     Advanced Nuclear Energy Licensing Cost-Share Grants       512 would authorize DOE to provide grants to developers      of advanced nuclear technologies to accelerate the      development, licensing, and commercial deployment of those      technologies. Such grants would be available for a range of      costs related to those efforts, including fees charged by the      NRC for licensing-related activities. Based on an analysis of      information from DOE, CBO estimates that spending for such      assistance under 512 would require appropriations totaling      $450 million over the 2018-2022 period. That estimate is in      line with the total amount of funding provided by the      Congress for a six-year effort, now largely completed, to      support the development, certification, and licensing of      small modular reactors (a type of advanced nuclear      technology). Assuming appropriation of those amounts, CBO      estimates that outlays would total $340 million over the      2018-2022 period and $110 million after 2022.     Accelerated NRC Activities       Funding for the NRC--which totals approximately $1 billion      in 2017--is provided in annual appropriation acts. Under      current law, the agency is required to recover most of its      funding through fees charged to licensees and applicants; CBO      estimates that such fees, which are classified as      discretionary offsetting collections, will total nearly $900      million this year.       512 would require the NRC to establish a regulatory      framework for licensing advanced nuclear reactors, defined in      the bill as reactors that involve significant technological      improvements relative to those currently being constructed.      The bill specifies that any funding provided to the NRC for      activities related to developing that framework would be      excluded from the portion of the agency's budget that is      offset by fees the NRC collects. Based on an analysis of      information from the NRC about the anticipated costs of      establishing the proposed licensing regime within the      timeframe specified by the bill, CBO estimates that      implementing 512 would cost $46 million over the 2018-2022      period, mostly for salaries and expenses for technical      experts required to develop the necessary analyses and      regulations.       In addition, starting in 2020, the bill would modify the      existing formula used to determine the amount of NRC fees.      CBO expects that the proposed modifications to the formula      used to set regulatory fees charged by the NRC could change      the amount of such fees collected in future years. Under both      current law and 512, the amount of such fees would depend      on the level of funding provided for a range of specific NRC      activities. Because CBO has no basis for predicting how much      funding will be provided for such activities in future years,      CBO cannot determine whether the resulting fees would be      higher or lower under 512 than under current law.                      PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS       512 would amend exiting law regarding the disposition of      uranium materials managed by Under the bill, DOE would      be required to develop plans for marketing those materials      and to comply with annual limits on the volume of uranium      materials placed into commercial markets. Specifically, the      bill would cap sales and transfers at 2,100 metric tons per      year through 2025 and at 2,700 metric tons starting in 2026.      The bill also would expressly authorize DOE to market      materials derived from depleted uranium, which is one of the      by-products of the uranium enrichment process.       According to DOE, uranium sales and transfers averaged      about 2,450 metric tons a year over the 2012-2015 period, but      fell to 2,100 metric tons in 2016. Using information from      studies done for the department on uranium markets, CBO      estimates that the quantity of uranium that will be disposed      over the 2018-2027 period under current law probably will      remain below 2,100 metric tons a year. Thus, CBO estimates      that the caps on sales and transfers of uranium materials in      512 would have no significant effect on offsetting      receipts from those activities over the 2018-2027 period.      (Under current law, CBO estimates that the sales of those      materials will total about $800 million over the 2018-2027      period; however, CBO expects that only a portion of that      value, or $80 million, will be deposited in the Treasury as      offsetting receipts because of uncertainty surrounding DOE's      budgetary treatment of these transactions.)           INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DIRECT SPENDING AND DEFICITS       CBO estimates that enacting 512 would not increase net      direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four      consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.               INTERGOVERMENTAL AND PRIVATE-SECTOR IMPACT       512 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on      state, local, or tribal governments.                         PREVIOUS CBO ESTIMATE       On June 12, 2017, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for      97, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act of 2017,      as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and      Natural Resources on March 30, 2017. Both bills contain      provisions that would authorize DOE to provide cost-share      grants to support the expedited development, licensing, and      commercial deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.      Because those provisions are substantively the same and the      estimated costs of implementing those provisions are the same      in both bills. The estimated increase in spending subject to      appropriation under 512 is greater than under 97      because the estimate for 512 includes additional costs for      the NRC to meet new requirements specified by that bill.

Disaster can strike at any time, often with little warning. It is never too early to prepare. Know your evacuation routes and have a supply kit ready. Also important, ensure your home is structurally sound to withstand intense winds and rain.  Taking steps now to reinforce a roof covering or protect an exterior window could mean the difference between saving money in the long run and dealing with major property damage.  That is why I am introducing the SHELTER Act, to provide tax credits to encourage people to stormproof their homes and properties.

The Federal Government does have an important enforcement role, and I am disappointed that the bill weakens the Department of Education's ability to hold States accountable for improving low-quality CTE programs.

This legislation is important because it recognizes that we need an education system that best prepares our kids for the future--a future in business--as soon as they hit K-12, and they should be ready to enter the job market or move on to additional training. Traditional 4-year colleges and universities cannot be the only pathway for the next generation of students.  In Virginia, there were nearly 110,000 postsecondary students enrolled in CTE courses in the 2014 year. Programs I am privileged to represent in Virginia's Seventh Congressional District include Amelia Nottoway Technical Center, the Chesterfield Governor's Career and Technical Academy, and Chesterfield County Public Schools Governor's Health Sciences  While these innovative programs in my district have excelled, technical skills and on-the-job training must be ingrained in the thinking of our entire K-12 educational system, across the curriculum, in every class.

4227,topic-id,1055,"Mr.President, our law enforcement officers and the families who support them give so much in service to our communities. As we were tragically reminded again last week--and this happens in far too many places, in far too many States--some make the ultimate sacrifice to keep us safe.  Last Friday in Kirkersville, OH, Police Chief Steve DiSario responded to a report of a man with a gun at a nursing home. Chief DiSario did what so many first responders do when most of us in the public run away from danger: He ran toward it. He arrived at the Pine Kirk Care Center to protect his community and was killed in the line of duty by a gunman who also took the lives of two nursing home employees. Chief DiSario was 36. He had six children and a seventh on the way.  Our thoughts and our prayers are with Chief DiSario's family and the families of all of our first responders, who worry each day that their loved ones may not return home. Think about that. For soldiers, marines, sailors, police officers, and firefighters, so often when they kiss their spouse goodbye and go to work, there is always the anxiety at home. It is not just the sacrifice that our soldiers and our military personnel and our police officers make; it is the sacrifice their families make too.  Sadly, Police Chief DiSario wasn't the only Ohio officer to lay down his life this year. In January, Officer David Fahey of the Cleveland Police Department was working the scene of an accident on I-90 and was struck and killed in a despicable act of hit-and-run.  This week in Washington, we honor the five Ohio officers killed in the line of duty last year. Aaron Christian of the Chesapeake Police Department was killed in a car accident while on patrol. While conducting traffic, Trooper Kenneth Velez of Elyria was killed by a driver under the influence of drugs. Officer Sean Johnson was the first officer to be killed in the line of duty in the town of Hilliard when he succumbed to injuries from a motorcycle accident during a training exercise. Officer Steven Smith was shot and killed during a SWAT standoff in Officer Thomas Cottrell, Jr., of Danville was killed in a heinous and cowardly ambush. Each of these losses is a tragedy for a family, for a community, and for fellow police officers.  As we honor the work and sacrifices made by law enforcement throughout Police Week, we need to offer more than kind words; we need action to support law enforcement as they work to keep our communities safe.  Yesterday, I was talking to Police Chief Richard Biehl of Dayton and Youngstown Police Chief Robert Lees about what more we should do to support officers and their families. This week, we have unanimously passed several pieces of bipartisan legislation that will provide new support to the officers who protect us and the families who sacrifice alongside them.  The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act, which Senator Grassley introduced, will put pressure on the Bureau of Justice Assistance at the DOJ to speed up claims processing so families of disabled officers or fallen officers get their benefits more quickly.  We passed the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act, introduced by Indiana Senators Donnelly and Young, to help law enforcement agencies establish or enhance mental health services, like peer monitoring pilot programs and crisis hotlines, for their officers. I learned about this bill from my friend Jay McDonald from Marion, OH, whose advocacy for police officers and their families makes a huge difference for Ohio's law enforcement communities. He has been the president of the Ohio Fraternal Order of Police for some time.  We approved Senator Cornyn's American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017, which would allow local police departments to use Federal grant money to hire veterans as law enforcement officers. It is a bipartisan, commonsense idea that would open new doors for those who served our communities and our Nation in the military and who have accrued and developed skills that will serve well their communities in police work.  We have a solemn obligation to the children of fallen officers whose lives are forever changed because of the heroism of their mother or father. The bipartisan Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act--which I have introduced with Senators Casey and Donnelly, two Democrats, as well as two Republican Senators, Toomey and Collins--would increase access to Pell grants for the surviving children of law enforcement who lay down their lives for their communities. It would ensure that all children of fallen officers are eligible for the maximum Federal Pell grant. Of course, we can't repay the debt we owe these families, but we can ease the burden on their children as they prepare for their future.  We need to do everything we can to ensure that officers and family members get the benefits and help they deserve. We also need to do more to give officers the tools they need to protect themselves. This week, I joined a group of Senators calling for full funding of the Bulletproof Vest  I have written to the Department of Justice thanking them for their work so far and urging them to speed up distributing funding we passed as part of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery The bipartisan bill created the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program to provide funding to police departments to train first responders as they deal with opioid-related incidents.[[Page S3038]]  More and more officers are being exposed to fentanyl out in the field. Just this week in Eastern Ohio, an officer in East Liverpool was the victim of an accidental fentanyl overdose. He survived, but the situation was perilous. We need to make sure officers have the equipment they need to handle this deadly opioid look-alike--only more toxic--safely.  Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line each day to protect us. This Police Week, we owe them more than gratitude; we must show support to the selfless men and women who serve our communities and country every single day, and we must support their actions, their lives, and their families.

4244,topic-id,2193,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 440 provides for a complete consideration of H.2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. The rule allows for consideration of 122 amendments in addition to the amendments made in order by yesterday's rule.  This brings the total number of amendments made in order for full consideration to 210. When you add in the 275 amendments offered during the Armed Services Committee markup, we will, in total, have considered 485 amendments to this year's  Just as important, there is a clear bipartisan split between the number of majority and the number of minority amendments made in order.  Mr.Speaker, this has been an incredibly open process that allowed Members of this body from both sides to have their input on this critical national security legislation.  Like other years, the NDAA is a great example of the House working through regular order in the authorizing process and getting the job done.  Thanks to this rule and the one we passed yesterday, the House will debate a number of issues where Members of this body have diverse views. From the future of GTMO to the future of the New START, the two NDAA rules provide for a robust debate on many important topics. That is a good thing, and I look forward to the debate.[[Page H5775]]  Before I continue, I want to briefly thank the staff in both the Armed Services Committee and the Rules Committee for their hard work on this rule. Dealing with this large number of amendments takes a considerable amount of time, and I know I speak for the entire body, both the majority and minority, in expressing our gratitude for their time and work in helping the members of the Rules Committee come to this product.  Yesterday, I outlined my strong support for this year's NDAA, which will help keep the American people safe and secure, so I won't rehash all those points. But I want to share some numbers that highlight the readiness crisis facing our military. This crisis has been caused by cuts to defense spending. This bill authorizes funding for the military at $688.3 billion, which is 16.8 percent of total Federal outlays and 3.4 percent of projected gross domestic product.  As a guiding point, 30 years ago, the fiscal year 1988 NDAA represented 27.3 percent of total Federal outlays. This year, 16 percent; back then, 27 percent. And 5.2 percent of projected This year, 3.4 percent; back then, 5.2 percent.  We are spending less proportionately today on our military, despite the fact that we face a wider range of threats across the globe. That should be troubling to every  Let's think about the threat environment we faced 30 years ago: the Soviet That was about it. There was no ISIS or al-Qaida or other radical Islamic terrorist organizations threatening the United States 30 years ago. Iran was not an existential threat to the American people 30 years ago. North Korea wasn't developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles 30 years ago. China was not on the radar as it relates to a military power 30 years ago. We weren't worried about cyber attacks or cyber espionage 30 years ago.  It is safe to say the world was a lot different 30 years ago, yet we were devoting a greater portion of our Federal budget to the military. We must make that same or an even greater commitment today. For too long, we, in Congress, have allowed our military to steadily atrophy, bringing us to a readiness crisis. Providing for our national defense is the most important job of this Congress, and this bill helps rebuild, repair, and reform our military.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 440 and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, last night, the majority on the House Rules Committee once again decided to exclude from debate 230 amendments to H.2810, the National Defense Authorization That means that half of the amendments submitted were rejected.  I can never understand why these amendments are denied the chance to be debated by the full When I first came to Capitol Hill as an aide to our former friend and colleague, Congressman Joe Moakley, the Defense Authorization bill would often take up to a week for debate. But even back then, it was one of the largest and most complex bills debated, and certainly one of the most important from a national security point of view.  The NDAA rule was also structured back then, but more in terms of the amount of time permitted for debate. And many amendments receive 1 hour, half an hour, 20 minutes, even 2 hours of debate. Why? Because they were about the important decisions and priorities facing our national defense policy at the time.  But that is not the case today. Amendments are lucky to get 10 minutes of debate equally divided if they are lucky enough to be debated at all. And the Defense bill takes up a total of maybe 2 days' worth of debate, if that. No wonder, no wonder Members are frustrated by this process.  This year, like every year for the past several years, important issues, especially on war and peace, were left on the chopping block by the  They decided that the House should not debate two bipartisan amendments that would make sure that nothing in the NDAA could be construed as authorization to use force against the governments of North Korea or  The Republican majority decided it is okay to debate a bigoted amendment that prohibits medical treatment for transgender servicemembers who are in transition, but they will not let the House debate an amendment that just calls for a study, Mr.Speaker, on blood donations from gay men.                              {time}  1245  Mr.Speaker, did you know that there is a provision in the NDAA that sets up an entire new military service branch, the Space Corps? The Pentagon doesn't want it; the Air Force doesn't want it; they say it is premature, but an amendment by Mr.Turner, a Republican, to require the Pentagon to report on the need to establish a Space Corps is not included in this rule. I guess the Republican leadership doesn't want the House to have a say and a debate on such a major change.  Mr.Amash led a bipartisan amendment to block the sale of cluster munitions to Saudi Last year, this amendment failed by just a handful of votes. I guess that is why the Republicans on the Rules Committee aren't about to let it come up for a debate and a vote this year.  When it comes to sending our uniformed women and men into war, into danger, where their very lives are at risk, the Rules Committee decided that such amendments were not worth the House's time to debate.  Last night, Republicans on the Rules Committee denied the opportunity for debate on a bipartisan amendment offered by myself and Representatives Walter Jones, Barbara Lee, Tom Massie, John Garamendi, Dan Kildee, and Peter  The amendment is very straightforward. If the President decides to increase the level of U.troops deployed in Afghanistan in fiscal year 2018, then he would report to Congress on the purpose and mission of those troops, how many were required, and how long they would be there, and then Congress would vote to approve or disapprove that escalation.  This would give the American people the voice they deserve when it comes to sending our men and women in uniform into battle.  Mr.Speaker, the President and General Mattis just decided to send an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban, on top of the 8,400 U.troops already there. That will bring the total number of American troops there to more than 12,000.  Now, if they should decide that they want even more troops in Afghanistan in fiscal year 2018, Congress should know why, and vote on it.  We can't keep giving the administration a blank check and allow America once again to go down the slippery slope of incremental escalation over the next year or two. Congress needs to step up to the plate and either approve or disapprove any renewed escalation in Isn't that amendment worth debating?  We are in year 16 of the war in It is the longest war in American history. Let me repeat that, Mr.Afghanistan is the longest war in U.history. The costs are already in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and the human cost to our troops, our veterans, and their families have been enormous, yet Congress has not taken a single vote, has not taken a single stand on this war for 16 years. Most of the Members of this House weren't even here when that one and only vote was taken.  So in the absence of debating an updated AUMF for Afghanistan, the very least we can do is debate whether we will once again escalate our military footprint in Afghanistan, but the Republican leadership of this House doesn't agree.  Each year, the Republican leadership does everything it can to stop any debate on these wars, and this year is no different. They will allow some amendments on reports and a sense of Congress here and there, but any amendment of substance that requires Congress to act is denied.  Mr.Speaker, I want to advise my colleagues of one thing, and that is, we are not an advisory commission. We are a legislative body. We need to start doing our job.[[Page H5776]]  Mr.Speaker, I have no problem with a report, but it won't be the first time we have seen a report, whether on Afghanistan or Iraq or Even the underlying bill calls for a strategy report on Afghanistan and other conflicts, but Congress avoiding taking any responsibility for continuing to send our servicemen and -women into harm's way is absolutely shameful. Mr.Speaker, it is cowardice.  Every day, military families say good-bye to their loved ones as they go into battle, placing themselves in harm's way to keep our country safe, and Congress does nothing. All we do is kick the can down the road and call for another report and then another report.  Mr.Speaker, we don't even act when the President actually does send us an AUMF, the way President Obama did on Iraq and Syria and the war against We did nothing. We said we didn't like it, but we did nothing. The Republican leadership complained that they didn't like it, but then they never even tried to act on it or to write their own They would rather just stand on the sidelines, complain and criticize, but do nothing, absolutely nothing, except stop other Members from taking any action that might require the House to debate these wars. Shame on all of us for allowing this to continue over and over and over and over again.  Now, I am guessing that whenever the House takes up the Defense appropriations bill, the Republican leaders will find a way to make sure that the bipartisan-supported provision in that bill to sunset the 2001 AUMF on Afghanistan and vote on a new one within 8 months will somehow disappear without a single Member of the House at large having a chance to vote on it. Maybe we will get another report. And so it goes on and on.  Mr.Speaker, there is nearly $700 billion authorized in this bill for wars, for weapons systems, for military equipment, and for personnel, all because Congress refuses to make hard choices. We can never seem to find the money to take care of our own neighborhoods and schools. We can't find the money to provide our citizens with better, more affordable healthcare, or make sure that all our families can put food on the table. We don't invest nearly enough in our roads and our bridges, railways and transit systems. There is never enough money to invest in a 21st century manufacturing base, provide training to support the jobs of the future, or raise the Federal minimum wage to a livable wage. We are told we don't have the money to take care of our parks or to make sure that our air and water are drinkable and breathable. We can't even seem to find the money to take care of our senior citizens and our children, but when it comes to spending on war or building more nuclear weapons, then magically we find trillions of dollars to operate and spend.  We need to pay more attention, Mr.Speaker, to the choices we make each year on how much spending our Nation really requires for its national defense. I believe, at a minimum, Mr.Speaker, that Congress needs to debate and vote on whether to keep sending more and more of our military men and women to fight in endless wars.  And I have to say, Mr.Speaker, to my colleagues, what the Rules Committee did last night by shutting out debate was shameful.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgH5774-3.txt,2197,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,13.0,July
4006,topic-id,1403,"Madam President, I thank my colleague from Maryland for articulating the issues in this discussion draft that has been released this morning.  As I hear him talk about these complex kids, how the cap is going to work, and when people are going to be affected, it reminds me of the book, ``The Smartest Guys in the Room.'' Right? Basically, people cook up schemes they think other people can't understand or the broader public will not catch on to in the hopes they can pass something. That is exactly what is going on here, a hoax and a scheme that is not cost-effective for the American taxpayer and will literally cut people off of access to healthcare, and literally, if the House bill was mean, this is doubling down on mean.  So I thank my colleague from Maryland for articulating the complex kids issue because these are concepts. If this is a discussion draft, I would hope my colleagues would come to the floor and discuss it--discuss the concepts that are in this bill and debate them, but that is not what is happening. In fact, we know very little detail at this point in time because people are assessing the information and trying to read and assess in between the lines.  I can state what I know and have gleaned so far by the accounts, and that this is a continuation on the war on I say that because with regard to this war on Medicaid, we didn't know where the Senate would go in their proposal. We know what the House decided to do. The premise and structure of the House bill is to cut Medicaid by capping it and continually driving down the amount of Federal obligation to this program.  I will tell you, it is not even a smart idea. If you want to reform and deliver[[Page S3707]]better healthcare at a lower cost, there are many ways to do that and save dollars and give better patient care, but that is not what the House proposal is. It was a budget mechanism. I am not just saying that. I am talking to my healthcare providers at home, I am talking to university professors, people who know and understand healthcare and have studied it for a long time. What the House did and now the Senate is doubling down on is nothing but a budget mechanism to cut people off of healthcare--as my colleague said, the most vulnerable of our population.  It is a wrong-headed idea. It is not going to help us control costs. Medicaid reduces bankruptcy rates, helps people stay employed, and boosts our Why would we want a draconian idea like cutting Medicaid as the centerpiece of a budget proposal by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle? As people have said, because they want to take that revenue and give it away in tax breaks for the wealthy. I guarantee you that is not what we should be doing.  The access to Medicaid is so important. Our veterans access the healthcare system through Many of them receive care through the VA, but also they receive services through Veterans would be impacted and would lose care. Our children who are seen at hospitals, such as the Children's Hospital in Seattle, are Medicaid populations, and they would not have the resources to get access to care. Our institutions that are covering individuals at Medicaid rates would take a hit.  All the Senate proposal does is basically move that cap, but it is a steeper cap at a point in time that makes and exacerbates this problem of cutting people off of access to care. So if the House bill is mean, this is just doubling down on mean.  There is nothing about destructing this safety net that is so important to Americans that goes hand-in-hand with the philosophy about how to drive down costs to healthcare. If you think about it, if we came out here and had a discussion with 100 U.Senators and said a great way to drive down the cost of healthcare would be to cut people off of healthcare, most people would say that is not a smart idea because when people are cut off of healthcare, we know that uncompensated care exacerbates healthcare needs, challenges other parts of our system, and delivering care to them makes it more expensive. When we have had discussions and roundtables about the proposal that the House had put out, providers in my State told me point-blank, covering the Medicaid population has helped drive down and control the rate of insurance in the private markets. By saying we are going to cut Medicaid at a more drastic rate, we are going to just send a signal to the market that rates for the private insurers should go up.  I don't think that is what my constituents want. They want us to innovate. They want us to drive quality care and managed care into parts of the United States where it doesn't exist. They want us to take care of our most vulnerable population, and they want to make sure we are not delivering that off people who are going into the emergency room 50 times in a year because they don't have insurance.  We know the Medicaid rate is critically important. Medicaid costs up to one-quarter less than private insurance. It is a way to deliver care. We know measures we put into the Affordable Care Act, such as moving people off of nursing home care to community-based care, has saved Medicaid dollars. More States should do it.  We know plans such as bundling up the individual market into larger programs so they can have clout like others who work for a larger employer has also driven down costs. So those are the things we should be accelerating, not this notion that we move forward as a country by cutting the most vulnerable off of healthcare.  I ask my colleagues to come out and discuss this concept, discuss this idea, how it will affect the healthcare providers in their I plan to do that with my I hope they will come out here and tell us why it is a smart strategy to cut people off from I know no State that has the money to make up for the Federal share of Medicaid that is going to be doubled down in this bill.  I do not want to see a war on What I want to see is innovation. What I want to see is that covering people with some level of insurance basically helps save everybody on their insurance bills as well. I hope my colleagues will take this discussion draft and be proud to come out here and discuss it, but we have heard very little of that thus far.  Let's look at the real numbers, and I guarantee that we will hear from Governors, we will hear from States, we will hear from providers, we will hear from businesses, and we will hear from people who do not think this is a good idea.  Already there are comments from the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging: ``This strategy will also put . . . Medicaid [and] states [and consumers] on a fiscally precarious path.''  We have heard from other people that the Medicaid cap is up to twice as bad for States, will cause problems, and also from children's healthcare groups: ``Converting Medicaid into a per capita cap . . . would dismantle critical protections . . . to care for all enrollees.''  These aren't just partisan comments. These are the facts. What my colleagues don't realize is that by taking a huge chunk out of Medicaid, you are taking a huge chunk out of the safety net so many Americans depend on. It will not help us lower costs. It will exacerbate an escalation of rates for everyone in the market.  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sasse).

4005,topic-id,2807,"Madam President, first I want to thank Senator Markey for his comments. I share his concerns. I agree with what he has said about the risk factors of the bill that was announced this morning by the Republican leader and what it could do to millions of people around this country and what it will do to coverage for hundreds of thousands of people in my State of Maryland who will lose coverage and just about every Marylander whose healthcare will be impacted if this bill were to become law.  I want to start by saying that I think this is a shameful moment for the Senate--the Senate, whose traditions have made it be known as the most deliberative body in the world; the Senate, which has been known as a body that[[Page S3705]]allows for robust debate and benefits from the views of all 100 Members, where each of us has opportunities to get our voices heard. That tradition has been badly damaged by what the majority leader has done in bringing a bill that affects one-sixth of the economy of our country to the floor of the Senate without the deliberation by our committees and without transparency to the American people.  When I got to the Senate, I worked hard to get on the Senate Finance I did that because the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee contains areas that I have devoted a good part of my public career to, including issues of taxation and issues concerning social programs in our But it also included healthcare, an area that I worked on when I was first in the Maryland State legislature. I wanted to be on the committee that had a role in developing the health policy of this I thought I could add to that debate with my experience, and I wanted to make sure that the people of Maryland had a voice as we developed healthcare policy in  That role is being denied by what the Republican leader is doing in bringing this bill to the floor without the benefit of hearings. Let me just repeat that. There has not been one hearing held on the legislation being brought forward by the majority leader. There hasn't been one committee markup of the bill.  Now, let me explain to the general public what a markup is. It is when the committees that have expertise on a bill--in this case, it would be the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Senate Finance Committee--have had a chance to bring the public in to get their views on the legislation, have had the committee staff go through it and explain all of the aspects to the members of the committee, with an opportunity for us to offer amendments to improve the bill, and then, ultimately, taking a vote on the recommendation to the full That is the regular order, but it is particularly the regular order on complex pieces of legislation.  I don't think there is a Member of this body who would say that this is not a complex field when we are dealing with healthcare--one-sixth of our economy. But the process that was used denied the people of Maryland and the people of this Nation the opportunity to have their voices heard through their elected representatives. It is a shameful moment.  Now, I know this has been done before on the floor, but I will just repeat it one more time. Compare this to how the Affordable Care Act was passed by the We had transparency, opportunities for the public to have input. We had hearings--many, many hearings that took place. My staff tells me there were 50 hearings or roundtable discussions or walk-throughs. We had 26 consecutive days of Senate debate. There were hundreds of amendments offered by both Democrats and Republicans that were adopted on the bill before the bill reached the floor of the That all took place before we started the debate on the bill.  You cannot justify this process. This is an abuse by the majority, and it will affect the functioning of the  There are concerns about what this bill will do. The process is terrible. The impact on the Senate is terrible. But the real tragedy here is the impact, if this bill were to become law, it would have on healthcare in  So let me talk a little bit about my State of It has been projected under this bill that those who will not have insurance coverage will go back basically to what it was prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act; that is, a little over 400,000 Marylanders are at risk of losing basic health coverage. Now, it is going to affect everyone with insurance in Maryland, and I will get to that in a moment. But as many as 400,000 people are in jeopardy of losing their insurance because of what is done with regard to the alliances and the Medicaid Program itself. Many more will lose quality coverage.  Senator Markey talked about preexisting conditions. You claim that there is protection for preexisting conditions, but it does not guarantee that the services will be provided because the States are given tremendous discretion as to what would be required as essential benefits within the healthcare plans. So if someone has a mental illness or someone has a drug addiction, is there a guaranteed coverage that that person would be able to get services? If that person has a preexisting condition, it may very well not be covered because of the absence of essential health benefits.  Let me just give you another example of what could happen under this bill, and this is a real example on gender discrimination. Obstetrics coverage is critical for a childbearing woman. Now, if that becomes an optional coverage because of the State plans and discretion that it is given, obviously only those women who are planning to have children will take that coverage. Why would someone who doesn't need that coverage take the coverage? What are the consequences of allowing that type of choice? It is very clear.  Younger women are going to pay a lot more for their health insurance than they otherwise would. Is that fair? I think not. I think not. That is the consequence of the type of changes that are being made in the Affordable Care  I was very instrumental in making sure that we had full coverage for pediatric dental. Why? Well, unfortunately, in my State in 2007--the year I first started in the Senate--we had a youngster, Deamonte Driver, who lived not far from here, who died because of an untreated tooth decay. It became abscessed and went into his brain. He had to go through a couple of surgeries, and he lost his life. What was needed was $80 of dental care. He couldn't get access to it because there was no coverage for it. He had no access to that care. He lost his life and, of course, the healthcare system had to pay a lot of money when it only needed to spend $80 to keep him healthy.  Well, we took care of that and fixed that with the essential benefits now, including pediatric dental. Is that protected under the Republican bill? The answer is unclear--probably not. It is up to the It may be different in one State versus another. We don't have the protection.  Then we get to the affordability issue for Marylanders to be able to afford to have health insurance. Under this bill, there will be discrimination on those that are older. They are going to have to pay more for their health insurance. Is that right? No, it is not right. I heard the majority leader this morning give examples of how the Affordable Care Act is in danger, and he cited high premium increases. One of the States he quoted was the State of Maryland, and it was very misleading the way he did that. He was talking about the individual marketplace, and he was talking about one segment of that. What he didn't tell you is that CareFirst, the insurance company that is proposing that rate increase, indicated that at least half of that increase is the result of action taken by the Trump administration, because the Trump administration has not made it clear whether they will fund the cost-sharing provisions, which keep the costs down and affordable in the individual marketplace. That is a self-inflicted increase in premiums by the Trump administration.  There is a second issue that CareFirst mentioned, and that is the President's insistence on not enforcing the individual mandate, and, by the way, that is in the Republican bill. It means that younger, healthier people will choose not to have health insurance. Now, if they happen to ride a motorcycle and wrap themselves around a tree and get flown to the Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore and we are going to treat him, guess who is going to pay the bill? All of us are going to pay the bill through uncompensated care. It is going to raise my insurance policy and everybody's insurance policy. That person should have had insurance, but that person thought he or she didn't need that insurance. So they didn't take out the policy.  You find that those who will take out the insurance policies are the higher risks because they know they need the insurance. So those with high-risk issues will be in the pool raising the costs and that is why CareFirst has a higher ask, because they know it is less likely that healthier people will be in the pool than projected under the original Affordable Care Why? Because of President  So when the leader says that the Affordable Care Act is falling apart, the[[Page S3706]]Affordable Care Act is strong, but it has been made vulnerable by the actions of the Trump administration, and the provisions in this bill will make it even weaker.  Now, 1.2 million Marylanders are in our Maryland Medical Assistance Program, or Medicaid Many of these people are working families. Many of these people are our seniors who need long-term care and are in the Medicaid Program because it pays for their long-term care expenses. Many of these people are veterans or returning warriors who are under the Medicaid  Under the Republican-released bill, they may make it a gentler slope before we get to the full impact of the Medicaid reductions, but the Medicaid reductions, if I understand correctly, are even more severe than under the House-passed bill.  Now, I could speak for I know our legislature. Our legislature is going to try to do what is right, but they have limited resources in order to try to meet the needs that are out there. It is just not right to say that we are passing these problems on to the States when the States don't have the fiscal capacity to deal with them. Who gets hurt? The 1.2 million Marylanders who rely upon the Medicaid Program and all Marylanders who don't want to see what we call cost shifting, when someone who doesn't have health insurance ends up in our emergency room and doesn't pay the bill and everyone else pays those bills.  So why are we doing this? What is the reason we have gone through this pain? I have heard my colleagues talk about it, and it is absolutely true. The Republicans need to make room for the tax cut. They are pretty clear about it. Close to $1 trillion in tax cuts is what they need to do. Who benefits from tax cuts? The wealthy, those who have access to healthcare. Who pays for the tax cuts? Those who are the most vulnerable in our community. That is just wrong.  My staff has put together a lot of individual letters that have been sent to us. I don't even need to go through them. I can tell the Presiding Officer just the experiences I have had walking on the streets to Baltimore or, quite frankly, walking anywhere, including here in  When people come up to me and say: Senator Cardin, keep up the fight. Do you know what is going to happen if that healthcare bill becomes law? We have done some tests and we have certain genes, we are in a high-risk pool for cancer. We are not going to be able to get coverage if you let insurance companies go back to the practices they had before the passage of the Affordable Care  People say that if they didn't have the insurance they now think they are going to lose, they would have to go through personal bankruptcy. That is not a hypothetical. Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, unpaid medical bills was the leading cause of bankruptcy. Are we going to go back to those days?  I talked to a parent who has a child with a disability--and to think what the cost of that child is going to be in the healthcare system. They don't possibly have the means to be able to afford that if they didn't have access to healthcare coverage without discrimination. You leave these discretions to how the insurance companies will respond with their businesses, they are going to figure out a way so a family who has a disabled child will not have adequate coverage. That is what is at risk. Senator Markey is right--healthcare should be a right, not a privilege, and we are moving in the wrong direction.  In Maryland, we have hospitals that are located throughout our State to meet the needs of the people of We have hospitals that are located in areas where they have a lot of elderly and a lot of poor people, but because of the way we deal with our hospital reimbursements, we don't have cost shifting. We can have what is known as an all-payer rate, where whoever goes into the hospital, they pay the same rate so a hospital can locate in an inner city or poorer neighborhood. If you increase the cost sharing for people who don't have insurance, hospital facilities will not locate in those communities, adding to the costs of everyone's healthcare.  One of the great benefits, one of the great achievements of the Affordable Care Act, is that we now have facilities that are more conveniently located to people in this country, whether they live in a rural area or urban setting. Some are healthcare centers and some are health clinics, but they are more conveniently located because more people have third-party coverage and have insurance in order to pay those bills.  So I read with interest that certain segments of the advocacy community are going to be given certain concessions in this bill, and they think they are going to be One is, I understand--and I am not sure what this term means, and maybe someone can explain it to me--medically complex children. These are children, I assume, who have special needs.  If I understand the bill correctly, there is going to be a carve-out in the Medicaid system so that these complex cases will be, at least for a period of time, reimbursed. Where are they going to get care?  Right now they are getting care, in many cases, in a school-based health clinic that is going to be closed under the Republican bill that is out here because it is not qualified to receive reimbursement. The expansion of our qualified health centers under the Affordable Care Act is going to be in deep jeopardy. I met with the CEOs of our qualified health centers where we have expanded to deal with pediatric care, dental care, and mental health. That is in jeopardy of being contracted if you don't have the reimbursements from the people who live in that community that we have under the Medicaid expansion. That is in jeopardy. So don't believe you are protecting any vulnerable population when you don't provide the structure in which you can have reasonable reimbursements so that doctors, hospitals, and clinics can locate in communities and be treated fairly under our reimbursement structure.  I am deeply disappointed. I am deeply disappointed with what we have done to this great institution on this, such an important subject. I am deeply concerned, about the impact this is going to have on the people of Maryland and our Nation, and I will join my colleagues in doing everything I possibly can, during the limited opportunities we have only on the floor of the Senate, not in our committees--to do everything I can to protect the interests of the people of Maryland and our Nation so healthcare can be a right and not a privilege.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgS3698-3.txt,,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,22.0,June

4012,topic-id,1617,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss, for just a couple of minutes this afternoon, the issue of healthcare and, in particular, the legislation that was unveiled today, what is referred to as a ``discussion draft.'' It is legislative text, but it is not the final word on this issue. So we have to begin in earnest to engage in debate because we are going to be very limited in the time that we have.  I think the best way to describe this legislation can be very simple, actually, in terms of the impact on a lot of Unfortunately, I don't think this is really an effort to improve the healthcare system. I think it is a scheme. It is a scheme that sells out the middle class. It hurts seniors and children and devastates the protections and healthcare for individuals with disabilities over time, and all of that is done to finance tax breaks for the very rich. There are other ways, of course, to describe it, but I will focus mostly on  As it relates to Medicaid, this isn't a repeal and replace, or repeal and improve, or repeal and reform. This is repeal and decimate when it comes to The cuts may be stretched out, but they are, in fact, deeper over time.  So if you are one of the 1.1 million children in Pennsylvania who receives Medicaid or one of over 720,000 Pennsylvanians with a disability who benefits from Medicaid, your healthcare could be at risk. My test would be that if any of those individuals lose their Medicaid benefits, it is a bad bill. I would hope that would be the test for every Member of the  The other adverse consequence of this legislation is that it will cripple efforts to battle the opioid addiction in our country. We just had a great consensus at the end of last year where both parties came together on two pieces of legislation--one that dealt directly with the opioid epidemic, the so-called CARA bill, or the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Then later in the year, there was another bill that provided some additional funding. All of that would be compromised, undermined, or degraded, at least, if this legislation went through because the biggest payer--certainly, in the top two, in terms of our paying for opioid treatment and services--is, of course, the Medicaid  So what we have here before us is a bill that is a tax giveaway to the wealthiest. The top one-tenth of 1 percent would receive thousands and thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars. One estimate of the earlier version of the House bill said, if you were in the top one-tenth of 1 percent, you would get $197,000 each. Those people don't need $197,000 from a tax break from a so-called healthcare bill. They would, I think, expect that we would take care of the people that need healthcare: Vulnerable children. Some 40 percent of the children in America get Almost half the births in the country are paid for by People with disabilities are disproportionately dependent upon Medicaid, and they should have a right to expect--and their families should have a right to expect--that, if you have a disability, you should get Medicaid today, tomorrow, years from now, decades from now, and as long as you need it. You should have that guarantee. This bill takes away that guarantee for those families with a loved one with a disability.  One of the many stories that we get from back home are from parents. Many of them are writing because their child has a disability or multiple disabilities, and they are dependent upon Here is just one:       My son, Anthony, was born at 25 weeks and he weighed one      tiny pound. We were overcome with medical bills which      Medicaid thankfully paid for us. Since his birth he has had      multiple health crisis, seizures, sleep disorders just to      name a few.       Most recently, Anthony was diagnosed with Autism spectrum      disorder, Tourette's syndrome, severe obsessive compulsive      disorder and He has suffered the most physically      and mentally because of his Tourette's. It's severe and he is      frequently unable to attend school due to his ``tics.'' They      are painful and debilitating. They make him unable to eat,      breathe and see at their worst. Far from what is commonly      depicted in the movies and on  Then, this father goes on to say:       Two years ago I was forced to quit my job of twenty years      as a therapist to stay at home and care for Anthony because      of the amount of doctors' appointments he has and the number      of days of school he misses every year. Luckily with medical      assistance--  That is the Pennsylvania version of Medicaid--     covering his services I am still able to do so. If we lost      coverage, we would not be able to provide the support he      needs. We are sure of that.       I truly realize that unless you are actually living this      kind of life, it's easy to turn a blind eye. I can assure you      that my story is much like thousands of others that DEPEND--  And he has that word ``depend'' in all capital letters--     on funds from medical assistance to cover doctors,      medications, therapies and durable medical equipment that      children with disabilities require. Families of children with      disabilities are desperate to not lose those benefits.       My son Anthony is currently attending school almost      regularly and functioning the best he has for a very long      time thanks to the services he received from medical      assistance.  That is otherwise known as  So that is the reality for a lot of families. Now, I can hear some folks in the Senate saying: Well, maybe Anthony will not be affected because the Medicaid provisions are going to be up to the States, and the States can handle that. We are just going to put a cap on the dollars, and we are going to wind down the Medicaid expansion that covered 11 million Americans at last count, and the States will handle it.  So we are sending back these challenges and the disproportionate burden that States will have to bear to make sure that Anthony--who has all those challenges in his life--has the coverage of The Federal Government will just wash its hands of that responsibility.  No, Medicaid is a guarantee now, based upon your eligibility. That guarantee should remain. We are a great country. We have the strongest economy and the strongest military in the world, and we have the Medicaid We don't have to sacrifice those kids or sacrifice the healthcare for one child who depends on We don't have to sacrifice that child in order to have another part of our budget funded appropriately. That is an insult, and anyone who is going to choose to support legislation that would fund tax cuts for the wealthiest, while at the very same time and in the very same bill would result in others losing coverage--and I am not only talking about children with disabilities. I am talking about adults who have coverage--20 million people in the last couple of years. Any Member of the Senate who chooses tax cuts for the wealthy over those children and over those individuals, I think, should examine their conscience, to use an old expression, because this kind of policy[[Page S3711]]that results in the most vulnerable among us losing their healthcare coverage is obscene. There are a lot of other words we could use--words we can't use here--because that is the definition of an insult to our values and to our country.  We are a better country than what we will become if this Chamber votes in favor of a bill that will decimate Medicaid, the way this bill will. I realize it might take a long time. I realize it might be another Presidency or many Congresses from now, but the deed will be done here that will lead to that kind of misery. We have no sense of the misery that will be imposed upon those families because we have never had this before.  We had a program in place for 50 years, and it has helped a lot of kids with disabilities. It has helped a lot of families to be able to hold down a job while their child gets the benefit of Medicaid because of a disability. It has helped a lot of poor children rise up from poverty and overcome terrible poverty because when they were kids--when they were very, very young--they got early periodic screening diagnosis and testing--the kind of early intervention and good healthcare that children get on  A lot of seniors get into nursing homes. A lot of middle-class seniors from middle-class families get into nursing homes solely because they get the benefit of Medicaid, in addition to  The last thing I would say is that I think Senators in this Chamber should think about the basic inequity when they have healthcare. Everyone here has healthcare. All the families here have healthcare. All of our loved ones who are dependent upon us have healthcare. Yet some will vote to take away healthcare from some, and, in the very same bill, vote for gross, obscene tax cuts for the wealthiest among us--most of whom, I would bet, don't want those tax cuts. They would rather see us take care of the vulnerable.  So it is a basic choice. This isn't complicated. This is a very simple choice. I hope that in the course of this debate, some will come forward with some courage, some guts, and some compassion and do the right thing and vote this bill down.  I yield the floor.

4230,topic-id,2085,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the Russia questions that are on the minds of so many We had--I think, in the midst of all of the debate and controversy and genuine concern across the country--some good news yesterday when it was announced that Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein had made the decision to appoint a special counsel and, in this case, former FBI Director That was good news because, 1, there was a special counsel who would undertake a review of these questions and in an independent fashion. I think people across not just Washington but even across the country were heartened by the fact that it was someone of the caliber, the experience, and the dedicated law enforcement commitment that Director Mueller demonstrated in his years with the FBI as Director, as a prosecutor. That was good news.  We are grateful for that. I know we will have a chance in a little while to talk to the Deputy Attorney General about these issues. I think we have to examine a couple more questions that arise.  So to review, on January 26, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed the Trump administration that General Flynn had apparently lied about having conversations with the Russian Ambassador, warning that it could open him up to blackmail. On May 8, Yates testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and stated, contrary to claims by White House officials, that Flynn had discussed Russian sanctions in his those conversations with the Russian  On January 27, President Trump hosted Director Comey at the White House, where the New York Times reported he asked Director Comey to pledge his loyalty. Director Comey reportedly promised only honesty.  On January 30, President Trump fired Acting Attorney General Yates, claiming her dismissal was over a matter unrelated to  On February 13, fully 18 days after the White House was originally informed by Yates of General Flynn's misconduct, General Flynn was relieved of his job after it became public that he lied about his conversations with the Russian  The day after General Flynn was pushed out, the President reportedly summoned Director Comey to a private meeting in which he took the extraordinary step of asking him to drop the FBI investigation into  In March and again in May, Director Comey publicly confirmed that Trump associates were under investigation for possible coordination with Russia to interfere in the election. On May 9, President Trump fired Director His administration initially said it was based on a recommendation from Attorney General Sessions, who was supposed to be recused from anything to do with the Russia investigation, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who reportedly had been asked by Director Comey just days earlier for additional funding for the Russia investigation. But then the President himself revealed he fired Director Comey explicitly because of the Russia investigation.  The day after, the President tweeted a veiled threat that Director Comey ``better hope that there are no `tapes' '' of their conversation, raising the question of whether the President was surreptitiously recording his Oval Office meetings and whether tapes exist.  While it may be unrelated, it also bears mentioning that, this week, it was also reported that President Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian officials in a private Oval Office meeting--information that could jeopardize critical intelligence assets and risk undermining relationships with allies.  I think there are some serious questions, even with the special counsel who has been named, even with two Intelligence Committees reviewing these matters. I would hope that, in addition to those reviews that are being undertaken--those investigations--that we also have an independent commission to get all of the answers we need so that we can ensure the American people that this will never happen again--that no foreign government, in this case, a foreign adversary, can interfere in an election at any time in our future.  That guarantee will not be ironclad unless we know exactly what happened and why it happened, and then we take a series of steps to prevent it from happening. We should be very clear with the Russian Federation that if they do this again, they will be sanctioned, and there will be a consequence in response to their actions. We won't be able to do any of that unless we find the answers.  Here are a couple of basic questions I hope would be a part of the deliberations, not just of the two committees or other committees that might review this but also the deliberations and work of the special counsel and his team.  The first question is, Why does the President believe that the Russian election interference investigation is baseless, which is contrary to the unanimous finding of 17 U.intelligence agencies? These agencies issued a ``high confidence'' assessment of the determination they made. That is a technical term in the intelligence circles that they don't use lightly.  Based upon the findings of those intelligence agencies and that finding being of high confidence, why does the President continue to question or even undermine that determination?  Question 2 is, Why did Attorney General Sessions, who had to recuse himself from the Russian investigation, weigh in on the firing of the FBI Director responsible for that very investigation? That is a question, I think, a number of people are asking.  Question 3 is, Can the Justice Department's political leaders--individuals who have just come in with this administration and officials in the Justice Department--be trusted not to interfere in the ongoing FBI investigation? That is a question.  Question 4 is, Why, immediately after firing Director Comey and amid the uproar about interference in the Russian investigation that it created, did the President convene a private meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister and the Russian Ambassador in the Oval Office and allow the Russian state media--the Soviet-era state media entity--to cover that meeting while keeping out the U.media? I think that is a question that a lot of people have.  Question 5 is, Why did the President reveal highly classified information to the Russian Federation, according to the reporting by the Washington Post and others, during this meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister and the Russian Ambassador, and what are the implications of that disclosure? That is something that we need to have answers to.  At least these five questions--you could add many more--are critically important questions. In some respects, there are even more urgent questions in front of us, and I will focus a little bit on those today--basically, three, I guess.  1, did the President intentionally interfere with the ongoing FBI investigation into his associates, people that were on his campaign or on the campaign or working in the government now? The interference question[[Page S3039]]seems more likely than not based upon the reporting, but we have to know for sure, one way or the other: Did the President intentionally interfere with an ongoing FBI investigation?  2, are any such efforts to interfere ongoing?  If the answer to the first question is yes--and we don't know for certain if it is question yes, but if it is yes--if there was intentional interference with the investigation by the President, the second question would be, Are there any such efforts to interfere that are ongoing?  3, do they extend--meaning this potential alleged interference--past the FBI inquiry, to the investigations in the Senate and the House of Representatives? I think that is a question that is rather urgent as well.  Will this attempt to interfere, or alleged attempt to interfere, carry over into other investigations?  In essence now, we have three inquiries. One is the House Intelligence Committee, the other is the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the third would be Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. They are all critically important.  I would hope that we could add a fourth to that, which would be an independent commission, like the 9/11 Commission, where we came to definitive conclusions with regard to what happened on 9/11. Then, added to those conclusions, there were a series of recommendations so that we could prevent another 9/11. The same could be said here--that we want to make sure we get answers to these questions, have conclusions made, have accountability with regard to those conclusions, but then have a series of recommendations about how to prevent Russian interference or the interference of any foreign adversary in our election ever again.  Director Comey himself warned about the danger of undue influence on FBI investigations in an exchange during a May 3 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. In this case, it was Senator Hirono, a Democratic Senator from Hawaii, who asked if the Attorney General or senior Justice Department officials had ever ordered the FBI to halt an investigation.  Interestingly, here is what Director Comey replied to that question: ``Not in my experience,'' meaning not in his experience does he know of an instance where the Justice Department officials interfered with an FBI investigation.  I will read it again.       Not in my experience. Because it would be a big deal to      tell the FBI to stop doing something.  Then, he continues on, and it picks up with this:       [W]ithout an appropriate purpose. . . . a situation where      we were told to stop something for a political reason, that      would be a very big deal. It's not happened in my experience.  That is the now former FBI Director saying that there is no precedence for the idea that the Justice Department would ask the FBI to take an action, which would be interference.  Director Comey was talking about the Department of Justice in this case--actions by the Department of Justice to interfere with an FBI investigation. In retrospect, perhaps a better question would have been whether the political interference he thought would be a ``very big deal'' might have been coming directly from the Oval It is essential that we get to the bottom of this--a number of these questions.  An issue of this importance requires that the full investigative power of the Federal Government be brought to bear. The House and Senate Intel Committees are doing their investigation, as I said. The FBI investigation continues as well, despite concerns about independence in the wake of Director Comey's firing.  I hope, and I expect, that the next FBI Director will be someone who will be as independent, as capable, and as committed as Director Mueller is as the new special counsel.  We know there are dedicated professionals running these investigations. It has long been my belief that these extraordinary circumstances demand even more. I have been repeating for some time that we need a greater level of independence to insulate this critically important investigation from any suspicion of partisan interference. That is why I have been calling--for many weeks now, since early March--for a special counsel. I am glad the Justice Department now agrees with me.  Suffice it to say that we have a lot more work to do. Ultimately, this will be the work of everyone here, even if you are not a member of the Intel Committee or any other committee that is doing work that is directly relevant to this because, ultimately, the Congress has to take actions to get to the bottom of these questions but also be part of the process, at least, of imposing accountability and, also, especially the Congress is going to have to play a major role--the leading role--in making sure we put in place policies and procedures and laws that prevent this from ever happening again.  I hope the administration will join us in taking every step necessary to get to the bottom of these questions and to insist and to ensure that this never happens again to any American election. That is not just a goal, that has to be a guarantee as a result of this process. If the administration is not committed to that, I am not sure what they are committed to.  To take lightly or to ignore a problem that is this great and this serious, to undermine our democracy is, I think, to put at risk the very foundation of our Nation as a nation of laws and not of men, a nation that is committed to the rule of law.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

I know Senator Paul has been very consistent on this, but I am afraid this vote is somewhat about some Members wanting to get a piece of President Trump's hide on an issue that is far more important than something like that. I am fearful that this is what is happening today on the floor.  A lot of people don't realize that Saudi Arabia already has the bombs. What we would be selling to them is the precision-guided weaponry systems that allow these bombs to be smart bombs and not dumb bombs.  Most people have been concerned about Saudi Arabia when they have been involved in pushing back the Houthis, who, by the way, are firing weapons into their country from the southern border. It would be no different than if Mexico were doing that to ours. I know that is not going to happen. But, obviously, we would be firing back. So what is happening here is that they bought the bombs from Italy, and what they want to buy from us is these precision systems that allow them to not kill civilians. It is to protect civilians.  Think about this. Here in the Senate we want to protect civilians in Saudi Arabia, and in our wisdom we are looking at blocking the sale of the very mechanisms that would allow that to happen--in some cases, I am afraid, just to make a point against the Trump administration.  Actually, their policies here have been very sound. The meeting they had in Saudi Arabia was very beneficial. Saudi Arabia has flaws, but they have been an ally. This would show us as stepping away from an ally in a way that is cutting our nose off to spite our face by not allowing them to have the precision mechanisms to keep them from killing civilians.  We have taken Senators down in the There is absolutely no evidence that Saudi Arabia tried to kill civilians--none. As a matter of fact, there is evidence to the contrary.

4180,topic-id,938,"Mr.President, I am happy to announce that soon I will be introducing legislation that reauthorizes several critical provisions to help fight human trafficking and bring us one step closer to ridding our country of this heinous crime.  The Abolish Human Trafficking Act is chiefly a bill about getting human trafficking victims the help they need by focusing on ways to support them as they rebuild their lives. To me, one of the most shocking things about this terrible crime that victims of human trafficking need most is a safe place to live because without that, they will not be able to escape the people who have enslaved them, nor will they be able to begin the steps of the long road to recovery.  This legislation reauthorizes the Justice Department's Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, which we established when we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a bill I authored that was signed into law last This fund--like a crime victims compensation fund--provides critical resources to help victims get the services they need to recover.  Part of the fund is financed through fines collected on convicted traffickers. It is a clear way we can use these fines to do some good. Last year, the fund provided almost $5 million in victims services. By reauthorizing it, it can continue to serve more victims.  The bill also empowers victims by permanently reauthorizing the Human Trafficking Advisory Council--a group of survivors who annually advise the government on ways to combat this crime and lend a hand.  This bill goes a long way to help victims who should be at the forefront of any of our conversations about human trafficking. There is also no question that our Nation's law enforcement officials need more support to track down the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice. Certainly, law enforcement needs more training to better equip them to serve victims too. This bill also does that.  It requires the Department of Homeland Security to implement screening protocols across law enforcement anti-trafficking task forces. One of the hardest things about human trafficking may be, in fact, being able to identify that it is occurring when it occurs right in front of your eyes.  This training will impact the work of law enforcement at the Federal, State, and local levels. That way, law enforcement at every level of government can learn how to better spot trafficking victims and will have the adequate training to connect victims to the services they need in order to recover.  The legislation will also direct the Department of Health and Human Services to continue a pilot program to train healthcare providers about human trafficking. Healthcare providers, after all, are likely to come in contact with human trafficking victims as well, and they need to know the telltale signs that will alert them so they can report this to the appropriate authorities.  I have noted before that so much of the battle is about educating professionals but not just professionals. I would say all of us as ordinary citizens need to be on the lookout for signs of human trafficking.  Sadly, I learned a few years ago, when the Super Bowl was held in Texas, that one of the premier trafficking events in the Nation each year[[Page S3110]]is the Super Bowl, sad and as tragic as that sounds.  There is a role for all of us to play as regular citizens in identifying the telltale signs of human trafficking, and then when we see something wrong, to say something about it so hopefully they can be investigated.  Through pilot programs like this one, my hope is that more people will better understand it. The more people who understand trafficking and its warning signs, the more we can do to help those trapped in this modern-day slavery.  The legislation will also give law enforcement more resources to target criminal street gangs who profit from human trafficking. They view human beings as just another commodity that they can make money from, and going after criminal street gangs who profit from human trafficking is really important. We would also enhance the penalties for several human trafficking-related offenses as well.  Finally, the Abolish Human Trafficking Act will improve and update the national strategy to fight human trafficking across the country by requiring the Department of Justice to add a demand reduction component. This will build on legislation passed in the last Senate by a vote of 99 to 0, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking  I know by reading the newspaper and watching TV, people think nothing happens in Washington that is truly nonpartisan or bipartisan in nature. This is an example of why that is wrong. Certainly, this is a cause that every Member of the Senate can get behind, and there is no reason we shouldn't be able to pass this legislation soon with similar strong bipartisan, literally overwhelming bipartisan support.  I am grateful to our friend and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chairman Grassley, for his focus on doing all we can for victims of human trafficking. In addition to his support for the Abolish Human Trafficking Act, I know he also plans to introduce complementary anti-trafficking legislation, the Trafficking Victims Protection  I am hopeful both bills will be considered soon so we can prove the Senate is united in our opposition to human trafficking and so we can lend more support to the victims who so desperately need it.

3967,topic-id,960,"Mr.President, several weeks ago the House of Representatives passed a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to replace it. It was passed without hearings. It was passed without an amendment process, and it was passed before the Congressional Budget Office provided the traditional analysis that we count on before we take up a measure of such magnitude.  The measure passed with a party-line vote--all Had two Republicans voted the other way, it would not have moved forward.  After it passed, the President of the United States decided to have a celebration at the White We saw him on television, gathering the Republican Members of the House of Representatives and celebrating the fact that this measure had passed and that, finally, they were going to repeal the Affordable Care  But then the American people took a close look and the Congressional Budget Office issued its analysis, and it turns out that 23 million Americans would lose their health insurance because of this Republican measure that passed the House of  It turns out as well that there would be a dramatic increase in health insurance premiums for people between the ages of 50 and 64.  It turns out that in my State and many other States hospitals were in danger. The Illinois Health and Hospital Association says they would lose 60,000 jobs in Illinois with the dramatic cutbacks in Medicaid, endangering hospitals in rural areas and inner-city areas.  The facts started coming out about this repeal bill passed by the House of Representatives, and the President of the United States had a change of heart and announced to the American people that it was a mean bill--a mean bill. The President was right. It was mean legislation--mean to the millions who lost their healthcare, mean to seniors who would find their premiums going up dramatically, and mean to the people living in rural areas and small towns who count on those hospitals.  The President was right. It was mean.  Then, the responsibility shifts to the The majority leader, Senator McConnell, and his Republican followers had a chance to do a bill that was not mean. They had a chance to sit down on a bipartisan basis and to have the same process we used to create the Affordable Care  That would have involved public hearings. We had 50 public hearings on the Affordable Care It would have involved a real amendment process. The Affordable Care Act had 300 amendments. How many were offered by the Republicans? There were over 150 offered and adopted in a bipartisan process when we passed the Affordable Care The American people got a good look at the bill. The Congressional Budget Office issued their analysis before we voted on it. We passed it, and I am glad we did, and I am proud of that vote.  But what happened in the Senate when it came to the Republicans? They went into secrecy. Thirteen chosen Republican Senators all sat in a room and wrote the alternative, or so we are told. They met in secret and never once had a public hearing, never once disclosed to the American people what was being debated, never once gave an opportunity for real bipartisan cooperation to strengthen our existing healthcare system--not at all.  So all we have at this moment is truly press accounts of what has been announced to the Republican Senate caucus, what they are going to get a chance to read and see. But it is enough to see that when it comes down to the basics, there is not much of a change between the House of Representatives' effort and the Senate effort.  You can put a lace collar on a pit bull, and it is still a mean dog.[[Page S3700]]  What we have here with the Republicans in the Senate is an attempt to dust off the edges of the House bill and say: This is not as mean. I will tell you, at the end of the day, from the reports we have, this is still a mean dog, and one the people of the United States don't want to see happen.  There isn't a single medical advocacy group--not one in my State, and I don't know of any nationwide--that endorses what the Republicans in the House have accomplished with the passage of their bill, and this bill mirrors it, as well, and we can expect the same result.  So the only thing we can offer the American people is a chance to be part of the conversation on a bill that will literally change healthcare for millions of If they are going to be part of the conversation, there has to be a chance for amendment and debate, at least, and a chance for the American people to see what is in the Senate Republican measure.  So I ask unanimous consent that any substitute or perfecting amendment offered to Calendar 120, H.1628, be subject to a point of order if the text of the amendment has not been filed at the desk and made available on a public website for at least 72 hours, along with an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office of the bill's budgetary, coverage, and cost implications; and that a motion to waive the point of order be in order, and if a motion to waive is made, an affirmative three-fifths vote of those duly chosen and sworn is required to waive the point of order.

My senior communications adviser, Ron Hindle, is retiring after more than 30 years in the U.If you do some quick math, you will realize that Ron has been part of the Senate longer than I have. I came here in January of 1997 and quickly learned Ron would be an indispensable part of my team. Previously, he had worked for my predecessor, Al That meant he knew Wyoming, and he knew how to communicate with  I am so glad I hired Ron when I came to He has written some of the best speeches I have given over the past 20 years. When Ron told me he was retiring, I went back and looked at a few of his remarks between tears.  When my longtime State director retired, Ron wrote:       There is an old saying we all heard before: Good help is      hard to find. Here is my experience: Good help is not only      hard to find, it is also impossible to replace.  That was true about Robin, and it is equally true of In a speech to the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies, Ron called the library card ``our passport to adventure.'' For a speech to the Young Entrepreneurs Academy, Ron referred to books, ``especially biographies and autobiographies--as `How To' manuals for success.'' When I spoke to my grandson's graduating fifth grade class, Ron wrote me an example comparing the Supreme Court to grandparents: ``If they say no, there is no one else to turn to.''  I hope this sampling of Ron's work can convey why he has been an important part of my team. He has a way with words that few people have and, more importantly, he knows what I want to say and how I want to say it. Ron does more than help me with speeches. If there is a student in Wyoming who has achieved an important goal, Ron helps me with a laudatory note. When an organization like Daughters of the American Revolution has their annual convention, Ron works on the statement commemorating that event. When a Wyoming business celebrates an important anniversary, Ron has helped me congratulate that success.  My staff and I will miss Ron, not only for the help he gives us but for the person he is. He is kind, considerate, and generous. He is also willing to lend a helping hand in everything we do, from hosting our holiday cookie party to organizing trivia, and building games for our staff planning sessions. This isn't goodbye, as Ron will remain my neighbor and my friend.  Today I want to celebrate all that Ron has done for me, for my office, for Wyoming, and for It is appropriate for me to once again quote Ron in describing the word ``celebrate'' to Wyoming Cowboy Challenge Academy graduates, Ron wrote:       Celebrating is much more than the things we do--it's the      feelings we get from the great accomplishments of our life.      It is the joy and happiness that comes from the heart when we      have reached one of our goals. It's the sense of satisfaction      we feel that comes from the knowledge that we have taken on a      difficult challenge and mastered it. It is the increase in      self-confidence and self-esteem that comes from learning to      trust in ourselves to make the right choices and the right      decisions.  Ron, Diana joins me in celebrating you today. You have been a great example of the importance of public service, and your legacy will continue in my office and in Wyoming as business owners, students, and others reread the words you wrote over more than 30 years.

4169,topic-id,512,"Mr.President, today I want to speak briefly about the nomination of Kevin Newsom to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals from  I intend to support Mr.Newsom's nomination. Mr.Newsom is currently in private practice in He previously served as the solicitor general of He also clerked for Justice Souter on the U.Supreme Court and graduated from Harvard Law School and Samford The American Bar Association has unanimously rated him ``well qualified.''  My support for Mr.Newsom's nomination does not mean that this is a judicial nominee that I would have necessarily chosen. There are aspects of Mr.Newsom's record that concern me.  For example, in private practice, Mr.Newsom published an article in which he was extremely critical of the doctrine known as substantive due process. This is the doctrine the Supreme Court invoked in protecting the right to use contraception, a women's right to choose, and the right to same-sex marriage.  Additionally, as solicitor general of Alabama, Mr.Newsom filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court in the case Rasul v. Bush, arguing that Federal courts did not have jurisdiction to hear habeas claims from foreign nationals who were captured overseas and detained at Guantanamo The Supreme Court ruled against Mr.Newsom's position in a 6-3 decision.  Lastly, while Mr.Newsom was in private practice, he filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court case Roper v. Simmons, where he urged the Court to reject a brightline rule prohibiting capital punishment for children under the age of 18. His work on this case followed several other cases where, as solicitor general of Alabama, he had argued against procedural rights for individuals on death row.  As I consider this nominee, I have to balance these positions--which do concern me--with other aspects of Mr.Newsom's nomination. Here, we have a nominee unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar His home-State Senators have returned blue slips and support his nomination. Although some outside groups have expressed concerns, no outside group has officially opposed his confirmation.  As a result, I voted to invoke cloture on Mr.Newsom's nomination today. My decision on every nominee will be based on that nominee's individual record.  I also want to briefly remind my colleagues why we are even considering Mr.Newsom's nomination in the first place.  In February 2016, President Obama nominated Alabama U.District Court Judge Abdul Kallon for this very same vacancy on the Eleventh  Today Mr.Newsom was voted on because Senators Shelby and Strange returned blue slips for his nomination.  I would like the Senate to also know that we held a hearing just last week that included Judge Ralph Erickson to be a judge on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals because Senators Hoeven and Heitkamp returned their blue slips. This shows the importance of the blue slip helping move nominations through the process.  Democratic Senators are conducting their due diligence on these nominees before returning their blue slips, and in the Erickson nomination, the return of the blue slip is bipartisan. Many of the current nominees have voluminous records, and we need to allow home-State Senators to do their work.

4178,topic-id,1543,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss problems that affect almost every aspect of our everyday life no matter who we are, where we live, our level of income, or any other distinction that might be possible to make. These problems have to do with America's surface transportation system.  Like most Nebraskans, I believe infrastructure is a core duty of the Federal It represents investment in our economy, public safety, and national security. In the Senate, much of my work has been focused on removing unnecessary obstacles to the flow of goods, materials, and, most importantly, people along our Nation's surface transportation networks. Through legislation and with Executive orders, we did lower the coefficient of friction on these systems. We can lower that enough that people and products can get where they need to go quicker and at a lower cost. I have been proud to support several pieces of legislation to do just that.  In 2015, Congress passed the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act--the FAST It was our first long-term highway bill in more than a decade. As chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee in the Senate, I was glad to help steer it to final passage.  I am also proud to have authored a significant number of its provisions. For example, the bill includes a new national strategic freight program that provides every State with annual guaranteed funding. Because of the freight program, States will have greater flexibility to work with key stakeholders and local officials to develop strategic investments in transportation. The program funnels transportation funds to States and allows them to decide on their terms how to use it. By dedicating funding for rural and urban freight corridors, the program enhances the flow of commercial traffic, and it increases safety on our Nation's roads.  The true beauty of this program is that it offers States the opportunity to make critical investments to best meet their specific geographic and their specific infrastructure needs. Nebraska can elect to invest in a rail grade crossing or a truck parking lot along a rural road. California could choose to invest in ondock rail projects at our Nation's largest port complex located just outside of Los It works for all States without leaving any behind.  The FAST Act was an important first step, but there is more to be done. President Trump has spoken frequently about the need to invest in our transportation infrastructure. Just yesterday, the administration released a set of principles for reexamining how we do that. I am encouraged to see these proposals that will give States greater flexibility to develop our infrastructure as well as reduce unnecessary regulations that delay these very important projects.  The proposal also talks about providing long-term solutions, which is something I have long supported. This is critical for States to develop, construct, and maintain infrastructure. Last week, at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing, we heard an update from Transportation Secretary Elaine She committed to working closely with Congress as we continue to develop commonsense solutions for our infrastructure needs. She outlined some of the proposals the Department of Transportation is reviewing to include in this infrastructure package. During that hearing--the Presiding Officer was there as well--the Secretary told me she is committed to working closely with my colleagues and me to develop a national infrastructure policy.  I also brought up the issue of delays due to burdensome regulations like the National Environmental Policy Act permitting process that directly affects Nebraska projects. To address these delays, the Nebraska Unicameral unanimously passed legislation that would allow the Nebraska Department of Roads to assume the NEPA permitting process. NDOR has sent a letter to the Federal Highway Administration to begin the implementation of this program, and that could take up to 18 months to complete.  I asked the Secretary for an update on the progress of the application, and she assured me the Department is following it closely. She said: ``We know the issue, we are tracking it, and we will continue to pay attention.'' Furthermore, Secretary Chao explained that the administration ``will not specify any list of projects'' in an infrastructure plan. States know their transportation needs best, not the Federal The larger the role States have from start to finish in developing their own infrastructure, the more they can direct funding to the projects that directly affect their citizens.  For the benefit of families across America in both our urban and our rural areas, we need to look for out-of-the-box solutions to ensure that our infrastructure is up to date. That is why I have introduced the Build USA Infrastructure Act, which looks to solve two major challenges to our transportation[[Page S3109]]system. The first is the near-term solvency of the highway trust fund's expiration of the FAST Act in 2020. The second is a lack of flexibility for States in starting and finishing major transportation infrastructure projects.  According to the March 2016 Congressional Budget Office projections, by the year 2026, the highway trust fund will face a cumulative shortfall of approximately $107 billion. Meanwhile, we see construction costs climbing. The rise in the use of electric and alternative-fuel vehicles is causing trust fund revenues to fall. Heavy Federal regulations continue to eat away at that purchasing power of the highway trust fund.  America needs a new plan to successfully meet the looming highway trust fund shortfall and to strengthen our transportation system. The Build USA Infrastructure Act gives us a plan.  For 5 years following the expiration of the FAST Act, this legislation would direct the U.Treasury to dedicate approximately $21.4 billion in Customs and Border Patrol-collected fees and revenues to the highway trust fund. Now, CBP revenue collections on freight, cargo, and passengers include tariffs, duties, taxes, and user fees at U.land, water, and air ports of entry. CBP revenues from these sources amounted to nearly $46 billion in fiscal year 2015. Because of their nature as charges on freight and travelers, Customs duties and fees closely abide by the ``user pays'' principle that we look at in transportation funding. According to CBP, the agency only utilizes $2 billion of that revenue for its operations, so the diversion of revenue would not negatively impact CBP's operating budget. By using an existing revenue stream which has a transportation nexus, we provide stability to the highway trust fund without increasing fees or taxes, and that is sound policy.  The Build USA Infrastructure Act also offers greater flexibility to States so their limited highway dollars can go further for them. I served 8 years in the Nebraska I know our States, counties, and cities face real challenges in starting and completing infrastructure projects because of excessive procedural costs, delays, and really an overall lack of transportation funding. According to the Congressional Research Service, major Federal highway projects can take as long as 14 years to complete from start to finish. It took less time to build the Panama Canal, and we did that more than a century ago.  Greater flexibility, improved collaboration, and more autonomy can help States begin and complete their vital infrastructure projects in less time, which means lower costs. The Build USA Infrastructure Act would let them do that through State remittance agreements. This legislation would offer States more flexibility and control of infrastructure funding by establishing a new partnership between them and the U.Federal Highway Under this arrangement, States are permitted to enter into voluntary remittance agreements whereby they can remit 10 percent of their Federal aid highway dollars in exchange for State purview over design, permitting, and construction aspects of Federal aid highway projects. The State-remitted money to the Federal Highway Administration would be deposited into the highway trust fund to help further address its growing deficit. It would give States breathing room as they work to bring in projects on time and on budget.  I am so confident in this bill because I have seen these concepts work at the State level. As a State senator in the Nebraska Legislature, I introduced the Build Nebraska It directed a quarter of each cent of sales tax revenue toward maintaining Nebraska's roads and bridges. Because of it, more than $1 billion will be available to meet Nebraska's infrastructure needs over the next 17 years.  I also introduced legislation that tasked the Nebraska Department of Roads with developing the Federal Funds Purchase In exchange for giving up a portion of Federal transportation dollars, Nebraska counties and their towns can now receive funds with more reasonable regulatory requirements. Because of this program, major Nebraska transportation projects, such as the longstanding bridge replacement in Buffalo County and a major arterial street in South Sioux City, are up and running.  Investing in infrastructure means so much more than just adding a few lines to a map. It means connecting our families and delivering goods and services. In Nebraska's case, it means feeding the world. With persistence and prudent planning, we can build for the future, we can give greater economic opportunity to rising generations, and we can connect communities--family to family, town to town, and coast to coast.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century  Mr.Speaker, when many Americans think of higher education, they think of a traditional college or university on a sprawling green campus.

While many Americans choose this path, there is a misconception that this is the only pathway to success. For many hardworking Americans, the pathway to success does not require a baccalaureate degree.

4216,topic-id,1094,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the House Republican healthcare bill and the devastating effect that it would have on people with mental illness and those affected by the Nation's opioid epidemic.  Nationwide, more than 52,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2015, the most recent year for which data are available, with 63 percent of those deaths involving an opioid. This means that drug overdose deaths now surpass the number of people who die each year from automobile accidents or from firearms.  That same year in Minnesota, we lost more than 570 people to drug overdoses. About half of those deaths were tied to prescription medication--particularly, opiate pain relievers--and another 20 percent of those deaths were associated with heroin. We saw drug overdose deaths jump 11 percentage points in Minnesota from 2014 to 2015.  The opioid epidemic knows no boundaries. It has touched people and families of all incomes, of all races, and of all ages. Some communities in Minnesota have been hit particularly hard by this crisis, including our Native American population. Not long ago, I visited the Bois Forte Indian Bois Forte is a small, beautiful reservation up in northern Minnesota, a community where people know each other and trust each other. In fact, historically, the trust has run so deep that folks in Bois Forte didn't even lock their doors at night. But the opioid epidemic--I was told this by the Tribe chairman--and the impact it has had on the people in the reservation has changed that. Opioids are changing and destroying families and communities, and one clear sign of this is that people now are locking their doors, the chairman told me.  Right now, we need to be doing all we can to help people, families, and communities that have been devastated by opioid addiction. We must provide support for treatments and other necessary interventions, and we need to be focusing on prevention. That is why we passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act just last year, and why we followed it up with the behavioral health provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act--again, just at the end of last  Now these important advances are under threat. The so-called healthcare bill that Republicans pushed out of the House of Representatives would undermine the very programs that help people with opioid addiction. For instance, as the CBO confirmed yesterday, the bill guts Medicaid, cutting the program's budget by more than $830 billion over 10 years. These losses are compounded by the additional $610 billion in cuts to Medicaid proposed in President Trump's budget yesterday. In total, these cuts would amount to close to a 50-percent reduction in the funding for the Medicaid Program, causing at least 14 million people to lose Medicaid coverage over the next decade. Medicaid is the 1 payer for behavioral health services in the It covers both prevention and treatment for people at risk for or actively battling opioid addiction.  For example, Medicaid pays for about one-quarter of medication-assisted treatment for opioid and heroin addictions. Because of the Medicaid expansion, 1.3 million additional people gained access to behavioral health services, which reduced the number of low-income adults needing substance use treatment but not receiving it by 18 percent.  To further undermine coverage, the House bill would also allow States to eliminate essential health benefits. The essential health benefits are 10 key benefits that plans exchanges must offer, including maternity care, prescription drugs, and mental health and substance use disorder services. What we know is that before the ACA was passed, many people with private insurance did not have coverage for the mental health services they needed. One in three did not have coverage for substance use disorder treatment, and close to one in five did not have coverage for mental healthcare.  Now is not the time to be cutting back on those benefits. In fact, last year, the Surgeon General issued a report on addiction, which found that there are more people with substance use disorders than people with cancer. What the CBO score confirmed yesterday was that people who live in States that rollback essential health benefits, who still need the services that are no longer included in the essential health benefits would ``experience substantial increases in out-of-pocket spending on health care or would choose to forgo the services.''  The report goes on to call out the fact that out-of-pocket costs for these patients could increase by thousands of dollars a year, and the benefits would again be subject to annual and lifetime limits. Substance use disorder services are highlighted as specific benefits that CBO anticipates States will exclude first.  I want to make this clear to my colleagues and to the American people: You cannot say that you want to address our country's opioid epidemic and at the same time support this bill. Those things are in direct opposition to one another. So, to all of my colleagues who supported CARA and supported the 21st Century Cures Act, I urge you to work with us to build on the ACA so that we can effectively address the opioid epidemic ravaging our country.  My colleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator Corker from Tennessee,[[Page S3183]]had it right when he remarked on the secret partisan process currently underway in the Earlier this week he said:       It's a very awkward process, at best. There are no experts.      There's no actuaries. . . . Typically, in a hearing, you'd      have people coming in and you'd also have the media opining      about if a hearing took place, and X came in and made      comments.  Senator Corker is spot-on. The American people deserve an open and transparent discussion on how we can best improve healthcare in our Many Americans are struggling just to keep their heads above water, paying their bills, raising their kids, caring for their parents, and coping with health problems.  Families in Minnesota and in all of our States have been or are currently being ripped apart by opioid addiction. They need our help. They don't need a bill or a budget, for that matter, that is hastily put together for ideological reasons. They don't need policies that undercut their care and their livelihood.  Ninety-one people die every day in the United States from an opioid overdose. Only one in five people who currently need treatment for opioid use disorders is actually getting it.  American lives hang in the balance. People are counting on us to do the right thing. So let's do it.  I yield the floor.

3857,topic-id,363,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, this amendment facilitates the construction of badly needed icebreakers. The United States does not have any heavy icebreakers that are available all year round. We only have one, and that is used in the Antarctic and, therefore, unavailable in the summer in the north.  Joining me on this amendment is the ranking member and others from the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure  We need icebreakers; in fact, we need six icebreakers. We need to build the first one immediately and get it underway.  Language in the underlying bill provides a mechanism for us to fund that icebreaker using the authorities of the Department of the Navy, specifically, one of their sections. This amendment clarifies the language and makes it clear that the Navy can act as the fiscal agent to carry out the icebreaker task. It does not require in any way that the Navy shipbuilding account be used in any way to pay for the icebreaker. The money for the icebreaker will have to come from other sources. But it makes it clear that the Navy can expend money as a fiscal agent using the special account that was designated, that has been in existence for some time.  I can go into great length about why we need icebreakers, but the very short story is that Russia has over 40 icebreakers, probably closer to 50, many of them heavy icebreakers capable of operating in very thick ice in the The United States really has none. We have some light icebreakers, but they will not suffice during the Arctic spring and winter. Therefore, we have to get with it.  We do know that in the future--well, today and this year, this summer--the Northwest Passage will be open for shipping, and the East Passage, which is along the Russian coast, is also open.  So the Arctic is a navigable ocean. The U.Navy cannot operate there without an icebreaker. We cannot conduct civil and maritime as well as military exercises without a heavy icebreaker. This allows us to do that.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgH5790-2.txt,1973,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,13.0,July

3864,topic-id,297,"Mr.Chair, just a couple of things.  First of all, there is a thing called the National Sealift Fund, which has been in existence for a long time, and it has been used to build non-Navy ships. That is exactly what we intend to do here is to use the National Sealift Fund, not the Navy shipbuilding fund.  Secondly, you may notice or you may want to know that the U.Coast Guard is, in fact, a defense as well as a civilian vessel; it has both obligations.  We also need to understand that we are not stealing money from the This is simply a mechanism in which the Navy acts as a fiscal agent to carry out the task.  The Coast Guard is not well suited to build ships of this type. We are looking for the most efficient and effective way to carry out the task, and the use of the National Sealift Fund, together with the U.Navy as the fiscal agent, is the best way to accomplish that.  I would end by simply saying the U.Navy is toothless, useless in the Arctic unless it has an icebreaker. So if you care about the Arctic Ocean and the role of the U.Navy in carrying out our national defense functions in the Arctic, then you must help us find a way to build the icebreakers.  We will do so without, in any way, taking funds away from the U.Navy shipbuilding. Indeed, it would be up to the appropriators to appropriate money quite hopefully from the Department of Homeland Security for this purpose, putting the money into this National Sealift Fund so that it can then be used to build the icebreaker, with the Navy acting as the fiscal agent.

3898,topic-id,321,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment with the intent of accurately and transparently determining the prevailing wage for Department of Defense contracts. My amendment would require the calculation of wages for contractors and all defense projects to be based on actual statistics calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, as opposed to the current process which determines these rates based on fundamentally flawed surveys within the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, or the  This amendment is needed. A 2008 Department of Labor Inspector General report found that ``one or more errors existed in 100 percent of the wage reports.'' The Congressional Budget Office estimates that upwards of $13 billion could be wasted over 10 years if Davis-Bacon is left unreformed. As stewards of the public treasury, we have an obligation to spend taxpayer money wisely. This amendment addresses that very need.  Additionally, this amendment doesn't remove funds from the Defense budget. The money this amendment saves--potentially in the billions of dollars--will be kept within the Department of Defense budget to be used for other important defense priorities. In a fiscal environment where every dollar counts, this amendment presents a welcome opportunity to make our defense dollars go further.  This amendment isn't an attempt to repeal Davis-It is about competition, equality, accuracy, and transparency for everyone. It simply asks that wage determinations for Department of Defense contracts be made with statistically sampled information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics so that we are able to spend Federal dollars in a more efficient manner and support more jobs. The BLS has proven time and time again that they are the only agency capable of accurately determining these wages.  A fair wage for a fair job is fair to the American taxpayer.

The bill provides significant benefits for all parties, including tribal members, supporters of fish and wildlife, supporters of the environment, supporters of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and, most importantly, the people living in the surrounding areas that need access to critical medical and healthcare services.  Local communities in the State of Alaska have been trying to build a one-lane, 11-mile gravel road to link King Cove and Cold Bay for nearly 3 decades.

He even told the President himself, and I understand that he repeatedly told this to the But Mr.Comey didn't listen to my request for transparency. I think transparency in government is very important because transparency brings accountability, and government needs to be accountable. Mr.Comey didn't listen to the President's request. Only months later has the truth finally come out.  Well, it ought to raise the question with anybody: What happened in the meantime? What happened because Mr.Comey refused to tell the American people that the President wasn't under investigation? The short answer is something you see almost hourly, particularly in this city: media hysteria. Countless media articles falsely claimed the President was under investigation for colluding with Unfortunately, a number of our Democrat colleagues in the House and Senate played right along. Over and over again, the media published selective leaks. They published classified half-truths. All this was used to make false allegations of sinister conduct by the And, of course, there were a lot of people who believed it.  The intelligence community conducted an assessment of Russia's efforts to interfere in the election. That assessment said one of Russia's goals was to undermine public confidence in our democratic system.  Because Mr.Comey refused to tell the public that the FBI was not investigating the President, conspiracy theories and, of course, wild speculation have run rampant about the election, the President, and These conspiracy theories and wild speculation have played right into Russia's aim of undermining faith in our democratic system.[[Page S3708]]  That doesn't come out very often in these stories, but we have to understand that Russia makes a career of not only undermining democratic systems in the United States, look at what they have done in Ukraine militarily, and look at what they have done in France with the elections and in the Netherlands with the elections. They are talking about upcoming elections in Germany, where the Russians will try to do the same thing because autocrats don't like democratic systems that work and whatever they can do to undermine those democratic systems is going to obviously make them look better in comparison.  Those national security concerns should have taken precedence. Mr.Comey said he was worried about a duty to correct the record if evidence of collusion involving the President came to light later on. But that concern was merely hypothetical--in other words, pure speculation. In the unlikely event that it came to pass, the public should know if the FBI is pursuing a criminal investigation against the President, just as the public should know if the FBI is pursuing a criminal investigation against a major party's nominee for But Mr.Comey agreed with Attorney General Lynch to shade the truth in favor of the Clinton campaign's rhetoric and call what was an investigation a ``matter'' instead of using the word ``investigation.'' This came about because of an order by Attorney General  After a year of the entire might of the U.intelligence community and the FBI looking for evidence of collusion with the Russians, where is that evidence? But after all of this chaos and mountains of innuendo about the President and collusion with Russia, the truth finally came out: The FBI was not investigating President Trump in the Russia probe. The media was wrong. The Democrats were wrong. The wild speculation and conspiracy theories ended up harming our country. They played right into Russia's hands.  How did we all learn the truth? In President Trump's letter removing Mr.Comey from office. At first, most didn't believe it. The media scoffed when they read what the President said in that letter. They insisted that Mr.Comey would never tell the President that he was not under investigation. We learned earlier this month from Mr.Comey himself that he had done exactly that. It wasn't a surprise to me because Mr.Comey had told me the same thing.  I have to note something else here. Mr.Comey didn't just tell the President, Senator Feinstein, and me that the President was not under investigation. He had also told the Gang of 8. Of course, the Gang of 8 includes the Senate minority leader, Mr.But even after Mr.Comey told the Gang of 8 that the President was not under investigation, the minority leader told the media that the President was under investigation, and, of course, that further helped feed media hysteria. The minority leader even tried to say that the Senate shouldn't vote on the Supreme Court nomination because the President was under investigation, and the whole time, he knew it wasn't true.  Media hysteria and baseless political attacks filled the vacuum left by Mr.Comey's failure to inform the public--to be transparent, to be accountable.  The odd thing about it is none of this fiasco had to happen. If Mr.Comey had just been transparent with the public, as I urged him to be, it could have been avoided.  Unfortunately, now it looks as if Mr.Comey and the media might be doing the same thing to Attorney General  Two weeks ago, Mr.Comey said he didn't tell the Attorney General about the conversation he supposedly had with the President about General Mr.Comey said this was because he believed the Attorney General was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.  Mr.Comey said the FBI was aware of the facts that he couldn't discuss in an open setting that could have made the Attorney General's continued engagement problematic. Well, that vague statement sounds very mysterious to people who don't know the whole truth. They will wonder: What were those secret facts? What did the FBI conclude about those secret facts? Was the Attorney General under investigation? Did the Attorney General collude with Russia?  Once again, Mr.Comey is not being as transparent about senior government officials and the Russia investigation as he could or should be. Now the speculation is running rampant again, this time about the Attorney General instead of the  CNN reported that Mr.Comey told the Intelligence Committee behind closed doors that the issue was a possible additional meeting between Sessions and the Russian The media has begun to speculate all sorts of nefarious things. So here we go again. The rumor mill is back in business. It is insinuating improper ties with Russians and undermining people's faith in another senior government official, with the follow-up that it also undermines people's confidence in our institutions of government, and maybe even in our  This is the same destructive pattern, and it plays right into the Russians' hands again. Well, this time around, we shouldn't put up with it. We ought to say enough is enough. There is no reason Mr.Comey couldn't have told the public the whole truth.  Once again, 3 months ago, Mr.Comey specifically told Members who was and who was not under investigation in the Russia probe. He should also tell the public whether the FBI ever had an open investigation on Attorney General He should tell the public whether the FBI checked out the times Sessions met the Russian He should tell the public whether the FBI looked into the Mayflower Hotel event that went on. He should tell the public if the FBI found nothing improper about these meetings. If there was nothing to it, he should say so publicly. He should not be telling Senators one thing behind closed doors and then making public insinuations that are different. He is the person who can nip this ridiculous speculation in the bud.  Mr.Comey should have told the public earlier what he told Members about the President, and now he should tell the public what he told Members about the Attorney Enough of this nonsense.  The investigations of Russian interference and of circumstances surrounding Mr.Comey's firing will continue. I am confident that we will eventually get all the facts, one way or another, and we are going to go where the facts take us. In the meantime, it is time to stop the rumor-mongering. It is time to stop the innuendoes and half-truths. It is time to stop leaking national security information to score political points. And it is time to stop playing into Russia's hands by intentionally sowing false doubt about your political opponents. Instead, it is quite obvious that it is time to get back to doing the people's business.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a relevant supplemental article from the Washington  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, June 14, 2017]     The Sessions Hearing Shows Who's Really Colluding With Russia                         (By Marc Thiessen)       According to the U.intelligence community, Russia's      objectives in meddling in the 2016 election included not only      hurting Hillary Clinton's chances but also undermining      ``public faith in the U.democratic process,'' ``impugning      the fairness of the election'' and calling into question      ``the U.S.-led liberal democratic order.'' If the spectacle      of the past few months is any indication, Russian leader      Vladimir Putin is certainly succeeding in these latter goals.       And here is the great irony: Those who are falsely claiming      that Trump was under FBI investigation for collusion with      Moscow are, in fact, the ones inadvertently colluding with      Putin to undermine American democracy.       Case in point is the campaign of McCarthyite character      assassination on display in the Senate Intelligence Committee      hearing No doubt Putin was smiling as Attorney      General Jeff Sessions was forced to rebut what he correctly      called ``appalling and detestable'' accusations that he      colluded with the Russians and lied to the Sessions      testified that the much-vaunted ``third meeting'' between      Sessions and the Russian ambassador at the Mayflower Hotel--     which Sessions reportedly failed to disclose--did not happen,      at least not beyond possible incidental contact that he      doesn't even recall.       There was a time when airing unproven allegations of      coordinating with the Kremlin was seen as bad form. Now it is      common practice in These kinds of false charges      and innuendo directly assist Russia[[Page S3709]]     in its efforts to undermine public confidence in our      democratic institutions. Those raising such accusations      without proof are, wittingly or unwittingly, doing the      Kremlin's bidding.       For months, Democrats (a.k.a. ``The Resistance'') have been      spinning the false narrative that President Trump was under      FBI investigation to call into question the validity of his      presidency. In March, Democrats used it as a pretext to argue      that Trump did not have the legitimacy to fill a Supreme      Court vacancy. Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer      (N.Y.) declared in a floor speech that the Senate should not      vote on Neil Gorsuch's nomination because Republicans      ``stopped a president who wasn't under investigation'' from      filling the seat. Two days later, Elizabeth Warren (D-     Mass.) said the same thing, declaring, ``The FBI has revealed      that the sitting president of the United States is under      investigation. And it raises a really, I think, important      question and that is whether or not a president who is under      investigation by the FBI ought to be ramming through a      Supreme Court nominee that would have a lifetime      appointment.''       The media gleefully echoed these false claims. The day      before Comey testified, CNN blared: ``In testimony, Comey      will dispute President Trump's blanket claim that he was told      he wasn't under investigation.'' In fact, Comey said      precisely the opposite. When James Risch (R-Idaho)      asked, ``While you were director, the president of the United      States was not under investigation. Is that a fair      statement?'' Comey replied: ``That's correct.'' Even then,      CNN was not willing to concede its error, declaring in a so-     called ``correction'' that ``Comey does not directly dispute      that Trump was told multiple times he was not under      investigation'' (emphasis added).       No, Comey did not fail to ``directly dispute'' it, he      directly confirmed it. The CNN story--and its non-correction      correction--was ``fake news.''       Not only that, Comey also testified that Trump never tried      to get him to stop the probe into Russia's election meddling,      which Comey explained was a separate matter from the FBI's      investigation of disgraced former national security adviser      Michael Not only did Trump not ask Comey to stop the      probe, the former FBI director told Marco Rubio (R-     Fla.), ``He went farther than that. He said, and if some of      my satellites did something wrong, it'd be good to find that      out.'' Rubio pressed Comey, asking whether he was testifying      that Trump effectively said, ``Do the Russia investigation. I      hope it all comes out. I have nothing to do with anything      It'd be great if it all came out, people around me      were doing things that were wrong.'' Comey replied, ``That      was the sentiment he was expressing. Yes, sir.''       Given these facts, Trump has legitimate reason to be      frustrated. If you knew you were not under investigation by      the FBI, but everyone was saying you were, you'd want the      truth to get out. And you might be upset with an FBI director      who refused to lift the ``cloud'' hanging over your      administration by confirming that he was not investigating      you.       That said, Trump has been fueling the liberal feeding      frenzy with his tweetstorms taking his critics to task. If      Trump knows he did nothing wrong--and if he really wants to      find out whether any of his ``satellites'' did--he should      stop talking and tweeting about the investigation, let      special counsel Robert Mueller III do his work and focus      on his job: governing. His daughter Ivanka Trump was recently      asked how she dealt with the media frenzy over She      replied, ``I'm trying to keep my head down, not listen to the      noise and just work really hard to make a positive impact in      the lives of many people.''       That's a good strategy--and one her father ought to      emulate.  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgS3698-3.txt,457,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,22.0,July

4184,topic-id,472,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today we are being asked to mandate a land exchange that will put a road through a designated wilderness area inside the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in If that sounds familiar, that is because we have been down this road before.  After years of prodding from the Alaska delegation, the Public Land Management Act of 2009 authorized this exchange and the eventual construction of the road. However, that 2009 authorization was contingent upon a determination by the Secretary of the Interior that the road was in the public interest.  The Fish and Wildlife Service then spent nearly 5 years preparing a full environmental impact statement in order to analyze the environmental impacts of the proposed road, and to determine if viable alternatives existed. During the lengthy and public process, the agency held 130 public meetings, reviewed thousands of public comments, 97 percent of which were opposed to the road.  Ultimately, the Interior Department determined that building a road through the one-of-a-kind wilderness area is not justified because it will destroy an irreplaceable ecosystem, and there are other ways to improve transportation in the area.  This is not just a simple trail through the woods. It is a road through a narrow chain of islands and lagoons. Its construction requires the development of bridges, installation of culverts and pipes, and the dredge and fill of nearly 4 acres of wetlands.  The Izembek National Wildlife Refuge supports numerous species of migratory waterfowl that we have international treaty obligations to protect, including nearly the entire global population of the Pacific black brant, and one of the only populations of nonmigratory tundra swans, in addition to providing prime habitat for bears, caribou, and other wildlife.  Now, before the point can be made, let me just say, I want to be clear, I have never been to the refuge. Opposition to this road is not based on personal opinion or spite, or ignorance, or because we love birds more than people.  Opposition to this road is based on extensive public comments and a long, careful, scientific review of its merits conducted by conservation professionals. The table of contents for the environmental review--not the review itself, but just the table of contents--is 28 pages long. The EIS comes with 10 appendices.  The Department of the Interior did its homework. They weighed the costs and the benefits and made an informed decision. Now we are being asked just to ignore that scientific analysis and ram this road right through the refuge, despite knowing the damage it will do.  The consequences of a decision like that are known. They are not unintended. The road through an Alaskan wilderness is not justified. This particular road is not justified, and it is not necessary.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

4188,topic-id,432,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We have heard the argument, and we will repeatedly hear the argument that the road connecting King Cove to Cold Bay is needed for health and safety purposes. While it is true that the road will be used for medical emergencies, there is a lot of evidence pointing to another objective.                              {time}  1015  If you look at the decades-long effort to build this road, it becomes clear that there has always been a commercial purpose in mind. King Cove is home to one of the largest fish processing facilities, operated by Peter Pan Seafoods, a subsidiary of a Japanese company that is one of the largest seafood companies in the world.  Fishing is the backbone of the King Cove economy, and it has always been one of the reasons for the road. Let's look at the facts.  In 1994, the city of King Cove passed a resolution to emphasize the positive socioeconomic impacts of a 20-mile road linking King Cove to the Cold Bay The resolution did not mention any need to use the road for health or safety or for emergency situations of residents.  In 2005, the Aleutians East Borough participated in public scoping meetings and presented their vision for a hub airport for Cold This plan included cold storage capability for fish from King Cove and other communities awaiting air freight.  In 2010, as part of a Fish and Wildlife EIS for the land exchange we are debating today, an Aleutians East Borough assemblyman stated that Peter Pan Seafoods would use the road to transport fresh product.  And finally, on May 25 of this year, Alaska Governor Bill Walker sent a request to the Trump administration. He asked for: ``Access for isolated King Cove residents to the airport in Cold Bay in all weather conditions, enabling access to health services and the movement of goods and people between King Cove and Cold Bay.''  When you add all this up, the evidence is pretty convincing. Sure, the road will be used for emergency evacuations, but it will also be used to transport fresh product to Cold Bay to be sold throughout Asia and the rest of the world.  Despite language in the bill seeking to prohibit commercial use of the road, once it is built, this prohibition will be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to enforce. This is an incredibly remote area, and the Fish and Wildlife Service does not have the resources or staff capacity to police the use of the road.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

The claim is wrong because there is no evidence to back it up, and it is wrong because using this kind of over-the-top rhetoric is irresponsible.  We do not oppose this bill because we think animal life is more value than human life, and throwing accusations like that around on the House floor should be beneath all of us.  We do not have to rely on one Member's claim that the sky is falling. These concerns have been assessed for years through public process, and the conclusion was that there were viable alternatives that will address any legitimate public safety concerns.  People's lives do not hang in the balance. We can protect public health and the refuge if we abandon this bill and work together on a better solution.  This is, indeed, a remote area. That is why many of the residents choose to live there in the first place. They are fully accustomed to the challenges that come with living in the last frontier. To address these challenges, the Federal Government has appropriated tens of millions of dollars to this community for better medical and transportation facilities.  We have remote communities in Arizona, especially Tribal communities, that would surely appreciate $37.5 million to address their health and safety concerns as well.  The local government used some of that money to buy a hovercraft that could make the airport run much faster than this road will ever allow. The local community, not the Federal Government, elected to stop using the hovercraft. Surely, if people's lives were at stake, the local government would not have made that kind of a decision.  We have legitimate policy differences on this bill. The EIS has convinced many on our side that this is not a worthwhile proposal. Let's debate these findings calmly and rationally that would serve the public in this debate and look for a solution that both protects people's health and the refuge.[[Page H6124]]  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                              {time}  1030  ",CREC-2017-07-20-pt1-PgH6120.txt,1708,TRIBUTE TO RON HINDLE,2017.0,20.0,June

The American taxpayer has already provided the town of King Cove with a total of $37.5 million to improve transportation access and medical facilities in the area. That included $20 million to build a road, construct a dock, and purchase marine equipment.  Part of this money was used to purchase a $9 million hovercraft. This Federal funding was provided as an alternative to building a road through the Izembek National Wildlife The hovercraft worked as it was designed. It carried up to 49 passengers at a time, an ambulance, and even cargo, making the trip between King Cove and Cold Bay in 20 minutes--a trip that would take 2 hours on the proposed road when it is not shut down by extreme weather conditions.  After operating for 3 years and performing at least 30 medical evacuations, the local government stopped using the hovercraft. The Aleutians East Borough is now trying to sell the hovercraft on the open market for $5 million.  As we speak, House Republicans are seeking massive and dangerous cuts to spending on things like education, assistance to working families, and even Medicaid and Before we mandate construction of a road through congressionally designated wilderness, it is only fair that American taxpayers are reimbursed for Federal funding that was intended to avoid the construction required by this legislation.

PROHIBITION OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MEDICAL                    TREATMENT RELATED TO GENDER       Funds available to the Department of Defense may not be      used to provide medical treatment (other than mental health      treatment) related to gender transition to a person entitled      to medical care under chapter 55 of title 10, United States       The Acting Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentlewoman from Missouri (",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgH5790-2.txt,2032,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,13.0,June
3925,topic-id,363,"Mr.Chair, today, North Korea is plotting the next ballistic missile test, Russia is threatening the NATO alliance, ISIS is spreading evil, and China continues their expansion in the South China Sea in defiance of the international community.  Our military has never been in such high demand, yet our readiness to confront these threats is at a dismal level. We must confront these challenges by ensuring our defense dollars maximize the military's readiness and lethality.  That is why I am offering an amendment to advance these goals by prohibiting taxpayer dollars from funding gender reassignment surgeries and related hormone therapy treatment for members of the military and their dependants.  There are many problems with this policy, but funding transition surgeries with tax dollars is especially problematic because the surgery is very costly. Surgical recovery time decreases deployability of our soldiers, and there is lack of medical consensus on the effectiveness of gender transition treatments.  Funding transition surgeries means diverting money from other defense priorities. Surgical costs alone can top $1.3 billion over the next 10 years. These resources could fund 13 F-35 aircraft to fight near peer adversaries like China and Russia; 14 F-18 Super Hornets to fight ISIS; or 8 KC-46 tankers needed for long-range strike missions to North  Our spending priorities must match our threat mitigation priorities. We must have soldiers who can deploy if called upon.  Military members undergoing transition surgery are nondeployable for up to 267 days. Similarly, regular hormone treatments renders individuals nondeployable into the future. It makes no sense to create soldiers who are unable to fight and win our Nation's wars, and it is unfair to nontransitioned individuals who must leave their families and deploy in their place.  For all these reasons, Mr.Chair, I offer this amendment as a responsible member of the House Armed Services Committee who has studied the threats and heard from each servicemember about the need for increased funding and readiness.                              {time}  1645  Prohibiting funding for transition surgery is the right policy for our military, our budget, and it is the right policy for the American taxpayer.  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgH5790-2.txt,2032,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,13.0,June

This simply says that we are not going to have taxpayers pay for this surgery.  This is different than somebody going in and having a cold, because this is a major surgery that requires a medical diagnosis that is going to render someone nondeployable. Just the recovery from the surgery alone is 287 days, and then the ongoing treatment precludes them from certain abilities to serve overseas.  So we need to take a look at all of this and make sure that we are addressing the threats, and we are spending every dollar that we can to go after the threats.

4224,topic-id,835,"Thank you, Mr.                            Yucca Mountain  I rise today to once again speak out against the administration's proposal[[Page S3034]]to revive Yucca I know I have said it before, and I will say it again: Yucca Mountain is dead. Nevada will not be our Nation's nuclear waste dump.  I conveyed that message in my meeting with Secretary Perry during his confirmation and reiterated it ahead of his visit to Yucca in My former colleague, Senator Harry Reid, was a powerful and outspoken opponent of Yucca and worked hard to make sure the project did not see the light of day. Now I am standing between this administration and I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that I will be leading this fight.  This is a reckless proposal. Over the last 30 years, the Federal Government wasted billions of taxpayer dollars to design and permit Yucca Mountain, all without any signal that Nevada would consent to it. A State without a single nuclear power plant should not have to shoulder the entire Nation's nuclear waste burden. We will not be run over by the desires of other States that want to move the nuclear waste that they produce, that they create out of their own backyards and then put it into ours.  I will say it again: Nevada will not be our Nation's nuclear waste dump.  Last week's accident at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State serves as a chilling reminder of what Nevada could have to deal with at Yucca I was relieved that no one was harmed after the tunnel collapsed but believe it serves as a wake-up call to my colleagues.  We need to find a viable solution to our Nation's nuclear waste problem. In addition to the potential tragic loss of life, radiation exposure resulting from a similar event at Yucca Mountain could shatter Nevada's economy. This is not to mention the threat of transportation accidents along the proposed waste transportation routes.  What this means is that under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, we are looking at shipping 9,495 rail casks in 2,800 trains, and 2,650 trucks hauling one case each to Yucca Mountain over the next 50 years. If the capacity limit at Yucca is more than doubled as has been discussed with the Department of Energy, we would shift 21,909 rail casks in about 6,700 trains and 5,025 truck casks to Yucca  So I ask my colleagues: Do you really believe that over the span of the next 50 years there will not be a single transportation accident with an ensuing radiological release?  Under the DOE's proposal, these shipments would use 22,000 miles of railways, 7,000 miles of highways crossing over 44 States and the Tribal lands of at least 30 Native American Tribes, the District of Columbia, and 960 counties with a population of about 175 million people.  Between 10 and 12 million people live within the radiological region of influence for route shipments; that is, within one-half mile of these rail and highway routes. In effect, these rail and highway routes would impact most of the Nation's congressional districts, estimated at 330 districts.  For those who are not familiar with the West or Nevada, access to rail corridors or highways is often difficult because they are in such remote locations. If there were a spill or an accident, questions remain within the Department of Energy regarding their response time for emergency radiological exposure. This is not to mention the issue of private ownership of rail rights-of-way, making it uncertain who would even control accident sites.  What we do know is that the local communities would be the ones forced to suffer any type of long-term effects of radiation exposure. This is in a State that was home to our Nation's nuclear test site and the surrounding communities, which have suffered for years from resulting exposure.  I ask my colleagues: Should Nevada be forced to once more to shoulder this burden?  Secretary Perry, in response to last week's accident, acknowledged our Nation's problem with nuclear waste, saying that the nation could no longer kick the can down the road.  I do not believe that our Nation should continue to kick the can--or in this case the cask--down the road. We must find a long-term viable solution to our Nation's nuclear waste problem, one that is rooted in a consent-based siting.  I stand ready to work with my colleagues to make sure States have a voice in this process. Failure to do so will serve only to make this problem worse, risking future accidents similar to what we saw last week.  We can no longer afford to look backward at the failed proposals of the past and waste even more taxpayer dollars. Instead, we need to move forward on a real solution to a very real problem.

This bipartisan legislation will help mitigate an increasingly disturbing threat to safety of the traveling public.  Mr.Speaker, as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security, it is my duty to understand and respond to the ever-changing threat landscape facing our Nation's aviation sector, which is a critical component to both America's economic and national security. In February of this year, we released a telling report on airport insider threats, which painted a disturbing picture of security vulnerabilities and gaps in screening and access controls at airports across the country. Just 3 days after the release of our report, news broke of a massive drug smuggling ring between Puerto Rico and the continental United States involving both TSA and airport employees. This network of criminals exploited their access to secure areas of airports to smuggle an astounding 20 tons--or $100 million worth--of cocaine into the United States and into our own communities.  Another concerning example uncovered in our investigation throughout last Congress was when an airport employee offered to smuggle explosives on a passenger aircraft. Luckily, this individual was caught in a drug trafficking ring by the FBI and was arrested. However, we have seen multiple examples of aviation workers with access to secure areas of airports being involved in serious criminal activities, including terror plotting, after being radicalized.  We cannot allow these lapses in security to continue placing the traveling public at risk, and we must continue to work together like my brother across the aisle, Mr.Payne, with our partners in security in the aviation sector and at the Transportation Security After a number of insider threat-related attacks at airports overseas, along with plots here in the United States, it is essential that we act on this legislation.  This bill, if enacted, will enhance employee vetting requirements, improve procedures governing the way airports issue security credentials, and reform TSA's employee screening operations to be more targeted and effective. It will also provide policymakers with critical, previously unavailable data relating to the cost and feasibility of providing full employee screening at all domestic airports.  The insider threat is real, and it is our duty to ensure the Federal Government is taking every step possible to keep the traveling public safe.

3920,topic-id,553,"Mr.Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that would authorize the Secretary of Defense to make existing funds available from the Defense Health Program for collaboration with medical researchers and universities to address the growing number of tick-borne diseases through research and testing.  The Army Public Health Center has operated a basic tick testing program for nearly 30 years. Through this program, military personnel can assess tick identification services through military healthcare facilities at no charge.  However, the tests provided by this program are limited to only six tick-borne diseases, whereas the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Defense have now identified 16 of these tick-borne diseases, some of which can be fatal.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, around 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported each year. However, additional CDC research reveals the actual number of diagnoses could be as high as 300,000. And, alarmingly, nearly 20 percent of the people surveyed in areas with high incidence of Lyme disease were unaware that the disease was even a risk.  This issue is of particular concern in my region. According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, my district includes the counties with the five highest rates of Lyme disease in the Commonwealth, including Barnstable County, home of Joint Base Cape  However, my region is not alone on this issue. Ticks carrying dangerous diseases can be found in all corners of the continental United States, from Massachusetts in the north to Texas in the south, from Pennsylvania in the east to California in the west. Our servicemembers are especially vulnerable as they frequently are exposed to heavily tick-infested areas.  For example, The Powassan virus is a serious tick-borne illness known to cause encephalitis, meningitis, and even death. Multiple cases of Powassan have already been reported in Massachusetts this year, yet the DOD tick testing program does not even include a test for Powassan in their regimen.  Mr.Chair, I realize there is a concern that amendments to this legislation might lead to a Defense Health Program pushed beyond its capacity. That is not the case here. The military tick testing program already exists. This amendment would necessarily help the Department of Defense modernize the existing program to meet new challenges in the field of tick-borne diseases.  Indeed, the DOD's own website informs us that emerging tick-borne diseases are being discovered all the time and that yearly cases of known tick-borne diseases have been increasing steadily for years. We are fortunate to have experts already working to combat the rise in tick-borne disease.  My amendment would facilitate collaboration among these experts in DOD to test more tick samples for more diseases, meet the growing needs of our military, and ultimately lead to better healthcare outcomes.  Mr.Chairman, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr.Thompson, for joining me as a cosponsor in this amendment. Pennsylvania is among the States in the mid-Atlantic region experiencing drastic increases in the incidence of tick-borne illnesses.  And the hope is our efforts today on the floor and by the Secretary of Defense in the next fiscal year will help save lives.  Also, I thank Chairman Thornberry for his work on this important legislation as well.[[Page H5799]]  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

3923,topic-id,208,"Mr.Chairman, in my earlier remarks, I did associate myself with the chairman's concern that the Department of Defense, the Defense Health Program could be pushed beyond its capacity. It is very important to recognize what he recognized, because if it gets pushed too far, it can't accomplish the things that it is working to really address.  In this instance, as he mentioned, I believe I did distinguish the fact that this is nearly a three-decade program, and what we are doing here is making sure its mission is modernized so it is dealing with what is happening in the healthcare field within that area of tick-borne illnesses.  So I do appreciate the comments of the chairman, and I think it is wise to point that out. I do hope my colleague supports this amendment, because I have been able to distinguish that from this trend.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

We did this in 2013; we did it in 2015. It worked well. Such a deal would allow the Senate to provide appropriations bills that reflect our true, enduring values as a nation.  The Trump budget proposes over $1.7 trillion in cruel and unsustainable cuts to important mandatory programs that provide a safety net of health and nutrition programs to those who are struggling most in our communities. Can you imagine, in the wealthiest, most powerful Nation on Earth, we are going to cut out programs to help the people most in need?  Many of the cuts in the Trump budget come from the Medicaid Program, where the President doubles down on the dangerous programmatic changes and cuts included in the TrumpCare bill. Not only would enacting this budget make it harder for low-income families to receive health coverage through Medicaid, but the proposal also cuts nearly $6 billion from the Children's Health Insurance Program, which would force near-poverty children off health insurance.  I know in my own State of Vermont--it is not a wealthy State; it is a small But when we started a program to make sure children had healthcare, it was costly at first. In the long run, it saved us all a great deal of money. We were rated every year as the first or second healthiest State in the You have to have people healthy from the time they are children. You cannot suddenly say: Oh, we are going to spend a fortune when you are adults on illnesses that could have been taken care of when you were children.  The President's budget proposes significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which supports food assistance for individuals and families in need. How does the President expect to make America great again if there are hungry children in our schools? Every parent knows a hungry child cannot learn. How can we be the greatest country in the world if we do not offer a helping hand to the most vulnerable among us?  It has been and continues to be my goal that we complete the appropriations process in the Senate the way it is supposed to be done. Each of the 12 appropriations bills deserves debate and an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. All Republicans and Democrats vote for the things they support and vote against the things they oppose. That is in the best interest of this country, and I know Chairman Cochran shares this goal. As vice chairman, I will work with him to do this.  This budget is an obstacle and not a pathway to this goal. The President's budget proposal is not bipartisan. In fact, I am willing to bet that, if you put the President's budget on the floor today and asked for a vote up or down, even though the Republicans are in the majority in the Senate, it would not pass because it does not make a hint of a gesture toward true bipartisanship. The appropriations process works best when you have bipartisan cooperation. This budget is not in the best interest of the country or of the real priorities of the American people. That is why it would not get even enough Republican votes to pass. It is unbalanced, needlessly provocative, and appallingly shortsighted.  Rural America, including rural States like Vermont, is missing in action in the President's budget. His[[Page S3107]]budget eliminates key investments in rural communities and leaves them without Federal partnership support for everything from infrastructure development and affordable housing to programs that preserve the environment and provide food for the elderly.  It is a compilation of broken promises to working men and women and struggling families, and it frays the lifelines that help vulnerable families lift themselves into the middle class. This Vermonter does not find that acceptable, and I doubt others do.  Eliminating the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which we call LIHEAP, would leave thousands of Vermonters and thousands throughout this country out in the cold. The government should not be in the business of saying to families: OK, you have a choice. It is 10 degrees outside. You can either have heat, or you can eat. You can either have enough warmth so that you do not freeze to death, or you can have food so that you do not starve to death, but you cannot have both.  We are the most powerful, wealthy Nation on What a choice to force on people.  From LIHEAP, in my own State, Vermont received nearly $19 million to help more than 21,000 households in all 14 counties last year. This is a vital lifeline, and it is especially important in rural communities. We cannot slash investments in our rural communities.  We cannot abandon Federal support for cleaning up Lake Eliminating the Sea Grant and Geographic programs would be foolish, as it would waste the investments we have already made. It would mean that the money we have put in to clean our lake would end up being lost, and we would have to start all over again.  The large and dynamic ecosystem in Lake Champlain is the largest body of freshwater in the United States outside of the Great It borders Vermont, New York, and Canada and is a treasure, but we cannot stand still. We do not want it to become polluted like other bodies of water throughout our country. You either advance or you slip behind, and once you start slipping behind, it becomes an escalating matter.  The budget is full of cuts that advance the administration's antiscience, know-nothing-ism agenda. It eliminates thousands of scientists and shuts off funding for research into cures for everything from Alzheimer's to cancer. You cannot say to people who are trying to find a cure for cancer and so many other diseases: Oh, we are going to cut your money for a few years, turn everything off, send the scientists home, and maybe in a few years we might give you money again.  You cannot do that with medical research. The University of Vermont would lose millions of dollars for valuable research--research that you cannot pause and hope to resume. We are so close to finding a cure for most kinds of cancer, just as we did years ago with polio. Are we going to turn that off? Are we going to say to the American people: We want to have a sloganeering budget. When your grandchildren come along, maybe someday, somebody will restore this science and will find a cure for cancer.  This budget not only denies the reality of climate change, but it eliminates all of the Environmental Protection Agency's climate programs, from voluntary incentives to programs that seek to prevent further damage to public health and environmental quality. Climate change is very real, and we are at a critical moment. Now is not the time to turn back the progress we have been making.  The President has promised jobs, jobs, jobs. I would love to see jobs, jobs, jobs in this country, but under his budget, an estimated 4 million people, including veterans, would lose access to employment and training services next year. Four million Americans would lose that promise of a job. He would eliminate almost $4 billion from Pell grants. You do not create jobs by denying young people access to affordable higher education or by slashing job training.  Cutting the State Department's budget by more than 30 percent shows a clear lack of understanding of the vital role of soft power in our national security. The Secretary of Defense said: If you are going to cut the State Department's budget this way, you had better give me money to buy more bullets, because I am going to need them.  The budget would eliminate lifesaving nutrition programs. It would impede our ability to promote stability in increasingly volatile regions of the world. America is not made safer by failing to feed the hungry.  As Defense Secretary Mattis has said, soft power is fundamental to our national security, which has been said by Secretaries of Defense and military leaders in both Republican and Democratic administrations.  The Trump budget would have serious and harmful consequences for our economy, for working families, for those who are struggling, for our environment, for health, for the seed corn of cutting-edge scientific and technological research, and for our national security. This is foolish, and it is not acceptable. You do not turn these things on and off to make a sound bite. Sound bites do not make America strong, and sound bites do not continue the greatness of Tough choices keep America great and help the American people.  I would remind the White House that the power of the purse rests with As vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I intend to exercise that power, and I will work with Chairman Cochran in laying out a bipartisan path forward.  Mr.President, there are far too many illogical, arbitrary, and harmful cuts in spending and wholly unbalanced priorities in the President's proposed fiscal year 2018 budget to list at one time. I will have plenty more to say about that in the weeks and months ahead, but I do want to take a moment to highlight one, as it illustrates the foolhardy way this Administration has sought to appease right-wing ideologues rather than do what is truly in the national interest.  For fiscal year 2017, the Congress--Republicans and Democrats--agreed to appropriate $607.5 million for international family planning programs. Under our law, none of those funds can be used for abortion. They are for contraceptives and services like education and counseling to promote voluntary family planning in the world's poorest countries and, by doing so, to reduce reliance on abortion, reduce child mortality, improve maternal and child health, and increase opportunities for women and girls.  These programs have a long track record. There is abundant, indisputable data to show they are effective and they save lives, and they illustrate that, while we may have fundamental differences about whether women should have the right to abortion, there is broad agreement about the importance of family planning.  For fiscal year 2018, the Trump Administration proposes to eliminate funding for international family planning as a way to ``protect life.'' That may be an appealing sound bite, but that's all it is. For every $10 million reduction in funding for family planning and reproductive health programs, the data shows that approximately 440,000 fewer women and couples receive contraceptive services and supplies, resulting in 95,000 additional unintended pregnancies, including 44,000 more unplanned births, 38,000 more abortions, and 200 more pregnancy-related deaths.  How does that protect life? The evidence is overwhelming that the absence of family planning not only means more unsafe abortions but higher birth rates, 95 percent of which occur in the poorest countries that cannot feed or provide jobs for their people today.  I would say to the ideologues in the White House who think that the way to protect life is to cut off funding for family planning: They don't know what they are talking about. These are the same people who support vastly expanding the Mexico City Policy beyond President Ronald Reagan and both President George H.Bush and President George Bush, to all global health funding. In fact, they will be responsible for more abortions, higher rates of child mortality, higher rates of maternal death, and greater suffering.  This is a shocking proposal. They either don't realize how much harm and suffering it would cause, or they don't care. Can you imagine if our government, in addition to trying to outlaw abortion, tried to take away the contraceptives Americans rely on to prevent unwanted pregnancies? Tens of millions of Americans depend on access[[Page S3108]]to modern family planning services every day. The outcry would be immediate, and it would be deafening.  I am confident that the Congress will reject this unwise and cruel proposal. It would be unconstitutional in this country, and it should not be imposed on millions of impoverished people in the developing countries who depend on our assistance.  I would note the importance of it. We had a man whom I admired greatly in this body, a Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mark He was strongly anti-abortion but was an honest and good man who said that we had to have these family planning programs because without them, the number of abortions would skyrocket, that the number of deaths at birth would skyrocket, and that we would have higher birth rates, 95 percent of which would occur in the poorest countries that could not feed or provide jobs for their people.  Let's not do that again. Let's not make policy by sound bite. Let's make policy as to what is best for our country and that best respects the values of America--values that we have tried to demonstrate throughout the world. We also try to demonstrate that to our own country no matter where you are, whether you are Republican or Democrat or Independent, whether you are poor or rich, rural or urban. Let's work on what is the best for America, not on a budget that tries to polarize America and pits one group against another.  Mr.President, on this table I have on the floor, I note that it shows how we, at the Pentagon, have money to put into a border wall at the cost of the Department of Agriculture, clean energy, climate change, the environment, education, foreign aid, infrastructure, healthcare, the middle class, civil rights, labor unions, nutrition programs, child nutrition, and community investments. If we want to spend $40 billion on a wall that will make no sense and have the taxpayers pay for it--easy--let's vote it up or down. I do not think the American people want it. They would rather see that money be spent on programs that educate people, that create jobs, that improve science and find cures for cancer and others, not for a wall that we will pay for and that nobody else will pay for.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.

4101,topic-id,207,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his great work on this bill that would reauthorize a program that is critical to both American workers and businesses, and the future of our American economy.  I am continuously hearing from family-owned manufactures across my district, such as Atlas Tool and Die and ODM, that they cannot find workers with the skills they need to fill good-paying jobs. I hear this from companies also like Boeing, Intel, and At the same time, millions of Americans are struggling to find jobs, but they don't have the skills that they need.

As we work to move innovative technologies into the marketplace, we need a skilled workforce to build and implement them.

4126,topic-id,685,"Mr.Speaker, this Saturday marks the 2-year anniversary of the death of Kate Steinle, which was a tragedy for her family and for our entire community. My colleague from California has mentioned the murder of Officers Davis and Oliver, something that shook our northern California community.  These things are terrible, and I think we can agree that every Member of this House objects to, mourns, and is tremendously distressed and opposed to these criminal acts. But H.3004 is not the solution to prevent such tragedies.  The bill expands criminal sentences for illegal reentry offenses, but, as has been mentioned by the ranking member of the Rules Committee, the person charged in connection with Kate's death--I believe he is, in fact, the murderer--spent over 16 years in Federal prison. He was repeatedly deported. It didn't prevent his crime.  I think it is important to recall that we are not here writing bumper stickers. We are here writing laws. So we need to examine what is the current law and what is the proposal to change the current law.  The discussion I have heard seems to assume that there are no harsh penalties in law for people who reenter without inspection. Nothing could be further from the truth. Right now, there is a felony provision for attempts to reenter. There are criminal penalties for reentry of certain removed aliens. For example, if you are removed subsequent to a conviction for a commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against a person, or both, or a felony, there is a 10-year sentence. If you are removed subsequent to commission of an aggravated felony, it is a 20-year sentence, and on and on.  What does the bill do? It, for example, changes the 20-year sentence to a 25-year sentence. Well, you can argue whether that is wise or unwise. I personally think whether it is 20 or 25 is not going to be the major difference for a heinous criminal.  It also expands the definition of the misdemeanors that must be committed to entail these tremendous penalties. Right now, I mentioned it is penalties involving violence or drugs. This would just be garden-variety misdemeanors. If you were driving without a license, if you were loitering, that would count for the 10 years in Federal prison.  I don't think that those provisions are likely to make a material difference in the kinds of crimes that we all abhor, but there is something else that is in this bill that I think needs to be attended to. The bill's sponsor claims this targets immigrants with criminal convictions, but the reality is the bill mostly affects other people.  The bill, for the first time, would make it a criminal offense for an individual who was previously denied admission or ordered removed to seek to reenter the country legally, even if the individual has no criminal history, no history of repeated reentries. The bill does this by adding a definition to the term ``crosses the border'' that includes those who enter the country in ``official restraint.''  This small change means it would be a felony for a person who has been previously denied admission or previously removed to present themselves at a port of entry to request asylum, parole, admission, or another form of entry consistent with immigration laws. This is a drastic departure from current law.  Under current law, an individual can be prosecuted for illegal entry if they are trying to evade or intend to evade detection. If they are trying to sneak in, they get caught, we charge them with a crime. An individual who comes to a port of entry and voluntarily presents herself to an immigration officer to ask permission to enter the country legally has not committed a crime. This bill would change that.  Think about that for a minute. The bill makes it a crime to come to a port of entry not with the intent to enter the U.illegally, but to ask for a form of entry provided by the immigration laws.[[Page H5311]]  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

4128,topic-id,293,"In other words, this bill makes it a crime for someone to try to reenter legally.  If you are a victim of human trafficking and come to a port of entry to seek protection and, ultimately, a T visa, which the law allows, you would commit a crime under this bill. If your U.citizen relative is critically injured and you show up at the port to ask for humanitarian parole so you can donate blood or an organ to your U.citizen relative, you have committed a crime. In each of these cases, you can be prosecuted and put in jail for up to 2 years, even if you ultimately win your immigration case.  I also want to make a point about some of the other types of people this bill would affect.  According to the U.Sentencing Commission, at least half of all the individuals convicted of illegal entry under the current statute, which is the most common Federal prosecution in law today, were coming to reunite with their family in the United Half of them had at least one child living in the U.Two-thirds of the offenders had other family members--a spouse or others--they were trying to get back to.  So, in addition to the people who are trying to enter legally, this bill massively increases penalties on people who are trying to get back to their families, many of whom are U.citizens.  The desperation of these broken families is a direct result of our failed immigration policy. Hundreds of thousands of immigrant parents have been deported over the years, leaving their U.citizen children as orphans in the United These parents--and I understand it--are trying to get back to their kids.

The desperation that these families feel is a direct result of our inability to create a top-to-bottom reform of our immigration laws that allows families to be united, allows the economy to meet its needs, allows the crops to be picked legally. We have created this problem by failing to enforce our laws.  This bill doesn't solve the crime problem that we all care about. It creates new problems. It is not the answer to the terrible offenses that are at the name of it. In fact, those terrible crimes seem to me to be merely an excuse to expand deportation for the many, many people whose only offense is wanting to be near their families.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and to oppose this bill.  ",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgH5308-2.txt,701,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,29.0,July

4004,topic-id,2049,"Mr.President, last week, President Trump reportedly told several of our Republican colleagues that the House-passed version of TrumpCare's healthcare repeal of the Affordable Care Act was mean. This week, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that the President would like to see a healthcare bill from the Senate that ``has heart in it.'' What did we get? We got a bill from my Senate Republican colleagues that is identical to and in some cases even worse than the disastrous House-passed American Health Care Act that would rip coverage away from 23 million Americans and gut Medicaid by more than $800 billion.  Nothing changes the fact that this undemocratic, secretive process has resulted in legislation that is so mean-spirited, it would make the Wicked Witch of the West cringe. The Senate Republican bill will rip away economic security from young families, make grandma and grandpa pay more for health insurance simply because they are old, tear away coverage for opioid addiction patients desperate for treatment, and punish Americans with preexisting conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. For once, I agree with President This bill is mean.  Let's take a closer look about what is really inside of the Senate GOP's proposal on healthcare. Let's start by looking at the lower quality coverage. First, this bill will roll back the clock to the days before the Affordable Care Act, when an insurance card did not guarantee comprehensive coverage.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, there are certain things an insurance plan just has to cover--things like emergency services, maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health services. There is security in knowing that if you pay your premiums, this sort of basic minimum coverage is in place when you need it. But Republicans want to rip that away. They want to give States and insurance companies the option to not cover these things. This would make it so that a consumer could easily be faced with an unexpected medical bill for services they had assumed were covered with their healthcare plan.  Independent analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that out-of-pocket costs for maternity care or mental health or substance abuse disorder services could increase by thousands of dollars in a given year under That is not increasing quality, as President Trump promised; that is lower quality. And that just increases inequality between the healthy wealthy, who can pay out of pocket for their care, and providing lower quality coverage for everyone else. That is mean.  Second, an age tax. Since the Affordable Care Act became law, the uninsured rate for Americans ages 50 to 64 decreased by one-half. Those are the baby boomers, and it is estimated that more than 28 million of these baby boomers will develop Alzheimer's disease between now and the year 2050. This reduction in the uninsured rates came about because the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid and put protections in place to prevent insurers from charging exorbitant prices just because of age. But instead of caring for our family and friends as they age and ensuring they can afford quality coverage on what may be a dwindling income, TrumpCare punishes you for achieving your milestone 50th birthday.  Under the Republican healthcare proposal, insurance companies can charge older Americans five times more than younger Americans for the same coverage. That is unconscionable. It doesn't matter if you are a 50-year-old marathoner in the best shape of your life; you will still be paying at least five times more for your insurance than your 40-year-old neighbor who smokes. As a result, Americans over the age of 60 could see their premiums increase by an average of $3,200 or 22 percent. That might not sound like a lot to some people, but for those with decreasing incomes and fewer job opportunities, it is the difference between being able to eat and being kicked out on the street.  To add insult to injury, the subsidies in TrumpCare to help individuals purchase insurance are far less generous than what is currently available under the Affordable Care Because that will result in premiums that are higher, the tax credits will not keep pace to help pay for more expensive insurance, and, as a result, this age tax is going to be mean to those who are older in our country.  3, Medicaid cuts. Medicaid is a lifeline for families across our country. More than 70 million Americans--nearly half of whom are children--depend upon it. But it is clear that with TrumpCare's cuts to the program, Republicans want Medicaid to flatline. For a program that covers more than one-fifth of the Nation's population, including the sickest, the oldest, and the[[Page S3704]]poorest amongst us, Medicaid is especially irreplaceable.  But Republicans harbor an ancient animosity toward Republicans say that we need to restructure Medicaid's financing to help control the program spending and make it more efficient. That is just another way of saying to America's most vulnerable that you are just not as important as those who donate to our campaigns.  Raiding the Medicaid coffers achieves two goals. First, it tears holes in a critical social safety net for more than 70 million low-income and working-class Second, it provides the GOP with an open checkbook to pay back their donors with huge tax breaks.  Republicans might want to refer to these changes as capping the Medicaid program, but don't be fooled. What capping really means is decapitating access to primary care, decapitating the ability of grandma and grandpa to secure a nursing home bed, and decapitating access to treatment for substance abuse and mental health conditions. Gutting the Medicaid program--that is mean.  Next, they are going to reduce access to care. This one is simple. Less insurance coverage equals less access to care. While it is possible to get a doctor's appointment and treatment without health insurance, it is usually at prices that are impossible to afford for a typical uninsured person. Most working Americans can't conceive of paying more than $150 every time they want to visit a primary care doctor or footing the bill for a couple of thousand dollars in the event they need more specialized care. The best medicines and the most effective treatments are only as good as the insurance coverage people have to help them to access to it.  How will these 23 million Americans who lose insurance under TrumpCare get the care which they need? They will not get the care. Unfortunately, when patients do try to access care, it will be because their illness has progressed to the point where it can no longer be ignored. Instead of seeking care with a primary care doctor in a less expensive healthcare setting, most uninsured patients will end up going straight to the emergency room--the most expensive site for care. And the cost of that uninsured patient--well, that is just going to get absorbed by everyone else in our country, as our rates for treatment and insurance coverage increase to make up for this uncompensated care. So reduced access to care--that is mean.  Then we move on to higher premiums. Higher premiums are going to be the new rule in our country because that is going to be what happens if the Republicans are successful in repealing the Affordable Care According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, TrumpCare would increase premiums by an average of 20 percent in 2018. In Massachusetts alone, premiums for next year could increase by $600, threatening coverage for more than 180,000 of my constituents with private insurance. Because of everything else in TrumpCare, even though you are paying more, you will be getting less. It is like paying for a Cadillac, but only getting a tricycle. This will only prevent Americans from securing access to the care and the treatment they need and they deserve. Less care for more cost--that is going to be mean. Premiums are going to go up for everyone.  Finally, it threatens all of those in America who have preexisting conditions. For so many Americans, allowing insurance companies to refuse coverage or charge more because of a preexisting condition is inhumane, and it is immoral. Anyone who tried to buy individual health insurance before the Affordable Care Act remembers this problem. Before the healthcare act passed, in most States, if you had a preexisting condition, you could either be denied coverage, charged a much higher premium, or forced to wait potentially for years before receiving treatment for the condition to be covered. For many people, this meant they either had to go without needed care or spend their entire savings. For those with the most serious conditions, it was the difference between life and death.  The anxiety of suffering from an illness was only exacerbated by financial insecurity. It was a cruel and unusual form of punishment. Sadly, the Republicans want to take us back to this era. Threatening preexisting conditions--that might be the meanest of them all because protections for families who have preexisting conditions is something that goes right to the heart of what the Affordable Care Act provided as a protection.  Why would millions of Americans have to suffer these cruelties, these indignities, these punishments? That is the most outrageous part of all of this. President Trump and the congressional Republicans are proposing this healthcare heartlessness, all so they can give tax breaks to the wealthiest in our country.  We heard it from President Trump himself last night when he talked about the people he hired for his ``I just don't want a poor person,'' he said. But who does he want running the government and our economy? He wants the wealthiest people in He wants people who are billionaires to be making the decisions as to how we run our economy. President Trump has in place a goal of turning over to the richest people in our country the responsibility for putting together the plan to cut the programs for the poor and the working families in our country.  The Republicans and their wealthy planners have put together a very simple one-step program: The rich get richer, and the rest get sicker in the United Make no mistake, this healthcare plan is of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. It is giving billions in tax breaks to people who don't need or deserve them, paid for by people who can't handle or afford it. That is cruel, that is inhumane, that is immoral, that is just plain wrong, and my Democratic colleagues and I will not stand for it.  We are standing up to say no to ripping away coverage for millions of We are raising our voices to say no to increasing costs for middle-class families. We are saying here today that we are going to say no to this legislative malpractice. The health of the American public is too important for us to be so mean, so callous to the people we were elected to serve.  This Republican proposal has never been about policy. It has always been about politics, and it is time to stop playing political games with people's lives, with people's healthcare.  Healthcare is a right and not a privilege. That is the promise we made to the American people with the Affordable Care Act, and it is a promise we must keep.  The President is keeping his promise to the rich in our country. They have now written a healthcare plan for one-sixth of our economy that slashes $800 billion that would be used for the poor, for the sick, for the working class, for senior citizens in nursing homes by $800 billion in order to give an $800 billion tax break to the wealthiest people in our country. That is wrong.  This is a critical moment in our country's history, and we, as Democrats, are going to battle every single day here on the Senate floor and across this country to make sure that every person understands what the consequences of this incredibly callous, mean bill will mean--lower quality coverage, an age tax on the elderly, Medicaid cuts that hurt families across our country, reduced access to care, threatening of the protections for preexisting conditions, and resulting in higher premiums for everyone.

4161,topic-id,740,"Mr.President, I thank my friend and colleague Senator Wyden for submitting this resolution. I am proud to partner with him as we address this senseless, deadly attack that occurred back home in Oregon just 12 days ago.  Robert Kennedy once said: ``We must recognize that this short life can neither be ennobled or enriched by hatred.'' We have been reminded of that in this part of our history in the last year and a half in which we have seen acts of hatred flourishing across the country, preying on divisions among parts of our society. It is incumbent on all of us to call out the unacceptability of hate speech and certainly to work to bring unity where there has been division.  This all came together in dramatic, deadly fashion on the MAX train when a man spouting hatred and anti-Muslim rhetoric accosted two young women sitting on the train. Three men stood up and sprang into action and told him that was unacceptable.  I wish we could turn back the clock and have the incident stop right there with that intervention. These men, by being willing to stand up in that setting, are champions of justice. They were saying that this is unacceptable. They were saying that it must stop. But then this confrontation turned deadly, with the man spouting the hate speech pulling a knife, stabbing all three of these champions, killing two of them, and nearly killing the third. These individuals, Rick Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, paid with their lives. The third individual, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, came very close to losing his as well.  We have been holding the families in our hearts and in our prayers. The community came together and had a vigil and another ceremony at the Muslim educational center and at the funerals to let the families know that, across Oregon, people are carrying them in their hearts and prayers. Certainly, one of those prayers was for the full recovery of Micah David-Cole He is back on his feet, and it is just a beautiful thing to see that he is out of the hospital. He spoke very eloquent words that I would like to share with you. In the days after the attack, he said:       I want you to imagine that for a second, being the little      girl on that This man is screaming at you. His face is a      pile of knives, his body is a gun, everything about him is      cocked, loaded and ready to kill you. There's a history here      with this. You can feel that this has happened before. And      the only thing that was different was the names and faces.  Micah continued. He said:       And then a stranger, two strangers, three strangers, come      to your aid, they try to help you, and that pile of knives      just throws itself at them. Kills them.  Well, this was an extraordinarily traumatic experience for these young girls simply to be accosted on the train and all the more so to see that those who came to their rescue were stabbed, with two of them dying and the third badly injured.  Our hearts are, again, so connected to the families. We must have a determination as a society to put healing where there has been division, to put empathy where there has been antipathy, to replace hatred with a connection, with a love.  Robert Kennedy said in that same speech when he was commenting on the fact that nothing has ever been ennobled or enriched by hatred--he continued to say this:       But we can perhaps remember--if only for a time--that those      who live with us are our brothers, that they share with us      the same short moment of life, that they seek--as do we--     nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and      in happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment that      they can.  Can't we come together as a society and enable each person to be able to live out their lives in purpose and happiness and set aside this divisiveness and this hatred?  I hope on this occasion, as we honor the incredible heroism of the three men who sprang into action and as we mourn the loss of two of them, that we all will dedicate ourselves to this purpose of creating a connection, creating unity, and creating respect and that we shall see the banishment of hate speech and hate violence.

4226,topic-id,3699,"Mr.President, the most important words in our Constitution are the first three words ``We the People,'' written in beautiful script and written many times larger than the rest of the document so that even if you are across the room, you know what this Constitution stands for--not a government by and for the powerful, not a government by and for the privileged, but as President Lincoln so eloquently said in his Gettysburg Address, a ``government of the people, by the people, and for the people.''  As a ``we the people'' nation, we adhere to a core set of principles that have guided us through good times as well as in dark moments. One of those key principles is the rule of law, that we are a nation in which not only is there the rule of law but in which no one is above the law.  If we walked out of this Chamber right now, proceeded through the double doorways, and down the steps of the Capitol, we would be staring at the beautiful building of the Supreme The entire building symbolizes the role of justice in our society. As you look at that magnificent Supreme Court--the broad, marble steps leading up to the door--you see these simple words inscribed above: ``Equal justice under the law.'' It is right there. You can almost see it from where I am standing now: ``Equal justice under the law.'' That is the principle that is part of the ethic of every courthouse in America--from the smallest, most rural courthouse to the big city courthouse square. We see those same principles personified as Lady There she is, holding the scales, blindfolded so as to make sure everyone is treated equally.  Yet, over the past few months, we have been in a period in which we have been staring into the abyss of a constitutional crisis because this very core principle of ``no one is above the law'' and ``equal justice under the law'' has been under assault.  We have a President whose campaign team is under investigation because of substantial information that suggests the possibility of coordination and collaboration with Russia to change the outcome of the Presidential election--an assault on one of the most fundamental premises of a free society; that of free and equal elections.  We have a President who gave code-word classified information to an adversary--Russia--just a few days ago. We have confidential information, we have secret information, we have top secret information, and we have code-word information at the very top. These are the most sensitive secrets of the American Government, and our President gave that information to If anyone else did that, he would be facing criminal charges.  We have a President who sought to shut down an investigation into one of his former team members--retired LTG Michael We know Lieutenant General Flynn was in contact with Russian officials, and he was fired for lying about it. President Trump fired the head of the FBI because he would not drop the investigation into General Flynn's Russian connections and conduct.  We have a President, President Trump, who asked his Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General to develop a cover story to tell the American people the reason he fired the Director of the FBI, which is that he was upset about the Director of the FBI's treatment of his former Presidential opponent, Hillary  If anyone believes the President woke up in the middle of the night and[[Page S3035]]decided to fire the Director of the FBI because he was concerned about the way Hillary Clinton was treated, then you have not been paying attention this last year and a half.  Now, if in the course of an investigation it is found that members of the Trump campaign coordinated or collaborated with the Russians to undermine the integrity of our elections, then that is treasonous conduct. If the President asked for, encouraged, or knew about such activity, then he would be party to such treasonous conduct. If the President used his office to attempt to shut down either the investigation of Michael Flynn or the investigation into the collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russians, then that obstruction is potentially a serious crime of obstruction of justice, and it has to be fully pursued. If the President fired his former FBI Director in order to slow down or shut down these investigations, then that compiles the evidence of obstruction of justice.  These sets of facts point to serious misconduct. We have to fully investigate whether there was, in fact, such misconduct. That is why, for more than 3 months--going back to February 15 and Michael Flynn's resignation--I have been calling for a special prosecutor to conduct a thorough, impartial investigation into these matters. Over these 3 months, the case for why we need an independent special prosecutor has only grown stronger with each new event, each new story, each new piece of evidence.  If there were any lingering doubt about the need for a special prosecutor, that doubt was washed away last week when President Trump fired Director Comey for pursuing the investigation into the ties between the Trump campaign and That is why many of my colleagues and countless Americans all across the country stood up and demanded that no nominee fill Director Comey's shoes unless a special prosecutor had been appointed. So I was very pleased when last night Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein appointed such a special prosecutor.  Now, he will be coming to this Chamber to speak with us in a short period of time, later this afternoon. But whatever else transpired, stepping up and appointing that special prosecutor was the right thing to do. He announced the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel--the words ``special counsel'' and ``special prosecutor'' are largely interchangeable--with wide-ranging authority to conduct a thorough and independent investigation into ``any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and, any matters that arose or may arise from the investigation; and, any other matters within the scope of the investigation.''  Last night's announcement was a tremendous victory for justice--the principle of justice. It was a tremendous victory for a country with the rule of law. It was a tremendous victory for the principle that no individual is above the law in the United States of  We need to have confidence that there will be a robust investigation to get to the truth, no matter where that leads us. Certainly, our confidence has been improved by the appointment of the special prosecutor last night--and not just any individual, but an individual qualified and respected to lead such an investigation.  For 12 years, from just before the September 11, 2001, attacks and right through 2013, this man, Robert Mueller, led the He led it for the second longest period in U.history. He led it for 2 years more than the standard term for the head of the He is known as a thorough, by-the-book prosecutor who can't be influenced or intimidated, and I have every faith that he will conduct a professional, robust, and thorough investigation and give the American people the answers to all of these issues.  But as we applaud this strong movement toward justice, to truth, and to accountability, this strong stride in support of our ``we the people'' democratic Republic, we cannot rest. We need to make sure that Mr.Mueller, as a special prosecutor, gets every resource he needs to aggressively pursue justice and the complete independence he needs to undertake this incredibly important task.  At the same time, we have to keep pressing here in the Senate, encouraging our Intelligence Committee, as well as the House Intelligence Committee, to aggressively pursue information. We cannot cede our obligation to represent and fight for the best interests of the American people or for our ``we the people'' Nation, and that includes speaking truth to power and holding our leaders accountable for their actions.  Mr.Mueller will have, as I noted, wide-ranging authority to conduct his investigation. His investigation and the investigation here in the Senate by the Senate Intelligence Committee will be looking at a number of connections that have occurred over the course of this last year and a half.  Now, we know a lot about what the Russians did to hack the American Presidential election. The intelligence community told us in a report this past January that, with ``high confidence'' Russian President Vladimir Putin ``ordered and influenced the campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.presidential election'' and that he did so in order to ``undermine public faith in the U.democratic process, denigrate [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.''  The report goes on to say that the Russian Government ``aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.''  We know many of the elements of this aggressive Russian campaign. They used the resource ``Russia Today'' to spread fake news stories, to develop those stories, and to publicize those stories. They hired thousands of internet trolls to comment in social media on the affairs in America, as if they were Americans weighing in. They proceeded to hack the DNC, or the Democratic National Committee, files and the Clinton campaign files, and they released damaging documents from those hacks. They used bots; that is, remote computers instructed by code that was placed onto those computers to weigh in on social media as if they were people weighing in. So we had thousands of machines weighing in with comments as if they were individuals weighing in. Why did they do that? To take the fake news story and proceed to amplify it with comments from thousands of trolls and, probably, tens of thousands of bots, in order to get those issues trending so they would appear in the everyday news that Americans see. We are talking about a massive campaign of interference in the Presidential election.  What we need to know is whether anyone on the Trump campaign was connected, in any possible way, to these activities. To find that out, we have to investigate the growing web of connections between members of the Trump campaign and  Just consider some of the connections that have been explored already in the press. One individual is Carter Page, who served as President Trump's foreign policy adviser on the campaign trail. Mr.Page lived in Russia for 3 years while working for Merrill He participated in several deals during his time there with Gazprom, the Kremlin-owned energy giant whose chairman was Vladimir Putin's deputy while Prime  He became friendly and emailed back and forth for months with Victor Podobnyy, a Russian spy who was recorded on tape saying he was trying to recruit  Last year, while employed as a member of the Trump campaign, Mr.Page traveled to Moscow to deliver a speech bashing U.policy toward Russia, saying: ``Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.''  Then there is Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the President's campaign. He was hired to manage the Republican Convention and to wrangle delegates, but he was promoted to campaign chairman and chief strategist, until he resigned because of his questionable foreign dealings.  From 2004 until 2014, Manafort worked as an adviser to the Ukrainian President, Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian strongman who, over the years, adopted policies that moved his country away from the European[[Page S3036]]Union and closer to Manafort is regularly credited with helping Yanukovych win the Presidency in 2010.  In 2014, a revolution rose up against Yanukovych, and he was ousted from power. He now lives in exile in But Mr.Manafort continued working in Ukraine, helping rebrand the former President's Party of Regions as an opposition party, mostly from eastern Ukraine, which advocates for stronger relations with  Then, we have Roger Stone, President Trump's longtime ally, friend, and adviser since they first met back in 1979. That is three-plus decades. Ironically, it was Mr.Stone who introduced Donald Trump to former President Richard Nixon back in the 1980s, and there are stories in the media that Mr.Stone pressured the President to fire Director  Over the years, Mr.Stone has appeared many times in Russia Today, the Kremlin's English language news network that developed and publicized fake news stories during last year's Presidential election.  In his appearances, Mr.Stone regularly criticized the U.intelligence community, he attacked our media, he attacked our free press, he praised Russia and its policies, and he even praised WikiLeaks--the organization responsible for releasing massive amounts of confidential and damaging documents about our Nation's intelligence services and capabilities.  More than that, Mr.Stone has bragged about his communications with hackers--hackers like Guccifer 2.0. And who is Guccifer 2.0? The individual responsible for hacking the DNC and releasing emails during the campaign.  Another person whose connections to both the Trump campaign and Russia will be looked at is our former colleague and now our Attorney During the course of his confirmation hearings, Mr.Sessions misled fellow Senators about his interactions with Russian officials. When asked what he would do as Attorney General if he learned that anyone connected with the Trump campaign had communicated with the Russian Government, he said:       I'm not aware of any of those activities . . . I have been      called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I      did not have communications with the  But he did have communications, meeting with Russian Ambassador Kislyak on two separate occasions last year.  Then, we have Michael Flynn, a very major part of the connections between the Trump campaign and Russia--a retired lieutenant general and appointed to be National Security Advisor by President He was intimately involved in the series of events that led us to yesterday, with the appointment of a special prosecutor.  Beginning in February 2016, General Flynn served as an adviser to the Trump campaign, and he was even considered as a potential running mate for President As we know, he followed President Trump into the White House as National Security But as I noted before, that role was short-lived, as his Russian connections came to light.  Back in 2015, he was paid to attend a 10th anniversary gala for Russian TV and sat at a table with Mr.He didn't disclose this on his security forms.  During the Trump administration's transition, he talked with Ambassador Kislyak by phone, including one call on the very day that President Obama ordered sanctions against Russia as punishment. Punishment for what? Punishment for interfering with the American election.  When that information was discovered, the White House contended that General Flynn's conversations with the Russian Ambassador were nothing more than ironing out logistics for an eventual call between the President and Vladimir  Even Vice President Pence went on the record defending Flynn, telling CBS News that the two ``did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.''  But General Flynn's conversation with the Ambassador was picked up during routine surveillance of the Russian And what were they discussing? They were discussing the sanctions President Obama was placing on Why did he place those sanctions? Because of Russian interference in the election.  Acting Attorney General Sally Yates made it known that she warned the White House that Flynn was lying to the Vice President and that he was compromised. She met twice with Dan McGahn, the White House Counsel, to warn him about But in exchange for making sure the White House knew about the fact that the National Security Advisor was compromised and then lied to the Vice President, she was fired--fired by the  Eighteen days after Sally Yates' warning, Michael Flynn resigned, after the Washington Post revealed that he had, in fact, discussed sanctions with Ambassador  Now, according to his lawyer, ``General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it.''  Well, I hope, as the Senate Intelligence Committee and as the special prosecutor pursue the investigations, that he will have every chance to tell it and will tell it with a fullness and an accuracy that will be complete.  That is the web of visible connections we already know about, and they suggest the possibility of coordination, consultation, and collaboration with the Russians to influence the American elections. We have to get to the bottom of whether, in fact, that is the case. Did it go beyond a series of conversations to actual coordination, consultation, and collaboration? This is what we need to know.  Now, the President says that there is no ``there,'' there. That is why we need an investigation, in order to find out. The President has called this a witch hunt. An investigation, I would convey to President Trump, is not a witch hunt. An investigation is pursuit of the truth. An investigation is in the highest tradition of equal justice for all.  A very large development, as we all now know, occurred last week with the firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the Bureau's investigation into these matters. Director Comey confirmed while testifying in the House on March 20 that the FBI was, in fact, conducting an investigation into Trump's campaign--something we now know really bothered the But at the outset, the President's White House claimed that Comey's firing was about the Director's handling of the Clinton email investigations, not because of the Russia investigation. That story on its face caused eyebrows to raise across the country. Did people really believe the President woke up and was determined to right a wrong because the FBI Director had unfairly treated Hillary Clinton? Yet he asked his team to develop this story to share it with the American people. He asked his team--his Attorney General and his Deputy Attorney General--to essentially put out a story to mislead the American people. That in itself deeply damages the integrity of the White  This cover story also claimed that Comey was fired because he lost the trust of the rank-and-file FBI agents. Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe came to the Hill to testify before the Intelligence Committee last week, and he conveyed that this is simply not true.  The cover story also involved Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein being the instigator of the firing by preparing this memo on his own and recommending it to the That also turned out to be a part of the deception, and the President himself made that clear, taking responsibility that it was his decision to fire, not a decision based on a recommendation that came from  In an NBC News interview with Lester Holt, President Trump admitted that he ``was going to fire regardless of recommendation'' and that he was thinking of ``this Russia thing,'' as he called it--``this Russia thing''--when he finally decided to fire the He also told Lester Holt that he had asked Director Comey three times whether he himself was under investigation. The President admitted on camera to the American people that he fired the man in charge of the investigation against his campaign because he was frustrated that the investigation was still going on.  The American people received reports subsequently that the President[[Page S3037]]had asked Director Comey to pledge his loyalty to the This is news report of the memo that Director Comey wrote after meeting with the We find that the FBI Director is not going to be loyal to anyone but Lady  The President had the audacity to publicly threaten Director Comey after firing him. ``James Comey,'' said the President, ``better hope there are no `tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!''  Attempting to intimidate future statements and possible statements in an investigation after a person has been fired is another factor that is totally inappropriate. Everyone with any shred of common sense knows such intimidation is inappropriate, but in the context of a criminal investigation, it may be more than inappropriate.  We don't know if there actually were tapes. Our Intelligence Committee has requested the memos Director Comey wrote on his various conversations with the Remember, this is an experienced, seasoned FBI agent-turned-Director who has spent his life documenting conversations. It is considered to be a high level of integrity when such information is recorded in this fashion. Those memos carry a lot of weight. Some are classified, some are unclassified. They need to be provided immediately to the Senate Intelligence Committee, and if they aren't provided, then the Intelligence Committee needs to subpoena them and needs to subpoena the tapes. If they exist, they need to be delivered. If they are not tapes but they are transcripts, they need to be delivered. If they are not tapes but a thumb drive or they exist on a piece of hardware, they need to be delivered, and our special prosecutor, Mr.Mueller, needs to have them as well.  I think that as one steps back from this incredible amount of information--the information about how Russia hacked the campaign, not just hacking into the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign but then releasing that information in strategic moments; hiring a thousand individuals to comment in social media as if they were American citizens; establishing a botnet of computers to weigh in as if they were people to amplify this false social media, to get it trending and to get it into the mainstream news--when we consider all of this, we know how terribly wrong it was, and we have to learn every piece about what went on in order to make sure we are in the best prepared way to stop it from ever happening again.  We need to make sure we are in the best possible place to ensure that we can assist other democratic republics in making sure they are not victims of the We need to make sure that if any American, no matter who he or she is, collaborated or coordinated with the Russians in this effort to hack our campaigns, that they are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

As even Republicans are pointing out, there has not been a single hearing, no robust debate, no opportunity for the people who will really suffer under this bill to see exactly how bad it would be.  This disastrous TrumpCare bill deserves full scrutiny under an open process, like the process that Democrats conducted when we passed the Affordable Care We held hearings, we took amendments from both sides, and we certainly didn't leave the fate of women's healthcare up to a few Republican men.  Senate Republicans are right to be ashamed of this mean and heartless legislation. Just like the House TrumpCare bill, it will increase premiums, it will undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions, it will defund Planned Parenthood, and it will allow insurance companies--insurance companies--to charge women more. It is going to gut It will take away care for our seniors, pregnant women, people with disabilities, and it will take health insurance coverage away from millions of people across the country--and for what? To give another massive tax cut to the wealthy and well-connected.  I would be ashamed, too, if I had to defend a bill that is cruel. I can certainly understand why Republican leaders do not want to give people time to see what is in this bill and why they don't even want to give their own Members time to see how much their constituents hate it, but that is the bed Senate Republicans have now made.

Selectively denying healthcare to trans servicemembers, which is available to other members of the military, only serves to alienate, undermine, disrespect and ultimately harm those serving our country.  This amendment is a shameful and targeted attempt to enact a conservative agenda that singles out transgender individuals. It circumvents, our military's doctors and uses the denial of healthcare to force currently serving, and future transgender members of our armed services from their posts entirely.  Transition related care is considered medically necessary by nearly every major medical association. It should not need to be said that when a military physician determines that hormones, surgery or other transition related care is necessary, we must treat it as we would any other medical care. Anything less is an abdication of our duty to provide healthcare to those who have chosen to serve our country.  Using finances to tie the hands of our military's medical professionals to target transgender individuals demonstrates an appalling lack of respect for our servicemembers, their doctors and the democratic ideals of equality our country was founded on.

Mr.Chairman, I come here today to speak in opposition to the amendment, one that would hurt the local economy, devalue workers' pay, and take a very important tool out of the toolbox for both Republicans, Democrats, and  Almost 100 years ago, two Republican Congressmen, James Davis and Robert Bacon, realized there was a problem with Federal contracts. Those contracts were unfair to the local economies. So in 1931, Congress unanimously approved Davis-Bacon prevailing wage. It ensures that construction workers are paid the same as construction workers in that local community.  The prevailing wage is based on surveys of local wages and benefits, not whether there is a union or not. It keeps the community vibrant, and it takes into account those things that happened in that local community. So when you hear the term ``if it ain't[[Page H5796]]broke don't fix it,'' this is a classic example.  They are trying to talk about surveys and methodologies. Quite frankly, this system has worked for over 80 years. They are talking about technicalities, but the fact of the matter is this is about cutting wages in your local community. Why would you ever want to go back and say, I want to hurt the people I represent? But apparently that seems to be what we are doing.  So we want to make sure that local workers are paid a fair wage.

I have listened to the response, perhaps, to that. Are you impugning through the Chair the record of Democrats on fulfilling our oath of office, the first part of which is to defend America from within and from without?  That is the oath of office. As co-chairman of law enforcement in the Congress of the United States for over 14 years, I am very close to the law enforcement community.  I think we ought to hesitate a second before we start pointing fingers. We are good at it, all of us, on both sides.  While we are doing that, most of our constituents are concerned about how to defend middle class jobs and bolster our manufacturing base. The majority of Americans agree that keeping U.jobs from moving overseas should be a top priority. Yet, despite the empty promises made by this President, the flow of jobs overseas has not stopped.  Mr.Speaker, the administration had awarded government contracts to companies that continue to offshore jobs. This is worse than empty words. These are the facts.  In fact, we use our tax money to help those corporations go offshore. I hope that makes you feel really good.

Mr.Speaker, last month, the Transportation Security Administration issued a directive prohibiting travelers flying out of 10 airports in eight countries from carrying laptops and other large electronic devices aboard airplanes. That decision was informed by intelligence that ISIS and other terrorist organizations may have developed innovative ways to plant explosives in electronic devices that TSA may not be able to detect. This swift action highlights the importance of TSA's being able to adapt quickly in response to the ever-evolving terrorist threat landscape.  Here, in the United States, we have been fortunate that there has never been a case where an airport worker has exploited their position to carry out a deadly attack on an airport, but we have seen such incidents abroad.  Accordingly, Congress has given particular attention to the airport insider threat risk, and, in the 114th Congress, we enacted measures to enhance access controls at airports and improve security vetting for airport workers.                              {time}  1715  Today, we consider H.876, a bill that seeks to address this risk by requiring TSA to carry out a cost and feasibility study of incorporating new approaches to bolster access controls to a diverse range of airports.  In an effort to help airports better understand the effectiveness of their current airport worker screening systems, the measure also directs TSA to increase covert testing of such systems.  One feature of the bill that I want to highlight is a provision targeted at fostering greater vigilance and awareness among airport workers regarding the insider threat risk.  Specifically, it directs TSA to work with airport operators, air carriers, and unions to develop insider threat security awareness training for airport workers within 180 days of enactment of the bill.

In that vein, my goal with this amendment is to prioritize those limited defense resources on efforts that pose an immediate and direct threat to our national security.

Our country is facing direct threats from a myriad of sources, including Islamic extremists: ISIS, al-Qaida, the[[Page H5794]]Taliban, Abu The alphabet soup of names in that regard is continuous and unrelenting: North Korea, China, Iran, Russia, even in space.

We know that. We also don't need Congress to tell us to report the issues that we might have in defending the Nation to the Congress or to the  We know our duty, and we will do our duty. If we have issues that need to be reported--whether it is sea level rise or the enemy has a new weapon or we can't feed our troops or what have you--we will report it, and we will resolve it. We don't need people in Washington, D.C., telling us how to run the war. That is our job. That is the military's job.  This amendment simply says that we ought to prioritize that. We ought to let them prioritize that. We ought to let combatant commanders--we ought to let the men and women who wear the uniform and defend our country focus on the enemy. If the enemy, indeed, is climate change, then they will focus on that as well, and they will submit information so that we can make decisions.  The point is, should somebody--should all of us in this uniform in Washington, D.C.--be telling the fine men and women in uniform across the globe defending our country that we know better? That is exactly what I am trying to avoid here.  Little by little, drip by drip, we have watched our Nation's and military's focus eroded--this and that. Believe me. I have filled out the reports. As an officer, I have filled out a whole bunch of reports on a regular basis that have nothing to do with completing the mission of securing our Nation and defeating the enemy--nothing to do with it. This is just one in the long line of them.  My only goal is to send this to where it needs to be--the agencies best adapted to deal with it and take it out of the agencies that shouldn't be dealing with it and should be dealing with securing our Nation and fighting the enemy.

3874,topic-id,292,"Mr.Chairman, I am opposed to this amendment, which would unnecessarily tie the hands of our military as it seeks to diversify its energy supply.  The Pentagon is pursuing alternative energy not because they are some kind of tree hugger, but because the diversity of energy options improves mission capabilities and saves lives.  Just because the price of oil is low today doesn't mean it won't spike tomorrow and force military leaders to divert resources away from mission priorities. In some cases, this has meant turning ships around and cutting their voyages short because of budgeting issues around fuel.  This is of particular concern as we continue the fight against ISIS while pivoting towards the The Pacific Ocean has an area of 64 million miles. It includes hotspots like the South China Sea and North Korea, whose recent aggression threatens the region and our security.  As we ask our military leaders to respond to threats at a moment's notice, they need the flexibility that comes with alternative energy sources. But you don't need to just hear that from me. That is the position of General Mattis at the Department of Defense, who opposes this amendment.  My colleagues on the other side are going to say that this is merely about choosing the most cost-effective option, but this amendment would place an undue burden on DOD procurement managers to track all subsidies and credits for fuel. It doesn't include a waiver for national security considerations or increasing combat effectiveness, and it would inhibit innovations that increase readiness and save lives.  A 21st century military with the capability to counter new and dynamic threats cannot be powered solely by the energy sources of yesterday.

Bases in the region I represent in San Diego--which is home to the largest concentration of military forces in the world--are already facing challenges from sea level rise, drought, and reliable energy sources.  For years, the most decorated military leaders in our country have been telling us that climate change is a national security threat. Congress cannot afford to make this debate about politics or ideology.  We don't have to agree on what causes climate change. We only have to agree with our military leaders that the effects of climate change are altering the security environment and the threats we face.

3962,topic-id,473,"Mr.President, we are beginning to receive the first bits of information about the Senate Republican healthcare bill, which has until now been shrouded in absolute secrecy.  I can see why. Even as we continue to get more details, the broad outlines are clear. This is a bill designed to strip away healthcare benefits and protections from Americans who need it most in order to give a tax break to the folks who need it least.  This is a bill that would end Medicaid as we know it, rolling back Medicaid expansion, cutting Federal support for the program even more than the House bill, which cut Medicaid by $800 billion.  Let me remind everyone in this Chamber, Medicaid is not just a health insurance program for Americans struggling in poverty, though that is an important and necessary part of it. Medicaid is increasingly a middle-class program. Medicaid is how many Americans are able to access opioid abuse treatment, Medicaid foots the bill for two-thirds of all Americans living in nursing homes, and Medicaid provides the cushion, particularly in rural areas, so hospitals can survive and give topnotch healthcare to all of us.  From what is reported, in just 3 short years under the Senate bill, Republicans will take millions off their Medicaid coverage, and then, starting in 2025, the plan will institute even more Medicaid cuts, and each year those cuts get deeper than the year before. Within 10 years of this new funding system, the cuts to Medicaid could total hundreds of billions of dollars above the more than $800 billion the House bill already cuts from the program.  Every senior in America should read the fine print of this bill. It looks as if American seniors could be paying way more. Why do this? Looking at the bill, the answer is, because the Republicans want to give a tax break to the wealthiest Americans--those making over $200,000 a year--and set themselves up to give these folks another, even larger tax cut in their tax bill.  Even though much of the early reporting says that the bill will keep certain protections for Americans with preexisting conditions, the truth is, it may well not guarantee them the coverage they need by allowing States to waive essential health benefits. What the bill is saying to those Americans is that insurance still has to cover you, but it doesn't have to cover what you may actually need. It doesn't have to cover all or even most of your costs.  If you need treatment for opioid addiction, your plan may no longer cover it. If you are pregnant and need maternity care, your plan may have decided that is too expensive. The coverage that Americans with preexisting conditions actually need may well become either unaffordable or even nonexistent under this bill.  Simply put, this bill will result----  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgS3698-3.txt,1036,STRENGTHENING CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT,2017.0,22.0,July

Simply put, this bill will result in higher costs, less care, and millions of Americans will lose their health insurance, particularly through It is every bit as bad as the House bill. In some ways, it is even worse.  The President said the Senate bill needed heart. The way this bill cuts healthcare is heartless. The President said the House bill was mean. The Senate bill may be meaner.  The Senate Republican healthcare bill is a wolf in sheep's clothing, but this wolf has even sharper teeth than the House bill.  It is clear that Republicans know that cutting Medicaid will hurt so many people in the middle class, so many in my home State of New Republicans know that people want essential health benefits, so they have created a disguise by saying that these changes will not occur for a year. But, in reality, the Senate Republican bill is a wolf in sheep's clothing, only this wolf has even sharper teeth than the House bill.  We are potentially voting on it in a week--with no committee hearings, no amendments in committee, no debate on the floor, save for 10 measly hours, on one of the most important bills we are dealing with in decades. That brings shame on this body. We won't even know the full cost or consequence of the bill until CBO scores it, and that could take a few days more.  How can my friend the majority leader expect this body to fairly consider this legislation, prepare amendments, and debate it in 1 week with only 10 hours of debate? How can he expect his own Members to do the same? Many of them on the Republican side are learning the details of the bill the same way we Democrats are: They are reading it today.  Now, listen to what the majority leader had to say in 2009 when we were debating healthcare--his words:       This is a very important issue. . . . We shouldn't try to      do it in the dark. And whatever final bill is produced should      be available to the American public and to Members of the      Senate, certainly, for enough time to[[Page S3699]]     come to grips with it. . . . And we are going to insist--and      the American people are going to insist--that it be done in a      transparent, fair, and open way.  Is 5 or 6 days enough time for the American people and the Members of the Senate to come to grips with a bill that affects one-sixth of the economy and the lives of every American in this country? I don't think so, neither do the American people and neither do a whole bunch of Republican  Senator Cassidy: Would I have preferred a more open process? The answer is yes.  Senator Collins: I don't think it gives enough time to thoroughly analyze the bill, but we will see when it comes out.  Member after Member--Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham, Jerry Moran, Marco Rubio, Bob Corker--has repeatedly said that this process--in their words and now in mine--is unfair, it is truncated, and it is rushed.  For my dear friend the majority leader to say we are going to have an open amendment process is turning truth upside down. I would ask our leader, rhetorically, because I know the answer: Can we allow at least 1 hour on each amendment, not 2 minutes? Will we have more time than 10 hours to debate the bill? I hope so. But, if not, please don't call this an open and fair process. If you want to rush it through, admit the consequences.  The debate over healthcare has been fierce. We know that Republicans and Democrats had differences when we debated the Affordable Care At least we had a debate. At least we had committee hearings and a process. More broadly than that, at least we Democrats were trying to pass a healthcare bill that helped more Americans afford insurance and tried to bring costs down and end some of the most egregious practices of the healthcare industry.  What is this bill--TrumpCare--trying to achieve? It seems designed to slash support for healthcare programs in order to give tax breaks to the very wealthy.  When the CBO score comes out, I believe it will verify that millions of Americans in this great country will be unable to afford insurance or the insurance they can afford won't cover the services they need.  Somewhere in America there is a family who takes a trip each Friday to visit grandma or grandpa at a nursing home, who sacrificed all of their savings to pay for their healthcare until they had no more savings and now rely on Medicaid to help pay the cost of long-term care in a nursing home.  Somewhere in America there is a father who is eaten up inside watching his son struggle with opioid addiction, who knows in his heart that his son will be able to go on and live a healthy and fulfilling life if he could only afford treatment to get him out from under this devastating addiction.  Somewhere in America there is a parent whose child has cancer, a mother and father who stay up late at night worried that their insurance will either not be available or run out when the family needs it most.  In the America that my Republican friends envision with this healthcare bill, those Americans, and many more besides, might not get the coverage and care they need.  We live in the wealthiest country on Surely, surely, we can do better than what the Republican healthcare bill promises.

4122,topic-id,927,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. This rule provides for consideration of H.3004, also known as Kate's  It should be instructive, also, Mr.Speaker, to recognize that H.3004 had a companion bill that we debated on the rule yesterday--not voted on, we will vote on these today--that was a companion bill to this that is a very important bill. These are both effective law enforcement tools that need to be made available not only to protect the people of the United States, but, in particular, people who live in many of the jurisdictions that are being denied that support by effective law enforcement because of political policies that are being instructed by city councils and mayors across the country.  Mr.Speaker, on July 1, 2015, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez shot and killed Kate Steinle at Pier 14 in San Francisco, California, while she was walking with her father. Mr.Lopez-Sanchez claims that he does not fully recall the murder, as he took strong sleeping pills prior to the incident.  Mr.Speaker, this senseless and cowardly murder should never have happened. Mr.Lopez-Sanchez is and was an unlawful criminal alien who had previously been deported five times from the United States of                              {time}  1230  He had numerous felony convictions in the United States of America, including for the possession of heroin and the manufacturing of narcotics in the United States of  Despite his lengthy history of criminal acts dating back to 1991, Mr.Sanchez was able to illegally reenter the United States again and again and again with minimal consequences, showcasing serious fault lines in one of our systems of deterrence: our border.  For years, the lack of immigration enforcement and the spread of dangerous sanctuary policies have failed the American people and cost lives. The death of innocent Americans, such as Kate, Sarah Root, Grant Roanebeck, and too many others across this country, is simply unacceptable.  Mr.Speaker, that is why we are here today. The American people have had enough. And I believe Congress has heard from the people, and we have heard enough and had enough.  The bottom line is we now have a President, Donald Trump, who not only heard this same story as he went around the country running for President, but had a different answer, because I assure you, the major candidates running for President on the Republican and Democratic ticket heard this same content. One person stepped up to the plate. He is now our President: Donald  The American people are sick and tired of turning on their TVs or radios or newspapers and seeing yet another senseless murder committed by a previously deported criminal alien. Their deaths are especially devastating since I believe they could have been prevented if our immigration laws had been carefully enforced or we had, really, what I call the national deterrent: the will to stop these senseless acts. Kate's Law gets close to doing just that.  The underlying legislation that the House will be able to vote on in this rule and in the legislation today enhances the current maximum sentences for illegal reentry. The bill raises the maximum sentence for criminal aliens who reenter the United States to between 10 and 25 years in Federal prison, depending upon the criminal's history.  For all those who are attempting to politicize this legislation--and, yes, they are--I would encourage them to read the bill. Mr.Speaker, I have that bill in front of me as we speak, and it is really not too much of a lift. It is half of a page and four other pages.  Members of Congress do have time to read the bill. Members of Congress do[[Page H5309]]have time to understand why we are here today. And it is more than just that is just the way it is. It is, in fact, a reality that has become all too known by every single American, and especially moms and dads, moms and dads and uncles and grandparents who hurt when our children are hurt.  So regardless of your position on general immigration reform, I would hope that you would join us today, join us today in agreeing that we should do everything we can to discourage murderers and criminal aliens.  Disagreeing one way or another on immigration policy is not what this is about. This is about where even there is the slightest potential that there could be citizens who would be harmed, we need a second look, a second opportunity, and a chance to address the issue.  The American people, I believe, need and deserve stronger deterrence of those who have come here illegally and have already proven that they are willing to break our Nation's most serious laws.  These are not huddled masses yearning to be free or families attempting to come here for a better life. These are bad people, and we call them criminals. They have violated the criminal conduct code here in the United States of They are people who we know are capable of terrible crimes, who, via their own criminal actions, have made sure that they have taken away the right that others had and, in doing so, have harmed the lives of our citizens.  The American people spoke clearly in President Donald Trump understood that. This is a criminal matter; this is not a politics issue; and the time of letting the worst criminals back in our country over and over and over again must stop. The process begins again today.  Mr.Speaker, that is just the way it is, and I reserve the balance of my time.

4124,topic-id,558,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock), a distinguished Member of this body.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr.Speaker, Kate's Law, the bill that this rule brings to the floor, is very personal to the people of my district because of two other names that we will never forget.                              {time}  1245  On October 24, 2014, Sacramento County Sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver and Placer County Detective Michael Davis were brutally gunned down in one of the most cold-blooded rampages in the history of either county.  It began when Deputy Oliver approached a car in a parking lot to ask if he could help a couple who seemed to be lost. He was shot dead.  A bystander who was too slow turning over his car keys became the next victim. Miraculously, he survived a gunshot wound to the head but vividly remembers the smile on the gunman's face as he pulled the trigger.  The next victim was Detective Michael His father, a Riverside County Sheriff's deputy, had lost his life in the line of duty on the very same day 26 years earlier.  These crimes should never have happened. Their assailant had repeatedly entered this country illegally. While here, he had been apprehended for committing other crimes and repeatedly deported, only to easily recross the border without being challenged.  I have heard it said there is no evidence that illegal immigrants commit crimes at any higher rate than the general population. Well, that is just not true. It is true that crime statistics don't aggregate by legal status. Some States, like California, no longer even report the legal status of inmates. They can tell us by race, gender, age, background, and jurisdiction who stole a car last year, but they won't tell us how many illegal immigrants did.  By painstakingly piecing together all of the available fragmented data in 2015, FOX News concluded that illegal immigrants are three times more likely to be convicted of murder than the legal population.  According to this report, illegals account for 3.7 percent of the population but are convicted of 13.6 percent of all crimes, including 12 percent of all murders, 20 percent of all kidnappings, and 16 percent of drug trafficking. Each year, 900,000 illegal immigrants are arrested for crimes.  Citing the GAO, FOX reported that 55,000 illegal immigrants were in Federal prison and 296,000 in State and local jails in 2011. The real tragedy is that there should be zero crimes committed by illegal immigrants because there should be zero illegal immigrants in this country.  For 16 years, two Presidents--one Republican and one Democrat--ignored their constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Well, thank God, we finally have a President who takes that responsibility seriously.  This rule brings a bill to the floor that increases penalties for those who return to our country after they have been deported. The other to be debated today adds long-overdue sanctions to local jurisdictions that refuse to protect their own citizens, and I rise in strong support of that bill as well.  It is too late for Officers Davis and It is too late for Kate It is too late for thousands of other Americans killed by illegal immigrants. But perhaps it is just in time for your neighbor, your family member, or yourself.  ",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgH5308-2.txt,1548,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,29.0,June

Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for the continuing work he does as the chairman of the Rules It is very important work for this Nation and the  Mr.Speaker, there are some debates on this floor that are very complicated. They hinge on technicalities and complex judgment calls. You need to properly weigh all the data, all the studies, and all the nuances.  But I will tell you, Mr.Speaker, that today's debate is not complicated. This is not about nuance. The subject is not complex. This is about answering a simple question: Is the purpose of our government to protect the American people first, or is the purpose of our government to protect felons who have entered our country illegally, broken our laws, and threatened our people?  I wish this were an exaggeration, but American citizens have died because some local governments have refused to uphold our laws. These so-called sanctuary cities offer safety for illegal felons, but they do so by putting our families, neighbors, and fellow Americans in danger.  The American people now look to their government and they are uncertain. They elected people to represent them, but would those Representatives rather protect felons here illegally or their fellow citizens?  As far as this House is concerned, let us end the uncertainty today. Our government should, and always will, put the safety of American people first. Cities offering sanctuary for criminals will no longer be ignored. Criminals who threaten our citizens and reenter our country with no respect for our laws will be punished.                              {time}  1300  Kate Steinle, an American citizen, a daughter, and a promising young woman would be alive today if local governments did not act as a safe haven for lawbreakers. Juan Lopez-Sanchez shot Kate after being deported five times. He had seven felony convictions before he murdered her.  After this crime, we asked the same questions the rest of America did: How could this man be let free? Why was he in America in the first place? How can cities across our Nation continue to shield such people from the law?  In America, the Federal Government has little right to tell States and localities how to conduct affairs properly left to them. But our Federal Government has every right to demand that these governments follow our just laws written in accordance with our And if they do not, if those cities protect criminals at the expense of law-abiding Americans, they should not expect their fellow citizens to help them through the Federal  For those cities with laws designed to harbor immigrants who have entered this country illegally, our legislation will prohibit those laws, cut off Federal grant money, and allow the families who suffer as a result of their foolishness the right to have their day in court.  And to the criminals: If you break our laws and ever return, justice will come for you, and the penalty will be severe.  Mr.Speaker, being an American means something. We should never forget that. If America is your home, you are a citizen. If you are part of this national community, rest assured, the government is here for you. The American people come first.

Yesterday, we heard a debate on H.3003, and today, on H.3004. They are, in sense, companion bills. Balancing acts is what I would refer to them as, acts about addressing two very specific problems that are in our country that are very interrelated.  These are law enforcement bills. Make no mistake about it. These are not political. These are law enforcement bills. These are law enforcement bills that are designed to make sure that we effectively codify into Federal law the viewpoint that cities cannot harbor criminals, rapists, murderers, or people who are robbing and killing people as they choose--multiple times--and cities turning a blind eye to not even recognize requests from other cities that might want these people, but also from the Federal  The second bill that we have got is one that says that what we are going to do is not only not fund these cities that are sanctuary cities, but we are going to deal more effectively with these criminals in the system. That is Kate's  Both of these bills, H.3004 and H.3003, effectively balance each other because, as Members of Congress, we hear from people back home, many times, not just families from people who are impacted, but really citizens who are worried about our country dividing itself on this issue of criminals.  Make no mistake about it, these are criminals. Make no mistake about it, this is a law enforcement bill.

4013,topic-id,1603,"Mr.President, last month, Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a healthcare bill. They call it the American Health Care It has been widely described as cruel and poorly crafted. Last week, President Trump described it as ``mean.''  The House bill, by design, would take health coverage away from tens of millions of It ends the guarantee of affordable coverage for people with preexisting conditions. It cuts Medicaid, which is the principal program for ensuring children, people with disabilities, and seniors in nursing homes. It cuts Medicaid by more than $800 billion, and to compound that cruelty, the same legislation gives an enormous tax cut--over $30 billion--to those at the top of the income scale.  We just heard this morning some of what is in the Senate bill, the Senate version of the American Health Care In fact, not only does it not do what President Trump claims the Senate was working on--it doesn't address the mean aspect of it--but it actually makes it worse. In a State like New Hampshire, it provides for even deeper cuts to our expanded Medicaid Program, a bipartisan program that provides for treatment for substance use disorders for people dealing with the heroin and opioid epidemic. It would tax older Americans more than younger Americans for their health insurance and defund Planned There are all kinds of reasons. It would eliminate the requirement that people with preexisting conditions are able to have healthcare coverage. And all of this was done in secret behind closed doors.  My office has been deluged with messages from constituents who oppose the Republican leader's bill. This shows whom we have heard from in recent weeks. I have received more than 5,400 messages opposing the bill and 108 in support, so 5,461 are in opposition, and 108 are in support.  I am sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle must be receiving similar volumes of mail and phone calls from their constituents, and they are hearing what I am hearing from my constituents: that if we go forward with this legislation that the House passed and that the Senate is considering, we are going to have people lose their access to healthcare and many people will have to pay more.  So I appeal to Republican leaders. I urge you to stop and reconsider what you are doing. I want you to listen to some of the people we have heard from in New Hampshire, everyday Americans whose lives would be devastated by this legislation.  Several months ago, I asked people across the State of New Hampshire to tell me their stories about the Affordable Care Act, to tell me their concerns, to let me know how it has made a difference for them.  Here we see one of the people I heard from. This is Deodonne Bhattarai and her son They live in Concord, As you see, Bodhi is in a special chair. Deodonne writes:       Our three-year-old son is a bright, curious, funny little      boy who also has Spinal Muscular  That is a degenerative neuromuscular disease that causes his muscles to be very weak.       Our insurance initially denied coverage for his wheelchair,      but because of the Affordable Care Act--  The ban on discrimination against those with preexisting conditions--     my son is now able to explore his world independently.  She goes on to say:       I have [read news reports about the Republican      legislation], and I fear for our ability to maintain not just      insurance coverage but the type of quality coverage my son's      life depends upon.  Next we have a picture of the McCabe family. They are from Kingston, NH, and this is their story:       Our daughter, Ellie, was born with a rare and serious heart      defect called Hypoplastic Left Heart  You can see Ellie there. She looks like a healthy, inquisitive little girl, and she is looking healthy because she underwent her first surgery when she was just 3 days old.  The McCabes go on to say:       It terrifies us to think about what would have happened to      our family if Ellie hadn't been protected by the pre-existing      conditions protections in place thanks to the Affordable Care      Without those protections, either we would be in serious      debt for the rest of our lives or Ellie would not have had      her life-saving surgeries.  Next, this is Marie She serves at the Lamprey Health Care Center in Nashua, That is a clinic I recently visited. She wrote to me:       I have a 24-year-old patient who was born with a congenital      condition that did not allow his leg bones to grow      completely. This patient was unable to afford proper care and      had been walking with an old prosthetic for the last 3 years.  Imagine not being able to get your prosthetic replaced for 3 years.       Thanks to expanded Medicaid and to the ACA protections for      those with pre-existing conditions, he's now getting quality      care and can afford a new prosthetic.  So his life has been changed by the Affordable Care  I have also heard stories from scores of entrepreneurs and small business owners who have benefited from the Affordable Care  This is Steve Roll of Keene, NH, and he wrote:       In late 2015, I left my job to start my own business. I've      built a profitable business and expect to hire employees      within a year or two. Before the ACA, I wouldn't have taken      the risk to start a business because I have a pre-existing      condition and I wouldn't have been able to get an individual      health insurance policy. If the ACA is repealed, I'm      concerned that I'll need to put my business on hold in order      to go back to a corporate job just to get the healthcare      benefits.  Well, the healthcare legislation that has been produced by the Republican leadership in the Senate would take away the requirement that people with preexisting conditions have to have access to healthcare.  We have another businessperson here, Dave He is the owner of Claremont Spice & Dry Goods in western New Dave wrote this:       Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance costs were more      than a third of my business expenses. Now they're less than      an eighth. The ACA made it possible for me to go out on my      own and realize my dream of starting a small business here in       And his business is doing well.  Many women have written to me about how the Affordable Care Act has[[Page S3712]]ended discrimination against them by the health insurance industry--discrimination because of their gender. In particular, they are grateful that the Affordable Care Act includes maternity care and contraception among the law's essential health benefits.  This is Maura Fay of Exeter, I talked about her last night when I was talking about the impact of this Republican bill on women's health. Maura wrote:       My husband and I are self-employed. Before the ACA, we were      paying rates that were simply unsustainable for a middle-     class family like ours. When I was pregnant in 2013, we were      forced to pay a maternity rider of an additional $822 a      month. I'm worried about the rollbacks in regulations around      essential health benefits, especially since so many of them      impact women. Maternity coverage shouldn't come with an      additional $800 a month price tag.  Here in Washington, some folks seem to think that repealing the Affordable Care Act is all about politics, that it is about winning this debate. But for ordinary people in New Hampshire--people like Maura, like the McCabe family, like all the people I have shown pictures of this afternoon--for ordinary people in New Hampshire and across America, repealing the Affordable Care Act isn't about politics. For so many of them, it is about life-and-death. It is about the kind of lives they are going to lead. It is about whether they are going to be able to continue to afford healthcare, whether they are going to continue to pay their mortgage and buy prescription drugs. We need to listen to these ordinary people in each of our States whose lives and financial situations will be turned upside down if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.  This process has really not been in keeping with our democratic process in For the Republican leadership here in the Senate and before that in the House to pursue a partisan approach to healthcare, to deny Democrats and even deny many of my Republican colleagues the ability to engage in the writing of this bill--it is deeply misguided to deny the public access, to deny a hearing on this bill, legislation that we know is going to hurt tens of millions of  There really is a better way forward for both the Senate and for our country. If we put ideology and partisanship aside, if we work together, we can strengthen the parts of the Affordable Care Act that aren't working. We can continue Medicaid expansion so it can help people with substance use disorders, so it can help kids with disabilities, so it can help elderly people in nursing homes. We can fix what is not working, and we can improve on this law and make it better, but we can't do that if we continue to be divided up on our partisan sides, if we are not willing to talk about the issue, not willing to work together.  The American people want us to work together here in Washington to address their concerns. Well, it is time to respect their wishes. Let's strengthen the Affordable Care Act so that it works even better for all  I yield the floor.

4123,topic-id,1279,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Sessions) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, all of us mourn the death of Kate Steinle, tragically shot and killed in San Francisco in 2015. Indeed, there isn't a parent anywhere who doesn't worry constantly about the well-being and the health and the safety of a child. And we all know, even though we may not have lost our own, we have deep sympathy with those who do. But as the Cato Institute has outlined, the legislation before us today would not have prevented that tragedy.  As the Cato Institute has said, the alleged shooter ``did not end up in San Francisco due to lax border security, and the case actually shows the opposite. In recent years, Border Patrol caught him each time he attempted to cross.''  He was only in the city because the U.Justice Department failed to do its job, and that is why Cato has called this bill, ``a waste of Federal resources.'' Let me say that again, Mr.Speaker, that these are the words of the Cato Institute, a group founded by the well-known conservative Charles Cato could not have been more clear when they said it this week: ``Kate's Law would not have helped Kate.''  Now, our country has listened as President Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants ``criminals, drug dealers, and rapists.'' The public has watched him promote the formation of a deportation force to tear apart immigrants from their families and sign an executive order directing Federal resources toward the construction of a wall along the border between the U.and Mexico, where there is one mostly already that has not done that much deterring, but that is despite the fact that Federal spending on border security over the last few years has been at the highest level that our country has ever seen. It seems the majority has now taken a page from the President's playbook, apparently trying to turn his dangerous rhetoric into law.  It is shameful that they are prioritizing a bill that is completely unnecessary, since current law already imposes adequately severe penalties for illegal reentry, including enhanced penalties for criminal offenses. It is already covered, Mr.Speaker, but we do have something we need to fill the afternoon since the health bill failed. All the while, the majority is ignoring the many, many, many major issues facing the Nation today.  Now, I know, and we all know, that the bill wasn't the only thing they were hoping to ram through here before we adjourned for the district work period. They also hoped to pass their healthcare repeal bill so quickly before leaving town that the American people wouldn't notice; but, frankly, even as I say that, they have noticed, as I understand now, that the approval rating for that bill is 12 percent. They have noticed. I think what they have noticed is that they are going to kill  The reason they wanted to do this in a hurry, repeal healthcare first, was in order to fulfill their tax bill promise of corporate tax cuts as well as tax cuts for the richest people in the United They wanted to take from the health bill, the expanded Medicare money, $80 billion to pay for tax cuts. The devastation that that would create, I think most American people understand it.  If they have a loved one in a nursing home, that means that, since 64 percent of the cost of nursing care is borne by Medicaid, that they would very likely have to bring the person home.  It means that 22 million people would lose their health insurance. You know, we just say that, ``22 million people.'' Let me put that number in some perspective. That number, 22 million, is more than the population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, and Wyoming combined. That is pretty impressive, isn't it?  In February, our President Trump said: ``Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.'' Well, Mr.Speaker and Mr.President, those of us on our side who worked for more than a year to craft the Affordable Care Act knew that very well. I was chair of the Rules Committee at the time, and just the Rules Committee heard from 46 different Members of Congress over the course of three meetings which, together, lasted more than 20 hours, one of them a full Saturday of hearings.  So, together with the work done by the other committees of jurisdiction, the healthcare reform law received such a thorough vetting--and I want to get this on the record because I hear all the time it was written behind closed doors and strange people and nobody knew what it was and that we were all surprised. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Bill Kristol proclaimed on FOX News: ``This is the most thoroughly debated piece of legislation in my memory in Washington.''  I feel like I need to say that again, but I won't take the time, but how important it is. But those of us who were there knew it. We knew how many committee meetings were held on this legislation.  On the bill you are talking about from your side, the majority side, not a single committee has heard it. I wager that the vast majority of the Republicans--who deserve to see it--have not even seen that bill, and that is a tragedy. We do not operate the United States of America that way.  So, Mr.Speaker, there is no comparison between the open, the transparent, and lengthy process that we went through to craft the Affordable Care Act--which, by the way, was written by experts--and what the majority is trying to do with this disastrous repeal bill.  And while I am at it, so many times when I was doing the rule on the repeal bills--and, you know, repeal and replace, repeal and replace. We know now that all those 7 years and those more than 60 votes that we paid for while we are running the House, that all this time there was no replacement. They still don't have a replacement. If that wasn't a hoax on the American people, I don't know what was. But the process we are seeing now is defined by backroom deals and secrecy and a complete disregard for regular order.  And I understand that, between now and tomorrow afternoon, there will be a lot of big deals changing hands so that we won't know next week what is there anyway, but we wait to see the new CBO score and see what that says.  Nearly every President since Theodore Roosevelt tried to enact healthcare reform. That is a long time. Teddy Roosevelt tried it and many[[Page H5310]]Presidents after him. But after decades of failed attempts and false starts, President Obama, working with a Democratic Congress, was finally able to deliver.  The majority should work with us again. We are willing to do that. And what we would really like to see you do is take the ACA and the problems that it has and let's work together and improve that law, which has already been in effect now for a number of years, since 2014, and we could just move ahead and get on with things that are terribly important to us.  We wish that you would do that instead of trying to dismantle it. If it were dismantled, it would disrupt the markets. It would harm the sick and disproportionately impact those in nursing homes.

4147,topic-id,433,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this is the 38th closed rule allowing no amendments that House Republicans have brought to the floor this year alone, and it is only At this rate, the majority is well on its way to becoming the most closed Congress in history.  Regular order seems to be a thing of the past under this leadership, with bills coming to the House floor, as these two are, for a vote without even going through the committee process. The immigration bills we considered this week didn't even go through regular order. The disastrous healthcare repeal bill, which would impact one-sixth of the Nation's economy, didn't get a single hearing, and hardly anybody saw it.  No experts were ever called to discuss its impacts, and it was jammed through the Chamber last month without even a score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office outlining its costs or its impacts. The Senate has also completely bypassed the committee process.  I was proud to bring the Affordable Care Act, as I said earlier, to the House floor in 2009, as chair of the Rules That process couldn't have been more different.  Let me remind those watching today that the House held 79 bipartisan hearings and markups on health insurance reform in 2009 and 2010. During this time, House Members heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, considered 239 Democratic and Republican amendments, and accepted 121 of them.                              {time}  1330  That process was entirely different from what we go through today. In fact, a lot of the Members of the House are really cut out of most of the process. The idea of getting an amendment is really pretty rare.  The legislation we consider here should be able to withstand scrutiny, but, more and more, the Nation's business is done in the dark, or by a few people.  Let's get out of the back rooms, Mr.Speaker, and let legislators of both parties do their job under an open process. That is what the Speaker promised when he took the gavel, and it is what all the books and Rules of the House of Representatives desire, and it is certainly what the American people deserve.  Mr.Speaker, we should not consider a bill that would cost tens of millions of people to lose health insurance, and not consider the anti-immigration bills before us today.  So I am going to urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, on the rule, and the bill, and hope for better days.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

It restores a bipartisan provision to the bill, one that was actually approved by Congress and signed into law by President  In 2009, Congress approved the King Cove Land Exchange under the condition that it be found to be in the national interest by the Secretary of the After a transparent 4-year review that included over 70,000 public comments and 130 public meetings, Secretary Jewell ultimately concluded that it was not in the national interest, and the land exchange was not approved.  Nevertheless, the legislation that was approved and signed into law in 2009 with Democratic and Republican support included language that, should the road be approved, it would have required the State of Alaska, Federal agencies, and local residents to develop a mitigation plan for the road so that impacts to migratory birds, wildlife, and wetlands are minimized.  The land exchange language that was passed by Congress in 2009 is similar to the legislation that we are considering today, with a few notable exceptions, including the removal of the section requiring this environmental mitigation plan.  It is common practice for any new road construction project to include an environmental mitigation plan, especially a road through such a sensitive area.

They are also designated wilderness, the highest level of protection that the American people bestow upon a piece of public land, and we in Congress are stewards of that mandate.  The road proposed by this legislation could do irreparable harm to the fragile environment of this wildlife refuge[[Page H6126]]if mitigation steps are not taken. As the Department of the Interior stated in 2013, this area is ``a globally significant landscape that supports an abundance and diversity of wildlife unique to the refuge that years of analysis shows us would be irretrievably damaged by construction and operation of the proposed road.''  The Department also found that construction of the road would lead to ``significant degradation of irreparable ecological resources that would not be offset by the protection of other lands to be received under an exchange.''

4010,topic-id,1095,"Mr.President, today we finally got a look at the monstrosity of a bill that the Republicans have been hiding behind closed doors for weeks. Yes, it is finally clear how the Republicans were spending their time, locked in those back rooms.  Now we know the truth. Senate Republicans weren't making the House bill better--no, not one bit. Instead, they were sitting around a conference room table, dreaming up even meaner ways to kick dirt in the face of American people and take away their health insurance.  Remember, the Senate Republicans worked for weeks on this new bill. They worked really, really hard on it. It is pretty clear now exactly who they were working for. This bill has one flashing neon sign after another telling us who the Republican Party cares about, and it is not American families.  The Senate bill is crammed full with just as many tax cuts as the House bill--tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, tax cuts for wealthy investors, and tax cuts for giant companies. All those tax cuts don't come cheap. They start to add up after a while.  Senate Republicans had to make a choice--how to pay for all those juicy tax cuts for their rich buddies. I will tell you how: blood money.  Senate Republicans wrung some extra dollars out of kicking people off the tax credits that help them afford health insurance. They raked in extra cash by letting States drop even more protections and benefits, like maternity care or prescription drug coverage or mental health treatment.  Then they got to the real piggy bank, Medicaid, and here they just went wild. Senate Republicans went after Medicaid with even deeper cuts than the House version--the Medicaid expansion gone, ripped up, and flushed down the toilet. The rest of the Medicaid Program? For Senate Republicans, it wasn't enough that the House bill was going to toss grandparents out of nursing homes or slash funding for people with disabilities or pull the plug on healthcare for babies born too soon. Senate Republicans wanted to go bigger.  The Republican bill claims to protect kids with disabilities by leaving them out of the calculations that decide how big the Medicaid cuts will be in each I don't know if the Republicans were expecting a round of applause for pitting kids with breathing tubes against vulnerable seniors or someone needing treatment for addiction, but I do know this so-called exemption will not do a thing to help these kids. The Republican cuts still slash hundreds of billions of dollars for Medicaid, leaving States with no choice--no choice but to cut services that kids with disabilities desperately need.  Medicaid is the program in this country that provides health insurance to 1 in 5 Americans, to 30 million kids, to nearly 2 out of every 3 people in a nursing home. These cuts are blood money. People will die. Let's be very clear: Senate Republicans are paying for tax cuts for the wealthy with American lives.  Think about what would happen if the Republican bill becomes law next week. Picture a woman in her eighties who lives at home. She is shaky on her feet. She needs help preparing her meals or taking a bath, but her only income is her Social Security check. Right now, Medicaid helps pay for home and community-based services so she can stay in her home, someone who comes by to help for a few hours a week. Because of that help, she gets to stay home, to live independently. The Republicans are determined to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires, so their healthcare plan cuts Medicaid money that helps millions of seniors stay in their homes.  Without these services, this elderly woman can't live alone. Where does she turn? The usual answer would be a nursing home. Medicaid pays for most nursing home care in this country. The Republicans are determined to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires, so they have cut Medicaid funding so much that there is no help for this woman at home and no nursing home bed for her either.  What does she do? She stays home without help. She can't climb the stairs anymore. Her world shrinks. Eventually, most likely, she falls and ends up in the hospital. The care is expensive, and she is miserable.  Finally, let's say the hospital gets her back on her feet, but there is nowhere for her to go when she is discharged. She heads back home to wait for the next fall, maybe the one that will be fatal.  In their determination to cut taxes for the rich, is this what Republicans have planned for frail seniors in our country? Wait until they are all used up and then leave them out at the curb for the next trash pickup?  It isn't just seniors who will be hit hard. How about a premature baby born with lung defects? His parents both have full-time jobs, but no matter how hard they work, no matter how many hours they put in, they will never be able to pay for the millions of dollars in surgeries, equipment, medicine, and therapy that their child[[Page S3710]]needs. Right now, Medicaid makes sure that kids with complex medical needs have coverage for feeding tubes and medication and surgery and physical therapy.  Senate Republicans were so determined to offer tax breaks for the rich that they have taken away this baby's What happens next? Maybe the parents try their best, but they can't pay. Maybe they try a Kickstarter campaign, but it is not going to bring in enough to cover the medical bills. They take out a second mortgage, and then they go bankrupt and lose their home.  Is that the Republican plan for this family--go live in a homeless shelter with your little baby, whose only crime was to be born 14 weeks early?  Senate Republicans can wave their hands and say that everyone will be fine, but it is time for the rest of us to take a long, hard look at exactly what would happen to the people who have to live with the Republicans' reckless cuts.  Senate Republicans know exactly what they are doing with this healthcare bill. Their values are on full display. If they want to trade the health insurance of millions of Americans for tax cuts for the rich, they better be ready for a fight because now that this shameful bill is out in the open, that is exactly what they are going to get.

I am proud of the contributions that my home State of Arkansas makes to the American economy. In Arkansas, 13 percent of the State's workforce is employed in the manufacturing industry, which is the second highest percentage in the South and the third highest percentage in the Twenty-eight percent of those jobs in Arkansas are in the Fourth  In 2016, manufacturers contributed $2.2 trillion to the American economy. For every dollar spent in manufacturing, an additional $1.80 is added to another part of the economy.  With abundant resources, a strong infrastructure, and a second-to-none work ethic, Arkansas is working to train the next generation of technicians and visionaries so that manufacturing can expand, promoting better careers, stronger families, and thriving communities.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-20-pt1-PgH6134-4.txt,2224,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,20.0,June
4185,topic-id,404,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of H.218, the King Cove Road Land Exchange I thank Congressman Don Young for his tireless work on this pressing issue.  Nineteen people: the cost of decades of inaction by the Federal Government, Mr.Chairman, is 19 American lives.  Expedient access to a hospital is something most Americans can, fortunately, take for granted. For many, emergency services are an ambulance ride away. Not for the citizens of King Cove,  Adjacent to the Aleutian Islands, the 1,000 residents of King Cove, Alaska, are connected to hospitals in the region via a small runway and a ferry. Harsh winter storms ground planes and prevent safe sea travel, cutting off residents from hospitals and necessary supplies.  In truly dire emergencies, King Cove residents have but two choices. Number one is to pray a boat captain will brave enormous seas. Or wait until the Coast Guard can dispatch a medivac helicopter.  Mr.Chairman, allow me to read some of the stories of those who have braved the sea, or held out until help arrived.  Take, for example, Lonnie Brandell, who had to hoist his ailing father out of a fishing boat during a blizzard. After a perilous 3-hour journey to Cold Bay, the sea was so rough his boat could not dock. Brandell had to tie a rope around his father and allow him to be pulled to safety. To quote Brandell: ``It was not a good scenario at all. But if we had stayed here one more day, even 10 or 12 more hours, he would not have lived.''  Or take Etta Kuzakin, who went into labor early. Unable to safely leave King Cove during a storm, it took the Coast Guard 8 hours to arrive to rescue her. ``I was lucky,'' she says. ``The Coast Guard was in the area. That is really what it was. They were in the area.''  Mr.Chairman, this is shameful. Our citizens should not have to wait hours for a medivac, or brave treacherous seas while we sit here and debate this issue. No American should have to perish while we argue whether or not a refuge would be better off with 81 or 70 miles of gravel road.  I urge my colleagues to listen to the stories of Etta Kuzakin, Lonnie Brandell, and others. I urge my colleagues to think about the 19 Americans who perished for want of a gravel road.  Mr.Chairman, I strongly support H.218.  ",CREC-2017-07-20-pt1-PgH6120.txt,2224,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,20.0,June

4217,topic-id,1058,"Mr.President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Franken and Senator Warren, who are also here for this conversation that was kicked off earlier this afternoon by our friend and colleague from West Virginia, Senator  West Virginia does not have a whole lot in common with Rhode We are a coastal Senator Manchin comes from a very landlocked mountainous Our biggest mountain in Rhode Island is probably the Johnson landfill. But we have something in common, which is the extent to which opioid addiction and opioid overdoses have stricken our We have had over 200 deaths per year. In a State our size, everyone is within 2 or 3 degrees of separation of everyone else. Those 200 deaths reverberate through our whole  There is a small town in Rhode Island called Burrillville, up in our northwest corner. Burrillville is a very small town in Rhode I went up there for a meeting about the opioid epidemic at Burrillville High In the previous quarter, in just 3 months, that one little town had six deaths from opioid overdoses. That is six times that the little police force had to respond, six times the funeral parlors had to handle grieving families, six times that death notices had to be published in the local paper. It felt like a battering to people in that community.  Senator Manchin has a pretty good idea to help make sure that we have the funding to get treatment to people before these tragedies take place. He proposes what he calls the LifeBOAT Act, which is one penny for each milligram of active opioid in a prescription drug--one penny. It is only a penny, but it would have raised about $2 billion last year. So $2 billion would save a lot of people and save a lot of lives.  Just to give you some idea of the scale, Purdue Pharma has generated estimated sales of more than $35 billion since 1995 for opioid medications. It has annual revenues of about $3 billion, mostly from That is just one company. So the idea of adding a penny really does not seem to me to be asking very much.  The way we operate now in the Senate, I know that asking corporations to do anything seems impossible because they have the financial whip hand over so many Senators because of the unlimited money they are allowed to spend and threaten to spend in our politics. But really, after all the lives that have been lost, after all the lives have been affected, you would expect that just out of common decency this industry would step up and say: For a penny, we are in. So let's hope they come around to that because I think it is a good plan.  TrumpCare, on the other hand, would be a disaster. So many people get their opioid treatment through Medicaid and through the expansion of Medicaid that the Affordable Care Act created. To undo that, to strip $1.4 trillion, as President Trump has proposed, out of Medicaid is inevitably going to deny people access to care.  I am not the only one saying this. Someone who works in Providence with recovering heroin addicts wrote to me. His name is He wrote to me about his clients who are receiving medication-assisted treatments. He credits their being able to come in and get the care that they get to the Affordable Care He said that it is the reason he and his colleagues have been able to help recovering addicts enter effective treatment programs. It works.  Travis relates that repealing the Affordable Care Act would have what he calls a profound impact on his clients' ability to get needed addiction and recovery services.  I will turn the floor over to Senator Warren in a minute, but I want to recognize one other person. I will not use last names. His name is He wrote to me from Rumford, RI, which is a very nice part of East Providence,  This is a gentleman who became addicted to opiates at the age of 52. He had surgery, and after the surgical procedure, his doctor gave him opiates for the pain. The doctor was somewhat indiscriminate about continuing to prescribe those opioids.  Mark realized that he was addicted. He went to a recovery group in Rhode Island called CODAC, which does very good work for treatment. He went into recovery, and he succeeded for 8 years without using opioids.  As sometimes happens, family stresses, business stresses, other stresses intervene. In his case, a family stress caused a relapse, but he knew what to do. He went back to He became sober again. Now he is back in recovery, clean and sober.  This pattern of recovery and then an occasional relapse and then back to recovery again is very often the way people who have an addiction get through it. To make sure that the treatment is there for them when they relapse can be a lifesaver.  By the way, Mark is a success. He is in the music business. He has toured around the world. The fact that CODAC was there for him on those two occasions has allowed him to achieve that success. Again, this was a 52-year-old individual whom a surgery sent into addiction.  I will close by pointing out that one of the things the CARA bill, which many of us worked so hard on, accomplished was to send the message that addiction is not a moral failing. It is a medical condition. It should be treated as a medical condition. Not only is it not a moral failing, I think many of us who have had family, loved ones, friends, or any experience with folks who are going through recovery--what we have learned is that recovery is actually a noble accomplishment. It is not an easy path, but it is a path that demands deep honesty, deep courage, deep trust, very often love. It is a path that people who are walking it can and should be proud of, and we should be proud of them for their achievements, and we should be there for them in their relapses and make sure the care that will put them back on that path is available.

I have written them. They have become law. I could tell my colleague, I have not once--not once--been asked to be part of any bipartisan effort with respect to this legislation.  I think, colleagues, it is real clear what is going on here. Senate Republicans are going to keep telling Americans they are fixing their healthcare right up until the second it gets taken away.

There have been no hearings on this dangerous, destructive proposal, not one hearing on whether Medicaid should be slashed to pay for tax cuts for the fortunate few, not one hearing on whether the bedrock protections for those with preexisting conditions ought to be shattered, not one hearing on whether Americans should face higher costs, along with annual and lifetime limits, on insurance coverage.
