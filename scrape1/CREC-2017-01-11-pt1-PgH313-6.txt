                     RECOGNIZING KRISTIN NICHOLSON

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is always difficult saying good-bye to 
a Member of our Hill family. When I was first electedto Congress, I 
sought a chief of staff who could work with me to help lead my team and 
shape my policy portfolio: someone whoknew the Hill as well as the 
legislative process in Congress; someone who was smart, strong, and 
compassionate; someone withsharp instincts; and, most importantly, 
someone I could trust. I found all of those qualities and so much more 
in KristinNicholson.
  As my chief of staff, Kristin has been a trusted confidant, adviser, 
and a true friend. So it is with both sadness and pridethat after 16 
years in my office I say good-bye to Kristin as she leaves the Hill to 
become director of the Government AffairsInstitute at Georgetown 
University.
  Kristin's leadership has been essential to me and my entire staff; 
and although we will miss her tremendously, she leavesbehind a team 
that has benefited from her professionalism, passion, humor, and grace 
under fire.
  Kristin, I cannot thank you enough for your service to me and the 
people of Rhode Island. Congratulations and best wishes.
