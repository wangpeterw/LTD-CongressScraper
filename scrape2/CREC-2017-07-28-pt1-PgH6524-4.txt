               HONORING THE LIFE OF LARRY JEFF ELEY, SR.

  (Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Larry 
Jeff Eley, Sr., a friend and strong advocate for farmers, growers, and 
landowners in my home district. He passed away suddenly at the age of 
71 on July 17.
  He was well known in Greene County, Georgia, as a gentle giant and 
will be remembered for his love for his family and his tireless efforts 
as president of the Greene County Farm Bureau and his steadfast 
leadership in the Georgia Association of Conservation Districts.
  Farming was Larry's life. He was a guiding force in the community, 
who actively worked with State and local leaders to foster and promote 
a better understanding of agriculture. He was a leading voice for 
Georgia's farmers. Larry's legacy will better ensure that our children 
and grandchildren will experience the same opportunities to enjoy the 
natural resources of Georgia's 10th Congressional District just as our 
parents and grandparents.
  Mr. Eley is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, Nancy, and their 
four children and their grandchildren. Dee Dee and I both extend our 
thoughts and prayers to the family during this time of bereavement.
  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have known Larry and to witness his 
passion firsthand. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing his 
unyielding commitment to the State of Georgia and our agriculture 
community.
