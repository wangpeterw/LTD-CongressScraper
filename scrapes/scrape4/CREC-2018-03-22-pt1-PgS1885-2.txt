                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our Father, may life's seasons teach us that You stand within 
the shadows keeping watch above Your own. We praise You that You are 
our refuge and strength, a very present help in turbulent times.
  Lord, cultivate within our lawmakers the grace of gratitude as they 
seek to stand for right for the glory of Your Name. May they refrain 
from hasty speech, as they labor to treat others as they would have 
others treat them. Empower them to grow in Your grace and in a greater 
knowledge of Your will and wisdom.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
