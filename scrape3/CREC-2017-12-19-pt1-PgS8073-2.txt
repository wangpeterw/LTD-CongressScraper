                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, fill us with reverence for You. Help us to remember that 
You are the one from whom we borrow our heartbeats. You continue to be 
the source of our peace and the center of our joy. May our reverential 
awe provide us with the foundation of true wisdom. Empower our 
lawmakers to make a positive difference in our Nation and world.
  Lord, give them generous, righteous, and compassionate hearts so that 
they will transform discord into harmony. As they turn to You in 
humble, fervent prayer, hear our prayers, forgive our sins, and heal 
our land.
  Lord, we thank You that You will never give us more to do than we can 
do with Your power.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
