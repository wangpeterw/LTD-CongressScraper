                  NOW WE CAN COMPLETE THE WORK AT HAND

  (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I am so glad we are now back here 
with the government open. I have been here these last few days over the 
weekend with my staff working hard to make sure that we get our 
government open and working for its people, for its military families.
  Today, I was over on the Senate floor when the Senate closed its vote 
in support of reopening our government. Now we can complete the work at 
hand. This is incredibly important.
  I just wanted to mention this. I, too, actually, as a previous 
speaker talked about being detained in the security lines, was 
unavoidably detained in those same security lines, but I wanted to come 
here onto the House floor and make sure that folks know we are here 
hard at work, we are going to make sure that we move forward from this. 
I am looking forward to addressing the issues at hand, making sure that 
we get a long-term solution.
  I am pleased with the CHIP funding that we were able to put through. 
This is something we have been working on now for several months. The 
House has voted in support of this. I have supported it many times now.
  As an appropriator, we had gotten these bills funded months ago. I am 
looking forward to a permanent solution here so we can get about doing 
the people's work.
