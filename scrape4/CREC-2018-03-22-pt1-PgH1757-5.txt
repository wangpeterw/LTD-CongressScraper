                   WELCOMING REVEREND PAUL C. MEYERS

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
Kinzinger) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome Pastor Paul C. 
Meyers as our guest chaplain this morning and greatly appreciate him 
leading us in prayer on this historic Thursday.
  Pastor Meyers is from the 16th Congressional District of Illinois, 
which I proudly represent, and serves as the senior chaplain at the 
United Methodist Church in Roscoe, Illinois.
  Serving in ministry since 1992, Pastor Meyers has been a stalwart, 
faithful figure in our community. He serves as chaplain for the fire, 
EMS, and law enforcement--19 years and counting--and is currently the 
head chaplain for the Harlem-Roscoe Fire Department and the Roscoe 
Police Department. He also serves as chaplain with the FBI and will be 
resident chaplain at the FBI Academy this month in Quantico.
  I want to say thank you to Pastor Meyers and to his family for all 
they do to serve in our community. We are humbly grateful for this 
dedication to serving the Lord and providing us with this spiritual 
guidance.
