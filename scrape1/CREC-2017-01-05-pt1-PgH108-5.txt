                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act works, 
but the majority of Republicans want to make America sick again. 
Republicans have voted more than 60 times to roll back the historic 
progress that has been made to expand health care to 20 million-plus 
Americans and to improve coverage for those who already have it. At 
every turn, they have undermined the law at the expense of American 
families and now are setting the path for full repeal.
  2.6 million Texans stand to lose healthcare coverage, including 
20,000 in our district. Fifty thousand of my constituents would gain 
coverage if Texas would have expanded Medicaid along with more than 1 
million Texans. Texas stands to lose $62 billion in Federal funding for 
Medicaid, CHIP, and financial assistance for marketplace coverage if 
the new President and Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Making America sick again is not the solution. Let's don't have a 
repeal until we have a replacement.
