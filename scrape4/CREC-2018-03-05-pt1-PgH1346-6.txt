            USS ``CARL VINSON'' MAKES A PORT CALL IN VIETNAM

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, this week, the USS Carl Vinson arrives in Da 
Nang, Vietnam. This is the first visit of a U.S. aircraft carrier to 
Vietnam in four decades, and obviously for a very different purpose. 
Together, Vietnam and America are demonstrating the importance of open 
sea lanes for commerce, security, and regional development.
  Arriving aboard the USS Carl Vinson is a young officer named Tower 
Cook. Tower is from Dallas, Texas, and the grandson of former U.S. 
Senator John G. Tower of Texas. Senator Tower was elected to the Senate 
in a 1961 special election and served the people of Texas for 24 years. 
He led the implementation of President Reagan's strategy of a larger, 
competitive, modern Navy, and it was an honor for me to work for him 
the final 2 years of his term in office.
  President Reagan and Senator Tower's vision of the importance of the 
Navy is illustrated by this week's visit of the Carl Vinson to Vietnam. 
Senator Tower, also a master chief petty officer, is looking down from 
his heavenly perch with great pride in seeing his grandson, Tower Cook, 
and the success of the United States Navy.
