  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE MAJORITY SAYS AND WHAT THE MAJORITY 
                                  DOES

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the majority 
is working to pass a tax scam that will raise taxes on my constituents.
  For nearly a year, Republicans have promised tax reform that benefits 
middle class families. Once again, there is a big difference between 
what the majority says and what the majority does.
  Instead of being a tax break for middle class Americans, it is a tax 
scam that will force hardworking Illinois moms and dads to pay the bill 
for tax giveaways to the rich and well connected. That is just wrong.
  Mr. Speaker, the American people know it is a scam. A new poll from 
Monmouth University found that half of all Americans believe this GOP 
tax scam will raise their taxes. These folks are right. It will raise 
their taxes, especially for families in Illinois and in the Second 
District.
  Mr. Speaker, I will never vote to raise my constituents' taxes just 
to pay for massive tax giveaways to major corporations and a handful of 
superwealthy families.
  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and stand with America's middle 
class and working families, the backbone of our Nation.
