            By Mr. GOODLATTE:
        H.R. 1315.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:

[[Page H1531]]

       Article I, Section 8, clause 3. Since the federal 
     government has extended Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 (the 
     commerce clause) beyond its intended boundaries, it follows 
     that efforts to rein in excessive federal government 
     encroachment in this area can be justified by Article I, 
     Section 8, Clause 3.
