            RECOGNIZING McCLYMONDS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable 
accomplishment of the McClymonds High School football team located in 
my congressional district.
  McClymonds High School capped off a 14-0 season on December 10, 2017, 
with its second consecutive 5AA championship, after defeating Visalia's 
Golden West 42-12.
  By winning two State championships in consecutive years, McClymonds 
became the first team in the Oakland Athletic League to achieve this 
impressive feat.
  Now, McClymonds High School is a historic public high school in the 
West Oakland community of my district, with a strong history of 
athletic excellence. NBA legend Bill Russell and Major League Baseball 
Hall of Famer Frank Robinson have graced the halls of McClymonds High 
School.
  Coach Michael Peters has carried forth the same tradition of 
excellence since 1992 and has continuously worked to ensure that his 
athletes succeed on the field but, most importantly, succeed in the 
classroom.
  These young athletes represent the spirit, the resilience, and the 
passion of Oakland. Please join me in congratulating their historic 
championship win.
