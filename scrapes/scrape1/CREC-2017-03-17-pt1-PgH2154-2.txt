                       HEALTH CARE IS COMPLICATED

  (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, President Trump has made some implausible 
statements recently, but one that certainly takes the cake on the issue 
of health care is when he said that nobody knew that health care could 
be so complicated.
  Well, for President Trump and those who are attacking the Affordable 
Care Act, I would like to talk about one little boy who challenges this 
claim.
  This week, of course, we know from the nonpartisan CBO just how 
devastating the Trump-Ryan repeal would be for millions of Americans, 
including Rhett Krawitt, a 9-year-old boy who lives in my district.
  Rhett battled and won a tough fight with leukemia. He spoke to a 
townhall in my district on Monday, where he said: ``Thanks to the 
Affordable Care Act, my parents don't have to worry about losing 
coverage because I have a preexisting condition. My family knows 
exactly how much money our health care will cost. I can stay on my 
parents' plan and get medical insurance when I go to college and 
medical school.''
  And he added one more thing. He said: ``I may only be 9 years old, 
but I have known for a long time that health care is complicated.''
  Mr. Trump, if only you had spoken to this 9-year-old before trying to 
gut health care for millions of Americans.
  Let's not go backward on health care in this country.
