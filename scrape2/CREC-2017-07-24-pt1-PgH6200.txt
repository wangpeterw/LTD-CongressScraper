                       REMEMBERING ROY HERRINGTON

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, recently, the Appling County community 
mourned the loss of lifelong resident Roy Herrington.
  He was a loving husband to his wife of 59 years, Georgia, and a 
dedicated father to his three children: Tami, Jeff, and Julie. Roy was 
an active member of the community. He was a member and a deacon at the 
Baxley First Baptist Church; a past director of Appling County Chamber 
of Commerce; and a recipient of the Chamber Award of Excellence in 
Agriculture.
  Roy was awarded the Appling County Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the 
Year award in 1981.
  During my time traveling the 12th District of Georgia, Roy was one of 
those people who I would always make sure to visit to gain insight on 
serving the great folks of the 12th District.
  Mr. Speaker, we are losing our greatest generation, but as Members of 
Congress and as Americans, we must not forget the lessons they have 
taught us. Every village, every community, has a man of peace and 
influence. In Appling County, that man was Roy Herrington.
  Baxley, Georgia, is a better place because of Roy Herrington. He will 
be remembered often.
