                      MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, if history has taught us anything over 
the years, it is that freedom is not free. It comes at a great price.
  It is easy to take for granted the freedoms we enjoy, but this 
Military Appreciation Month I pray that we all reflect upon the 
sacrifices the men and women of our Armed Forces have made for our 
liberty and our security.
  Specifically, I am reminded today of the 5,100 dedicated men and 
women serving at Dyess Air Force Base, home of the 7th Bomb Wing and 
the 317th Airlift Group, and the 40,000 veterans in my district in west 
Texas.
  It is with them in mind, Madam Speaker, that I would like to express 
my gratitude for those who have served, my sorrow for those who did not 
make it back home, and my condolences to those who have lost someone 
dear in service to our great country. Let us never forget them. Let us 
always remind our children and grandchildren of the sacrifices of those 
who gave up their today so that we can have our tomorrow.
  God bless our men and women in uniform. And God bless these United 
States of America.
