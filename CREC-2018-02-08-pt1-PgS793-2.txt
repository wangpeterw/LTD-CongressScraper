                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Spirit, our lamp and light, we praise Your Holy Name.
  Lord, You are our strength and shield, enabling us to be sure-footed 
even when standing on mountain heights. Stay with our lawmakers. 
Support them with Your mighty hand and keep their feet from slipping. 
Enable our Senators to one day stand before Your presence with great 
joy. Show them Your greatness until the things of Earth grow strangely 
dim in the light of Your glory and grace.
  We pray in Your majestic Name. Amen.
