                     STANDING WITH DACA RECIPIENTS

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, September 5, 2017: that is a day that 
will forever be ingrained in the minds of immigrants and DREAMers as 
the day that Donald Trump crossed a moral line.
  The President is playing hot potato with a group of young people who, 
like me, came to this country ``with heart,'' ``con corazon;'' ``with 
humility,'' ``con humildad;'' and ``with a desire to do more,'' ``con 
el deseo de hacer mas.''
  DREAMers are ``fighters,'' ``luchadores.'' They are fighters, and so 
we will not rest until the Dream Act is the law of the land and until 
DREAMers and their parents can go to sleep without the fear of ICE 
knocking on their door and showing up in their place of worship, 
school, or at a hospital.
  To my colleagues, we urge you to stand with us, stand with 800,000 
DACA recipients, and stand with their parents in passing the Dream Act.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
