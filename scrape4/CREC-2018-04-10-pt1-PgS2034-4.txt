                       TRIBUTE TO BRANDON JENKINS

 Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize 
Brandon Jenkins, the Brevard County Teacher of the Year from Heritage 
High School in Palm Bay, FL.
  Brandon received this important recognition based on his teaching 
philosophy and practice, leadership, professional development, and 
encouragement of parental engagement in the learning process. After 
Brandon was named Teacher of the Year, he said it felt like proof his 
hard work was not in vain. It has always been a dream of his to touch 
the lives of students, as his life was touched many years ago.
  Under Brandon's leadership, Heritage has seen its band membership 
grow from 15 to 130 students. The band's ratings have improved from 
previously receiving poor ratings at competitions to becoming a 
superior-rated concert band for the past 3 years.
  Brandon earned his bachelor of science degree in music education from 
Winston-Salem State University and master of music degree in wind 
conducting from Messiah College. He became the band director at 
Heritage High School and has been a Brevard County Public School 
teacher for 5 years.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Brandon for all his 
hard work and dedication he has given to his students. I wish him 
continued success in the years to come.
