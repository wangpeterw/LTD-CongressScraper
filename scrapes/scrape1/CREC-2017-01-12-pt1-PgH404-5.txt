                   REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to the burden 
ObamaCare has placed upon my constituents.
  They have seen their healthcare costs rise while their quality of 
care has lowered. It is imperative that we repealObamaCare immediately.
  I also emphasize to the folks here and at home that, as we repeal 
ObamaCare, we will make sure there is a stable transitionperiod during 
the replacement so that people do not have the rug pulled out from 
under them. This transition period will give usthe time we need to 
ensure our healthcare reform is full of truly patient-centered 
solutions that allow patients, families, anddoctors to direct their 
health care.
  Congress must focus on the principles of affordability, 
accessibility, and quality to provide the American people withgenuine 
healthcare reform, but we can only get to that point by repealing 
ObamaCare now. I promise to read the bill beforevoting on it, unlike 
how it was passed.
