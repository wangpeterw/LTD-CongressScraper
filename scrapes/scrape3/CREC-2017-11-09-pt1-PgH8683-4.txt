                SALUTING ALL WHO DEFEND OUR GREAT NATION

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, on Veterans Day, we salute all those 
who have defended our great Nation and served in uniform. We say a 
profound thank you for so bravely offering yourself and your services 
for the betterment of our Nation.
  Whether part of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast Guard, 
you have served and sacrificed greatly to secure the freedom we enjoy 
here at home. Your commitment to duty and to serve a cause bigger than 
yourself commands our respect. You continue the greatest traditions of 
responsible citizens in this Republic, and you are a role model for 
younger generations of Americans.
  To the families who have sacrificed alongside our veterans, we say 
thank you. You provide the love and care necessary for our servicewomen 
and -men to continue their honorable work.
  I am honored to serve the veterans in my hometown community, in Bucks 
and Montgomery Counties, and across the Nation. Our gratitude is 
enduring, our support for you steadfast. We have your back.
