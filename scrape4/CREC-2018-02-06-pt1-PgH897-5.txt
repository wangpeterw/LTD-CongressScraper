                   HONORING THE LIFE OF DENISE COHEN

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Denise 
Cohen.
  Denise was a loving mother of two. She worked as a property manager 
in Santa Barbara, California, and always made everyone around her feel 
good.
  She attended the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas with her 
boyfriend, Bo, to celebrate her 56th birthday. Denise was a huge 
country music fan, and she loved concerts and was a vibrant and 
positive woman.
  She is remembered by her son, Jeff, as a strong and beautiful person 
who made a difference in the lives of the people she knew. She always 
had a vibrant and positive attitude.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Denise Cohen's family and 
friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, 
and the whole country grieve with you.
