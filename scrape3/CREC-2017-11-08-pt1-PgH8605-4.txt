                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Jeff Williams, Faith Community Church, Janesville, Wisconsin, 
offered the following prayer:
  Our Father in Heaven, Your Word declares that You have been our 
dwelling place throughout all generations and that, from everlasting to 
everlasting, You are God.
  Your sovereignty when juxtaposed with our humanity humbles us and 
causes us to seek Your face on behalf of our Nation and those who 
govern us.
  When beginning his rule, King Solomon prayed for You to grant him a 
discerning heart to govern Your people and to distinguish between right 
and wrong. Grant that same discernment in this Chamber today.
  I pray for these who have been entrusted with the responsibility to 
govern this great people that they may adhere to the principles and 
convictions our country was founded upon.
  Bless them and their families, I pray. Your prophet Moses prayed 
saying: ``May the favor of the Lord our God rest on us and establish 
the work of our hands for us.'' May that same favor rest upon this, the 
people's House, today.
  In Jesus' name, I pray.
  Amen.
