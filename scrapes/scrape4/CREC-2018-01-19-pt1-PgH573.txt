 HONORING STEPHANIE OHIGASHI, MILDRED OKUDA, AND TOM FUJITA, JAPANESE 
                        CULTURAL SOCIETY OF MAUI

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, Hawaii has long enjoyed a special and 
unique relationship with Japan, and Hawaii's Japanese-American 
community has been integral in shaping our history and collective 
story.
  I rise today to recognize three special leaders: Stephanie Ohigashi, 
Mildred Okuda, and Tom Fujita, three members of the Japanese Cultural 
Society of Maui, who, for decades, have been dedicated to preserving 
Japanese culture and heritage in the County of Maui.
  These three leaders have gone above and beyond working to strengthen 
ties between Hawaii and Japan and their service to Maui's community. 
They have worked to create a sister-city relationship between Maui 
County and Fukuyama City, organize cross-cultural and educational 
opportunities, cultivate the stories and history of the first Japanese 
immigrants to Hawaii, and so much more.
  In recognition of their many contributions and legacies, they have 
each been selected for awards from the Japanese Cultural Society of 
Maui.
  ``Thanks,'' ``Mahalo,'' to Stephanie, Mildred, and Tom for your 
service to the people of Hawaii.
