                   COMMEMORATING KOREAN AMERICAN DAY

  (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate Korean American 
Day, which celebrates the arrival of the first 102 Korean immigrants to 
the United States on January 13, 1903.
  The first Korean immigrants came in pursuit of the American Dream and 
initially served as farmworkers, wage laborers, and section hands. 
Through resilience, effort, and sacrifice, they established the 
foundation for their children and future generations. Today, nearly 2 
million Korean Americans have honored their ancestors' legacy and 
achieved the American Dream by transforming all aspects of American 
life: from Roy Choi, who joined Latino and Korean culture to create new 
cuisines that have won the stomachs of all Americans; to the first 
Korean American elected to Congress, Jay Kim; and to the countless 
Korean Americans who run successful small businesses.
  I am honored to represent the largest Korean population in the 
country and to reintroduce this resolution on the 115th anniversary of 
the first Korean immigrant arrivals. I call upon my colleagues to join 
me in acknowledging the Korean Americans who helped strengthen and 
shape our country.
