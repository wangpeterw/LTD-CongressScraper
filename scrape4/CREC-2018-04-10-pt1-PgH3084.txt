                      2018 MASTERS GOLF TOURNAMENT

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, last week, in Augusta, Georgia, we celebrated 
a tradition that is truly unlike any other. The first full week of 
April is always one filled with excitement and stellar competition as 
we watch the most talented golfers in the world take on the famed 
Augusta National Golf Course.
  For 1 week each year, the world gets a glimpse into Georgia 12 and 
the wonderful people who live and work there, the district I have the 
great honor of representing. From the world famous azaleas to the 
delicious pimento cheese sandwiches, the tradition that encompasses the 
Masters is truly something special.
  We also heard a historic announcement from Chairman Fred Ridley that 
the final round of a new competition, the Augusta National Women's 
Amateur tournament, will be played at the Augusta National, furthering 
the Masters tradition and the future of golf.
  I would like to congratulate Chairman Ridley for his leadership in 
making this important decision. I would also like to congratulate this 
year's Masters champion and Augusta University graduate, Patrick Reed, 
for his outstanding performance under the greatest pressure experienced 
in any competition: the back nine at Augusta.
  It is my great privilege to welcome people from around the globe to 
the world's greatest sporting event as we count down the days until 
Masters 2019.
