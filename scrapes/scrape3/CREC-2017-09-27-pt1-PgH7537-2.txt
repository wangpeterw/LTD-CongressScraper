                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Dennis Jokela, Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department, 
Kalamazoo, Michigan, offered the following prayer:
  Father God, we are grateful to be able to come into Your presence in 
a free country such as ours.
  I ask that You bless this great Nation.
  I ask You to pour out Your wisdom and revelation knowledge into 
everyone hearing the sound of my voice.
  I ask You to let Your glory shine like a light emanating from this 
place, filling our entire country.
  I speak unification of our country in our original, can-do, American 
spirit.
  I speak life into those dead and dying places in our land, Lord.
  For those places that are in need of Your restoration power, I ask 
that You pour it out on them.
  I ask that You bless these proceedings today and bless the work of 
our hands.
  I ask all of this in Jesus' mighty name.
  Amen.
