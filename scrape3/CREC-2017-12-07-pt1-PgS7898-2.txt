       THANKING THE SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA AND THE GUEST CHAPLAIN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to thank our colleague from 
Nebraska and our guest this morning for reminding us of the wonderful 
story of Boys Town. We were discussing the movie from the late 1930s 
staring Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney, as well as learning what has 
happened to Boys Town since then.
  Thank you so much, Senator Fischer and our guest, for bringing us up 
to date on the latest on Boys Town.
