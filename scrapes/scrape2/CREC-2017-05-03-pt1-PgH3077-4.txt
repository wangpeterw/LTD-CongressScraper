     MATKINS FLOWERS AND GREENHOUSE CELEBRATES 90 YEARS IN BUSINESS

  (Mr. WOMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a small business in my 
district that is celebrating its 90th anniversary this week.
  Matkins Flowers and Greenhouse in Bentonville, Arkansas, has served 
the northwest Arkansas region since 1927, when Henry Lenny Matkins, 
Sr., founded the company. Throughout the last nine decades, this 
Arkansas small business has persevered in good times and bad, and it 
serves as an example of how you make a small business sustainable with 
integrity, accountability, and hard work.
  Working through the Great Depression, World War II, and the modern 
era, the Matkins family has continuously exhibited the importance of 
the family-owned small business to the American economy. Now in its 
fourth generation of leadership with Jim and his son Jeff, it is worth 
celebrating this important milestone.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent this outstanding family and 
offer my thanks and admiration for the success of Matkins Flowers and 
Greenhouse.
