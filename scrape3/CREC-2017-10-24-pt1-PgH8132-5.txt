                           REJECT THE BUDGET

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, it has been 8 years. For 8 years, from the 
day Barack Obama was sworn in until the day he left office, I heard my 
Republican colleagues telling me that we weren't paying enough 
attention to the national debt, that we were mortgaging our children's 
future, and that we needed to do more to get our debt and deficit under 
control. Heck, to be honest with you, I agreed with what they were 
saying.
  But now that they are in power--control the Presidency and both 
Chambers--what are they doing?
  Totally ignoring the debt deficit is what they are doing.
  Worst yet, actually, the budget of theirs that has just come out adds 
$1.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. This is their 
stated strategy in the budget. This is $1.5 trillion our children and 
grandchildren need to pay back. I just can't believe it. The hypocrisy 
is beyond belief.
  Apparently, my Republican colleagues are only fiscally conservative 
when the Democrats are in control.
  Let's reject this unconscionable budget and work across the aisle for 
tax reform that actually improves our children's future.
