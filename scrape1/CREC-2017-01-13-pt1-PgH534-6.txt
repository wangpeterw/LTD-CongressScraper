    COMMEMORATING THE SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EARTHQUAKE IN HAITI

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the anniversary of the 
devastating earthquake that struck the nation of Haiti onJanuary 12, 
2010. This Thursday marked 7 years since a magnitude 7.0 earthquake 
struck Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, killingHaiti's population 
center and the seat of its government.
  The aftermath of the quake was unimaginable. 316,000 people perished, 
and 1.3 million were displaced. This tragedy struck anation already 
hobbled by grinding poverty, health disparities, and food insecurity. 
Approximately 147,000 people remaininternally displaced in Haiti, with 
countless others displaced outside IDP camps.

  The world and the American people, though, responded to the 
earthquake with generosity. To date, the United States hascontributed 
billions to recovery efforts, along with donors from around the world.
  The Assessing Progress in Haiti Act, which was a bipartisan effort 
with Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and wassigned into law 3 years 
ago, provides us critical oversight to ensure that aid continues in the 
most effective way possible.
  Unfortunately, more work needs to be done. Haiti continues to be 
struck by natural disasters, including severe drought anddevastating 
effects of Hurricane Matthew in 2016.
