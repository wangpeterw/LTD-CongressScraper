veterans managing this challenging condition.
  Throughout my time in Congress, I have paid close attention to 
effective alternative therapies for the symptoms of PTSD, from service 
dogs to equine therapy, from book and writing groups to yoga and 
acupuncture. A group in my home State of Maine, called K9s on The Front 
Line, has created an extraordinary model. At no cost to the veteran, 
volunteer police dog handlers teach participants to train their own 
dogs or dogs selected from shelters to be PTSD service dogs.
  Many of these veterans have had years of therapy or drug treatment 
with limited success. Yet, in so many instances, the impact of these 
service dogs on both veterans and their families has been nothing short 
of miraculous.
  I am proud to honor my constituents at K9s on The Front Line for 
improving the lives of Maine veterans with PTSD.
