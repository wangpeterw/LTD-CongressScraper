                         SUSTAIN THE RESISTANCE

  (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this is undoubtedly the greatest 100 days 
of any President in human history. Give President Trump a grade of A-
plus for the greatest broken campaign promises in history; the greatest 
meaningless executive orders, offering showy ceremonies when a mere 
phone call would have done the job; certainly, the very greatest number 
of insulting tweets--no President in history has ever come close; the 
greatest conflicts of interest; the greatest embrace of authoritarian 
leaders; the greatest gap between reality and fantasy, unquestionably. 
He talks as a populist and he governs as a plutocrat.
  The greatest thing about Trump's 100 days is that America still 
exists without a major war or an economic free fall. Every day we 
survive without a Trump-inspired catastrophe is a great day for our 
country.
  Sustain the resistance and remain hopeful for a Trump-free America.
