          PRESIDENT TRUMP MUST RELEASE HIS INCOME TAX RETURNS

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I had a town hall in Memphis on Saturday. We 
had over 1,000 people there, and over 10,000 people live streamed on 
Facebook. Many were concerned about Russia's influence with this 
administration.
  Something smells. It would be like a vegan going and talking about 
how much they were supporting the Beef and Dairy Council, or that 
Chick-fil-A cow going up and saying: Eat more chicken.
  There is something else to it. There is an ulterior motive.
  This President's love affair with Russia, his constant support for 
Russia and Putin--one of the most villainous leaders on the face of 
this Earth--spells a problem. We need to get to the bottom of it, and 
one way we will find out is through his taxes.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the President to release his income taxes to the 
American people. It is so important to us having confidence in his 
administration and to our government's ability to withstand an evil 
power, as Ronald Reagan called them.
