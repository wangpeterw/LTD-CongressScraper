                             MEDIA BLACKOUT

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, here are recent examples of the 
liberal national media's ignoring inconvenient news:
  The economy grew by 3 percent last quarter, the fastest pace in 
years, but you might not know this good news because of the media 
blackout of the story by broadcast networks.
  The media blackout extended to a story by The New York Times on a 
current Senator's corruption trial, which failed to mention he was a 
Democrat in a 1,200-word story.
  The media hyped the claim that climate change was responsible for 
Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but the media blacked out the fact that the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that hurricanes are not 
increasing in intensity or frequency.
  This is what the liberal media do: they ignore the facts that 
contradict

the liberal view they want to promote with their readers and viewers.
