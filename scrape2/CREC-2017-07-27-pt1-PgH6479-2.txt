           IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT OF JUDGE FRED A. STINE

  (Mr. MASSIE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the retirement of 
Judge Fred A. Stine, the Chief Circuit Court Judge of the 17th Judicial 
Circuit in Campbell County, Kentucky.
  Judge Stine graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1973, and 
received his J.D. from the Salmon P. Chase College of Law at Northern 
Kentucky University in 1978. He then worked in private practice for 2 
years until his appointment as the Assistant United States Attorney for 
the Eastern District of Kentucky.
  Judge Stine has honorably served the Commonwealth as circuit court 
judge since 2005. He has many awards, which include a Distinguished 
Service Recognition from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and a 
Special Recognition for Victims' Rights from the U.S. Department of 
Justice.
  Throughout his career and despite his heavy case docket, Judge Stine 
selflessly gave his time to serve his community. Judge Stine is a true 
public servant who has served his State and Nation well.
  On behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and all of the citizens of 
the Fourth District, I am honored to wish Judge Fred A. Stine the very 
best in his retirement. Thank you from us all.
