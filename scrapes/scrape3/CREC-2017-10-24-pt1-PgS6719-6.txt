                   NATURAL DISASTER EMERGENCY FUNDING

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today, the Senate will pass an 
important measure to provide relief for communities that are struggling 
to rebuild after the natural disasters that have affected many 
different parts of our country. Soon, this emergency funding 
legislation will be on its way to the President for his signature.
  With these new resources, Federal aid workers from FEMA and the rest 
of the administration can continue their critical recovery operations, 
including search and rescue missions, debris removal, and 
infrastructure repair, as well as providing much needed assistance to 
individuals and to families.
  I will continue to monitor these disaster response efforts, and I 
will continue to engage with leaders both in Washington and on the 
ground. The Senate will also continue doing its part to help the 
victims recover.
