                  THE MENACE OF THE DESERT--WARMONGER

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Ayatollah, the menace of the 
desert, had defied yet another U.N. resolution prohibiting missile 
tests. No surprise. Iran just can't follow the rules. Time and time 
again, Iran has tested ballistic missiles with no consequences. The 
last time, they launched two missiles with ``Israel must be wiped off 
the Earth'' written on them in Hebrew. Also, the Ayatollah has clearly 
stated numerous times he wants to destroy the United States.
  Even worse, Mr. Speaker, we are paying him to do it. Yes, that is 
right. Obama slipped the rogue tyrant $150 billion hoping that 
appeasement would make the Ayatollah be nice. Well, guess what? Obama 
was wrong, and the U.S. is less safe. The Ayatollah, in my opinion, is 
using our money to build weapons to destroy us.
  Mr. Speaker, there must be clear consequences for the dictator of 
Iran and his mullah cronies for warmongering. The people of Iran need 
to change this regime, and the menace of the desert just needs to go.
  And that is just the way it is.
