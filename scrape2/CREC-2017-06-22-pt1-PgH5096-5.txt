             JUNE IS ALZHEIMER'S AND BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer's and 
Brain Awareness Month. Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death 
in the United States, and it has reached crisis proportions.
  There is no effective treatment, no means of prevention, and no 
method for slowing the progression of the disease. Sadly, one in three 
seniors will die with the disease.
  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5 
million Americans were living with Alzheimer's disease in the year 
2013. This number is expected to almost triple to 14 million by the 
year 2050.
  Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable. Alzheimer's also has a devastating 
impact on caregivers and loved ones of those diagnosed with the 
disease. More than 15 million Americans provide unpaid care to family 
and friends living with Alzheimer's and other dementias.
  Compared with caregivers for people without dementia, twice as many 
caregivers for people with dementia indicate substantial emotional, 
financial, and physical stress.
  Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. Let's join the fight. Let's take 
the pledge to raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease, and to never 
stop searching for a cure.
