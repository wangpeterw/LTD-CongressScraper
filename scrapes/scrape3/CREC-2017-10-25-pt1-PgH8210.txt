                               TAX REFORM

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, day after day, the President and 
congressional Republicans have sought to frame their tax proposal as a 
tax cut for hardworking middle class families and not a tax cut for the 
wealthiest Americans, even going so far as to say it will not add to 
the deficit. Quite simply, they are trying to sell the American people 
a dream that will not become a reality.
  In New Jersey alone, 25 percent of the residents will see their taxes 
increase by $2,400, annually. That means one in four New Jerseyans are 
affected by this failed strategy of trickle-down economics.
  These aren't the very rich. I am talking about New Jersey's regular 
working families. These New Jerseyans are a part of the 47 million 
Americans that will see a tax increase.
  This horrific tax reform plan and the rhetoric my Republican 
colleagues are using to garner support is simply fake news. It is a tax 
break for the wealthiest Americans.
  I refuse to participate in the crippling of the middle class and the 
working class and the halting of continued growth of the American 
economy by rubberstamping this billionaires-first tax scheme.
