                         REMEMBERING DAVID CULP

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the 
recent passing of David Culp. He was an unassuming American hero, a man 
who spent much of his life working quietly but tirelessly to reduce the 
threat of nuclear weapons and eliminate them from the face of the 
Earth. For more than 15 years, David led efforts at the Friends 
Committee on National Legislation and in the arms control community to 
reach that goal, working with Members of Congress on both sides of the 
aisle.
  Over the years, as I fought to oppose new nuclear weapons and to 
support vital arms control agreements, I always knew that David would 
be there with me, fighting for what was right. His persistence, his 
focus on concrete goals, and his constant, good-natured advocacy helped 
make the United States and the world a safer place.
  It was President Harry Truman who said: ``It's amazing what you can 
accomplish if you don't care who gets the credit.'' David, who lived by 
those words, deserves enormous credit. He will be sorely 
missed.
