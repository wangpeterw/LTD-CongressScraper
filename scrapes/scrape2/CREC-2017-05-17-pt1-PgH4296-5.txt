                                HOKA HEY

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, it is time that all of America knows a phrase 
that the Manvel Mavericks in the 22nd District of Texas know well. The 
phrase is ``Hoka Hey. Hoka Hey.'' That means be unselfish; compete for 
team, school, and town. Hoka Hey carried the Mavericks to the men's 
track and field team title for Texas 5A. That happened last week.
  The team started rough. After seven events, they had 8 points. They 
were in 10th place. But the spirit of Hoka Hey came back during the 
relays. Our guys burned up the track. When the relays were over, the 
Mavs had 50 points and Port Arthur Memorial, 41.
  Hoka Hey had 85 points when the meet was over. They were the State 
champions. Congratulations, Hoka Hey Manvel Mavericks, State champions, 
Texas 5A.
