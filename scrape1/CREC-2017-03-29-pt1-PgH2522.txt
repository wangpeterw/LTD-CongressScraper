                   HONORING SERVICE OF DR. THOM MASON

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The Chair 
recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann) for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of 
Dr. Thom Mason, who has served as the director of the Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory for 10 years. Thom joined ORNL in 1998 as a 
condensed matter physicist, and quickly demonstrated his talents as a 
visionary scientific leader.
  He led the completion of the one-of-a-kind Spallation Neutron Source, 
which has provided a decade of exceptional research. When promoted to 
lab director, Thom led ORNL to many other successes: the development of 
two supercomputers which at different times ranked as the most powerful 
in the world; and ORNL's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility, which is 
revitalizing American manufacturing.
  Thom served our community as chairman of the Oak Ridge Public Schools 
Education Foundation, leading the multimillion-dollar expansion of Oak 
Ridge High School; and as chairman of Innovation Valley, a regional 
economic development partnership.
  Thank you, Dr. Thom Mason, for many years of dedicated service to the 
great State of Tennessee and our Nation.
