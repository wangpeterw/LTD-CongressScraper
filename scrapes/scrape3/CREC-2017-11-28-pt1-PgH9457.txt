                         NATIONAL DAY OF GIVING

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today is Giving Tuesday, a 
global day dedicated to giving back.
  Last week, we celebrated Thanksgiving, and families across the 
country gathered to celebrate and give thanks for all their blessings.
  Today, on the National Day of Giving, many come together for a common 
purpose: to celebrate generosity and to give.
  Giving Tuesday kicks off the charitable season when many focus on 
their holiday and end-of-year giving to worthy causes. Charitable 
giving is a force for good, which is why the tax reform package, 
approved by the House, maintains this important deduction.
  Charities, families, businesses, community centers, and people around 
the world will lend their time or their personal resources to 
philanthropic efforts across the Nation.
  Giving Tuesday also brings together the collective power of a unique 
blend of partners--nonprofits, civic organizations, businesses and 
corporations, as well as families and individuals--to encourage and 
amplify small acts of kindness.
  As a global movement, Giving Tuesday unites countries around the 
world by sharing our capacity to care for and empower one another. That 
is something we can all celebrate.
