    RECOGNIZING THE 150TH BIRTHDAY OF LITTLE RIVER COUNTY, ARKANSAS

  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a milestone for 
Little River County, Arkansas. On March 5, the county will celebrate 
its 150th birthday.
  According to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas, Little River County came 
into existence following an act of the Arkansas General Assembly, 
officially separating from Hempstead and Sevier Counties in 1867.
  During its century and a half, the citizens of Little River County 
have shown resilience and innovation as they weathered the Great 
Depression, sent its men to fight in World War II, and grew the local 
economy in the years since. In recent years, Little River County has 
withstood severe flooding, but they have come back strong and 
resilient.
  Little River County is blessed with natural resources, including 
forestry, agriculture, and minerals that all provide the inputs for 
manufacturing jobs that play a big role in the local economy, and will 
continue to do so in Little River's next 150 years.
  I am proud to call Little River County part of the Fourth 
Congressional District, and I congratulate its citizens on 150 years of 
progress.
