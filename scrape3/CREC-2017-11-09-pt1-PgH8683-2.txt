         HAPPY 242ND BIRTHDAY TO THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the 242nd 
birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps.
  In today's own unpredictable world, the Marines are as important and 
essential now as ever before.
  I am proud to have a member of the Marine Corps serving in my 
Washington office as a legislative fellow. Paul Camacho achieved the 
rank of staff sergeant during his service from 2000 to 2008. He is a 
native of Philadelphia and served as a field artillery cannoneer.
  At one point, Paul was the youngest marine in the entire Marine 
Corps, an achievement that is celebrated each year during cake-cutting 
ceremonies.
  To Paul and all those who are part of ``The Few. The Proud. The 
Marines,'' I say happy birthday and thank you for your service. Thank 
you to all who have served in one of the most respected fighting forces 
in the world.
  Mr. Speaker, it was President Ronald Reagan who said ``some people 
spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the 
world. But, the Marines don't have that problem.''
  Happy birthday.
