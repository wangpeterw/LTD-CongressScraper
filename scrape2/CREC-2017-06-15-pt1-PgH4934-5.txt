     COMMENDING CAPITOL POLICE FOR OUTSTANDING BRAVERY AND COURAGE

  (Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, ``As a law enforcement officer, my 
fundamental duty is to serve mankind; to safeguard lives and property; 
to protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression 
or intimidation, and the peaceful against violence or disorder. . . .''
  Mr. Speaker, that is the first paragraph of the Law Enforcement Code 
of Ethics that every law enforcement officer across this country swears 
to upon their becoming a law enforcement officer and accepting that 
badge.
  I can tell you, yesterday, during the horrible event that took place, 
Officers Bailey and Griner with the Capitol Hill Police performed their 
duties above and beyond the expected.
  Mr. Speaker, I just want to take this opportunity on behalf of law 
enforcement officers across America to thank them for doing their job 
with such outstanding bravery and courage.
  I also want to let the Scalise family and the Mika family know that 
they are in our prayers. We pray for their speedy recovery.
  God bless.
