                     DIRECT CONNECT TO SUCCESS ACT

  (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1

year degree opens up even more opportunities for these students, many 
of whom come from underserved and rural areas.
  This has been a nationally recognized program that is only available 
in a few States, but by expanding this simple, proven program 
nationwide, we will extend the opportunity to continue higher education 
to millions more hardworking, deserving students.
  We can all agree that government has a role to play in reducing 
barriers to success, and this guaranteed admission is a low-cost, 
highly efficient way to remove this big barrier. I ask you and others 
to join me in support of the Direct Connect to Success Act to create 
more opportunities to pursue the American Dream for all students.
