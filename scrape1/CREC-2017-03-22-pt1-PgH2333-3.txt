                             HEALTH MATTERS

  (Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I spoke with a dynamic, 
impressive young woman, Maryn White, from Lee's Summit, Missouri.
  Maryn is a 16-year-old sophomore at Lee's Summit West High School. 
When she was 10 years old, she was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. 
Despite a lot of pain and a number of major surgeries, Maryn is active 
in her high school and is raising money for a cure.
  Maryn was the winner of the Dream Factory of Kansas City. Instead of 
going on a cruise ship or some tour to an exotic place, she came to 
Washington to talk to people who are about to vote on her health. She 
is absolutely infuriated that money is not going to the NIH to continue 
to do research for a cure.
  There are thousands of similar stories all over the country. This is 
not a political matter, this is a matter of life and death for people 
all over this country.
  Yes, I am saying that TrumpCare will make America ache again.
