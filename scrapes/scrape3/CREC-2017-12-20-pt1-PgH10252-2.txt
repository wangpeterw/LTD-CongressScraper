  CONGRATULATING THE NORTH CAROLINA A&T STATE UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM

  (Mr. WALKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the North 
Carolina A&T State University football team, winner of the 2017 
Celebration Bowl and the HBCU national championship. This win capped 
off a historic year for the undefeated Aggies, a first in Mid-Eastern 
Athletic Conference history, and marks their second championship in 3 
years.
  In the final minutes, the Aggies marched 56 yards in seven plays. The 
drive was capped off with a fake spike and a quarterback sneak on the 
goal line for the game-winning touchdown by Lamar Raynard.
  MVP Marquell Cartwright, who followed the great Tarik Cohen, rushed 
for 110 yards and two touchdowns. With the guidance of Coach Broadway 
on the field and the leadership of Chancellor Harold Martin in the 
classroom, North Carolina A&T is leading the way in showing the great 
value and the importance of our Nation's HBCUs.
  I am proud to represent this distinguished school of academic and 
athletic excellence, leaving only one question remaining, Mr. Speaker: 
Can I get an ``Aggie Pride''?
