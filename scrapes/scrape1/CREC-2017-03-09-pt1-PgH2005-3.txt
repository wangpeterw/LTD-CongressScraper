               REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE PLAN FAILS AMERICANS

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, the Republican healthcare plan would 
not only fail to improve upon the Affordable Care Act, it would undo 
the benefits millions of Americans depend on and devastate our economy 
in the process.
  This plan would strip millions of working families of their health 
care, cut benefits for millions more, and increase premiums for older 
Americans by 25 percent. It would ravage our economy by destabilizing 
the healthcare sector and pushing State and local governments to the 
brink of bankruptcy.
  Four Republican Senators have even rejected this bill because of its 
economically devastating Medicaid cuts.
  The Republican plan would force the counties I represent to pay 
hundreds of millions of dollars more for health care.
  This bill would force local governments to raise property taxes or 
deny health care.
  We need healthcare solutions that improve care and strengthen our 
economy at the same time. We must not settle for this plan, which 
accomplishes neither.
