                        REMEMBERING TIM MITCHELL

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we were all saddened by the news that 
Tim Mitchell, a longtime member of the Democratic floor staff, passed 
away this past weekend after his heartbreaking battle with brain 
cancer. I know the Democratic leader will have more to say in just a 
moment, but I wanted to take a moment myself to reflect on Tim's Senate 
service and express our condolences to his family.
  Last September, the former Democratic leader and I had the 
opportunity to recognize Tim for a remarkable 25 years of Senate 
service. As we noted then, Tim has long been a critical member of the 
Senate team who worked tirelessly with his colleagues on both sides to 
ensure that the floor operated smoothly and efficiently.
  Despite his passion for this institution, however, we know that Tim's 
family always remained his top priority. I know his wife Alicia and his 
young son Ben know this as well. Our prayers are with them at this 
immensely difficult time.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
