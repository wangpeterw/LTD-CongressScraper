                        REMEMBERING PEARL HARBOR

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the attack on 
Pearl Harbor and in memory of those who gave their lives on that tragic 
day.
  Today marks 76 years since the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, where 
2,403 Americans lost their lives. Many years have passed since that 
day, and, sadly, there are fewer and fewer survivors of the attacks 
left with us; however, it is vital that we never let their memory fade.
  In my own district, a group of Pearl Harbor survivors, other 
veterans, and community members have dedicated themselves to preserving 
the memory of this attack. Every year, the city of Mission, Kansas, 
hosts a memorial to observe this date.
  One of my constituents, Dorwin Lamkin, is a veteran, Pearl Harbor 
survivor, and has played a key role in organizing this event. I have 
had the privilege of attending this ceremony in the past, and I applaud 
them for continuing this important tradition.
  Let us never forget the fallen and the survivors of Pearl Harbor, and 
may we work every day to honor their memory and sacrifice.
