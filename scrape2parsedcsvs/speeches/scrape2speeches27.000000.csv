8485,topic-id,821,"Mr.Speaker, before it was cool to quote Ronald Reagan's national security philosophy of peace through strength, there was our first Commander in Chief, George Washington, who, in his first State of the Union address, said, ``. . . to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.''  See, maintaining a strong national defense is not a new concept.  While more war has been diverted, more peace has been kept, and more freedom has been defended by our Nation's armed services, today we risk not only our Nation's security, but the lives of those who serve if we fail to adequately fund our military.  The policies and posture of the past 8 years under the previous administration have left our defense arsenal dilapidated, our position in the world diminished, our allies doubtful, and, unfortunately, our enemies even more determined.  Our military men and women have faced years of cuts, almost a quarter of our entire military budget, with defense spending at historic lows, over $170 billion, since 2010.  So as the world becomes increasingly dangerous and unstable, the government has forced our armed services to do more with less.  One of the United States' greatest assets in our national security arsenal and one of the crown jewels of west Texas is Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Dyess plays a key role in protecting our democracy against the rising global threats, and our airmen from Dyess have been deployed all over the world in countless military and humanitarian operations. Additionally, Dyess hosts the largest B-1 bomber base in the Nation; and the city of Abilene has won the Air Force's award for most supportive communities so many times, they actually changed the name of the award to the Abilene award.  Now, that may sound like I am bragging, but in Texas, that is just telling the truth.  But while we put the lives of these men and women on the line daily and ask them to defend our Nation, they are crippled by this discouraging reality. The Air Force is now the smallest and the oldest it has been in our Nation's history. Altogether, given the current demand, our Nation's Air Force is short 1,500 pilots, 4,000 mechanics.  Before the House Armed Services Committee, General Stephen Wilson testified: ``Today we find ourselves less than 50 percent ready across our Air Force, and we have pockets that are even below that.''  In fact, just to get by, the Air Force has been utilizing bombers that were designed and constructed for World War  This is a national security crisis, Mr.This is a great American travesty.  Why?  Because I believe our former President, for political reasons, in my opinion, arbitrarily withdrew troops from critical battlefronts and dangerously drew down our overall military resources.  Today, on behalf of Dyess Air Force Base and all the brave men and women who keep our great country safe, I urge my colleagues to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, which will rebuild our national security, repair our national defense, and restore America's leadership position in the world.  The NDAA will provide our military with the resources they need to address our current threats. We have increased funding 10 percent over the previous administration. The NDAA will fund Dyess Air Force Base and other military installations at appropriate levels, increase the size of our armed services, enhance and modernize our defense arsenal, give our troops a pay raise.  If anybody in the Federal Government has performed with excellence and with courage and distinction, it is our men and women in uniform, and they deserve a pay raise.  This NDAA will also build on the reforms that we have enacted over the last 2 years to update, improve, and streamline services to our armed services.  By passing the NDAA, we send a message to the world that America will continue to be the greatest force for good in the history of mankind; a message to our allies who promote liberty and democracy that you can count on us to defend you, we have got your back; a message to our brave military men and women that we are standing firmly behind you, we are going to put our money where our mouth is, we are going to protect you as you protect us; and a message to our enemies that America is no longer in the business of making idle threats.  Mr.Speaker, before I close, I want to thank Chairman Thornberry for his hard work on this bill and for being a tireless advocate for our military. I am proud to call him a fellow west Texan, and I am even more proud to call him my friend.  One must wonder, on the heels of our 241st birthday, how did this oldest continuous democracy persist for two centuries against all odds? Don't you wonder?  Mr.Speaker, vote for NDAA, vote for our military.

Invisible wounds like PTS are just as important and worthy of treatment as physical injuries. Seeking help for PTS is not a sign of weakness or defeat, but a show of strength and commitment to a full and healthy life.  Treating PTS is not a one-size-fits-all process either. Our veterans need options to find the treatments that work best for their unique needs. That is why I am proud my legislation, the COVER Act, has been signed into law and will help increase access to evidence-based alternative therapies at the  For National PTS Awareness Month, I stand committed to serving our Nation's heroes and improving their treatment options.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgH5307-2.txt,1838,AUTHORIZING USE OF EMANCIPATION HALL IN THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER,2017.0,29.0,May

8662,topic-id,3431,"Madam President, I want to talk about what we are doing today and how important it is, how unique it is in the history of the country. Since 1789, 112 people have served on the Supreme It is hard not to be reminded today, as we vote for the replacement for Justice Scalia, that he served on the Court for 26 years after Ronald Reagan, who appointed him, left the White House and 13 years after President Reagan died. Clearly, the impact of a Supreme Court nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate is one of those things that has the potential to last long beyond either the service of those in the Senate at the time or beyond those of the President at the time. It is a significant decision.  A Federal Court appointment, generally an appointment for life, is different than an appointment for someone who serves during the tenure of the I think almost all of us look at judicial appointments differently than we look at Cabinet appointments and other appointments that are concurrent with the President's term. This is an appointment that lasts as long as the judge is willing to serve and able to serve.  At 49 years old, Judge Gorsuch, who has already been a judge for 10 years, should know whether he likes being a judge. It would appear, and we would hope, he will have a long and healthy life to use his skills on the I think those skills are very obvious in the over 2,000 decisions he has been part of, of the 800 decisions he has written as a circuit judge, the appeals judge above other Federal judges and right below the Supreme Court.[[Page S2437]]  So he is someone who comes to this job understanding the job, with a significant body of work that the Senate has had plenty of time to look at and the President had time to look at before this nomination was made. In those 800 opinions Judge Gorsuch has written, he has been overturned by the Court he will now sit on, the U.Supreme Court, exactly 1 time. That is an incredible average of decisionmaking if 1 of 800 times is the only time a court that is the court of appeals for you, the Supreme Court in this case, decides that your decision did not meet their view. Now, that does not mean that your decision did not meet your view of the law, if you are Judge Gorsuch, or your view of the Of course, both of those things, after today--his view of the law, his view of how you apply the law--will go to the Court with him.  At the White House event where his nomination was announced, Judge Gorsuch said that a good judge is not always happy with his opinions. Now, what would that mean? I thought that was very reassuring in the sense that his job as a judge is to read the law, to look at the Constitution, and to determine how the facts of the case meet the reality of the law.  One of the things that makes this a great country to live in, a great country to work in, and a great country to take a chance in is the one thing you can rely on, hopefully--the rule of law. The one thing you can rely on, when good lawyers read the law, is that they all understand it to mean the same thing, and you move forward with whatever decision you make on that. What Judge Gorsuch was saying was that personal opinions are not always satisfied by reading the law. What he also, I think, reflects is a view that the law is what the law was intended to mean at the time.  There are ways to change the law. If the country has changed, if the world has changed, if circumstances have changed, there are ways to change the law, and that is our job. That is not the job of any Federal judges anywhere, including on the Supreme Their job is to determine what the law was intended to mean when it was written, and their job is to determine what the Constitution was intended to mean when it was written. Everything the Constitution intended was not what we would want to live with today, and that is why we have that long list of amendments, starting with the Bill of  Even immediately, the people who wrote the Constitution said that we have to add some things to this because this does not mean what we really want it to mean as it is applied. So you get the Bill of Yet that is not the job of the It is the job of the Congress to pass laws, the President to do his job of vetoing and sending those laws back or of signing them into law. The Court's job is what Judge Gorsuch understands it to be.  He said in his hearings: I have one client, and that client is the law. That client is not either party appearing before the That client is not the government. That client is the law. I think he also said that judges are not politicians in robes.  We have a job to do that is different than the job of the Court, and I think, as we send Judge Gorsuch to the Court today--to be the 113th person in the history of the country to serve on the Court--we send a person who has an understanding of what a judge should do. Most Americans, when they think about what the Court is supposed to do, would clearly understand that is the job of the There are other jobs to be done, and they are to be done in other places. I think he will be a great addition to the Court with his 10 years of experience as a judge and as the judge that other Federal judges' cases are appealed to. What great training he has had to get ready for the  Then, of course, to get this job done, we had to return to the traditional standard that has always been the standard in the country, until the last few years, as to how Presidential nominations are dealt with. It is easy to confuse, I think, the unique role of the Senate in its having some barriers that the House does not have with regard to advancing legislation. Since, basically, 1789, that has been applied to legislation. The Senate has always seen its job as wanting to be sure the minority is heard before we move forward. Yet, starting in 1789, there was never a supermajority for Presidential nominations, whether it was to the Cabinet or the  It is impossible to find, even before 1968, any case in which the Senate came together and said: We are officially going to decide that we are not going to have a vote on this judge. Now, not every judge got a vote, but when every judge got a vote, a majority of Senators determined whether that judge would go on the Court or not. Two members of the Court today did not get 60 votes. Clarence Thomas got 52 votes, and I think Judge Alito got 58 votes. Two members did not get 60 votes, but nobody thought they needed 60 votes because that had never been part of the structure of how judges got on the  I think what we have done this week is return the Senate to, essentially, the practice on Presidential nominees that for 214 years was the way nominees were always dealt with.  In 2013, the Senate was controlled by our friends on the other side of the aisle. With the roughly 1,250 to 1,300 Presidential nominations, they decided that every nomination that was available to them--for every judge where there was a vacancy, for every person where the President might have had a vacancy to fill--would be determined by a simple majority. From that moment on, everybody, I think, should not have been surprised, when we eventually had a Supreme Court vacancy--and this is the first one since that happened--that whoever was in charge would extend that same majority to the Supreme Now all Presidential nominees are back to where they had been for 214 years.  I heard the minority leader--I heard my friend Mr.Schumer--talk about the importance of our recommitting ourselves to the protections for the minority in passing legislation. I think we can do that. Frankly, this exercise of refreshing our minds as to how legislation has always been handled in that way, I believe, has probably created a greater commitment to that--to the legislative supermajority to move forward with debate--than we have had for a while.  I think the leader of our friends on the other side and certainly the leader on our side have both said nobody is willing to back down on the challenges the Senate faces when we are required to come together to get things done.  The Senate is unique. Essentially, it takes 6 years for every Senator to run for election. After some new sense of the direction of the country occurs, voters basically have to say again and again and maybe a third time: No, we really want to change the way the country has run up until now. Quick decisions are not necessarily the best decisions in a democracy, and in our democracy, this institution--the Senate--is the legislative institution that determines that there is a necessary either coming together of the people who are here at the time or for voters to say at another time: No, you did not get it the first time, and we are sending different people because we really want to make this change.  I think the vote today and the traditions of the country send that 113th person into the history of America to serve a lifetime term on the I am confident the President's nominee and the Senate's decision to send that nominee to the Court sends a good person to the Court with a good understanding of what the Supreme Court of the United States is supposed to be. His job is not to look at the law and try to determine what it should have said or to look at the Constitution and determine what it should have said but rather to look at the law and the Constitution and determine what they say.  Judge Gorsuch, as well as any person who has ever appeared before the Senate to stand available for that job, understands that principle, will take that principle to the Court, will work with his colleagues, as he has on the Tenth Circuit, in order to rally around what the law says and what people can rely on in a country where our freedoms should be secure and where we should know that the courts are there to determine what is right in any given case, not what the judges think would be their ideas of what would be right.  I look forward to the vote later this morning and to seeing Judge Gorsuch be sworn in as a member of the Court sometime in the very near future.[[Page S2438]]  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr.Madam President, I rise today in support of the nomination and the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme I do so with mixed emotions because I believe that the actions taken in order to achieve this position will have lasting effects that are unfortunate on this body as far as comity is concerned, but also the confirmation of future judges of the Supreme Court by 51 votes. Rather than go back through the history of what former Majority Leader Reid did in regard to judges and what we are doing now, I am very concerned about the future which will then, with only a 51-vote majority required, lead to polarization of the nominees as far as their philosophies are concerned when the majority does not have to consider the concerns and the votes of the minority.  With my focus on Democrats' unprecedented filibuster of Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the U.Supreme Court and the Senate's regrettable action yesterday to invoke the nuclear option on Supreme Court nominees, I have been remiss in not taking the time to describe for the American people why I support strongly and without qualification confirming Judge Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  Why I do so is very simple. Rarely has this body seen a nominee to the Supreme Court so well qualified, so skilled, with such command of constitutional jurisprudence, with such an established record of independence and such judicial temperament as Judge It is, in fact, exactly for these very reasons that this very body unanimously voted in 2006 to confirm this very judge--this same judge--to the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Yet, now, the other side would have the American people believe that this very same judge lies firmly outside the mainstream and is, therefore, otherwise unacceptable to serve in the Nation's highest Even by the standards of this body, this sophistry is breathtaking.  Let me take a moment to join the chorus of support of my colleagues and recount why Judge Gorsuch is so deserving of this body's support for confirmation to the Supreme  First and foremost, Judge Gorsuch is a world-class judge. On the U.Appellate Court for the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has maintained the lowest rating of other judges dissenting from his opinion. Indeed, according to the Congressional Research Service, only 1.5 percent of Judge Gorsuch's majority opinions were accompanied by a dissent--the lowest of any judge in that study. Notably, the U.Supreme Court has never overruled any of Judge Gorsuch's opinions--not a single one. Furthermore, in the more than 2,700 cases Judge Gorsuch participated in, 97 percent of them were decided unanimously, and Judge Gorsuch was in the majority 99 percent of the time. These are facts. In addition, the U.Supreme Court overruled an opinion where Judge Gorsuch sat on a panel only one time.  While serving on that court, Judge Gorsuch built an exceptional reputation for his fair-minded, articulate, and sharp intellect. Stanford Professor Michael McConnell, who served with Judge Gorsuch on the Tenth Circuit, characterized Judge Gorsuch as ``an independent thinker, never a party liner'' and ``one of the best writers in the judiciary today. . . . [H]e sets forth all positions fairly and gives real reasons--not just conclusions--for siding with one and rejecting the other.''  Second, Judge Gorsuch has one of the most impressive professional and academic backgrounds this body has ever seen. He graduated from Columbia cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa and cum laude from Harvard Law He also obtained a doctorate degree in philosophy from Oxford University and served as a Truman and Marshall Additionally, he served for U.Circuit Court Judge David Sentelle, Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Judge Gorsuch also served as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice before serving as a judge on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth  For all of these achievements, Judge Gorsuch has earned the highest possible rating from a group Minority Leader Schumer calls the ``gold standard'' for evaluating judicial nominations.  Finally, Judge Gorsuch has established himself as an exceptional nominee. Indeed, Judge Gorsuch's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee was extraordinary. In the course of the three rounds of questioning by that committee, each Member had the opportunity to quiz Judge Gorsuch for over an hour each on just about every aspect of constitutional law. In answering about 1,200 questions from the panel, he demonstrated almost peerless mastery over that field.  Furthermore, Judge Gorsuch's nomination, with the help of my friend and former member of this body Kelly Ayotte, was exemplary in its transparency. Before his hearing, and in response to the Judiciary Committee's requests, Judge Gorsuch provided over 70 pages of written answers about his personal record and over 75,000 pages of documents, including speeches, case briefs, and opinions--which, by the way, makes you wonder why he wanted the job. Anyway, White House archives and the Department of Justice similarly produced over 180,000 pages of documents related to Judge Gorsuch's time at the The Department of Justice, moreover, provided access to reams of documents that would ordinarily be subject to claims of privilege. However, in the spirit of cooperation and in the hope of truly bipartisan consideration, the Department of Justice provided my friends on the other side access to these records anyway.  Additionally, in response to almost 300 separate questions posed by Democrats on the committee, Judge Gorsuch provided another 70 pages of written responses, and did so within a week of receiving them, to give my friends sufficient time to review the answers before the committee voted for consideration of his nomination.  Despite all of that I just said--despite everything that I just said, my friends on the other side would have the American people believe that Judge Gorsuch lies firmly out of the mainstream and hopelessly obfuscated his judicial philosophy.  My friends, when you do that with an individual that qualified, you lose credibility.  For all of the reasons I just went through, that is simply untrue. Moreover, when many of my friends on the other side had the opportunity to question Judge Gorsuch over the 20 hours they had with him during his confirmation hearing, they contented themselves with asking Judge Gorsuch for his personal opinions on issues that could come before him if he is confirmed to the In addition, they passed hypotheticals they knew he, for ethical and prudential reasons, could not possibly be expected to answer.  Here is some straight talk. The real reason most of my friends on the other side opposed Judge Gorsuch's confirmation is that President Trump nominated him--because their base of support and related special interests on the far left have been upset about President Trump's election in The fact is that if most of my friends on the other side of the aisle are opposed to this nominee, they will oppose any nominee put forward by this President, or any Republican President, for that matter.  The record is clear. Judge Gorsuch's qualifications, knowledge, skill, judicial temperament, and record of independence are truly exceptional. For these reasons, he has earned my strong and unqualified support for his confirmation to the Nation's highest  Could I just make one additional comment, and I know my friend from Utah is waiting. When President Obama and Presidents before him were elected from both parties, it was pretty much the standard procedure here in the U.Senate to give the incoming President the benefit of the doubt. In other words, the American people, by electing a President of the United States, had also basically endorsed his responsibility and his right to nominate judges to the courts. That is just[[Page S2439]]sort of a given, because the American people spoke in their selection of the President of the United States, taking into consideration those responsibilities the President would have. So, therefore, for those reasons, I voted for most of President Obama's nominees, as I did most of President Clinton's nominees. Now we are in a position where we are so polarized that even a man of the qualifications of Judge Gorsuch is now opposed by our friends on the other side of the aisle.  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, and I say to my friends on this side of the aisle: That is not the way the Senate was designed to work. The Senate was designed for us to communicate, for us to work together, for us to understand the results and repercussions of a free and fair election. It is about time we sat down together and tried to do some things for the American people in a bipartisan fashion. This near-hysterical opposition that I see from my friends on the other side of the aisle does not bode well for what we know we need to do.  Madam President, I recognize the presence of the distinguished Senator from Utah, and I say ``distinguished'' because both he and I are of advanced age.  I yield the floor.

General Marshall served as Army Chief of Staff during World War II, Special Ambassador to China, and Secretaries of both the Departments of State and He was promoted to General of the Army in 1944--one of only nine individuals in our Nation's history to rise to the rank of a five-star officer--and was also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1946.  In addition, General Marshall was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953 for developing the European economic recovery strategy known as the Marshall Plan, which was essential to bringing peace to the postwar European continent.

The George Marshall Foundation opened the George Marshall Museum and George Marshall Research Library in 1964, in Lexington, Virginia, on the post of the Virginia Military Institute, the alma mater of General The library provides scholars with a documented record of the life of General Marshall and his public service, and the museum shares his inspiring story with visitors through exhibitions, artifacts, and educational programs.

8618,topic-id,905,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.702, the Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2017, as amended.  I also thank my good friend, Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, for his work on this measure and for his leadership and passion of our committee's ongoing efforts to ensure that Federal equal opportunity programs truly guarantee equal opportunity.  Most agencies are careful to ensure that their personnel policies protect employees' rights and that their EEO programs ensure that if discrimination does occur, employees can seek fair and timely redress.  Unfortunately, there have been instances in which agencies fail to meet the standards of a model EEO program. When that occurs, hardworking Federal employees are harmed.  For example, during the last Congress, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform conducted a number of hearings to examine how allegations of harassment and retaliation were handled at the National Park Service and the U.Department of Agriculture, including the Forest  In the case of the Park Service, a former superintendent of the Grand Canyon, one of our premier parks, received a report in 2013 documenting multiple allegations of sexual harassment. But rather than determining whether further investigation was warranted or disciplinary action should be pursued, the superintendent attempted to bury the report.  A year later, more than a dozen current and former employees sent their allegations directly to the Secretary of the The Secretary referred those allegations to the Inspector After an extensive investigation, the IG found ``a long-term pattern of sexual harassment and a hostile work environment'' at the Grand Canyon River  The Inspector General's Office also identified more than 20 other individuals who ``reported experiencing or witnessing sexual harassment and hostile work environments,'' and the IG confirmed that previous reports of sexual harassment ``were not properly investigated or reported.''  As disturbing as these findings are, the Inspector General has also found instances of sexual harassment and retaliation at other parks, including iconic places like Yellowstone National Park and the Canaveral National  While the Park Service has announced measures to address the serious shortcomings in its EEO programs, it is clear that deficiencies in these programs are longstanding and have hurt numerous employees.  Similar chronic problems have occurred at the Department of The EEO program there has now been the subject of two extraordinary letters sent by the Office of Special Counsel to the President of the United  In May 2015, the Special Counsel wrote to warn the President that USDA's civil rights program ``has been seriously mismanaged, thereby compromising the civil rights of USDA employees.''  Just last month, the Office of Special Counsel wrote again to the President, finding that ``while the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights has taken positive steps to improve its performance, based on the significant number of cases that are still subject to delays, OSC has determined that the agency response is unreasonable in part. USDA may need to devote more resources to the Office to ensure that cases are promptly processed and hold senior supervisors accountable for the mismanagement in this office.''  Such findings are not to be tolerated, and they highlight why this bill, H.702, the Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act, is urgently needed.  This measure would require that the head of an agency's EEO program report directly to the head of the agency himself or herself. The measure would also require that an agency's EEO program be operated independently of its human resources or general counsel offices, ensuring that the EEO program is focused solely on protecting the civil rights of all employees and applicants.  H.702 would strengthen the accountability mechanisms central to the effectiveness of the EEO process. For example, the bill would expand the notifications that agencies are required to provide when discrimination is indeed found to have occurred, and it would require agencies to track and report whether such findings resulted in any disciplinary action.  The bill would also prohibit agencies from attempting to gag employees by banning policies, forms, or agreements that seek to prohibit or restrict an employee from disclosing to Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, or an Office of the Inspector General any information that might relate to a violation of any law, rule, regulation, or waste, fraud, or abuse.  H.702 is essentially identical to the bill we considered in the last Congress, which passed the House by a vote of 403-0. I urge Members to support the measure again.  As I close, Mr.Speaker, I join with Ranking Member Cummings in urging the Senate to move on this measure as expeditiously as possible, without the addition of extraneous and harmful amendments that might seek to curtail due process rights of Federal employees.  Any employee who engages in discriminatory or retaliatory behavior or who harasses another employee must be held accountable. The American public expects no less. Current personnel policies and practices are adequate to ensure that this can occur, and there is no need for any amendment to this bill that would undermine or weaken employees' due process rights.  Mr.Speaker, I talked to Representative Elijah Cummings recently. He is doing great. He is full of fight and can't wait to get back here to We expect to see him shortly.

I stand shoulder to shoulder with the administration in condemning this brutality. Again, we see Bashar al-Assad crossing a line--a line drawn and then ignored by the Obama administration.  The United States and the world community simply can't stand idly while Syria continues crimes against humanity, again, under Russian protection. That is why last night the administration responded quickly and proportionally. I commend the President and his national security team for acting decisively and sending a clear message to Assad and our allies. I am sure it was a message that was not missed by the leaders of the Iranian Government, the Russian Federation, and North  I agree with Ambassador Haley that Russia's obstructionism at the U.has enabled Assad and prevented international action, resulting in at least 400,000 Syrians dead in this civil war and millions of others displaced as refugees, not only internally but externally as well. Going forward, I stand ready to work with the President and his administration on a unified strategy to defeat Assad's barbarism and work toward greater stability in Syria and throughout the region.  Madam President, on another subject, as we all know, here in about 20 minutes, we will start the vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch as the next Justice of the Supreme Over the last few weeks, our colleagues and I have--and the entire country, as a matter of fact--have gotten to know Judge Neil Gorsuch not only as a judge but as a man. He is a good man with superb qualifications and incredible integrity.  A Colorado native, Judge Gorsuch has served on the Denver-based Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals for about 10 years. He is known for his sharp intellect, his brilliant writing, and his faithful interpretation of the Constitution and laws passed by He is, in short, a distinguished jurist with an impeccable legal and academic record.  In addition to his decade on the bench, his professional experience includes years practicing in a private law firm, prestigious clerkships, including the Supreme Court of the United States under two separate Justices, and service in the Department of  It is simply undeniable that Judge Gorsuch is a qualified, high-caliber nominee. I have no doubt that he will serve our Nation well on the Supreme But of course, in spite of all of this--his sterling background, his proven character, his broad bipartisan support--we have seen an unprecedented attack on this good judge and this good man in the form of a partisan political filibuster, the first ever lodged against a Supreme Court nominee. Yesterday, our Democratic colleagues would have prevented the up-or-down vote we are getting ready to have here starting at 11:30. For what? Well, it certainly was not because of the judge, his character, his qualifications, or his background and experience; it was merely because so many of our colleagues across the aisle simply have not gotten over the fact that Donald Trump won the Presidential election and Hillary Clinton did not.  Before Judge Gorsuch was nominated, the minority leader, our colleague Senator Schumer, said they needed a ``mainstream nominee.'' After President Trump nominated a mainstream nominee, Democrats then looked for other ways to make him out to be some sort of extremist or radical. But they failed because there is simply no evidence to justify those kinds of characterizations.  For one, judicial experts spanning the political spectrum, including President Obama's former Solicitor General, voiced their support.  Second, they had to deal with the facts of his record. During his time on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch was[[Page S2441]]involved in thousands of decisions--2,700 to be exact. The vast majority of those panel decisions made by at least three judges--sometimes more on the panel--97 percent of them were unanimous. So you would basically have to slander the reputations of all of those other judges with whom the judge agreed to claim that he is some sort of out-of-the-mainstream extremist. That is truly an impressive record for a judge in a multi-judge court like the Denver-based Tenth Circuit Court of It simply rebuts any picture our friends across the aisle have attempted to paint of him as some kind of extremist or radical.  I would ask our friends this question: If Judge Gorsuch does not fit the bill for a qualified, mainstream nominee, then is there any nominee from this President or any other Republican President who will meet the Democrat's arbitrary, flimsy standard?  Time and time again, our friends across the aisle failed to make any intellectually honest argument against this nominee. Still, they are determined to block him. That brought us to the cloture vote yesterday and the last-ditch effort to block Judge They did not want to even give him the up-or-down vote we are getting ready to have here in a few minutes. Instead, they wanted to kill his nomination by simply refusing an up-or-down vote and moving his nomination forward.  In our Nation's entire history, before yesterday there had only been four cloture votes for Supreme Court nominees--only four. None of them had been cast as a partisan filibuster determined to try to block the nomination--until yesterday.  Still, the minority leader, cheered on by the extreme groups on the left, barreled this Chamber to the first-ever partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, following a regrettable and recent tradition of Democratic obstructionism when it came to Republican judicial nominees.  Now that there is a Republican White House, that is what they want to do again--obstruct. This is a wholly concocted method the Democrats started back when George Bush was President to deny a Republican President an opportunity to nominate the person of his choice, confirmed by a majority vote in the  Before 2000, before Senator Schumer and a number of liberal legal activists decided they wanted to raise the threshold for confirmation to 60 votes, instead of what the Constitution requires, which is a majority vote. No one would ever have dreamed that the Constitution would have allowed for a 60-vote requirement, rather than an up-or-down vote.  It is not that our friends across the aisle truly oppose Judge The fact is, they oppose President That is what this is all about.  This vote isn't actually about President It is about the man we have all learned so much about, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who has a record of faithfully interpreting the law, a man who has proved himself to possess an independent judicial mind, who simply follows the law wherever it may lead. He is someone who has won bipartisan approval.  This vote is about delivering our promise. The Republicans have promised to let the American people's voice be heard in deciding who they would choose as President to select the next Supreme Court The American people did that. They chose President Trump, and he chose Judge  If Hillary Clinton had been elected President today, I have no doubt that her choice for the Supreme Court would be confirmed by a majority vote in the same U. Now it is time that we deliver on the promise we made to the American people and confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme  I yield the floor.

I thank all of the bill's co-sponsors, including Representatives Norton, Sensenbrenner and Jackson Lee, for working with me on this measure and for their commitment to strengthening federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) programs.  I also thank Tanya Ward Jordan, Paulette Taylor, and all the members of the Coalition 4 Change (C4C) for their years of work on this measure and their perseverance.  H.702 is essentially identical to H.1557, which was considered in the last That legislation passed the House by a vote of 403-0. However, the bill did not pass the Senate before the end of the 114th I am hopeful that this year, we can finally get this measure over the finish line and to the President's desk for signature.  I authored H.702 to make long-overdue reforms of federal EEO programs to ensure that they are better able to protect the rights of federal employees and applicants for federal employment.  Federal EEO programs exist to uphold the guarantee of equal opportunity that is the right of every citizen in this nation and to ensure that any barriers impeding fairness in personnel decisions are identified and eliminated.  While the vast majority of federal workplaces comply with current EEO requirements, some federal agencies still have not met the standards of a model EEO program set forth by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  For example, in 2014, the EEOC issued a report on the Social Security Administration (SSA) that made 12 findings regarding SSA's failure to maintain a model EEOC program, ensure efficient management of the complaint process, provide uniform training to ensure equal opportunities, and implement effective and efficient anti-harassment policies and procedures.  The EEOC made more than 60 recommendations for reform of that one program alone.  Last year, bi-partisan investigations conducted by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the National Park Service and the U.Forest Service found significant deficiencies in both agencies' EEO programs.  At both agencies, employees suffered when their complaints of discrimination were not handled in a fair and timely manner. Employees were also harmed by agencies' failure to safeguard complainants' personal information.  To help end these failings, my bill would require that EEO programs operate independently of an agency's human resources or general counsel offices--and that the head of the program reports directly to the head of an agency. This would ensure that effective implementation of the EEO program is prioritized at the highest level of an agency--and that it operates with the sole purpose of ensuring equal opportunity for all employees.  H.702 would also strengthen the accountability mechanisms that are central to the effectiveness of the EEO process.  Further, H.702 would make clear that agencies cannot impose any nondisclosure agreement on federal employees to prohibit employees from disclosing fraud or illegal actions to Congress, the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), or an Inspector  According to the 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, only 60 percent of federal employees agreed that they could, quote, ``disclose a suspected violation of any law, rule or regulation without fear of reprisal.''  The Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act would help ensure that federal employees can report discrimination without suffering retaliation--and that such reports will be thoroughly and fairly investigated and adjudicated in a timely manner.  Finally, as I close, I want to address some of the issues that arose during consideration of this measure in the Senate Homeland Security Committee last year.  I want to be crystal clear that I believe that supervisors who engage in discriminatory or retaliatory action must be held accountable.  However, this can be accomplished without curtailing any existing due process rights for federal employees and I will continue to oppose all efforts to roll back any due process right.  I urge all Members to support H.702, and I hope that in this Congress, we can finally enact this measure into law.

The people of Sanders County know Jim and his wife, Renee, for the admirable work their ministry has done to support those in need. Before becoming a pastor, Jim made a living harvesting timber, and those skills have been valuable with helping the most vulnerable members of their community stay warm during the cold Montana winters. In addition to distributing firewood, Jim's church harnesses the talents of many volunteers in order to provide a food bank, soup kitchen, and clothing bank. Jim's hands on approach to ministry has empowered his community to help each other overcome challenges.  Communities like Plains depend on folks like Jim and Renee, as well as the dozens of volunteers they have mentored over the years. I thank them for all the hard work they have done and wish them the best as their ministry continues to grow in the service of others.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-20-pt1-PgS4109.txt,2138,RENEGOTIATION OF TRADE AGREEMENT,2017.0,20.0,June
8490,topic-id,563,"Mr.President, for the second time this year, Illinois communities are assessing damage and cleaning up after flooding. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and first responders in northern Illinois who are working to recover after heavy rain caused severe flooding in Lake, McHenry, Kane, and Cook Counties last week.  The water has started to recede in some communities, but in some areas, water levels will likely continue rising this week. Thousands of buildings--including homes, businesses, and schools--have been damaged by floodwaters.  Lake County has been one of the areas most impacted by this flooding. Last weekend, I visited two towns in this area--Libertyville and Gurnee--and I saw street after street of flood damage to homes and businesses. What I saw was heartbreaking. I spoke with residents who were concerned about being able to recover from the flood and resulting damages and who voiced the need to find long-term solutions that will mitigate the impact of future flood events. I am extremely grateful for the hard work of local first responders and county officials. Thankfully, there have been no reports of injuries or fatalities as a result of this historic flooding.  I want to acknowledge the dedication of both the State and local employees and volunteers who have come out to help at every level, from the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the American Red Cross, to county emergency management agencies. Many volunteers have helped with sandbagging. County board chairman Aaron Lawlor has also been helpful in securing resources and making sure residents have information about where to find shelter and access cleanup supplies.  People from all around the area are pitching in to help their neighbors and even strangers protect property and get back on their feet.  I would also like to thank James Joseph, director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, for his hard work. He has been there during a time when Illinois constituents and communities need him the most.  The State has provided 850,000 sandbags and deployed an emergency management assistance team for flood mitigation and response efforts. Representatives from the Illinois Emergency Management Agency are working closely with local officials to make sure communities have the resources needed to protect critical infrastructure and clean up when water begins to recede.  The Governor has declared four counties State disaster areas. In the coming days, the State will work with FEMA and local officials to begin conducting preliminary damage assessments.  Once we have an idea of the scope of the damage, the Governor has the ability to request a Presidential disaster declaration. In the past, it has been challenging for Illinois to receive Federal aid after a disaster occurs, but the Illinois delegation and I stand ready to do whatever we can to help get any Federal assistance needed so that these communities can clean up and recover.  There is more work to be done, and cleanup may be difficult and dangerous, but I have no doubt the people who live and work in the impacted communities will make incredible progress rebuilding with the help and support of volunteers, local officials, and State agencies.  I want to thank everyone who has been engaged in the response and mitigation efforts and all those who will be engaged in recovery efforts in the weeks to come. We will rebuild, as Illinoisans always do, and we will be stronger for it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-18-pt1-PgS4051-2.txt,326,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,18.0,June
8666,topic-id,1416,"Madam President, I hadn't planned to speak this morning, but when my friend from Texas decided to give his version of history, I thought: Well, I ought to give my version. It is slightly different.  Justice Antonin Scalia passed away in February of last year. President Barack Obama, the President of the United States of America, had a constitutional responsibility under article II, section 2 to nominate a person to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, as every other President had. And he did.  He came up with the name Merrick Garland, the Chief Judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, a man who is widely respected, judged unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar President Obama submitted his name to this Congress, to the Senate, a Senate that has a Republican majority, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of  Senator McConnell and the Republican Senators did something that had never happened in the history of this Chamber--not once. They denied President Obama's nominee the opportunity for a hearing and a vote. In fact, Senator McConnell went further and said: I won't even meet with the man.  It had never happened before.  You say to yourself: Well, come on. This isn't beanbag. You are in This is major league politics. This sort of thing must happen all the time.  In fact, if you go back not that far in history, to 1988, in the last year of President Ronald Reagan's Presidency--his fourth year of his second term, some call it the lameduck year--there was a vacancy on the Supreme  Republican President Ronald Reagan sent the name Anthony Kennedy to a Democratically controlled Senate, which had the power to do the same thing Senator McConnell did: Deny a hearing, deny a vote.  Well, what did the Democrats do? We gave Justice Kennedy a hearing, a vote, and sent him to fill the vacancy on the Supreme  Under Senator McConnell, the Republicans refused Merrick Garland the same opportunity, and they said to President Obama: You are in your fourth year. You are a lameduck. Your choice for the Supreme Court really doesn't count.  But there was more to it. Really, the strategy was based on the premise and possibility that a Republican would be elected in this last November election, and if so, that Republican President could fill the vacancy on the Supreme  Well, that is exactly what happened. The election of Donald Trump gave him the opportunity to fill the vacancy of Antonin Scalia, a vacancy that should have been filled, I believe, by Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee.  That is what led up to the vote yesterday, but there was more.  Where did the name Neil Gorsuch come from? It is true that he served on the Tenth Circuit for 10 years. He had been approved by the He certainly had a strong resume. But how did he get on the finalist list?  Well, most of the time you never know. Presidents don't always disclose how they come up with names. In this case, it was very open because, during the course of his campaign, Donald Trump, the candidate, listed 21 names of people whom he would appoint to the U.Supreme On that list of names, Neil Gorsuch of  How did that name make the list? Well, we know because President Trump told us. He was the choice of the Federalist Society and the Heritage If you know these two organizations, you know they are Republican advocacy groups, very conservative groups, and they were going to pick the nominees who were approved by them and submit them to Donald Trump, which he then publicized. We know that because, at the end of the day, Donald Trump thanked the Federalist Society for nominating Judge That is how the name came to us.  I sat through the hearings as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I will tell you that most Supreme Court nominees don't go out of their way to volunteer information. They try to be respectful, but they don't try to say much of anything. They don't want to get in trouble either as judges or as candidates to be a Justice on the U.Supreme So there were gaps in his testimony and troubling questions raised about him.  I don't want to dwell on him so much as I want to dwell on this process. What happened yesterday on the floor of the Senate was unfortunate. Since I have been in the Senate, the last four Justices on the Supreme Court--two[[Page S2442]]nominated by President Obama, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, and two nominated by George Bush, John Roberts as well as Justice Alito--all received 60 votes during the course of their consideration. That is not, as the Senator from Texas alluded, written in the law per se, but it was written--until yesterday--in the rules of the You needed 60 votes to overcome the possibility of a filibuster and to file cloture.  Well, that rule was changed yesterday to a simple majority. That is an unfortunate occurrence. A lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land should be more than just a bare majority vote, as far as I am concerned, and, historically, with very few exceptions, that has been the case.  That is not the case here. We found yesterday that the Republicans voted for a change in rules, which was under the power of the majority to do--a change in the rules, which lowered the standard for this judge for the first time officially in at least a century to a mere majority vote. That is what he received, and that is what brings his nomination to the floor today to be considered for the Supreme  At the end of yesterday's session, when the rule was changed, some Senators were engaged in high fives on the other side of the aisle. I am not sure why. I don't think it was a time for any winning celebration. I think it was an unfortunate moment.  The question is, Where will we go from here? We know what the outcome of the vote will be on Judge Gorsuch this afternoon. That is preordained by the rule struggles we went through yesterday. But where does the Senate go? Where should we go? Well, I hope we will have the good sense to restore the 60-vote margin when it comes to future Supreme Court nominees.  It may be that Justice Gorsuch has an asterisk by his name as the only one to have been officially approved with cloture set at a majority vote, but I am hoping, even if he reaches the Supreme Court, that will not hold him back from serving this Nation well. I know he has told us over and over again that is exactly what he wants to do.  But I hope the Senate will restore the standard of 60 votes necessary for the Supreme I really believe serving as a Supreme Court Justice is an extraordinary opportunity for a person to serve this Nation, an extraordinary responsibility, and we should take it very seriously. It shouldn't be a majority decision; it should be a 60-vote decision. I hope we get back to that very soon.  Secondly, I hope the Senate will not be derailed by this Supreme Court nomination having happened so early in the session. This is a great institution. I have given a big part of my life to it and look forward to serving more in the Senate--not as long as the Senator from Iowa, who I think has retired the trophy in his State for his service in the Senate--but I do believe this is a great institution.  An example is that the Senator from Iowa and I are of opposite political faiths. He and I have worked together on some important issues in the past, and we want to work together in the future. I think we can. If we can restore what you and I remember as the glory days of this body, it is in the best interest of this  So beyond this Supreme Court nomination, let's hope we can all come together to make that happen.  I see my colleagues filing in. I know they are anxious to vote. I am not going to hold the I am just going to say that I thank the Presiding Officer and my friend, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary I look forward to the vote.  I yield the floor.

Fentanyl is a manufactured opioid, which, especially in its illicit versions, has contributed to tens of thousands of deaths. Especially concerning is the fact that this synthetic poison can be ordered online and delivered via medical or express consignment couriers from places like China, and because of its high potency in small amounts, Fentanyl is extremely difficult for law enforcement officials and authorities to detect.  That is why I have joined Congresswoman Niki Tsongas in introducing the INTERDICT Act which will provide U.Customs and Border Protection agents access to the latest chemical screening devices and scientific support to both detect and intercept synthetic opioids before they can cause our communities more harm and more devastation.

8667,topic-id,348,"Madam President, we are about to vote on the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, so I would like to say to my colleagues why I am so pleased that we will soon be referring to him as ``Justice Gorsuch.''  I opened our Judiciary Committee hearing with this:       One of Justice Scalia's best opinions begins with this      declaration: it is the ``proud boast of our democracy that we      have a government of laws and not of men. . . . Without a      secure structure of separated powers, our Bill of Rights      would be worthless.''  The separation of powers in our Constitution is a guardian of our liberty. Judge Gorsuch understands that. His deep understanding of the separation of powers enlivens his opinions.  By faithfully enforcing the boundaries among the branches of government and the power of the Federal Government in our lives, this Justice will ensure that the law protects our liberties.  Here is the other thing that is important about a judge who respects the separation of powers: We know he will be independent. He told us that he is his own man, that no person speaks for him. He is not beholden to the President who appointed him. His testimony shows that he is not beholden to us in the Congress either. He wouldn't compromise his independence to win confirmation votes. He passed the test.  This is a man of integrity, and his qualifications for the bench are exceptional. You know the story: bachelor's from Columbia University, Harvard Law School, doctorate from Oxford University, partnership at a prestigious law firm, and high-level Justice Department service for the people of our country, but most importantly, a decade-long record of faithfully applying the law on the Federal bench in 2,700 cases as a member of the Tenth Circuit Court of  Let me sum up this way: This brilliant, honest, humble man is a judge's judge, and he will make a superb  I yield the floor.

8456,topic-id,818,"Mr.Speaker, so the ruling party in Puerto Rico staged an election, and they are very proud of the results. They say 97 percent of Puerto Ricans support statehood and that the United States should grant statehood right away because of it.  Yeah, they got 97 percent of the vote. That is pretty impressive; the kind of numbers that would make Putin jealous and Saddam Hussein green with envy if he weren't dead already.[[Page H5052]]  The reason why the statehooders got 97 percent of the vote was pretty much the same reason those two guys get 97 percent of the vote: only one political party participated.  All the other parties thought the election was so rigged and so predetermined for the outcome the sponsors wanted that they didn't even think it was worth participating.  The vast majority of Puerto Ricans agree. Only 23 percent of the people voted. Seventy-seven percent boycotted the election because they didn't think it was worth their time; and they were absolutely right, but I guess in the era of alternative facts and made-up statistics about how many people attend your inauguration, you can try to make a one-party vote of 23 percent of the people look like a mandate for statehood. But I am here to warn my fellow Democrats not to believe the hype for one second.  Those who are peddling the fantasy of statehood sometimes call themselves Democrats, but we should be aware of an elephant in donkey's clothing.  Let's look at leaders of the statehood party here in Our colleague, the Resident Commissioner who ran on the statehood ticket, is a Republican who caucuses with the Republicans here in the She is a proud supporter of Donald Trump and pals around with Steve King and other Members who we might say aren't too friendly to Latinos and Latino causes, much less the Democratic Party line.  The Governor's Washington, D.C., office is headed by a Republican, Carlos Mercader, who was appointed to the position by Governor Rossello after serving as executive director of the rightwing political organization called Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, infamous for its constant bashing, yes, of President  That is who is pushing statehood in D.C., which makes me wonder why any Democrat would be embracing them, especially the chairman of the DNC, unless, of course, as the media reports, it is a payback for votes for DNC chairmanship.  And as for Governor Ricardo Rossello, leader of the statehood party, the ``Democrat,'' his conservative record speaks for itself, even though he has only been in office for less than a year.  As a candidate, he sided with the bondholders and vulture capital funds and opposed any debt restructuring for Puerto Rico, saying that Puerto Rico should pay its debt in full to Wall Street speculators, in spite of massive cuts that that would entail for police, fire, health, pensions, roads, and schools.  He hosted, yes, a Democrat, the GOP Presidential candidate, Ben Carson; and the Governor opposes LGBT rights, including same-sex marriage, and opposes the teaching of gender equality in the schools.  Townhall, the uber conservative website, sees a kindred spirit in Governor Rossello, the Democrat, praising him for his conservative approach to helping bondholders over schoolchildren. And the Governor has withheld his criticism of President Trump, which few Democrats are able to resist, and for Latino Democrats is darn near impossible unless you are just playing the Democratic role to get ahead.  When confronted with the obvious, that Trump has denigrated Mexicans as rapists and murderers, promised to build a wall to keep Latinos out, and sneered at Puerto Rico's desire for what Donald Trump called a bailout, Rossello responded, saying of the President: ``My view is I don't know that he is anti-Obviously, I have heard some derogatory remarks, but I don't know him personally, and it doesn't deter me.''  So instead of spending money to help children whose schools are closing, to fix roads that are falling apart, or to pay doctors enough to prevent them from leaving Puerto Rico and going to Florida, it seems the entire Puerto Rican government is now dedicated to pursuing the unlikely chance of statehood.  It is certainly useful as a distraction from what the Governor and his D.operatives are actually doing.  Mr.Speaker, I have said this before: I hope to be buried one day on that beautiful island of Puerto But when I am buried, I hope it happens in a free, sovereign nation that has thrown off the yoke of colonialism and dependence on an overseas master, just as this country did, the United States of America, the country in which I was born.  I look forward to celebrating the Fourth of In the meantime, I think it is important to warn my fellow Democrats that they should get no more in bed with the statehooders than with any other group of rightwing conservatives with an agenda.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5051-5.txt,478,NATIONAL GEORGE C.

8663,topic-id,1985,"Madam President, I really appreciate my colleague for his comments. He is one of the great Senators here, and we all pay attention to what he has to say, especially on foreign policy and military affairs, but also on so many other things as well. People ought to be listening to what he is saying with regard to this judgeship. I have great respect for Senator McCain and always will. He is one of the truly great Senators in this body. I just wish my colleagues on the other side would pay a little more attention to what he is having to say here today. So I thank the                      Nomination of Heather Wilson  Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the confirmation of Heather Wilson to be the 24th Secretary of the Air  I have had the privilege of knowing Wilson since her election to Congress, where she distinguished herself as a member of the House Intelligence In my interactions with Wilson in the Intelligence Committee, it quickly became apparent that she is a person of great intellect and exceptional character. But this should come as no surprise since she has always achieved a level of excellence in each of her endeavors.  Wilson knew success from an early age. She made history as one of the first female graduates of the Air Force At the academy, she thrived as a student, eventually earning a Rhodes scholarship to attend Oxford University, where she earned a Ph.in international relations.  Wilson then wrote a well-received book titled ``International Law and the Use of Force by National Liberation Movements.'' As a lawyer, I was particularly impressed by Wilson's in-depth analysis of international law. What is all the more impressive is that the book was published as she was serving as Director of Defense Policy and Arms Control for the National Security  Wilson's commitment to national security was evident when she served in the House of Representatives from 1998 to 2009. When she left the House after more than a decade of service, Congress' loss was South Dakota's gain. In 2013, she became the president of the South Dakota School of Mines and There, she showed extraordinary skill in leading a large institution.  In sum, Heather Wilson is a person of great intellect, strong management skills, and superlative character. I believe she will be an outstanding Secretary of the Air Force, which is why I strongly encourage my colleagues to confirm her without delay.  Confirming Wilson with dispatch is necessary to address the many challenges currently facing our military. After all, there are fundamental issues regarding the readiness of our armed services--especially the Air Force--which must be confronted and resolved.  Although the lack of proper investment and training is evident in each of the military departments, I am especially concerned about the Air Force because of its unique missions and responsibilities. Two words describe each set of problems facing our Air Force: ``too few''--too few aircraft; too few personnel, including pilots; too few flight training hours.  Regarding the shortage of aircraft, as the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff recently testified before the SASC Readiness Subcommittee, less than 50 percent of the services' aircraft are ready to perform all of the combat missions to which they are assigned. The average age of the service's fighter aircraft is 27 years old. Many other aircraft, including the B-52 and the KC-135, have decades of wear and tear. Even more alarming, the aging aircraft of the 1950s and 1960s will be retained in the force for the foreseeable future.  The current number of 55 fighter squadrons falls short of the number needed to fulfill our warfighters' requirements. As Wilson testified during her confirmation hearing, ``the Air Force is not fully ready to fight against a near-peer competitor,'' such as China or Russia--too few aircraft, indeed.  Of course, the number of aircraft is just one of the multiple issues facing the Air We also have too few personnel, including pilots. Our aircraft--no matter how advanced--cannot fly without experienced and highly trained maintenance personnel, and we need 3,400 more before the service can effectively accomplish its mission.  We are also running short of the men and women who fly these aircraft. In recent testimony before the Airland Subcommittee, senior Air Force officers testified that the service had a deficit of 1,555 pilots. Of that number, we require more than 750 additional fighter pilots. Further, there is concern that those pilots who remain are receiving very few flight training hours--much less than needed.  These are enormous challenges. But despite the Herculean task in front of us, I have no doubt Wilson will develop the strategies and policies required to restore our Air Force to a full state of readiness. I hope the Senate will speed the confirmation of Wilson to become the 24th Secretary of Air  Madam President, I am very concerned with the way Neil Gorsuch has been treated. We could not have a finer person, a more ready person, a more knowledgeable person, a more legal expert-type of a person than Neil Gorsuch for this very, very important calling on the Supreme  It is amazing to me how some of my colleagues on the other side have ignored all of the facts, all of the evidence, all of the experience, all of the goodness of this man. I hope they will not vote against him, but it looks to me as though many of them are going to vote against him. If you are voting against Neil Gorsuch, who can you support? Are you just going to support people who do your bidding? Or are you going to support people who really can do the Nation's bidding, do the things that this country needs?  Neil Gorsuch is that type of a person. He has that kind of an ability. He has that kind of experience. He is a terrific human being. Whether you agree with him or disagree with him, you walk away saying: ``Well, he certainly makes a lot of good points.'' You walk away saying: I like that guy. He is somebody I can work with. He is somebody that really loves this country. He is somebody who sets an exemplary example in every way.  I have to say that, in my years of service here, I have seen a number of Supreme Court nominations, and I have seen a number of people put on the Court, and they have all been exceptional people. But there is none of them who exceeds Neil He is that good. It is kind of a shame that we can't, in a bipartisan way, support this selection.  I suspect that there is more to it than Judge I think our colleagues on the other side know that this early in President Trump's reign as President of the United States, he might very well have another one, two, or even three or four, nominees to the I don't blame my colleagues on the other side for being concerned, because--let's face it--he is unlikely to put people on the Court with whom they agree.  On the other hand, he is very likely to put people on the Court who are[[Page S2440]]great lawyers, who have had great experience, who will bring great distinction to the Court, and who will, without telling us how they are going to vote and how they are going to rule, do the job that we all count on the Supreme Court doing.  The Supreme Court, to me, is a sacred institution. We have had great Justices on both sides--on all sides, as a matter of fact. We have had great Democrat We have had great Republican No one knows how great the nominee is going to be until that nominee actually serves on the Court and does the job that is so difficult to do as a member of the U.Supreme I have every confidence Neil Gorsuch will be one of the all-time great Justices for that He deserves confirmation. He deserves overwhelming confirmation. If we weren't in such a disputative mood around here, if we didn't have so much problems with each other, he would be an easy person to support.  So I hope we can put our politics aside and look at the man, look at his experience, look at his ability, look at his genius, look at his decency, and look at the fact that he agreed with his colleagues on 99 percent of the cases tried before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals--and most of those colleagues were Look at these types of things, and say: My gosh, what are we about here? Has it just become a politicized exercise every time we have a Supreme Court nomination, one way or the other?  I have to admit that it looked as though Hillary Clinton was going to win. Senator McConnell decided that we should not put Merrick Garland on during a Presidential election, which I think was a good decision. It was a sincere decision. It looked as though, if Hillary Clinton was going to win, she might very well put a much more liberal judge on the Court than Merrick The fact of the matter is, Senator McConnell knew the odds were against Republicans winning the Presidency this last election.  To some, it was kind of miraculous for Donald Trump to win. It wasn't miraculous to me, because last May Donald Trump called me and asked me to support him. I said: You don't want me. I said: I am the kiss of death.  He laughed and he said: What do you mean the kiss of death?  Well, I supported Jeb Bush, and he went down to defeat. Then I supported Marco Rubio, my colleague in the Senate, and he had to withdraw. So I am the kiss of death.  He said: I want you, anyway.  So I became one of two Senators who supported this now-President of the United States and was gratified to see him win that election. I thought he could. Deep down, I knew there was a great chance because I was going all over the country and I found that people were not willing to say whom they were for. I knew darn well they were for They just didn't want to admit it--especially But he got an overwhelming number of blue-collar Democrats--I understand them; I learned a trade as a young man--who voted for him.  When I say I learned a trade, I was born not with the wealth of some of our colleagues. I was born in what some people would call poverty today. We didn't think we were poverty-stricken. My parents were very solid, decent, honorable people, but they were poor--frankly, poor in the sense of monetary value. But they were good, honest, decent people, and I feel very blessed to have been raised by them.  All I can say is this. To allow the selection of the Supreme Court nominee to come down to a wide vote against that nominee with the qualities of Neil Gorsuch--if that is what my colleagues on the other side, in their wisdom, decide to do, I think it is a disgrace. I think it flies in the face of years and years of people selected for the Now, we all can differ. Everybody has that right. All I can say is I just wish we were more together as a body.  I have great respect for my Democratic colleagues, as well as my Republican colleagues. This is the greatest deliberative body in the world.

8613,topic-id,729,"Mr.Speaker, last week, the Trump administration released its NAFTA renegotiating objectives, which laid out its plan for how to fix that bad trade deal for America's workers, but it lacks specifics.  Yes, America needs a better deal, better jobs, better wages, for a better future for our people and the people of our continent. As renegotiations begin in August, let us remember the devil is in the details. The President's rhetoric alone is not enough. Action is what creates jobs.  Nearly 30 years ago, NAFTA was sold as the epitome of a modern trade agreement. Its supporters promised U.job growth. They guaranteed trade balances and even surpluses. They said there would be increased economic trade flexibility for North American industries and new buyers of American goods.  But guess what. Those promises didn't materialize. Instead, U.workers faced enormous job loss, declining wages, sublevel wage competition from desperate millions in Mexico, whose workers have no rights.  The recent tragedy in San Antonio with all of those desperate workers in that truck is the tip of an iceberg of labor exploitation on this continent that was caused by NAFTA, enhanced by It is so ugly.  The cold, critical measure of the job-hemorrhaging truth this country has passed since NAFTA's passage is our trade balance. That is how many more products and services our country exports rather than imports from offshore sweatshops. That translates into jobs.  Since the inception of NAFTA, our trade deficit has ballooned to unprecedented levels. This chart basically goes through what has been happening recently. Each month and each year, we go deeper and deeper into trade deficit, not just with Mexico, but a number of other countries. But there has not been a single year of trade balance with Mexico since NAFTA's passage, just more job dissolution and job loss.  Just in May, the United States experienced an overall $46 billion trade deficit with the world, of which NAFTA is a part. But since NAFTA's passage--get this--our country has accumulated nearly $2 trillion net negative balance with Mexico and Canada, and that translates into lost jobs here at home, and the American people know it.  This import deficit supports millions of jobs abroad, not U.workers. It means less money left in the wallets of hardworking Americans as consumer dollars feed the greed of rapacious corporate interests that feed on desperate workers.  Look at NAFTA's job numbers. Between 1997 and 2010, our country bled over 696,000 manufacturing jobs to Mexico alone. You would recognize the names of the firms. It is an alphabet soup of companies: AlliedSignal, Lucent Technologies, Mr.Coffee, Rockwell Automation, UTC Aerospace Systems, Weyerhaeuser, and so many more.                              {time}  1030  Unfortunately, the Midwest has suffered the most from this job hemorrhage. For Ohio, the trade deficit with Mexico alone resulted in tens of thousands of lost jobs. Ohio workers have had their net incomes go down by $7,000 per family since NAFTA's passage. Neighboring Michigan lost over 300,000 jobs since 2000 alone to  There is little doubt the original NAFTA agreement failed to create a modern opportunity for America's workers. It undercut them.  Today, the Trump administration has a chance to change this. President Trump campaigned and promised to build high-quality jobs and bring them back to the United How can a renegotiated NAFTA do this? It must include the most modern and enforceable continental labor agreements to yield rising standards of living so wages and job training across borders are equalized. If NAFTA were working, more good U.jobs could be created, outnumbering job losses.  Mr.Trump promised a good deal for Americans as a candidate. Now he has to deliver on that promise. The old expression, ``Don't tell me what they say, show me what they do,'' will be the true test of this administration's renegotiation of  The President must take bold action in renegotiating NAFTA, and it must resolve in reversing these negative balances and making them positive. He must stand up for America's workers, for their jobs, not just for global corporate interests, whose shareholders have been making a fortune off the backs of desperate labor.

And as can happen, the debate has been deeply polarized here, leaving Americans to wonder sometimes whether the facts get obstructed by the politics of the day.  So I want to take a minute and share what some experts have had to say about the Republican healthcare proposal. These are not politicians; far from it. These words come from folks who operate outside the walls of Washington's halls and have dedicated themselves to fighting for those struggling with mental illness.  According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Republican healthcare plan will ``force people with mental illness out of work, onto the streets, and into jails and emergency rooms.''  The legislation ``shows dangerous disregard for the well-being of people with substance use disorders and their families and erases decades of progress,'' says the Association for Addiction  Mental Health America tells us that this bill ``will ultimately do significant harm to people with all chronic conditions, including mental illness, while increasing the cost of healthcare to everyone.''  The National Association for Rural Mental Health agrees, saying, ``these actions will leave millions of Americans with serious mental health and substance use conditions without life-sustaining and essential health insurance coverage, especially at a time when the Nation is suffering from the largest opioid epidemic in history.''  In short, this bill would be, according to the American Psychiatric Association, ``particularly devastating to the millions of Americans in need of mental health and substance use treatment.''  Mr.Speaker, these groups are not political organizations. They are doctors; they are healthcare professionals; they are patients; they are advocates who have dedicated their lives day and night to filling the gaps of a badly broken mental health system. Take it from them.  This is what TrumpCare is offering our country. This is what they are trying to sell us at a time when we are losing nearly 100 Americans a day to an opioid epidemic. This is what is being negotiated behind closed doors as we speak while the rest of us read reports that tell us that the death toll from opioids could reach well over half a million people in the next decade.  So let me be clear: You cannot advocate for comprehensive mental health reform and then stand on the opposite side of nearly every major mental health organization in this country. You cannot claim to be a champion for those suffering from mental illness and then support a bill that guts funding for Medicaid, which is the largest payer of mental healthcare in this country.  You cannot say that you are committed to addressing the opioid epidemic and then stand behind a piece of legislation that gives insurance companies cover to deny those patients addiction treatment and to tell those in the grips of addiction to summon just a little more will.  You have to choose: With these families or with this bill? Which side are you on?                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgH5299-4.txt,2172,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,29.0,May

The report found that SBE funding furthers the mission of NSF and helps other agencies achieve their missions, and this funding provides tools and methods that have helped business and industry grow the U.economy and create jobs.

8566,topic-id,1065,"Mr.President, today I am incredibly honored to rise and recognize a group of 25 heroic veterans who have traveled from West Virginia to visit our Nation's Capital as part of the eighth Always Free Honor On behalf of our State and Nation, it is a true privilege to recognize them for their courageous service and unparalleled sacrifice as they tour the memorials that have been built in their honor.  With one of our country's highest per capita rates of military servicemembers and veterans, West Virginia is undoubtedly one of our Nation's most patriotic According to the Department of Defense, West Virginia had the highest casualty rate in the Nation during the Vietnam war, and I am so proud that the Honor Flight will allow these West Virginia veterans to pay homage to their brethren at the Vietnam Throughout our State's history, West Virginians have demonstrated selflessness and courage time and again in making tremendous sacrifices to defend our freedoms and to keep our homeland safe. As these veterans tour the monuments made in their honor, I offer my sincerest thanks to them on behalf of our Nation for their service.  The veterans joining us in Washington range in age from 62 to 94 and hail from the coalfields of West Virginia and These patriots come from seven West Virginia coal mining counties and three Virginia counties. Of the Honor Flight veterans attending, two served in World War II, one served in the Korean war, two served in both the Korean and Vietnam wars, 18 served in the Vietnam war, and two Veterans served stateside. They have participated in decisive overseas battles and won a myriad of accolades for their accomplishments in uniform.  I would especially like to recognize our World War II veterans who will be on this Honor Flight for the second time. Ninety-four-year-old former SN William ``Ray'' Calvin Sexton from Tazewell joined the Navy in Bramwell, WV, in 1943 and was a gunner stationed in Panama and the Galapagos We will also be joined by Machinist Mate 3rd Class Marion Grey Noel who joined the Navy in the 1940s and bravely fought in the battles of Iwo Jima and  These men represent our Nation's Greatest Generation, and their sacrifices and valor embody American patriotism. They fought in such a pivotal war, in an era that threatened our existence as a nation. Unfortunately, as the years go by, we are losing so many of our World War II veterans, and we must show them our utmost gratitude each and every day.  As I mentioned, we will also be joined by veterans of the Korean and Vietnam wars. These men and women served courageously in a variety of ways, working both at home and abroad. They engaged in combat all over the world. They were pilots, helicopter gunners, and radio operators. One of these veterans is MSgt Reese Williamson Moore who joined the Air Force in 1951 in Bluefield, He was first stationed in Iwo Jima as part of the Japan Occupation Forces in 1952. Then he moved to the Royal Thai Air Base Nam Phongin in the Kingdom of He served during a pivotal time following World War II and went on to serve in the Vietnam war.  We will also be joined by Iaeger, WV, native Sergeant Marion ``Mario'' Deskins, who joined the Air Force in 1968 in Beckley, He served with the 15th Aerial Port Squadron at Danang, where he maintained records on unit personnel and transported documentation to the headquarters of the 7th Air Force in Saigon via C-130 Hercules airplanes. Sergeant Deskins was awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal for his service in  Another Vietnam veteran participating in this week's Honor Flight is Sergeant Marshal Mann from Princeton, Sergeant Mann served in combat as an aircraft loadmaster, bravely preparing and air lifting urgently needed ammunition to combat troops fighting in the Republic of For his service and extraordinary achievement, Sergeant Mann received the Distinguished Flying  This week's Honor Flight and the continued support of our veterans would not be possible without the dedication of so many volunteers and caregivers. I would like to thank the five JROTC Cadets from Montcalm, Bluefield, Pikeview, and Princeton High Schools, as well as the military spouses serving as the guardians on this year's Honor The care and love these Patriots provide for our veterans is invaluable and deeply appreciated.  I also commend those in the Always Free Honor Flight network for their dedication to providing our veterans with such a unique and meaningful experience. Without the diligence and passion of Dreama Denver, president of Always Free Honor Flight network and owner of Princeton, WV, Little Buddy Radio, as well as Pam Coulbourne, the coordinator of these flights, many of our veterans would never have the opportunity to travel to Washington and pay homage to the men and women they fought beside. Dreama and Pam launched the Always Free Honor Flight in 2012, and every year, they continue to make this dream a reality for many of our West Virginia veterans.  I would also like to recognize SFC Paul Dorsey, vice president of Always Free Honor Flight and official photographer Steve Coleman, who have done a tremendous job of ensuring that our veterans receive the recognition they deserve. Dreama, Pam, and Steve have also dedicated themselves to the Denver Foundation, serving as incredible examples of how individuals can give back to their communities.  This week, as we celebrate these incredible veterans and their answering our Nation's call of duty, we must remember that the men and women who have given so much to ensure America's safety deserve the utmost care and support upon their return home. We must continue to fight for a Department of Veterans Affairs that provides our veterans with the services they very much need and deserve.  I am filled with pride every time I meet the patriots who have served our country, and I am so pleased to welcome West Virginia's most courageous veterans, who are all heroes, to Washington, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in saluting them. They truly inspire us all as we are reminded of their selfless service. It is because of their bravery that all Americans enjoy the greatest liberties and freedoms in the world.

8592,topic-id,1119,"Mr.President, climate disruption is the seminal challenge of our generation. It affects everything from our farming to our fishing to our forestry. We see the impact in disappearing glaciers, shrinking ice sheets, melting permafrost, dying coral reefs, more powerful storms, and migrating animals and insects.  In response, communities across the globe are transforming their energy economies. They are increasing the energy efficiency of their buildings and their vehicles and their appliances, and they are replacing carbon-polluting fossil fuel energy with clean, renewable energy.  How much do you know about the changes underway? Let's find out.  Welcome to episode 2 of the Senate Climate Disruption  First question: Which car company announced just last week that all of its new models will have an electric motor starting in 2019? Was it Toyota, which has the Prius currently, the Prius plug-in? Was it Volvo, known for its safety, or Honda, which advocates its fuel efficiency, or Ford, which has the all-electric Focus?  The answer is B: On July 5, Volvo announced that beginning in 2019, every new model in its fleet will have some form of electric propulsion. These cars will include so-called ``mild'' hybrids featuring regenerative braking like the Prius, plug-in hybrids like the Volt, and fully electric cars like the Volvo intends to do all of these forms.  Now with electric cars in mind, let's move on to question 2: Which European country plans to ban the sale of new diesel and gas vehicles by the year 2040? Is it France or Spain or the United Kingdom or Switzerland? The answer is  Last week, on July 6, France's Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot announced a new environmental plan for his country to reflect France's commitment to the Paris climate agreement. Minister Hulot not only said that France will ban the sale of new diesel and gas cars starting in 2040, but will seek to shut down all of its coal-powered electric plants over the next 5 years--by the year 2022--and to pursue a ``carbon-neutral'' economy by the year 2050. That is the same as a net zero production of carbon dioxide.  Let's turn to a different part of the world. Let's go to the Southern A crack in the Antarctic ice shelf will soon create an iceberg of what size? Will it be the size of Oregon, my home State, which is roughly 100,000 square miles; or the size of the Superdome in New Orleans, about 6 acres; or how about the size of Manhattan, 23 square miles; or Delaware, which is much larger, at about 2,000 square miles? The answer is D,  The crack in this ice shelf will create an iceberg about the size of  This is Antarctica's fourth largest ice shelf. The crack is now 120 miles long, and in some spots now it is 2 miles wide, and there are just 3 miles left in which it is attached to the ice shelf. So given the stresses that are being applied to that vast sheet of ice, the break is expected to happen in the next couple of weeks. When that happens, we will have an iceberg larger than 2,000 square miles--about the size of Delaware--and this will be such a large iceberg that it will contain roughly 1 trillion tons of ice.  Question 4: Global production of what fossil fuel fell by 6.2 percent in 2016? Was it coal or was it oil or was it natural gas?  The answer is A: coal. According to British Petroleum's annual report, global coal production fell by over 6 percent last year--the largest decline since they started keeping statistics in 1950. What is driving the decline? It is shrinking coal production in both the United States and in  What is happening in the other two sectors--oil and gas? There was a slight increase in the production of oil last year, and the production of natural gas was basically flat.  Now, compare these to renewable energy, which grew very quickly last year. Global wind energy grew by more than 15 percent in a single year, but that is a small amount compared to global solar energy, which grew by almost 30 percent--in a single year, almost a one-third increase in global production. And renewable energy is now taking up a larger share of the primary energy production worldwide.  Finally question 5: How many U.cities have joined the ``We Are Still In'' coalition? That is the coalition that was formed after President Trump announced he was going to withdraw the United States from the Paris accord. Is it 15 cities, 125 cities, 500 cities, or just 100 cities?  The correct answer is B, and of course the number is increasing even as we speak. President Trump announced on June 1 that he would pull the United States out of the Paris accord and, in just that short period since--a little over 5 weeks--125 cities, 9 States, 900 businesses and investors, and 183 colleges and universities have declared that they are committed to the vision of the Paris Agreement and to taking steps to be part of obtaining and securing that vision. Together, this coalition represents 120 million Americans and a $6.2 trillion share of the U.economy.  It includes cities from the West, like Los Angeles, and the East, such as It includes cities in red States, like Houston, TX, and Tucson, It includes cities from the Southwest and Southeast, like Santa Fe, NM, from the Southwest, and Charleston, SC, in the  These are just a few of the 125 cities--cities led by Democrats and Republicans--because the fact is, the threat of climate disruption to our planet is not a partisan issue. It is not a red issue or a blue issue; it is an issue that impacts everyone on this globe, regardless of political ideology.  So there you have it, folks. Episode 2 of the Senate Climate Disruption Quiz--questions ripped right from the headlines. How did you score?  Every week we have surprising new facts--new facts on the ground about the changes in the environment and new facts about the response of communities across the globe.  There is no question that we are racing the clock to take this on as human civilization, and there is no time to spare. So stay engaged in the fight.  In the near future, I will bring you Episode 3 of the Senate Climate Disruption Quiz to present some of the new issues that will unfold in the coming days. If you are following this quiz at home and have a good idea for a climate disruption question, please tweet it to me at @SenJeffMerkley on Twitter, using the hash tag  Let's fight together and save our beautiful blue-green planet.

8673,topic-id,933,"Mr.President, Alaskans will gather on August 9 to celebrate the life of Dan Fauske, a public servant extraordinaire, who lost his battle with cancer in Upon learning of Dan's passing, Representative Mike Chennault, four-term Speaker of the Alaska House of Representatives described Dan as ``Superman.'' In Mike's words, ``Dan Fauske leaped tall buildings in a single bound. Like Superman, there was not a challenge he couldn't take on.''  Dan was a dear friend of mine, and his family is part of our extended family in the Murkowski office. Dan's son, D.J., who now serves as director of government and external affairs for the North Slope Borough, helped open my Washington office in 2003 as a staff assistant. D.subsequently married Gretchen Wieman, a legislative correspondent in my office during that period.  I counted on Dan for advice and counsel on important public policy issues affecting Alaska, as did many others in the His integrity and wisdom were unsurpassed, but Dan's greatest attribute was perhaps his humility. He was known as a straight shooter; one who was about getting the job done and doing it right. Although he waded into many a difficult political problem, he resisted the urge to become a politician. If there was an ounce of self-promotion in Dan Fauske, I never saw it. Dan was one of the most grounded people I have ever met, and that was the key to his influence and effectiveness.  Dan Fauske, like so many builders of Alaska in the half century after Statehood, adopted our State as his home. Dan was born in Fargo on December 13, 1950. He relocated to Alaska in 1974 after serving in the Army--not to the big city, but to Barrow, now called Utqiagvik, the northernmost American city. A place where the first language was then and remains today His older brother, Dave, was a teacher in the village. Dan worked construction and delivered fresh water, and he made himself part of the community. Elise Patkotak remembers him as one who approached the world as if everyone were a potential friend. Dan built a dog ramp to help Elise get her handicapped dog into the house. This is just one example of the many random acts of kindness for which Dan was known. Bridging the cross-cultural divide, his kindness was reciprocated in the community.  Dan left Alaska to study for an MBA at Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA, but it was a temporary absence. Utqiagvik was Dan's home, and upon graduation, Dan went to work for the North Slope He was chief financial officer and chief administrative officer. During his tenure, he pursued a vigorous capital construction program which brought water and sewer to many of the North Slope villages.  In 1995, Dan moved his family to He was named chief executive officer of the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, John Bitney, then a legislative staffer, remembers the day that he and the legislative auditor presented a bill in committee to liquidate Just when the committee was about to move the bill, a man ventures forward from the audience, announces that he is the CEO of AHFC, and it is his second day on the job. He asked the committee to allow him to pursue a turnaround of the agency--and, boy, were we lucky that the committee agreed.  Over the next 18 years, Dan would not only rescue AHFC from its financial difficulties, but mold it into one of the most respected State housing agencies in the During his tenure, AHFC pioneered its weatherization and energy rebate program, which helped Alaskan families survive the challenge of high energy costs in the frozen He issued more than $7.5 billion in bonds, led AFHC to avoid the subprime mortgage collapse and returned more than $1.9 billion back to the State of Alaska through cash transfers, capital projects, and debt service payments. The AHFC building has been renamed the ``Daniel R.[[Page S4763]]Fauske Building'' by the Alaska Legislature in honor of his many accomplishments.  Dan was so successful at AHFC, the Alaska Legislature asked him to take on a second duty, that of exploring the feasibility of constructing a small diameter pipeline to bring natural gas from the North Slope to serve In 2013, he left his job at AHFC to pursue this ``second job'' full time as executive director of the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation, He served in that role until November 2015.  At AGDC, Dan brought the same focus to the position he had to every other one he had held in his distinguished career: serving For Dan, AGDC's mission wasn't so much about commercializing Alaska's gas as it was delivering energy to His focus on delivering energy relief and security drove the State's efforts and resulted in AGDC joining the integrated effort to build Alaska LNG as the entity focused on delivering gas to  Whether it was building water systems on the North Slope, developing housing across the State, or delivering energy, Dan did it for Alaskans first. That was what we loved about him, he saw policy not at the 50,000-foot level but in the face, life, and experience of every person he worked with and served.  Dependable, trusted, respected--the consummate ``go to'' guy--all of these phrases are used to describe Dan He believed in He believed in Like all great Alaskans, he believed anything could be done, but what earned him our unwavering respect is that he followed through and got it done.  Dan Fauske will long be remembered as a true leader who walked with the people and a key figure in Alaska history of the post-Statehood era.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4762-2.txt,1694,FEDERAL EMPLOYEE ANTIDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,2.0,July

One contributor to this decline is an inhumane practice that is known as ``finning.''  Finning is the removal of the fins from a shark and, often times, is done while the shark is still alive. These fins are mostly used for shark fin soup, which is a traditional soup seen in many Asian countries. After harvesting the fins, these sharks are thrown back into the ocean, where they are left to die from suffocation, blood loss, or be killed by other predators, since they have no way of having an opportunity to defend themselves.

In 1997, when the handover occurred, America was hopeful that the people of Hong Kong would achieve the free, democratic future they deserved.  But two decades later, we see China's promise of `one country, two systems' is not being met. The Chinese have not honored that promise, and the British have ignored it.                            RECENT CRACKDOWN  Since 2014's `Umbrella Revolution,' the people of Hong Kong have faced a barrage of unjust and harsh restrictions on their freedoms.  Hong Kong's pro-Beijing government is slapping democratically-elected opposition lawmakers with expensive lawsuits in a backhanded attempt to disqualify them from their seats.  Peaceful activists are being rounded up and detained by the hundreds for exercising their right to protest the new government.  Five booksellers were abducted, smuggled across the border to China and forced to confess their so-called crimes on national television--simply because their employer sold books critical of                              WONG ARREST  And, just this week, the democracy activists and heroes of the `Umbrella Movement', Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, were arrested while peacefully protesting the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping--where they unfurled a banner in support of Liu  This egregious attempt at smothering free speech is alarming, illegal and deserves the swift condemnation of the international community.  We must honor the protestors' chant--`the world is watching'--and condemn the arrest of Wong and the other demonstrators.  Unfortunately, Beijing shows absolutely zero signs of ceasing its aggressive campaign of intimidation against democracy and human rights activists.                                 Close  In Mainland China, the Chinese government continues to jail journalists, human rights lawyers, those fighting to practice their own religion and democracy activists at an alarming rate.  And the Chinese Government is brutally trying to erase the religion, culture and language of the Tibetan people.  America has a moral duty to speak out in defense of the legitimate political aspirations of the people of Hong  If we do not speak out for human rights in China because of economic concerns, then we lose all moral authority to talk about human rights in any other place in the world.  As we mark this solemn anniversary, we must stand up for all those who are demanding the promises of `one country, two systems' be honored.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgH5359.txt,905,1700,2017.0,29.0,July

8589,topic-id,4754,"Mr.Speaker, before I get into the substance of my remarks, I would like to mention a little story.  When I used to work for Ronald Reagan years ago, he also said: Well, Dana always start off with a little funny story. So I thought I would share one that Ronald Reagan loved with all of you and the Congressional Record and those watching us tonight on C- What it deals with is a man who was struggling, struggling to get by. He lived in an area that had very little farmland left. My relatives all came from dirt-poor farms in North They didn't have very good land up there. They were homesteaders, and it was rough going. But they did make a go out of it. They made a living out of it. This story is about a fellow in Kentucky, a guy who wanted to be a farmer but couldn't even find any land as good as my parents ended up with when they homesteaded.  One day he found a piece of land that he knew was very fertile. What it was was an old riverbed. He decided he could plant that riverbed, and it was such good soil that he would have a great crop. Well, the trouble with it was that the riverbed was filled with tree stumps and rocks and all sorts of weeds and horrible obstructions to get anything done. He spent a year of his life cleaning out that riverbed. Every day after work, he would go and blow up the rocks, haul them out. He would get a mule team and pull the tree stumps out. He would take a machete and cut down all the weeds. The briars would scratch his body. It was a monstrous job, but he got it done and he planted a garden.  When that garden started to come in, it was so beautiful that he had to tell somebody, he had to brag to somebody. He went to the person in his little town who he respected the most. It was the preacher. He said: Preacher, I want you to come out and see this.  The preacher came out, and the preacher said: This is a miracle. Praise be to Look at that corn. I have never seen corn so big as that. And that watermelon, my gosh, and the berries. My goodness, I have never seen such a wonderful garden. Praise be to  He went through this, kept going: Thank God for this, thank God for that.  Finally, the young farmer said to him: You know, Preacher, you should have seen this when God was doing it all by himself.  Well, today, there is a lot of stuff going on in Washington, D.People are very active. Don't think that there is not a lot of activity. You may not be able to see it, but we in this new Congress, we are scurrying around. There are all sorts of people working on healthcare reform, tax reform. We have got the fiscal year `17 and fiscal year `18 appropriations. We have got border bills. We have got security problems and issues that are the highest order. We are working here. I believe that with the Republican Party under President Trump, we are going to accomplish great things. These are things that we are asking the help of God, but we are not waiting for God to do it.  I would like to discuss tonight a few of the creative proposals that I have made which I believe could impact and have a very positive impact on the United States of America and the American people.  First of all, I would like to talk about border security. And an issue, of course, in border security that is the number one issue that has been plaguing us for so long, so let's understand, there has been a massive flow of illegal immigrants into our country at least for the past 30 or 40 years. I trace it back, unfortunately, to the time I was in the White I trace it back to Ronald Reagan's amnesty of 1987.                              {time}  1930  Ronald Reagan was told that there would be 3 million people who would[[Page H3062]]then be granted citizenship, would be brought into the core of American activity, and be made U.citizens. He also was promised that there would be border control if he signed on to giving amnesty to 3 million people, that no jobs would be permitted to be given to illegals from then on, and that there would be some sort of situation where we could control it so that not only illegals weren't going to be further coming across the border, but they certainly wouldn't be given benefits by our government to encourage them to cross the border.  Well, what happened?  Yes, Ronald Reagan had pity for these poor folks who came here, 3 million of them, who he was going to agree to grant citizenship to, and he did. He signed an amnesty law. And instead of 3 million, it turned out to be 11 million.  And from that moment on, those 11 million, there were none of these restrictions on jobs. We could be E-Verifying all jobs right now and cut that off. We could have done it long ago. We could have done it in the next year after that amnesty that Reagan signed.  There hasn't been a huge effort to make sure that we control our borders. Just the opposite. We have had administrations that undercut the border guards that control our borders.  So what have we had since 1987, especially when the word got out that we actually will provide benefits? We will actually provide health care? And we will actually provide jobs? And education for children? Anybody who could just get here, even if they are here illegally?  Well, what we have had is a huge flow into our country that has been threatening, and is threatening, to change the basic fiber of our country in the long run. But even in the short run, it has had a horrendous impact. It has had a horrible impact, for example, on the wages that ordinary Americans have. They have come in, and the middle class and lower middle class working Americans have had their wages bid down by tens of millions of people who have come in and bid down the wages of the American working people.  Now, don't anybody try to tell me, as you have heard--everyone has heard this: There are 11 million illegals in this country. They have been saying that for 20 years. Be honest with yourself, everybody. Let's talk about it. There are probably 30 million illegals in this country.  What has that caused? How has that impacted on us?  What have we seen?  We have seen an education system that has been drained of its resources so those very same working class Americans, who depended on us to make sure their children had a decent education, now have an education that is nowhere near good because the money has been drained away to take care of millions of young kids who have come here illegally.  Well, where is our allegiance?  What about the healthcare dollars that are being consumed?  Average working people know that illegal immigration to our country has hurt, yes, the education and the healthcare benefits to their own families.  Plus, we have destroyed the security of so many middle class neighborhoods where now we have--again, of course, some people don't even want to deport illegal aliens who happen to be criminals. They are talking about let's have a city in which they will not abide by the law, even to deport criminals who are here, violent criminals against our own citizens.  No, these aren't sanctuary cities that we are talking about. These are outlaw cities that don't care about the American people as much as they do about people who come here illegally.  Well, those have been some of the really negative aspects that we face. We know that.  The reason that we understand, and people have recognized this, is Donald Trump was elected President of the United States because of this issue. We know that.  The American people understand that their wages are going down, quality of life is going down, safety in their neighborhoods is going down, education for their children is going down, and health care is being torn apart. And a lot of it goes right back to a massive flow of illegals into our country.  Thus, when Donald Trump shook up the system by saying, We are going to build a wall, and we are going to prevent this massive flow of illegals into our country from continuing, that is why Donald Trump was elected.  So this out-of-control illegal immigration has got to stop. And that is one of the things that now with Donald Trump as President, and with a Republican majority, we are committed to doing.  And the first step, at least the most important step, maybe not the first one, is fulfilling Donald Trump's pledge that we are going to build a wall across our southern border that will be both symbolic and will be practical in stopping this large and massive out-of-control flow across the border.  I have a proposal that I think will go a long way in helping President Trump build that wall. My proposal called the Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Financing Act of 2017--that is the name of the bill. Again, I will say it. Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Financing Act of 2017. I am currently drafting that bill, which will be submitted as either an amendment or it will be submitted as a separate bill.  This goes a long way that will permit President Trump to keep his promise to us.  Now, why wouldn't he keep his promise to us?  Everybody has been saying: He will never find the money necessary to build that wall, so he has fed a false promise to us.  There are resources that are available if we use our creativity.  Ted Cruz, over in the Senate, proposed the $14 billion that we have confiscated from a Mexican cartel leader, who we now have in custody, let's use those $14 billion as a down payment. I think Ted Cruz has got a great idea there, and I think that is one idea.  My idea, which I am encompassing my legislation, is based on the idea that we have, and most people know this, 1 million legal immigrants coming into our country every year. Let me make clear what I just said. One million legal immigrants.  Republicans are not against immigrants. We are portrayed that all of the time. We support 1 million legal immigrants coming into our country every year, which happens to be more legal immigrants migrating into our country than all of the other countries of the world combined. Nobody comes even anywhere close to us in our generosity, and Republicans are in favor of that legal immigration. Because we will choose who is coming, they will benefit and help our society as a whole, and they will not especially undermine our poor and working class  Well, what does that have to do with the wall?  Well, my legislation, which I am now in the middle of writing, says this: Of that million, it recognizes there are 50,000 people who are permitted to come into our country legally every year.  And how are they selected? The rest are very carefully selected.  These are people who are selected by a lottery. That is right, a lottery. We are having a choice, just by happenstance, who we pick, of 50,000 people coming into our country. We may need them. They may be able to contribute. They may not. But we are leaving that up to a lottery.  My proposal is eliminate that 50,000. But we are not going to lower the number of legal immigrants coming into our society. We support legal immigration. In fact, those people who claim Republicans are anti-immigrant, they are the bigots. They are the ones who are proposing that we lump legal and illegal together.  So don't let anybody kid you. That is a political ploy.  So when you hear someone say, Republicans are anti-immigrant, just remember, we are prolegal immigrant. And with them trying to combine illegals with legals makes them the negative force against people who have come here from other countries legally.  So what is my proposal?  My proposal is you take the 50,000 slots that now are selected by some kind of lottery, and you say: We are going to start a pool of money. It is going to be an account that is a protected account. It can only be used for upgrading the border security of the[[Page H3063]]United States, of both the border, Border Patrol, immigrations coming in, and making sure our homeland is more secure, especially on our borders.  So we take that money in the pot.  Now, where is the money coming from of that 50,000 a year?  I am proposing that we charge anyone in the world, who is not a criminal or some kind of a terrorist. That basically we permit them to put $1 million into that fund. And they will immediately be guaranteed legal status, a green card in the country, but they will be guaranteed within 2 years that they will become a U.citizen.  Are there 50,000 people in the world who would do that?  There sure are. We know at least that. But there may be a lot more than that.  But that would be enough for President Trump to build his wall and to make sure that we stem the flow, this massive flow of illegals into our country, and to secure our borders from these drug cartels, et cetera, and to strengthen our Border Patrol, and to make sure that when people are coming into the country we can vet them, we have some sort of technology devices that can help us secure that radical Islamic terrorists aren't coming into our country. Yeah, we can do that if we have the resources.  President Trump wants to do it. Our country has been thwarted in the past by politicians who don't want to do it. But President Trump is committed. We need to get behind him.  My proposal would at least give us the resources to accomplish that mission. Unfortunately, of course, there are people here, power brokers here in the United States House and throughout our government, who would like to get their hands on that money and spend it on other projects, special projects that they have in mind.  Right now, the Republican Party needs to unify. We need to hear from our base.  The number one priority for any of the money that would be derived from offering a citizenship to people from overseas, that money should be used to control our borders and create the security of our country.  Now, by the way, why haven't we acted before?  Why is it that from 1987 on that we have had this flow and we haven't been able to stop the flow, or do what I am doing right now should have been done 10, 20 years ago? Because we have people in this country who wanted that massive flow of illegals.  There are probably 30 million illegals in our country. That is not some kind of happenstance that just happened. That wasn't an accident.  We have had, and, unfortunately, on the Republican side of the argument, we have had Big Business who wants cheap labor, and that has prevented the Republicans from doing what we want.  And on the liberal side, on the leftwing side, on the Democratic aisle, you have ultra-left liberals who want what? Who want to make sure that we have masses of people that they can use to try to socialize our country. Change the fundamental nature of our country because they don't like the fundamental nature of our country.  So we have a political motive and an economic motive on both sides, manipulating these poor people from around the world and threatening the well-being of those working people and those lower middle-income people in our own country who are just struggling by. We could have solved this a long time ago.  But that is what Donald Trump was all about. Donald Trump spoke to those people in Wisconsin and working class people in Pennsylvania and elsewhere and said: We are going to watch out for you. We are watching out for you from now on.                              {time}  1945  Now, we need to join Donald The people have spoken. We need to build that wall, build it.  I was very proud during the Reagan years that I participated. I was one of Ronald Reagan's principal speech writers, and we all remember what his most important line was. What did he do that really changed the world? He had a policy that stood firm against the Soviet Union without sending our troops into military action; and he stood, and he was strong, and he stated and he argued our case aggressively to the world.  Ronald Reagan, when he went to the Berlin Wall and he said, ``Tear down this wall,'' it changed history and made our country safe for decades ahead. I did not write those remarks, but I am very proud that I helped smuggle those remarks to the President of the United States so that he had the option of saying it. And of course, once he read those remarks, he was bound to say it, even though his senior staff tried to prevent him from doing so.  Well, I am saying this: Donald Trump, listen in. Build that wall. We are behind you. The American people are behind you. You should be as aggressive on this issue as Ronald Reagan was in ``Tear down this wall.'' Because he, too, was villainized for--they claimed he was some kind of a warmonger for even being so tough with the Soviet Union; and, of course, what he did is lead to the disintegration of the Soviet  So that is my first idea.  Mr.Speaker, I have another project that I have been working on, and I know this sounds perhaps a little bit disconcerting for people because people have the idea that everyone here is left and right, and they have stereotypes of who is on the left and who is on the right.  So let me just suggest that my next proposal is something that is usually associated with the liberal left, and that is I happen to believe that we have had a tremendous waste of our resources. It has had a horrible impact on our country that we have tried to regulate adults using marijuana, and especially our efforts to stamp out any use of marijuana, which is what the policy has been for decades, in a way that has prevented us from developing the medical uses of cannabis, marijuana.  Cannabis is a plant that has enormous potential for our economy. We can't even import it now. It was used to make all of our rope. The Constitution is written on cannabis paper. There are so many uses. Our farmers aren't even permitted to grow it. And on top of that, no one has been permitted the means necessary to see if there are some medical purposes. And just now, after a few decades, we have found there are significant medical uses for marijuana.  Now, it took me a long time to get to the point where I found out where we could work, a coalition could work on both sides of the aisle to try to just look at this issue with a realistic eye.  What is going on? What is this incredible hysteria over some adult smoking marijuana in his backyard that we have to waste the resources of our police forces?  The police should be out protecting people down the street, but instead they are going into the guy's backyard to make sure that he is not smoking marijuana. And then how about the jailer? How about the judge? How about the penal system? How about all of those? How about the loss of income of that individual?  Trying to control people's personal lives, especially their consumption of cannabis, has been a horrendous failure because it has not prevented people's use, and it has been dramatically costly.  And then, of course, there is the side effect of what? There is the side effect that we are financing drug cartels throughout the world who are actually putting democracy in those countries in jeopardy, and we are financing it.  The issue isn't whether or not people should smoke marijuana or have cannabis. The issues are:  If you are going to have that cannabis, shouldn't the person selling that be accountable so that they only sell it to adults?  Shouldn't it have a label on it so that you know it is not filled with opium or poisons?  Shouldn't it be a situation where a businessman has a bank account and is taxed and regulated and is treated like any other business, responsible business? Or we can let the drug cartels have the billions of dollars that that endeavor will be bringing in every year, and which it does.  So we have financed the drug cartels overseas. We have gangs here, domestically, all tied to the fact that we are trying to control people's private behavior for their own benefit.  It is time to unshackle people. An adult in the United States has every[[Page H3064]]right to make his own decision about whether or not he will consume cannabis, and that is especially true of doctors and patients. We believe, supposedly, Republicans believe in the doctor-patient relationship. We have talked about it with ObamaCare, et cetera.  Well, guess what? The doctor-patient relationship if we are saying, ``Yeah, you can do this, but you can't do anything with cannabis,'' that is not recognizing the doctor-patient relationship. So don't tell me about limited government. Don't tell me about individual freedom. Don't tell me about the doctor-patient relationship. Don't tell me about those things if you believe that adults should not be able to use cannabis, especially for medical purposes.  And the worst part is there are some medical reasons for it. We have already seen that Israel has, by the way, legalized marijuana, and they have done great research just in recent years on the medical uses of cannabis, of marijuana.  They have found that epilepsy, children's epilepsy in particular, this will stop seizures. Yet we are denying our own people the use of this. How insane.  Yes, we need to make sure that we watch out for our people, but we do not control their lives because we know better.  This is not a nanny state, but some people, interestingly enough, on the other side of the aisle, who believe in the nanny state, are the ones who believe mostly in allowing people to use medical marijuana if that will help them.  I just will say this: we have an epidemic of opiates in this country. And one of the reasons we have that is because we have our veterans who have been given these opiates at the  I just had a call yesterday from a friend whose son came back from the war, and he was in convulsions on the floor, and they couldn't help him. They took him to the VA, and they put him on opiates, and it still didn't help. Finally, after a year, the doctors pulled him aside and said: Come to my office off the campus. They gave him a prescription for medical marijuana, and the man's son hasn't had a seizure since.  So what does that mean?  So he doesn't have a seizure. You have a veteran who has been filled with opiates. So now I got a call just yesterday. This poor young man who is smoking that marijuana does not have seizures, but they have filled him with opiates. He is trying to get off the opiates, but the process they have got him going through is he has to be dry of everything, including marijuana. And as soon as that level goes down, he begins having seizures again.  And then he went a few days ago--maybe a couple of weeks ago he was at the VA hospital. They were trying to get him off these opiates. He is going to feel a seizure. He went to the car to smoke a marijuana joint and was arrested because the people at the veterans hospital who run the parking lots are Federal employees. It is Federal property.  We have had votes right here in Congress saying that if a State legalizes the use of medical marijuana, the VA in that State is permitted to let their people utilize medical marijuana, and it failed. That vote failed.  I challenge my Republican colleagues to join with the Democratic colleagues who supported that resolution last time. If you really care about these people--yes, we have an opiate, an opium-based horrendous surge going on in our country, and it is bringing down our people, our veterans in particular. Let's not eliminate if the doctor believes that medical marijuana will have an impact. Let us not outlaw that doctor from doing this. Let us also remember that we know that it can end seizures.  This poor guy who called me the other day, his son, once the medical marijuana is going down--and they won't let him do this on the campus of the VA hospital--he ends up going back into seizures.  This is a type of catch-22 when you are trying to control people's private lives. It doesn't work. It is not right. It is not right for our veterans. It is not right for our senior citizens who are sitting in the senior citizens' homes. If they would like to take a gummy that is filled with a little cannabis, so what? So what? Let them enjoy themselves a little bit, for Pete's sake, in a way that is not harmful; bring back their appetite, or whatever.  No, we are trying to control people's lives, and it is having a harmful effect on the people themselves. And think about one last note of it. Who is most hurt by this is we have people in the poorest neighborhoods of our country who end up being arrested and being frisked to see if they have got any marijuana on them.  We have armed groups who look like Army personnel coming into our cities for drug raids. The Founding Fathers never meant criminal justice to be handled at the Federal level--they never did--but now we have the equivalent of SWAT squads going in and breaking people's doors down for providing medical marijuana. This is ridiculous. And those poor people in the Black areas and the Chicano areas get arrested. They are arrested, and that follows them for the rest of their life.  I have a bill that says that it is up to the And I would ask all of my colleagues and the people listening tonight to support the States' rights to make this decision. This is a State issue. And I have a bill that basically says that the Federal Government shall respect State marijuana laws. And when we do that, that will be left up to the people of those States to make these decisions.  That is what our Founding Fathers wanted, and that is why things didn't go haywire back in the old days. We left it up to the We especially left that issue of drug enforcement, but also law enforcement, at the local level for local police.  Mr.Speaker, so those are two ideas that I thought I would share with my colleagues tonight, that I think would save billions of dollars on the wall, and trying to change our attitude, trying to stop the waste that we are wasting lives, and billions of dollars, and creating drug cartels.  When it comes to marijuana, we need to change that law and leave it up to the And we can then--if people need help, we are going to give it to them. But if they are adults and Americans, they have a right to run their own lives.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgH3061.txt,979,THE HYPE OF STATEHOOD FOR PUERTO RICO,2017.0,2.0,April

According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, last year alone, nearly 18,000 firearms were reported stolen or lost just from Federal firearm licensees, or That is Federally licensed dealers, manufacturers, and importers.  Today I introduced the SECURE Firearms Storage Act to help address the stolen-gun problem by requiring all FFLs to securely store their inventory when not open for business.  Additionally, this bill would require the Attorney General to review and put forth further commonsense security measures to reduce the risk of theft, and require new applicants to detail their security plans before a new license is issued.  There are simply too many innocent lives being destroyed by these stolen guns. I invite my colleagues to join me on this bill to make commonsense improvements for gun safety.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6280-5.txt,99999999999999,WELCOMING OUR HONORABLE VETERANS TO THE NATION'S CAPITOL,2017.0,25.0,July
8449,topic-id,354,"Madam President, as we continue to grapple with last week's testimony from former Director Comey, it seems the new strategy by some on the right is now to question the credibility of Special Counsel Already, former Speaker Gingrich and others have said negative things about Mueller just weeks after praising his selection. They know that Mr.Mueller is the man now responsible for following up on Mr.Comey's testimony so the hard right is trying to discredit him in advance. They know they can't debate the facts or the issues or defend the actions of the White House on the merits, so what do they do? They attack the referee and try to besmirch the reputation of someone like Mr. Mr.Mueller is a man of integrity. That is agreed to by just about everybody. He has devoted his entire career to his country. He came out of private life to do a job on behalf of his country and be right down the middle. Even Attorney General Jeff Sessions has praised Mr.Mueller for his service and credibility, saying his ``integrity is undoubted,'' as is his ``experience and love of country.'' Those are Jeff Sessions' words. Now the political right has pulled out their partisan knives to try and defame his reputation.  It is a shameful, shameful ploy. The right must be afraid of what Mr.Mueller is going to find. I would ask Speaker Gingrich a question. Is he afraid of what Mr.Mueller is going to find out? Is that why he is attacking his reputation? The baseless attacks on former Director Mueller ring hollow. Former Director Mueller has been hailed as a paragon of public service by people of all political stripes. This country comes to a low point when that kind of attack is issued.  Despite what Speaker Gingrich may try to imply, we should have every confidence that he will investigate the matters at hand with integrity and thoroughness.  I can tell you one thing, the little bit I know about him, Speaker Gingrich's attack and attacks like that will not do a thing to deter Director Mueller from finding out the truth.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-12-pt1-PgS3382-4.txt,1036,REMEMBERING DAN FAUSKE,2017.0,12.0,April
8476,topic-id,486,"Madam President, finally, on another matter entirely, I continue to be alarmed by the wave of criticism from the far right of Special Counsel Robert It seems obvious that, because Mr.Mueller--one of the most respected and trusted men in Washington--is in charge of investigating Russian interference in our elections and any other issues that arise out of that investigation, the far-right, special interest partisans have set out on a despicable campaign to smear his character and muddy the waters of his investigation.[[Page S3569]]  I just want to remind my colleagues and the American people that there is no one more qualified or more trusted to do this job than Robert He spent almost his entire adult life in service to his country. He is a decorated veteran of the Vietnam war and served as U.attorney for 12 years. He was appointed by a Republican President, President George Bush, to lead the FBI in 2001 and served his full 10-year term with distinction, and then he was asked to spend an additional 2 years under President Congress had to pass a special waiver to allow him to continue in his FBI post, and the vote was unanimous. Every Republican--many in this Chamber--voted unanimously to ratify Robert Mueller for another 2 years as FBI What an endorsement--a great endorsement. That vote made Mr.Mueller the longest serving FBI Director since Edgar Hoover and the only FBI Director to serve under Presidents of both parties.  Mr.Mueller represents the best of public service. He will pursue this investigation without regard to politics or pressure of any kind, and that is exactly what America needs.  The chorus of extreme commentators and media personalities who seek to curry favor with the President by trying to tear down this man of great integrity is only heaping dishonor on themselves. Worse yet, they are trying to discredit our most important democratic institution--the rule of law. These critics know Mr.Mueller is a straight arrow, and many of them said as much when he was appointed, but because he is in a position to examine the President's actions and perhaps to take action, they are attacking his character.  This is not, my colleagues, a political game. This is a very serious investigation about foreign interference in our elections--something that eats at, that corrodes the roots of our democracy, the very wellspring of our being and pride as a nation.  The man leading this investigation ought to be trusted by the American people, and over the course of his long, distinguished career, he has certainly earned that trust.  Again, I urge that these attacks on Mr.Mueller cease and that my friends on the other side of the aisle join me in defending his reputation. The critics are going much too far.

8519,topic-id,663,"Mr.President, now, let's talk a little bit about the President's first 100 days. We are approaching the 100-day mark of the Trump It is an appropriate time to take stock of what this President has accomplished so far. Unfortunately, it is not much.  In the first 100 days, so many of the promises the President made to working families during the campaign have either been broken outright or remain unfulfilled.  The President ran as a populist. I have said this to him. The President ran as a populist against both the Democratic and the Republican establishments, promising to stick up for the American worker. He talked like a different kind of Republican who might be willing to work with Democrats, particularly on issues like trade or infrastructure. Instead, the President has spent the first 100 days governing from the far right on behalf of the powerful and the special interests he once campaigned against, breaking his promise to be a President for the American worker--the forgotten men and women, as he called them. It sure didn't take long for the President to forget them too.  The President has broken promises or has yet to fulfill them in areas that matter to so many of his voters and to so many Americans, whether they voted for him or not. He promised he would drain the swamp, right? He talked about it over and over again. He promised he would drain the swamp, but instead he has filled his Cabinet with billionaires and bankers. And listen to this: He has given out secret waivers that allow lobbyists to work in his administration on the very issues they previously lobbied on. That is not draining the swamp. That is filling it up to the brim, going far beyond what others have done.  He said he would deliver better healthcare that would cost less and provide more benefits. At one point, he said we are going to give healthcare to everybody, but his bill, TrumpCare, does the exact opposite, providing fewer benefits at higher costs, all to finance a massive tax break for the wealthy.  He promised a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. We Democrats sent him our proposal--a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, taking the number he talked about in the campaign--over a month ago. We haven't seen any proposal or gotten any response from the  The President promised he would be tough on trade, outsourcing, and jobs. He promised he would label China a currency manipulator and fight back against their rapacious trade policies which robbed America of millions of jobs and cost trillions of dollars of our wealth. He hasn't done that either.  The 2018 budget he proposed is a dagger to the heart of the middle class, cutting some of the programs that matter to the middle class most, including transportation, education, and scientific research.  So as we head into the 100-day mark, Democrats are going to hold the President accountable for the promises he made to working-class voters. We obviously disagreed with a lot of what he said in the campaign, but he made a number of promises to working-class voters that we could have helped him to accomplish. Unfortunately, he has abandoned those promises in favor of a hard-right, special interest agenda.  We can work together, but only if President Trump and Republicans actually seek Democratic input and are willing to compromise. Right now it seems the President's idea of compromise is never talk to Democrats, put forward his own Republican proposal, and pressure us to support it; never talk to Democrats, that is, about the issues he is moving forward. I have talked to him, but it is never on the issues that are before us. That is not the way our politics have ever worked. Unless the President's approach changes, the next 100 days will be just like the first: a whole lot of talk and no progress, a series of broken or unfulfilled promises to the working families of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-24-pt1-PgS2475.txt,1036,MIA SELECT COMMITTEE,2017.0,24.0,May

I am not sure that every Member of the Republican caucus inside has seen it.  To everyone in America, this should be a red alert. This should be a red alert for doctors, hospital administrators, and patient groups, groups that represent older Americans, groups that fight for children's healthcare, groups that fight for better treatment for substance abuse and mental health. This should be a red alert for working families across this country whose lives depend on affordable healthcare and yet have no earthly idea what their representatives in Congress might pass in just 2 short weeks.  They might never know. The Republicans have not scheduled a single committee hearing--not one--not a single committee hearing on a bill that would reorganize one-sixth of the American economy, touch the lives of millions of Americans--a life-and-death issue for some--not a single committee hearing or public debate on a bill that would potentially change drastically the way Medicaid is funded, the way women are treated in our healthcare system, the way we treat older Americans and those with preexisting conditions.  Why on Earth haven't we had a single committee hearing on a bill of this magnitude? Why on Earth is this bill being hidden from public view?  There is only one reason. The Republican majority is afraid of the American people learning what is in their healthcare bill. They don't want the American people to know how much they cut and destroy Medicaid or how fat of a tax break they give to the wealthiest few because they know the backlash would be severe. In short, by their actions, it seems our Republican colleagues are ashamed of this bill, and they know their chances of passing the Republican healthcare bill would plummet if they release a bill that looks anything like the House healthcare bill, which only a tiny sliver of Americans support--17 percent in the last poll. The majority of Republicans and the majority of Trump voters are opposed to  So our Republican colleagues have made a calculation, which is ultimately self-defeating, to keep their healthcare bill hidden from view under lock and key until the last possible moment. Maybe this is the only strategy to pass a bill as unpopular as this[[Page S3416]]bill is going to be. Maybe it will shield their bill from criticism in the short term, but make no mistake, there will be a reckoning if this bill is passed.  Passing a bill of this scale, with so many consequences for the American people, without telling them what is in it, without telling them how they would fare, the political retribution will be swift. It will be a catastrophe for the Republican I am afraid, worse, this bill will be a catastrophe for the American people.
