                TRIBUTE TO FORMER CONGRESSMAN JOHN WOLD

  (Ms. CHENEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend 
and former Member of this House, John Wold, of Casper, Wyoming, who 
passed away on February 19. Congressman Wold was a member of the 
Greatest Generation serving as a naval engineer during World War II. He 
also served Wyoming in our State legislature and as our Member of 
Congress. He was a leader and pioneer in the energy field, and he made 
numerous contributions, along with his incomparable wife, Jane, to our 
civic life and as a philanthropist.
  I knew John my whole life. The friendship between our families goes 
back even farther. John was the oldest living former Member of 
Congress, and I was honored to receive his advice and counsel over the 
years.
  I will never forget attending his 100th birthday this past summer in 
Casper and seeing the joy it brought him to be surrounded by so many of 
his wonderful children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
  We will miss him, but the impact Congressman Wold had on our State 
and our Nation and the legacy of leadership and honor he leaves behind 
will continue to be an inspiration for generations to come.
