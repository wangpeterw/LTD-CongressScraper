   STANFORD CHAMPION SWIMMER AND RAPIST BROCK TURNER: POSTER BOY FOR 
                     SWIMMING, POSTER BOY FOR RAPE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last year, Stanford rapist and 
champion swimmer Brock Turner was sentenced to a mere 6 months in 
prison for his disgusting crime: raping an unconscious young woman 
behind a dumpster in the darkness of night.
  The judge claimed a prison sentence would have ``a severe impact on 
him.'' Never mind that a rape victim sometimes gets a life sentence of 
mental turmoil and anguish.
  But apparently, the light punishment is still too tough for the 
rapist and his daddy dearest. Now they have gone crying and appealing 
to the courts, trying to avoid the designation that Turner earned as a 
registered sex offender.
  Daddy's high-dollar legal team is claiming the victim was intoxicated 
and Turner should get more leniency. It is the old defense: it was the 
victim's fault.
  The fact the victim was intoxicated and unconscious makes the crime 
worse. She was helpless. She could not consent or fight back.
  Rape is never the fault of the victim--never.
  Uphold the conviction and give Brock Turner the only title he 
deserves: sex offender and poster boy for rape.
  And that is just the way it is.
