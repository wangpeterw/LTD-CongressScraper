             THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED OF TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, the American people are speaking up, and 
they are absolutely terrified of the Republican healthcare plan, 
TrumpCare. According to a FOX News poll, two-thirds of Americans 
disapprove of TrumpCare. That's a FOX News poll.
  Why? Because it will take away healthcare from 23 million Americans. 
For those who still have the good fortune of being able to get 
insurance, they will pay more for worse care. If you are age 50 to 65, 
fasten your seatbelts; you are about to pay five times what others will 
pay for health insurance and for prescription drugs.
  Of course, in the Senate, they are crafting their version of 
TrumpCare in secret, behind closed doors. Nobody knows what is in it. 
Why? Because they know the American people will reject it.
  We know we have got issues we have to deal with in healthcare. No law 
is perfect, and the ACA is one of those. But my goodness, you cannot do 
this behind closed doors. We have to do this in public. People need to 
understand what Congress is doing. We have got to get it right, and we 
have to do it in the open.
