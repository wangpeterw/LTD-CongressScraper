                        RECOGNIZING JOSEPH DOUEK

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. Norman) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great American 
whom I had the privilege of meeting at the Library of Congress, Mr. 
Joseph Douek.
  Mr. Douek hails from a great family. His father came penniless to 
America some 70 years ago. He did what is now becoming a lost art in 
this country--he went to work.
  He went to work as a laborer and, eventually, worked his way up to 
where he owned a successful photography shop. He bought real estate, 
and he has now retired to a great retirement life, which he has earned.
  Joseph, his son, has dedicated himself to public service. He has been 
on the New York City Planning Commission for 5 years, and he was just 
reelected. He is an example of somebody who has given his time, his 
tithe, and his talent to serve in the great State of New York and our 
great country.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating what he has done and 
really encouraging other people to do what he has done in that he has 
gone to work. He has done what Americans do.
