                         HONORING RILETTA CREAM

  (Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a very special 
woman, Mrs. Riletta Cream, from Camden County, but was known not only 
from the city she was born in, but the entire State of New Jersey. She 
passed away, unfortunately, yesterday.
  Mrs. Cream was a kind, gentle, and loving woman, but had special 
character, strength, and conviction.
  She was known as an institution for education and public service. She 
was a friend, a mentor, an educator, and a dear, dear friend to so many 
of those children who went to her school.
  She was a Camden city native, and was a principal of Camden City High 
School for over a decade. She served as a role model for students, 
teachers, and administrators. After retiring, she didn't give up. She 
then ran as a freeholder, and was elected time after time, continuing 
to serve the community.
  She led projects at the time called Tech 2000 to make sure there was 
a computer in every child's classroom and at their desk. She fought for 
libraries when funding was short. She knew the value of education, 
whether it was going to college or to a trade school.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join me in mourning the loss of this 
shining light in my hometown. Mrs. Cream accomplished so much and gave 
so many years of service. May she rest in peace.
