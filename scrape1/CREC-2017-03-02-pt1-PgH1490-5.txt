         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of

     Hon. Paul Ryan,
     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, 
         DC.
       Dear Mr. Speaker: On February 28, 2017, pursuant to section 
     3307 of Title 40, United States Code, the Committee on 
     Transportation and Infrastructure met in open session to 
     consider eight resolutions provided by the General Services 
     Administration at the request of the Department of Veterans 
     Affairs (VA). The Committee has authorized these leases to be 
     executed pursuant to GSA's leasing authority in accordance 
     with the provisions of the Public Buildings Act.
       The Committee continues to work to reduce the cost of 
     federal property and leases. The eight resolutions considered 
     are part of the VA's Construction, Long Range Capital Plan 
     and include consolidations and relocation of existing space 
     to improve the VA's delivery of healthcare.
       I have enclosed copies of the resolutions adopted by the 
     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on February 
     28, 2017.
           Sincerely,
                                                     Bill Shuster,
                                                         Chairman.
       Enclosures.
