         BRING FORTH TAX REFORM THAT BENEFITS THE MIDDLE CLASS

  (Ms. PINGREE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I recently sat down with Mainers who are 
terrified of the Republican tax plan:
  In tears, a high school teacher listed the items she purchased for 
her students in need. Under this plan, she will no longer be able to 
deduct them.
  A cancer survivor told me how she now writes off thousands of dollars 
of medical expenses every year--no more, under the tax plan.
  A recent college graduate wondered how difficult it would be to 
achieve his career goals while paying off his student loan debt without 
a deduction for the interest.
  A dairy farmer talked about a tax exemption that has allowed farmers 
to have more control over their businesses by forming co-ops. That is 
gone under the GOP tax scam.
  In 10 years, one in five Mainers will pay more in Federal taxes under 
this plan. Their sacrifices and our national debt will pay for generous 
benefits to massive corporations, foreign investors, and the wealthiest 
of the wealthy.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to withdraw this thinly veiled 
handout to the one-percenters and bring forth tax reform that will 
actually benefit the middle class.
