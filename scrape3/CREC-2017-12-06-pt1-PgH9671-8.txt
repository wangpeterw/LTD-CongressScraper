                               TAX REFORM

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, with the leadership of 
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady from Texas, the House has 
passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
  The tax cuts bill that the House Republicans supported makes the Tax 
Code simpler and fairer, allows hardworking taxpayers to keep more of 
their own money they earn, and gives small businesses more room to grow 
and create jobs.
  Our Senate colleagues deserve credit for listening to the people of 
the country and voting to pass tax cuts last week. Now we stand on the 
doorstep of history. As we move to conference committee, we have the 
chance to overhaul the antiquated and notoriously confusing Tax Code 
for the first time in a generation.
  When the conference process is finished, the President will be able 
to sign a tax cut bill that serves the interests of American families 
and businesses rather than those of politicians and special interests.
  As Speaker Paul Ryan has said, these opportunities come around only 
once in a generation, and now is the time for us to seize the moment.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
