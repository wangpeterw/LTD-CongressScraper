                         TRIBUTE TO PAUL REEDER

 Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Paul Reeder, 
a retired Billings Police Department chaplain, for his unwavering 
faith, rock-solid dedication, and compassionate heart.
  His words of wisdom have brought comfort, peace, and joy to families 
all across Billings and the State of Montana.
  Paul was born to John and Ella Reeder during the Great Depression, 
and as a young boy, Paul helped support his family, working in their 
garden, raising food, and helping to preserve it each fall.
  Paul took his first job in the ministry in 1955 in Valier, MT, before 
moving to Havre in 1958 to pastor at the First Baptist Church.
  In 1966, he and his family moved to Great Falls, where he led the 
Riverview

Baptist Church. After a few years there, he reached out to other 
community organizations in the area facing administrative challenges.
  Finally, he, his wife, Mary, and their three children Doug, Karen, 
and Barbara moved to Billings, where Paul accepted the directorship of 
Friendship House of Christian Service. He helped coordinate and expand 
programs there including early childcare, afterschool programs, and 
nutrition classes.
  Though Paul is retired, he continues to preach one Sunday each month 
at All Nations Church and still attends morning briefings at the 
Billings Police Department.
  Paul has built a life around helping others and building stronger 
communities.
  He is a role model for Montana, and Billings is a better place 
because of his work.
