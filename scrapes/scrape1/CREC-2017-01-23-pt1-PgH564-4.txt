                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Thank You, God, for giving us another day. This prayer is authored by 
a high school class at St. Anne Episcopal in West Chester, Ohio.
  Dear God, we ask You to bless our country during this time of 
leadership transition. We ask that You guide the people of this land, 
and all nations, to honor one another, serve the common good, and 
promote the dignity and freedom of every person. We pray that everyone 
who rules this country might pursue peace and justice.
  We pray for wisdom, humility, and mercy to be in the hearts of our 
leaders as they make decisions for the welfare of all people. We ask 
that You allow our world's leaders, and those who have the burden of 
any power or authority, to execute their actions for the justice of the 
world and in harmony with Your word.
  Please help to guide the President as he takes on his role. Ease his 
mind so that he is able to do his job. Help him to keep in mind the 
thoughts of others, to have a listening heart and an open mind, and to 
remember that he is a representative of all people of this country. 
Help him to do the will of what is best for the Nation.
  We pray to You, O God, for the world's security, safety, and 
tranquility. Please let there be a guiding light to peace for all 
people and an end to all war and violence.
  In Your name, we pray.
  Amen.
