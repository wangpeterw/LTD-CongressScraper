           STAND FOR PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT AMERICA'S CHILDREN

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let us never forget that the GOP tax scam 
will harm real people.
  On Tuesday afternoon, 42 high school students from the Cristo Rey 
Newark High School were here at the Capitol, urging me to vote against 
the GOP tax scam.
  Mr. Speaker, the young people I met with are from financially 
struggling families. They worked hard and got accepted into an 
innovative school to gain professional skills. The students take part 
in a corporate work study program. Their earnings go towards their 
college preparatory education. The model works.
  Last year, 100 percent of Cristo Rey Newark's students were accepted 
into 4-year colleges. Under the GOP tax scam, these bright, young 
people from financially disadvantaged families will have to pay taxes 
on their work study earnings--taxes they cannot afford.
  That is wrong. I will continue to stand up against the GOP tax scam 
and stand for programs that benefit America's children.
