                    CALLING FOR ACTION ON GUN SAFETY

  (Ms. SHEA-PORTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I just returned from outside these 
doors where there are thousands of young people who are calling for 
action on gun safety.
  I marched out with my Democratic colleagues, and I really wish that 
my Republican friends across the aisle had joined us in this, but I 
will describe what I saw.
  I saw a lot of very, very upset young people who are begging this 
House and the Senate to make change to protect them. They no longer 
want to live under this threat.
  There was one sign in particular that caught my eye. A young girl was 
standing there with a sign, quietly, and it said, ``Am I next?''
  So, Mr. Speaker, we have to ask ourselves that question: Are we next?
  They don't want another moment of silence. They want action. They 
want it now.
  I congratulate them for their efforts.
  When 18-year-olds are leading the country with moral courage, I think 
it is time for us to respond in kind.
