                            DRAIN THE SWAMP

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, Saturday marks 100 days since 
President Trump took office. He is far from ``draining the swamp'' as 
promised. He stacked his administration with billionaires, family 
members, and people with dangerous ties to Russian interests.
  His national security policies have been a far cry from the steady-
handed

decisionmaking he promised. From Mar-a-Lago missile strikes to 
aggressive and impulsive national security rhetoric, the President has 
made our foreign policy as murky as swamp water--a dangerous practice 
in today's world.
  One hundred days in, the President is heavy on alternative facts and 
light on action. Where is his job bill? Where is his infrastructure and 
cybersecurity plan? Where is all of the ``winning'' we were supposed to 
be sick of by now?
  It has been 100 days, Mr. President. It is time to do something the 
American people can get behind. You can start by draining the swamp you 
created at the White House.
  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the life and legacy of 
Donna Lynn Johnson who, for 40 years, brought quality eye care to the 
South Side of Chicago. She will be greatly missed by her patients, 
family, and especially her niece, Donna Miller.
  Lastly, I am proud to have Baily Lynn Compton from Texas as my shadow 
today.
