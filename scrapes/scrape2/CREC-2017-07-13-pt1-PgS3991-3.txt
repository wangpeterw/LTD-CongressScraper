                       TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH BRANNON

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Joseph Brannon, 
one of my Washington, DC, interns, for all of the hard work he has done 
for me and my staff at the Senate Republican Conference.
  Joseph is a graduate of Stevens High School in Rapid City, SD. 
Currently, he is attending Auburn University in Auburn, AL, where he is 
majoring in sociology. Joseph is a dedicated worker who has been 
committed to getting the most out of his experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Joseph Brannon for all 
of the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the 
years to come.
