                   TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL ``MIKE'' MUNOZ

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of 
my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee law clerk Mike 
Munoz. Mike hails from Avon, CT, and will soon graduate from Georgetown 
University Law Center. As a law clerk on the Commerce Committee, Mike 
assisted the Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data 
Security Subcommittee. He is a dedicated worker who has been committed 
to getting the most out of his clerkship. I extend my sincere thanks 
and appreciation to Mike for all of the fine work he did for the 
committee and wish him continued success in the years to come.
