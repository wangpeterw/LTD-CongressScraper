      OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS RUN TO DANGER, NOT AWAY FROM IT

  (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, the Nation stands in mourning over the 
tragedy in Las Vegas. No one ever wants to be in that situation. But 
it, once again, reminds us that, when there is danger, our law 
enforcement officers run to it, not away from it.
  We are going to hear many stories from that tragedy in Las Vegas, but 
many of them will concern those brave law enforcement officers who, at 
the risk of their own life, protected and saved the lives of many, many 
others.
  So, as we mourn the tragedy in Las Vegas, let us always remember and 
be thankful for those law enforcement officers who protect us each and 
every day.
