                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  God, our shield, look with favor upon us today. Enable us to go from 
strength to strength, as we strive to live in day-tight compartments. 
Guide our Senators around the obstacles that hinder them from living 
for Your glory, as they seek to fulfill Your purpose for their lives in 
this generation. As they strive to please You, empower them to stand 
for right and leave the consequences to You. Lord, give them the grace 
to seek You with their whole hearts, knowing that those who 
passionately pursue You will find You. May they daily yield themselves 
to You through prayer and obedience. May they grasp Your firm hand, 
depending on You to lead them through the darkness to the light.
  We pray in Your powerful Name. Amen.
