                    THE IMPORTANCE OF NET NEUTRALITY

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the importance of 
preserving net neutrality.
  As many of my colleagues are aware, cybersecurity is a top priority 
of mine, as I believe it is the national and economy security challenge 
of the 21st century.
  As co-chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, I have fought 
for years to help reduce security risks while preserving the amazing 
benefits of an open interoperable internet.
  But the internet was not designed with security in mind, so I haven't 
been surprised by the work needed to better protect our networks and 
data.
  But the internet was designed to be free and open. That is why, Mr. 
Speaker, I have been stunned by the Federal Communication Commission's 
recent proposal to end net neutrality and allow a small group of large 
companies to control what we see online. This is absolutely outrageous.
  I have heard from countless constituents back home in Rhode Island 
about this misguided effort, and I join them in calling for the FCC to 
reject it.
  Mr. Speaker, we do need to better protect ourselves on the internet, 
but we better make sure there is still a free and open internet to 
protect.
