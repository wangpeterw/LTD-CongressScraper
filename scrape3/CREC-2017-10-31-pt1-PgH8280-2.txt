                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Compassionate and merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us 
another day.
  Give the Members of this House strength, fortitude, and patience. 
Fill their parties with charity; their minds with understanding; their 
wills with courage to do the right thing for all of America.
  In the work to be done in the week to come may they rise together to 
accomplish what is best for our great Nation.
  Last week, we honored, and we thank You for the service rendered to 
the Allied cause of the Filipino veterans of World War II. May we 
always be grateful for the courageous in our midst, and the sacrifices 
of so many that we might enjoy the freedoms we have as a nation.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.

                          ____________________
