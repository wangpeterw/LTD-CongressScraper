                         OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

  (Mr. TED LIEU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speaker, as a former prosecutor, I 
rise to state the obvious: President Trump committed obstruction of 
justice.
  We have direct evidence that the President asked the FBI Director for 
loyalty. He demanded it. He asked the FBI Director to drop an 
investigation into Michael Flynn.
  The President fired the FBI Director. Then, on national TV, he said 
he did it because of the Russian probe. Then he told the Russians in 
the Oval Office that he did it to relieve great pressure because of the 
FBI investigation. That is classic obstruction of justice.
  The Washington Post today has a quote from one of the prosecutors of 
Watergate. He says: ``I helped prosecute Watergate. Comey's statement 
is sufficient evidence for an obstruction of justice case.''
  I call on Special Counsel Mueller to investigate the President of the 
United States for violating the obstruction of justice statute, which 
is a felony.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Cheney). Members are reminded to refrain 
from engaging in personalities toward the President.
