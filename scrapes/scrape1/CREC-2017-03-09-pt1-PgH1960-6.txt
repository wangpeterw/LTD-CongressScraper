is in a death spiral. Now we are on a rescue mission. The President and 
our replacement bill repeals the ObamaCare mandates and taxes, but 
preserves three important protections:
  One, we don't allow denying coverage or charging patients more with 
preexisting conditions.
  Two, we don't allow insurers to charge women more for being women.
  Three, we allow children to stay on their parents' plan until age 26.
  Going forward, we bend the cost curve downward by decentralizing 
health care, promoting competition, and expanding HSAs. We make health 
care more affordable by providing tax credits, creating value pools, 
and more judiciously redirecting Medicaid dollars back to those who 
need it most: children, elderly, and those with disabilities.
