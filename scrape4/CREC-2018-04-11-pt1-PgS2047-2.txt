                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on us today. You are a God of 
might and power, and our times are in Your hands. Forgive us for 
sometimes forgetting to trust Your prevailing providence, as You 
increase our faith through the power of Your Holy Word.
  Lord, thank You for our lawmakers. Remind them that they are 
appointed by You and are, therefore, accountable to You for their work. 
May they not forget that they are servants of Your Kingdom as You 
motivate them to be faithful in what they think, say, and do. Provide 
them with Your wisdom, empowering them to fulfill Your purposes for 
their lives.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
