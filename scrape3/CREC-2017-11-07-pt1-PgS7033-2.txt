                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our Father, help us this day to love and serve one another in 
ways that honor Your Name.
  May our lawmakers manifest a courtesy that brings about constructive 
change. Grant our Senators a tolerance so that they may not be quick to 
condemn ideas that differ from their own. Lord, give them such 
integrity so that their work may be their best whether there is anyone 
to see it or not.
  Bless and keep us all. Shine Your wisdom upon us, doing for us more 
than we can ask or imagine.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
