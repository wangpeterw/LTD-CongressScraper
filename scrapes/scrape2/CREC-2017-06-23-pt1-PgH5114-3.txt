 HONORING THE MEMORY OF FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL SERGEANT WILLIAM BISHOP

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Florida 
Highway Patrol Master Sergeant William Bishop of Lake City. Sergeant 
Bishop was killed last Saturday while working a traffic accident on I-
75 in Alachua County, Florida.
  Sergeant Bishop is a 30-year veteran of the Florida Highway Patrol, 
and he dedicated his life to law enforcement. He truly loved his patrol 
family. He also served in the United States Army, serving on the front 
lines all his life. That is a calling, not a job.
  Many of Bishop's colleagues remember him as someone who exhibited 
compassion, honesty, and faith. He loved watching football, but his 
greatest love of all was his family, especially his son, Trampas.
  His service and sacrifice to the State of Florida is a debt we will 
never be able to repay.
  Please join me in honoring Florida Highway Patrol Master Sergeant 
William Bishop and all of our fallen heroes who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice for our safety.
