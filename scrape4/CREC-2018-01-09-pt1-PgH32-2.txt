               HONORING THE LEGACY OF DR. RICHARD ALBERTA

  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
legacy of a constituent of mine in my district, Dr. Richard Alberta, 
senior pastor at Cornerstone Evangelical Presbyterian Church in 
Brighton, Michigan. On December 31, 2017, Dr. Alberta stepped down from 
the pulpit after 40 years of service.
  Originally from New York, Dr. Alberta was raised in a nonreligious 
home. After marrying his high school sweetheart, Donna, he embarked on 
a successful career until, one day, something changed. He attended a 
church service and realized the missing puzzle piece in his life was to 
do whatever he can to pursue and prayerfully consider the path felt by 
the love of his Lord and devotion to his ministry.
  Over the past four decades, Dr. Alberta dedicated his time, wisdom, 
and leadership to the Lord and the church. His friendship and faithful 
guidance has made a lasting impression on the lives of so many.
  As he begins his next chapter, I wish him all the best, and I commend 
him on his unwavering commitment to his congregation and to our 
community as a whole.
