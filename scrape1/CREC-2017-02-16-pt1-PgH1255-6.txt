             RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

  The SPEAKER laid before the House the following resignation from the 
House of Representatives:

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                                February 16, 2017.
     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,
     Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Ryan: This letter is to inform you, in your 
     role as Speaker, that I have today sent a letter to my 
     Governor resigning my seat in Congress. A duplicate of that 
     letter is attached.
       I am truly honored that President Trump has given me the 
     opportunity to lead the Office of Management and Budget. The 
     opportunity to work with such a talented and intelligent 
     group of people--in an effort to try to restore our country's 
     fiscal security--was too good to pass up. It does, however, 
     come at the price of leaving the House.
       I am thankful for the efforts you made on my behalf in this 
     effort. I am thankful for the leadership you have shown 
     during my time in the House. But, more than all of that, I am 
     thankful for your friendship over the last six years. Working 
     with you--as a Chairman and the Speaker--will forever be one 
     of the highlights of my career.
       I sincerely hope my resignation is not the end of that 
     relationship. Indeed, I choose to see it as simply the next 
     chapter of our mutual effort to try to serve the nation.
       All the best. Thanks again. And God Bless.
           Sincerely,
     Mick Mulvaney.
                                  ____



                                     House of Representatives,

                                Washington, DC, February 16, 2017.
     Hon. Henry McMaster,
     Governor, State of South Carolina,
     Columbia, SC.
       Dear Governor McMaster: Earlier today I was confirmed by 
     the United States Senate to serve as President Trump's 
     Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Assuming 
     this office requires me to resign my position as the United 
     States Representative for the 5th Congressional District of 
     South Carolina.
       It has been a great honor and personal privilege to 
     represent the people of South Carolina in Congress. The 
     people of my district, and of our state, are some of the 
     nicest, hardest working people I've ever met. They care 
     deeply about our state and our nation, and I will be forever 
     grateful for the opportunity to have been able to serve them.
       However, the opportunity to work directly with the 
     President in his Cabinet to shape our nation's budget and 
     ensure financial stability for generations to come is a call 
     to service I simply cannot ignore. I am truly honored that 
     President Trump has given me this opportunity.
       So, in hopes that I can better serve our nation, the 
     President, the people of the 5th Congressional District, and 
     the state of South Carolina, I hereby tender my resignation 
     as United States Representative, effective immediately.
       Thank you for your service to our state and your continued 
     friendship.
           Respectfully,
                                                    Mick Mulvaney,
     Member of Congress.
