                      RECOGNIZING DARREN LUTTRELL

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Darren Luttrell 
from Ohio County, in the First District of Kentucky.
  Darren was named the 2017 Farmer of the Year by the Kentucky Farm 
Bureau at their 98th annual meeting held in Louisville, Kentucky. 
Throughout an extensive interview process, Darren's steadfast 
commitment to agricultural modernization, education, and community 
involvement shone through every facet of his career and personal life.
  During his decades of experience in farm management and agricultural 
technology sales, Darren has not only doubled the size of his family 
farming operations, but has been an outstanding leader in the Ohio 
County Farm Bureau and his local chamber of commerce. Known to the 
students as Farmer Luttrell, he has inspired the next generation of 
agricultural leaders through his involvement with local schools.
  I am thankful for Darren's advocacy for Kentucky agriculture, and I 
join Kentucky Farm Bureau and all those Darren has served throughout 
his career in wishing him the best of luck as he competes at the 
Swisher Sweets-Sunbelt Ag Expo Southeastern Farmer of the Year 
competition in Georgia in 2018.
