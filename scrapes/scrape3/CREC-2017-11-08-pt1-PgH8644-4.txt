                    OUR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN NIGER

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm about our 
military operations in Niger.
  On October 4, four U.S. Army Special Operations Forces were 
tragically killed on a mission in Niger. My deepest condolences to the 
families of these fallen heroes.
  This is a mission, Mr. Speaker, which Congress still knows nothing 
about. And as recently as last week, Secretaries Tillerson and Mattis 
testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on this 
tragedy. But one question remains unanswered: Why were our 
servicemembers in Niger?
  It is outrageous that Congress has been left in the dark about these 
operations. At a minimum, we should have some basic knowledge of the 
missions we are asking servicemembers to risk their lives for.
  Myself and others sent a bipartisan letter to the administration 
demanding that President Trump seek authorization ahead of any future 
military operations in Niger.
  It is not just Niger. Speaker Ryan needs to stop blocking a debate 
and vote on these ongoing wars. The people deserve answers.
  What is the holdup, Mr. Speaker? What are you afraid of? Why don't 
you want the American people to know?
  Congress, yes, is missing in action. We owe it to our servicemembers 
and our constituents to have a debate and a vote on these ongoing wars. 
Congress needs to do its job.
