                  UNDETECTABLE FIREARMS MODERNIZATION

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, in 1988, Congress realized the danger posed 
by guns that can pass through security checkpoints undetected, and 
passed the Undetectable Firearms Act.
  The act, signed by President Reagan, has since been reauthorized 
under every single President, both Democrats and Republicans alike.
  When this bill originally became law, fully plastic guns were science 
fiction. But, today, plans for plastic guns are available online and 
can be produced at home with no technical expertise. Unfortunately, the 
Undetectable Firearms Act hasn't been updated since 1988, and glaring 
gaps exist.
  That is why today I am introducing the Undetectable Firearms 
Modernization Act. This bill will make modest changes to the original 
act to more fully adhere to the spirit of the law.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to be working to ensure that terrorists and 
criminals can't walk through security checkpoints with firearms 
undetected.
