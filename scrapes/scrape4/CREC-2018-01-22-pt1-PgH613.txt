    SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE STORY OF AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ON TRIAL IN 
                               CALIFORNIA

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, we are now 60 hours into the Schumer 
shutdown only because Senate and House Democrats would like to join 
them in forcing through an unfinished, hurried immigration policy.
  This fellow here--I am not even going to name his name--is on trial 
in northern California for killing two police officers. He was twice 
deported from Arizona.
  When the killings were described by others in the court, this fellow 
laughed and smiled as it was recalled. He then launched into a profane 
tirade, claiming his only regret is he didn't kill more than two 
officers and that he would escape from jail and he would do it again.
  I will even quote part of him, if I can:

       I don't blank regret that. The only thing I blanking regret 
     is that I only killed two. I wish I blank killed more. I will 
     break out soon, and I will kill more.

  He has promised, when he gets out, he will kill more.
  Does anybody out there believe that, under current policy, with the 
sieve of a border that we have, he won't fulfill that promise? Do we 
think that the families of Danny Oliver and Michael Davis or the 
families of Kate Steinle and Jamiel Shaw, Jr., have confidence that 
isn't going to happen?
