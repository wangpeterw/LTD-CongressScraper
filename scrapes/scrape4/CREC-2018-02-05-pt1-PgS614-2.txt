       SA 1921. Mr. McCONNELL (for Ms. Klobuchar) proposed an 
     amendment to the bill H.R. 582, to amend the Communications 
     Act of 1934 to require multi-line telephone systems to have a 
     configuration that permits users to directly initiate a call 
     to 9-1-1 without dialing any additional digit, code, prefix, 
     or post-fix, and for other purposes.
