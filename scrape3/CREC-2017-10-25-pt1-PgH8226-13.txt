            By Mr. SESSIONS:
        H.R. 4133.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Medicare is a health care program under current law that is 
     operated by the federal government. This bill would improve 
     the efficiency, accessibility and fairness of the operations 
     of this federal program, especially the purchase of services 
     and freedom to contract between doctors and Medicare 
     recipients. This bill directly affects interstate commerce, 
     which Congress has the power to regulate under Article I, 
     Section 8, Clause 3.
