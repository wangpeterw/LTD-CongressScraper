                        HURRICANE IRMA RECOVERY

 Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, due to ongoing efforts from 
Hurricane Irma, which devastated many parts of Florida, I am staying in 
my state to assess the damage and help marshal the full capacity of 
recovery resources available to us. Today I met with U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and personally showed him various 
parts of Florida's agriculture lands that were damaged by Hurricane 
Irma.
  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered 
to be printed in the Record.)
