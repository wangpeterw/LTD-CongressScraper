              REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GOING ALONG TO GET ALONG

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I sent my first paycheck as a 
bag boy at the A&P--$19-and-some-odd cents--to the Barry Goldwater 
campaign. I was 16 years old.
  I have been involved in almost every major Republican campaign in my 
State and nationally since then. But the Republican Party I grew up in 
was the fiscally conservative party. I wish it still was.
  But we will pass a spending bill today that is everything but 
fiscally conservative. Our national debt is now over $20 trillion. This 
bill will speed us down the road to $30 trillion.
  Our deficit last year was $666 billion. This bill will make it even 
higher this year. There is nothing fiscally conservative about this 
bill. Spending was already going up.
  Now we are busting the budget caps and adding another $300 billion 
more. Anyone who supports this bill cannot accurately say that they are 
fiscally conservative.
  It is very sad to me that the Republican Party I love is now going 
along to get along and spending many, many billions that we simply do 
not have.
