  Our legislation fulfills our constitutional duty to fund the 
government responsibly, to ensure that vital needs are met, to protect 
our Nation from harm within and outside our borders, and to govern in a 
way that will not only get things accomplished in Washington but that 
truly represents the people we serve. Our package is fiscally 
responsible.
  We brought all 12 appropriations bills through the committee process 
in record time and gave every Member the opportunity to make their mark 
on the bills in the earliest stages. Over the past week, we have 
debated and voted on hundreds of amendments in a very open process 
that, again, allowed every Member's voice to be heard.
  The results are bills that represent our shared values and 
priorities. I am proud we have brought forth an appropriations package 
that makes sure Americans have access to Federal services they rely on, 
encourages our economy to grow and thrive, and keeps our country safe.

  I would like to take a moment to thank the incredible 12 chairs; the 
12 ranking members; all members of the Appropriations Committee, the 
front office staff, both minority and majority, and particularly thank 
the clerks and the appropriations staff on both sides of the aisle for 
their hard work and dedication.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject the motion to recommit 
and vote ``yes'' on the Make America Secure and Prosperous Act, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is 
ordered on the motion to recommit.
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it.
