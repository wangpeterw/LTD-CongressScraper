333,topic-id,199,"Madam Speaker, in 2014, four MS-13 gang members brutally murdered a 14-year-old boy from Texas with a machete. Just this year, two MS-13 gang members laughed and waved at the cameras as they faced trial in a Houston courtroom for the kidnapping, rape, and murder of young girls. These are just two examples that reflect the horrific and gruesome reality of what gangs across this country are capable of.  There are as many as 100,000 gang members in my home State of Texas, several of whom are linked to Mexican cartels, who help them distribute drugs and traffic people and weapons. Nearly 60 percent of identified prison gang members in Texas are serving sentences for violent crimes, including homicide, robbery, and assault.  MS-13 is one of the most dangerous gangs in our State, with almost 500 members throughout They have been described by the Houston police chief as a ``transnational terrorist organization,'' the ``worst of the worst,'' and a ``cancer.'' It is State and local law enforcement officers like him, as well gang task forces, who are on the front lines, putting their own lives in danger to deal with these heinous criminals.

Mr.Gonzales grew up in the Hispanic neighborhoods of South Omaha but, unfortunately, fell into drugs and alcohol and was part of a street gang by the age of 11. At the age of 23, Alberto met Sister Joyce Englert, who helped him learn about Christ and get off drugs permanently. As a result, Beto committed his life to helping youth.  Beto runs youth drug and alcohol treatment groups, outreach with schools, and served as a Boys Town crisis hotline counselor. Today, he serves[[Page H7386]]as an Omaha Police Department gang prevention and intervention specialist and a youth counselor for the South Omaha Boys and Girls Through these efforts, Alberto Gonzales has touched and changed the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of youths in the Hispanic community.

This deals with the subject matter of ``Buy American'' in the National Defense Authorization  I have long been a strong supporter of our manufacturing sector, of our national security, and I believe this amendment strongly supports both.  All week we have been going back and forth about whether we are going to vote on amendments to this measure. The Senate is supposed to be an institution where we can debate and bring our ideas forward, represent our States, represent the hard workers of this Nation, and I reserve the right to object to this unanimous consent request because I am frustrated, on behalf of those I represent, that we are not going to see a vote on this ``Buy American'' amendment.  I would additionally note the unique status we have--actually, in this case, a Statement of Administration Policy indicating strong support for the amendment that I have filed. To me, the ultimate test will be what is in the final bill that is signed into law. I am going to continue to push on, but I am, again, disappointed that this Senate is not operating in a fashion where we can offer amendments, debate those amendments, and have votes on those amendments.

51,topic-id,1827,"Mr.President, last week, the junior Senator from Vermont and a group of other Democrats unveiled a proposal to have Washington take over healthcare for everyone in Some refer to it as They intend to do this on the backs of American seniors, which is of grave concern to me as a doctor who has taken care of many senior citizens--many people on Medicaid--as part of my practice as an orthopedic surgeon. Their idea is to put everyone in this country on a new program that operates like That is about 250 million Americans who would be added on to the Medicare Program, which is already being strained.  One-third of the Democrats in the Senate have signed on to this plan. It seems to be the litmus test for the liberal left. Several of them came to the floor last night to criticize efforts by the Republican Party to save America's failing healthcare system. Problems with the American healthcare system, as a result of ObamaCare, continue to get worse, and the impacts, such as those that I hear every weekend in Wyoming, including this past weekend.  From what I heard from the Democrats, they seem to want to let the system collapse in a way that they can then impose a complete Washington takeover of healthcare in To me, this plan they are proposing is going to be devastating to people currently on These are the seniors who rely on Medicare today. What the Democrats are proposing is going to, in my opinion, undermine the stability, the integrity, and the certainty of the Medicare Program on which our seniors rely, and for them, it is truly their lives that depend upon it.  Remember when President Obama promised that if people liked their insurance, they could keep their insurance, and that if they liked their plan, they could keep their plan? Well, people realize that is not exactly what happened. Many people lost their plan. They lost their insurance. It got more expensive, harder to afford, and millions ended up paying a fine, a fee, or a tax--whatever you want to call it--because they weren't able to afford the premiums for the plan that President Obama said they had to buy, and they lost their own plans. Well, now it seems that if Democrats have their way, millions of seniors will find out that they are not going to be able to keep the insurance that they have right now that they depend upon and that they use on a daily basis.  The Sanders plan will get rid of Medicare Advantage plans. We have 17 million seniors in this country who are on a Medicare Advantage plan. The reason they sign up for Medicare Advantage is that for them personally, when they study it, there are advantages to Medicare Advantage for them in terms of preventive care and coordinated care. That would all go away under  It is interesting to watch this whole process unfold because one in three people who are currently on Medicare have chosen to go outside the system the Democrats want to put them into. They want to put everyone into it, but a third of the people on Medicare have chosen a different way.  What happens to these 17 million Americans who are currently on Medicare Advantage with the scheme that Senator Sanders and other Democrats have come up with? They don't say. Did the Democrats who came to the floor last night have anything to say about these 17 million seniors who would lose their Medicare, seniors who are on Medicare today? What is going to happen to them? They are going to lose what they have today.  A lot of seniors are probably going to lose access to their doctors as well because when their plans change, their doctors change. That is because there are going to be doctors who won't be able to take care of these new Medicare patients whom ObamaCare has caused to have problems, but it is made worse with what is being proposed by Senator  Right now, it can be tough for a senior to find a doctor. These are seniors on That is because today about one in four doctors doesn't take new Medicare patients or take any Medicare patients. But certainly as more and more people--and 10,000 baby boomers a day are turning 65 and going on There are more and more people on Medicare without an expansion of the number of doctors to take care of them.  Since the reimbursement is lower, what doctors and hospitals are paid to take care of Medicare patients is lower than what those doctors or hospitals get paid for patients with private insurance. Their priority, when they are already crowded and loaded in their office and very busy taking care of patients, with waiting rooms full--their choice, of course, is to choose patients who pay them more than what they get from the government.  You say: Why is that? Is that right?  Well, having practiced medicine for 24 years and having run an office, there are issues related to paying nurses, healthcare personnel, rent, electricity--all the costs of running an office, let alone the high cost of medical malpractice insurance. We know the huge cost of that. A physician who wants to be able to pay his or her bills needs to take all those things into consideration. And with Medicare paying less than the current going rate for care at hospitals and with doctors, the concern is, Will Medicare patients be able to find a doctor in the first place?  The Democrats' solution is to cram more people onto Medicare when we already have 10,000 people a day joining the ranks of Medicare and Social If a doctor has a lot of Medicare patients, he or she has to make sure they have enough other patients who have insurance to make up for the lower rates Washington pays. Well, under the Democratic plan, doctors won't have the backup of private insurance companies because that is all going to go away.  All those things will be lost to people who want to buy private insurance. Under the plan the Democrats are now--and it is not just Democrats in the Senate; a majority of the Democrats in the House of Representatives have cosponsored legislation by Representative Conyers that does exactly the same thing: puts everyone on a Medicare Program--a government takeover of healthcare.  When the Democrats came to the floor last night, I didn't hear them say anything about that. How are they going to guarantee that seniors will keep their doctors? Seniors are not going to be able to keep their doctors[[Page S5840]]under the Sanders liberal-left plan that is being proposed and cosponsored by over half of the Democrats who are in the House of  We are already facing a shortage of doctors in this country. The Association of American Medical Colleges, which helps oversee the training of doctors, says that the shortfall could be as many as 100,000 doctors across the country within the next decade. If we have fewer doctors and more people trying to get appointments, that means less access for seniors.  It is not even clear if Washington can afford to add every man, woman, and child on to a government program like Medicare because Washington has done a terrible job in running Medicare as it is. The Medicare trust fund is supposed to be exhausted at the end of the 2020s. That is what the Medicare trustees are telling us. In 12 years, they say, there will only be enough money coming in to fund about 8 or 9 cents on the dollar of what the benefits for Medicare are supposed to be paying out. The program is going to have to start doing something--either raising taxes or cutting benefits. From what I have seen proposed by Senator Sanders, it would be raising taxes a lot. The Medicare trustees say the program needs significant reform. They say it is already unsustainable. The Democrats' plan does nothing to change any of that. It does nothing to reform the program. All it does is crowd more people into a system that is already struggling financially.  My concern is that the Democrats' plan is going to undermine the stability of the Medicare Program that our seniors desperately need. We should be taking steps now to shore up, to strengthen Medicare so that it is able to keep the promises that we made to our seniors. My goal is to save, to strengthen, and to simplify That is not what we are seeing here.  A few years ago, we knew the Medicaid Program needed help. Democrats just threw more people into the system with That is what they did. With the expansion of ObamaCare, the majority of people who have new coverage under ObamaCare didn't get it through private insurance; they were put in to the Medicaid Program, which has significantly strained Medicaid and made it much harder for people on Medicaid, the people for whom it was originally designed--low-income, women, children, people with disabilities. It was designed to help them. It made it harder for them to get care because all these individuals who were working-age adults were put on in addition.  Now it looks as though the Democrats want to do the same thing they did to hurt Medicaid--make it harder for our patients on It won't work. An insurance card does not equal accessible, available access to care. The people who suffer the most are going to be the seniors who have no other options. These are seniors who are relying on Medicare today. They were promised that Medicare would be there for them. We need to keep that promise.  Instead of protecting seniors today, however, Democrats are trying to give Medicare to everyone else. So 17 million seniors are going to lose access to the plans that they have chosen, that work for them, and that they want to keep.  Seniors are going to lose access to the doctors that Democrats push out of the system as they continue to put more and more people on Democrats should not be building their takeover of the American healthcare system on the backs of our seniors.

272,topic-id,1640,"Mr.President, I thank the leaders of the Armed Services I know the Presiding Officer serves on that committee so he is well aware of the extraordinary work and service done by Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed and our colleagues on the committee who have cooperated so collegially, in a bipartisan way, to produce a defense bill that supports our military men and women and their families and, more importantly, supports the United States of America in continuing to be the greatest and strongest power ever on the planet.  I want to talk about some of the specifics of that measure but first want to honor the 17 sailors who perished on the USS McCain and USS Two of them were sailors from Connecticut, and I want to pay tribute to ET2 Dustin Doyon of Suffield and ST2 Ngoc Truong Huynh of Watertown, They were true patriots. Their families[[Page S5722]]should be proud of them. All of Connecticut celebrates their extraordinary service and sacrifice to our Nation, even as we are struck by the grief and share the sadness of their families as best we can.  I know we also feel we owe it to them, their families, and all families of the men and women in uniform to be safe. The investigation is proceeding into the circumstances surrounding the crash that caused their deaths. I will be interested, and I hope that investigation will be expedited.  The NDAA is a vital measure that preserves our national security in an uncertain era of unprecedented threats and delivers support necessary to sustain our servicemembers and our national defense. A number of the provisions I helped craft in this measure will improve opportunities for veterans, military sexual assault survivors, help with the Ukrainian soldiers, and extend the Afghan special immigrant visa program. Those measures, among others, I am proud to have participated in crafting and supporting.  This year's bill invests billions of dollars in submarines, helicopters, and the Joint Strike Fighter engine, all produced by Connecticut's highly skilled and dedicated workforce.  The bill includes over $8 billion for Virginia and Columbia class submarines, including over $1 billion above the President's request for Virginia funding and full funding for the Columbia class program following a successful amendment I led to secure our undersea superiority and grow Connecticut jobs. Nothing is more important to our national defense than our undersea superiority. The stealth, strength, and power of our submarine force is vital to our national security.  The measure also includes $25 million for undersea research and development partnerships which Electric Boat and the University of Connecticut are well poised to take part in.  This defense measure provides, as well, $10.6 billion for 94 Joint Strike Fighters across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, adding 24 above the budget request submitted by the Those 24 are necessary, and they are important now.  It includes $1 billion for 48 Army Black Hawks, $1.3 billion for six Marine Corps CH-53Ks--two more than requested--and $354 million for the Air Force Combat Rescue Helicopter  Today our Active and Reserve components are deployed together in Afghanistan, and the National Guard brings unique capabilities to the fight. I am very proud of the Connecticut National I am proud to be a supporter, to work to protect and secure their vital mission as they work for us.  This year's NDAA authorizes $7 million in military construction for a new base entry complex, bringing the 103rd Airlift Wing into compliance with the Department of Defense's antiterrorism and force protection requirements to support their C-130 mission.  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. For these reasons and many others, this bill keeps faith with our military men and women. It secures our national defense. It provides the assurance going forward that we will remain as strong as we need to be as the world's only superpower, guaranteeing not only our own freedom but that of others around the world.  As we consider amendments on the floor, I urge my colleagues to reject the new BRAC proposal that was introduced by Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed as McCain amendment 933. With all due respect, I support the intent. Again, I thank them for all of their work on this bill, as it has been an extraordinary accomplishment to bring it this far and to, hopefully, within the next few days, get it over the finish line. The intent is good. Our military is capitalizing on future savings where they exist, and it must continue to do so. Base closings will be necessary, as that is a stark fact of life, but I cannot support the BRAC effort they have proposed.  The BRAC amendment would set in motion a long and time-consuming and convoluted base closure process. Connecticut is all too familiar with that process. We had a near-death experience with our base not all that long ago. It was an experience that should sound alarm bells not only for Connecticut but for other States my colleagues represent. As a Senator who represents one of the last military bases in New England, I am deeply concerned that there may be harm to civil-military relations and harm to our national security that will be caused by closing bases in our region.  The first obligation of Congress is to do no harm to these military bases. Connecticut has seen this process before. It took almost a decade for the Connecticut Air National Guard to be assigned the C-130 flying mission that was the outcome of the last BRAC round. To carry out this mission, the Connecticut Air National Guard began deploying in support of operations in the Middle East this year.  I know personally about that BRAC process. I was involved in the BRAC Commission proceedings, and afterward I was involved in literally suing the Secretary of Defense to preserve the flying mission of our base at the Air National Guard in Closing that base to the Air National Guard, to the C-130, or to other planes like it would have been a disgraceful outcome, but we succeeded in reaching a result, through settlement, that preserved it.  The submarine capital of the world, also known as the ``First and Finest Submarine Base,'' is in The fate of that base, the Naval Submarine Base of New London, was unnecessarily put in jeopardy in 2005 as it endured unnecessary questions over its viability and military value that delayed investments and the homeporting of submarines there. Given the importance and prominence of our submarine fleet today, as well as the $17 million since 2005 that the State has invested in this base--$17 million invested by the taxpayers of the State of Connecticut--it is inconceivable that we would close this asset. It is home to 16 submarines as well as to a submarine training school.  BRAC is long on unrealized returns and short on increased readiness. In 2005, BRAC was anticipated to cost $21 billion and save over $35 billion in the next 20 years. In reality, costs have ballooned to $35 billion, and savings will be less than one-third of what was initially projected--just $10 billion. That is the 2005 BRAC verdict; that it costs more than it saves. Simply put, BRAC cuts capabilities, and we can never get those capabilities back. At a time of global uncertainty and an expanding threat environment, we should be investing more, not less, in our readiness.  As a first step, I would welcome an independent study on where excess capacity exists today, but I am concerned that this amendment sets into motion a BRAC authorization before Congress is provided with the justification for doing so and where and how it should be set in motion. I am concerned this amendment employs a force structure baseline that has not been adequately assessed by the Department of That force structure baseline is the lifeblood of our future military, and moving forward without it provides a distorted view of where excess capacity may exist.  The BRAC amendment eliminates the independent commission that was previously designed by Congress in an effort to take politics out of the process. I deeply respect my colleagues who support this measure, but I have no confidence that they will be able to set aside the impact closures will have on their individual Let's be very blunt. This measure will exacerbate the role of politics in this process, not diminish it.  While an independent commission is by no measure completely above politics, removing it will aggravate the roles that parochialism and politics play in deciding the future of military installations. Under the rules of the Senate, this body stripped itself of the ability to even make requests for individual military construction projects at specific bases. It follows that deciding the fate of entire military bases should also be a power we keep from ourselves.  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, for our own sake, as Members of a body that should support our national defense, keep it as free as possible from politics and parochialism, and make sure we insulate it as much as possible from the currents and forces of special interests. I admire and respect the time and effort our committee leaders have devoted to this amendment. If it is defeated, I will[[Page S5723]]work with them to address the issues I have outlined. Base closing must be considered. There are bases that can and should be reduced and perhaps completely eliminated, but I cannot support the BRAC amendment before us, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.  Again, I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain, and the ranking member, Senator Reed, for all of their great work on this very important measure, which I hope will be passed shortly.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgS5712-3.txt,2076,HURRICANE IRMA RECOVERY,2017.0,14.0,September
441,topic-id,1240,"Mr.President, I thank the majority leader for yielding me this time before we close business today, as the last speaker of the day.  Let me first of all say how deeply we feel about folks who have been affected by these mammoth storms in the gulf coast, in Florida, and in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, as well as others elsewhere. Our hearts and prayers are with them.  I am here today to talk about another potential disaster to our country, although it is of a completely different kind and not a physical disaster made by nature but a disaster potentially of our own making--one that can be prevented and avoided. I am horrified that I am here again, fighting back again, against a proposal that would devastate the health and finances of so many families in Connecticut and around the country.  This proposal--the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill--is cruel beyond measure. It is undoubtedly the most extreme proposal we have seen from my Republican colleagues in their political crusade to destroy the successes of the Affordable Care How illogical and irresponsible to pretend, as my Republican colleagues continue to do, that any proposal that cuts billions of dollars from Medicaid and decimates important Affordable Care Act provisions protecting people with preexisting conditions and high medical costs will somehow result in a better healthcare system. In fact, it will vastly diminish and in some respects destroy that system.  The Republican obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act and gutting Medicaid really has to end, and it has to end today.  My constituents in Connecticut made themselves heard loud and clear in saying that past proposals were sickening attempts to ruin the gains we have made in providing better healthcare to many people. Those folks who came to town meetings and emergency field hearings, who wrote, who phoned, who made their views known, were the catalyst in defeating these ill-advised efforts before. I can assure you that, once again, they will be heard. They will make themselves heard. They will, once again, guarantee its defeat.  Under this lethal proposal, hundreds of billions of dollars will be cut from Those severe cuts will cause Connecticut more than $2 billion by 2026. In 2027 alone, without the reauthorization of funds, Connecticut would lose $4 billion. In 2027 alone, $4 billion would be lost to Connecticut without reauthorization. Those are not just dollars, those are lives. They are hundreds of thousands of lives.  This bill would end the patient protection that countless Americans have come to rely on in their oftentimes lifesaving care. States would allow insurance companies to reimpose annual caps and lifetime limits; insurers could decide to drop essential health benefits, like maternity care or mental health services; and those with preexisting conditions could see their premiums skyrocket, leaving them with no affordable options and nowhere to turn. It would be a humanitarian catastrophe. This is not hyperbole. It is not exaggeration. It is reality.  In a recent report on this legislation, there was a finding that a person with metastatic cancer would see a $142,650 premium surcharge; a pregnancy would mean a $17,320 premium surcharge; and, during a deadly and unrelenting opioid epidemic, people struggling with substance abuse disorder could expect to see a $20,450 premium surcharge. These effects are immoral and incomprehensible. They will lead to many Americans needlessly losing their health insurance and very likely their lives.  When I see the true effects of this bill and what they are likely to be, I can't help but think of a little boy in Connecticut whom I mentioned on the floor before. He is 7-year-old Conner Conner has Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It is a chronic and terminal condition that will slowly erode his motor functions unless there is a cure, and none exists now. This disease will eventually take his life. He is a young man of extraordinary courage and strength and so is his family.  His parents have told me that although he appears healthy, he will slowly lose his ability to run, walk, or even hug them goodnight. In fact, earlier this summer, just days before the last Republican effort to gut Medicaid and repeal the Affordable Care Act--which failed in the Senate, fortunately--Conner's family had two lifts installed in their home so he could move up and down the stairs more easily. The video shows Conner's infectious smile as he tries out the new lift, not fully understanding the disease that necessitates it but enjoying his newfound freedom. He is just a little kid.  His mom wrote that this experience shows just how important Medicaid is to their family. As Conner gets older, he will only need more and more help, more medical services and equipment, and more financial support for his family to enable that kind of care. He will need a loving and compassionate healthcare system that will protect and care for him when he is at his most vulnerable. That is the only way he will have a fair chance at life. This bill, to put it mildly, deprives him of that fair chance.  So I question whether my Republican colleagues can look Conner or his family in the eye and explain to them why protections for children with preexisting conditions should be weakened, diminished, eviscerated. I question whether they can look at Conner's smile and tell him why Medicaid will be eliminated. This is the program that one day will make sure he has everything he needs to live. It is a program that should be enhanced, not cut by hundreds of billions of dollars.  Tell his parents why the insufficient or temporary funds my colleagues have proposed to replace Medicaid will run out in 10 years, as a shadow of Medicaid that you have left behind goes dark. See whether Conner's family cares about your legislation. See if your empty promises leave them reassured.  I can tell you, Conner's parents are two of the kindest, most wonderful people you will ever meet. They are also among the hardest working. They worry about countless things every single day. They worry about Conner's slowing body and medical research that could save him before that pernicious disease takes his life. They worry[[Page S5869]]about his independence. They worry about his two brothers and the toll this awful disease will have on them. They worry about those stairs--the ones that will have a lift. I promise you, Conner's parents worry nonstop. All of us worry about our children. They worry about Conner unceasingly.  I will say it again. I am ready to work with all my colleagues on solutions to the healthcare problems our country faces. They are urgent and important--critically important--to address. I refuse to stand silently and let this cruel proposal give Conner's family even more reason to worry.  We as a country are better than these reprehensible proposals--first, repeal and replace; now, Graham-They are all different versions of TrumpCare that is a catastrophe which will lead to a humanitarian crisis. This heartless proposal should be put behind us. We should work together as our colleagues Senators Alexander and Murray are doing and, at least for the moment, give Conner some assurance that we are making things better for him, not worse, and the parents who worry about their little boy know that at least we are moving in the right direction, not rolling back the progress we have made.

63,topic-id,1921,"Mr.President, I want to talk about healthcare and what it means to families and what it means to communities. It is the most personal thing that families deal with. Every family knows that at some point they are going to deal with not one but multiple healthcare issues as life progresses, as things happen in life--at times you don't expect them to happen in life--and nothing is more riveting or focusing than healthcare.  Somebody told me one time--and I have said this on the floor of the Senate before because I think it is such a good observation about what happens in healthcare. Somebody told me that when everybody in your family is well, you have lots of problems. When somebody in your family is sick, you have one problem.  So it is not like tax policy or energy policy or the intricacies of this or that; it is something that every family and every individual identifies with in a unique way. It is one of the reasons the debate is so passionate, and I think it may be one of the reasons why sometimes we see exaggerated claims about how a plan I may be for is going to cause more people to have healthcare problems than if that plan didn't pass. I certainly wouldn't intend for that to be the case. What we are all looking for is the best plan that addresses this problem in the best way.  In the debate we had 6 weeks ago, I remember looking across the Senate floor at one of my colleagues who stood up and said: If the plan passes that many of my colleagues are going to vote for--he may have said the people across the aisle are going to vote for--health insurance rates are going to go up next year by 20 percent. Missourians have already seen a 145-percent increase, under the plan we have now, in 3 years. The rates that were just filed have ranged from a 35-percent increase to a 47-percent increase. So it is a pretty safe prediction by my friend on the other side who said that if the plan I was for passed, health insurance rates would go up 20 percent.  The plan he had been for--the plan they were defending--is out of control. There is no argument that what we have now is not working.  Families who have coverage don't really have access. So many families with coverage have these high-deductible policies with insurance rates that, first of all, they can't afford the premium. If they are somehow able to scrape the money together to afford the premium--I think the average deductible in the bronze plan was $6,000 per individual, and for almost all of those plans, if you had more than one individual in your family, you had to hit the per individual rate twice if two[[Page S5847]]people got sick. So you were paying maybe $1,000 or more a month, and that was for insurance coverage. Then, if somebody got sick, you had another $12,000 that potentially would kick in before your insurance plan helped at all.  Not only was that not real coverage, but it clearly wasn't access. It clearly didn't provide the opportunity to go to the doctor and have the kind of healthcare you need so you don't have a tens of thousands of dollars healthcare crisis that arises needlessly. Some of us will have those problems no matter how well we take care of ourselves, but access to healthcare matters, and healthcare that works where you live matters. Frankly, that is the plan Senators Cassidy and Graham have come up with--a plan that would take the decision making for government-assisted healthcare out of Washington and put it back in the  When one of my Congressmen from Southwest Missouri was a freshman Congressman, decades ago in the House of Representatives, he was on the committee at the time that wrote the laws and regulations for Washington, Somebody asked him why he thought he was smart enough to write the laws for Washington, His hometown happened to be Sarcoxie,  He said: In my hometown, almost everybody knows where Washington, DC, is, but here in Washington, almost nobody knows where Sarcoxie is. Does that mean the people in Sarcoxie are a lot smarter than the people in Washington? Maybe not, but it meant they probably knew what was better for Sarcoxie than the people in Washington did.  So what Senators Graham and Cassidy are talking about is looking at taking all the money we are currently spending in this government-assisted healthcare world and divide it up among the States in a more equitable way. Right now, four of the States get about 37 percent of all the money. You don't have to be a math genius to figure out that means the other 46 States must get about 63 percent of all the money. Now, if 37 percent of all people in the country lived in those four States, that might be a reasonable way to divide up the money or even if 37 percent of people with income and health needs that were so significant they needed more help than everybody else lived in those four States, that might be a reasonable way to divide up all the money, but neither of those things are true. What this plan would do would be to look for a new way to more fairly allocate the money we spend on healthcare and then let State governments experiment with what to do about that.  Jefferson said, in our system, the States had the unique ability to be laboratories for change because they could try things and see if they worked and then share with the other States what worked, but there was no vision at the time that the Federal Government was the best place to do everything. This is really sort of a debate between are you for federalism or are you for government-run everything.  I guess 30 percent of the Democrats in the Senate, just a few days ago, said they were for government-run everything in healthcare. They were for single-payer healthcare. I am not for that. I don't think that is the best way for our system to work or to find the healthcare innovations we need or the access to healthcare people in desperate moments should always have, but I do think we could do a better job serving healthcare needs for people in the 50 States and the territories if, in fact, we gave them more authority to do that.  First of all, in all likelihood, you will get your healthcare in the place you live, and you are more likely going to be able to get access to the same healthcare your local State representative gets, where it is not just me arguing for what is good for Missouri or my colleague in the Senate arguing for what is good for our State or the eight people we have in the It takes all 163 house members in our State, the 34 senators, and the Governor leading to have a real understanding of where 200 legislative families get their healthcare and where 200 people who are making that decision--who see people at school and the grocery store--that is a lot different than just seeing 10 people, sending them to Washington, and saying: Why don't we adjust the one-size-fits-all system so it serves our State better.  If you have ever bought any one-size-fits-all clothes, you are a very unique person if they actually fit you. One-size-fits-all almost never fits anybody. Even in a State, it is hard enough to come up with a plan that fits everybody in the State in the best possible way, but we would be much more likely to do that than we would to suggest what happens in Manhattan and what happens in Marshfield, MO, are the same thing because they are not. People in New York are going to come up with a more likely way to address those issues and figure out what healthcare is there, what they need to do to augment it, what they need to do to be sure it is available to the most people in the most cost-effective way, and in Jefferson City, MO, they are more likely to answer all of those questions for our State than, frankly, they are at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington,  Even if they want to do that--even if they are all Missourians who take over the Department of Health and Human Services, their goal would not be to figure out what is best for where I live. Their goal would be to come up with one plan that is best for the whole country, and it is just not working very well.  First of all, it is not working very well because it is clearly not divided in an equitable way. No matter what formula you put in place, four States having that much of the money spent in their States is not the right kind of system to have. There are ways to adjust for need, there are ways to adjust for location, but those ways are not going to be found in waivers Governors would ask for but are more likely to be found in State capitols than they are here.  This is the classic example of why our government has worked as long as it has in so many areas, but every time we try to become responsible for everything at every level, we mess up. Every time we think different regulations have to be passed by city government, county government, State government, Federal Government, that never works very well.  This is an opportunity to say to States: We are going to let you be responsible for devising a system for people in your State that meets the needs of people in your State, and we are going to do that in a more effective way than has been done in the past. The growth of healthcare programs has never been allowed to be looked at in a way where you look at all the programs and put them together in a way that really works.  So we are going to have an opportunity to make a big decision about the future of healthcare. We are going to be deciding, among other things, do we trust people to make that decision who are closer to the problem or do we think it is better to try to solve the problem further away from the problem. I think the right answer here is, clearly, what we are doing isn't working.  Let's take advantage of the Constitution and the Federal system of government, and let's come up with a plan that uniquely can work--in Florida where you live, in Missouri where I live, in Louisiana where Senator Kennedy lives--that has a unique opportunity to serve the families where the 1 thing they take most personally is the health and welfare of their family. Everybody has to deal with this. Let's try to create an environment where everybody gets to deal with this where there is the greatest opportunity, greatest sensitivity, greatest availability, and greatest understanding of how, if those things aren't working, to uniquely come up with a solution to the problems in that State that are very likely not the problems that need to be solved in the entire country.

First organized as a prayer band on August 8, 1917, Mount Airy has had many homes throughout its 100-year history. Over its history, while its base home address might have changed, the Mount Airy membership and effect of its faith leadership grew.  Today Mount Airy is a thriving house of worship led by pastor Reverend Charles Brown, Pastor Brown received an honorary doctorate degree of divinity from Western Bible College, becoming the first pastor in the history of Mount Airy Missionary Baptist Church to receive an honorary degree.

15,topic-id,578,"Mr.President, I rise to speak in honor of the 70th anniversary of the United States Air  In the seven decades since its inception on September 18, 1947, the U.Air Force has bravely fought to protect freedom, liberty, and peace on every continent around the globe. From active participation in major international conflicts to providing humanitarian support throughout the world, the U.Air Force has continued to be the Nation's leading edge across every domain and throughout every location by meeting the challenges of an ever-changing world with limitless strength, resolve, and patriotism. Today, more than 100,000 airmen are standing watch at 175 global locations, committed to continuously defending the people and interests of the greatest Nation in the world.  As cochair of the Senate Air Force Caucus and the son of a retired Air Force master sergeant, I have been personally touched by the proud history of this distinguished service. From the earliest days of aviation when the Department of War accepted its first military airplane to the present-day delivery of global airpower, the U.Air Force has made tremendous strides in the technological innovation and operationalization of air, space, and cyberspace warfighting capabilities.  The earliest aviation pioneers believed in the notion of airpower and fought for its development into a force so formidable that its responsibilities[[Page S5832]]and contributions would eventually be recognized as being equal to those of land and sea power. In essence, the birth of the U.Air Force began the dawn of a new era, where the skies became the ultimate high ground.  As we celebrate this historic occasion, we must also remember and honor the courageous men and women of the U.Air Force, as the service would not be what it is today without these fine airmen.  I had the privilege of speaking at the Department of Defense's National Prisoner of War/Missing In Action Recognition Day last week. It served as a poignant reminder of the many sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform.  One such airman, Kenneth Newton Walker, played an important role in building the organization that would later become an independent air service. General Walker's direct contributions to crafting doctrine and policy were instrumental to the creation of the modern U.Air  General Walker was reported missing in action after his B-17 Flying Fortress went missing over Papua, New Guinea, in 1943, and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President The actions of fearless warriors like General Walker symbolize a continuing commitment to meeting the demands of an increasingly dynamic and dangerous world with limitless strength, resolve, and determination.  These dedicated airmen and their values of integrity, service before self, and excellence that they uphold in all they do embody a proud heritage, a tradition of honor, and a legacy of valor. We owe them a tremendous amount of gratitude for the sacrifices they have made defending the greatest country on Earth on this, the 70th anniversary of the United States Air  I am especially proud of my home State of Arkansas and its contribution to our air superiority. The Little Rock Air Force Base and the 188th Wing in Fort Smith play an important role in our national security. I am proud to support these missions and look forward to continuing to support our airmen stationed in Arkansas and throughout the world.  I am pleased to be here speaking on behalf of a grateful nation, remembering, honoring, and commending our airmen and the world's greatest Air  I yield back.

49,topic-id,1344,"Mr.President, my colleagues have been here on the floor over the last few minutes, last night, this morning, and this afternoon to talk about our distress about people trying again to push the repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a successful strategy to move our Nation forward with more affordability.  We just received a letter from 10 Governors basically telling us the same thing, to slow down and work on a bipartisan basis. They are basically telling us the proposal people are trying to rush through without regular order is not the kind of thing which will help us in making the necessary reforms.  I think these bipartisan Governors--from the Governor of Colorado to the Governor of Ohio, to the Governor of Alaska, the spectrum of Democrats, Republican, and Independents is something people in the United States of America should listen to because it is important we get this right because the affordability of healthcare is so important.  What I don't like about the proposal now being pushed by my colleagues--even though they want the States to have some flexibility and play a larger role--is that it basically ends the 52-year State-Federal partnership we know as Medicaid today; that is, it changes the dynamic in saying that the States and the Federal Government are in business together to take care of a population that is the most vulnerable of citizens in our country and that giving them affordable access to healthcare is a priority because it actually reduces everybody's healthcare costs.  When people think about the expense in healthcare, ask any provider, and they will tell you that 1 in 5 dollars spent on the Federal system drives the cost of everybody's insurance. If you leave people uninsured, they go to the hospital, they raise the cost to everybody. It is not a good strategy. We have seen States that have covered people on Medicaid actually raise people out of poverty, help their economies, and reduce the costs at individual hospitals, thereby driving down the cost of private insurance.  Why would we want to destroy that by authorizing in legislation the end of this 52-year relationship between the Federal Government and States, trying to make sure our populations are covered; that if a State spends a dollar, they can count on the Federal Government to spend that dollar as well and to continue the partnership that works cost-effectively.  What I also don't like is it sunsets Medicaid for 15 million people. If you are going to sunset Medicaid for these 15 million people, when are you going to sunset Medicaid for the rest of the Medicaid population? When are you going to try, by legislative action, to curtail the opportunities for millions of Americans who use Medicaid as a stabilizing force for health insurance in America? In our State, 600,000 people--most of whom were previously uninsured--would be in that sunset of  The legislation my colleagues are pushing would basically end the funding for this block grant program in 2027, which would leave States with an unfunded bill for those individuals of about $300 billion. I doubt States have the money. I doubt the individual market is going to take care of those individuals as cost-effectively as we are taking care of them through States will then cost shift these resources back to the public, raising everybody's rates again.  Our job has to be about affordability. It has to be about driving down costs. It has to be about driving down costs in the individual market and driving down costs of the delivery system overall. There is nothing innovative about kicking 15 million people off Medicaid and sunsetting it in this bill.  I also object to the notion, in this bill, of literally advocating the privatization of They are advocating that what you do with this population is take them off the current program and shift them onto the private individual market.  Some people who are following this might say: Well, wait. Then they can go to the private market--and, yes, there is support to make sure we have affordable health insurance. No, because the legislation also says you stop that support by 2027. So this is just one more sneak attack by our colleagues at kicking people off To start the process and agree to privatize Medicaid, where is it going to end?  I am the first to say we can improve our delivery system, that we can save money. I have advocated I think one of the most cost-effective ideas of the Affordable Care Act; that is, to move the population of our citizens who need care in the later years of their life off nursing home care and into community-based care. It is one-third the cost. Our State, the State of Washington, saved more than $2 billion doing this over a 15-year period of time. If other States would do this, we could save $100 billion or more by having States give people the opportunity to age at home and have a long-term care delivery system which works in our communities. It is one-third the cost.  That is innovation. Those are cost savings. That is improvement on our current delivery system, hopefully covering an aging baby boomer population that will reach retirement and a population of Americans who are going to live longer.  There is nothing innovative about just privatizing Social Security, privatizing Medicaid, and kicking people off by shifting them over to an exchange and then cutting the resources for the exchange. I hope our colleagues will stop the notion that somehow this is innovation. It is not innovation. It is sunsetting, it is privatization, and it is cutting people off care. That is why we have heard from these Governors and others about why it is so important not to take this bait.  We need to make sure we are continuing our bipartisan discussions, continuing to work together about what will drive affordability into the market. Bundling up a population and giving them clout to negotiate on rates and giving a State the ability to negotiate on rates--either on drug costs or on insurance--yes, this can save dollars. It is being done right now in New York and Minnesota, and it can be done in other places.  Cost-shifting to the States this $300 billion or then making States make[[Page S5839]]the draconian decision of, ``I already shifted that population onto the exchange. Oh, my gosh. The Federal Government just cut the funds we are going to get,'' and the next thing you know, this population is left without care.  Privatizing Medicaid is not the way to go. I hope our colleagues will continue to discuss, on a bipartisan basis, the aspects of the Affordable Care Act that could be expanded to drive down costs and increase affordability. I hope they will continue to make sure things like basic health--the essential elements of what should be covered in a basic plan--are there for our consumers; that we are not going to take the bait in thinking that by cutting essential services to people, somehow that is the way to get a private insurance plan.  We have the ability to work together. My colleagues and I have been working and discussing these ideas. My colleagues Senator Murray and Senator Alexander are working on various ideas in their HELP Committee, as we are working in the Finance Committee, in making sure we expand and fund the affordability of insurance for children and their families under the Children's Health Insurance or CHIP program.  Let's not make this worse. Let us not end this 52-year relationship that has successfully covered a population of America, and let's not fall for the bait and think that somehow this is going to save the American taxpayer money. It is not. It is going to cost shift right back to the private individual, raise individual rates, and we can't afford it. Let's not privatize Let's fight to make it a more cost-effective program for the future.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Direct Support Professionals are an invaluable part of our Nation's health care system, caring for the most vulnerable Americans, including the chronically ill, seniors, and those living with a disability. With the help of Direct Support Professionals, these individuals can perform daily activities that many people take for granted, such as eating, bathing, dressing, and leaving the house. The work of Direct Support Professionals ensures that these individuals can be active participants in their communities.  In our Country, we are incredibly fortunate to have millions of service-oriented Americans who are willing to rise to the task of becoming a Direct Support According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the employment of DSPs is projected to grow by an average of 26 percent from 2014 to 2024, compared to a 7 percent average growth rate for all occupations during that period. Unfortunately, direct support professionals are often forced to leave the jobs they love due to low wages and excessive, difficult, work hours. Many Direct Support Professionals rely on public benefits, and some must work multiple jobs in order to provide for themselves and their families.

47,topic-id,1913,"Mr.President, there are reports that we may be having a vote next week, under reconciliation, dealing with the healthcare system of this country. We know that colleagues have filed a new bill, but it is basically the same bill we have seen in the past but this time even more consequential to our healthcare system and the people of this country.  I mention first the process because this bill has not gone through any regular order. It has not been referred to a committee for consideration. It has not been marked up or debated in our committees. It is going to supposedly be[[Page S5837]]brought up as an amendment but with us returning to reconciliation.  Let me first explain what that means. That means there will be no chance for us to offer amendments to the legislation. That means there will be no opportunity in our committees to mark up legislation or to get the cost of the legislation or the technical help to do any bill, let alone a bill that affects a large part of our economy.  The Presiding Officer and I both serve on the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over healthcare. We are not going to get the opportunity to get the expertise and help from our staff to look at the consequences of the Cassidy bill and have a chance to work on it to make it work. Instead, what is going to happen if the game plan goes forward is that this bill is likely to be on the floor next week during budget reconciliation, where a simple majority will be able to pass it. There will be no chance for debate on the floor because it is what is known as a vote-arama, and it will affect one-sixth of our economy. That is not the way we should be operating.  I am also told that it will be done without a Congressional Budget Office score. That is unconscionable. We know from previous Congressional Budget Office scores on the other proposals that have been brought out that tens of millions of Americans would lose their health insurance coverage. Premiums would increase by, in some cases, 20 to 25 percent. It was certainly information from our objective staff that caused many of us to say: What are we doing? But at least we had that information before we voted.  We are now being told that we may get a one-liner from the Congressional Budget Office giving us the bottom-line impact on the deficit but not the specific information as to how many millions of Americans are going to lose their coverage and what is going to happen, for those of us who currently have insurance, with our premium increases.  This is not the way we should be proceeding. It retreats from the progress we have made against the abusive practices of the insurance industry.  Under the Cassidy bill, as I understand it, each State could basically set up its own rules for how they wish to have coverage. The entire Medicaid system of this country would be block-granted and would be capped. So the Federal Government could be getting out of the Medicaid business. The States would be given greater flexibility on how to operate the exchanges in their State and would no longer be subject to the same national requirements.  We all pride ourselves that we eliminated preexisting conditions. But, in reality, if the State determines what benefits are going to be covered and under what conditions, preexisting conditions come back. That is something we should not ever allow to happen. Yet, under the Cassidy bill, we are going to be telling people that we may not be covering their mental health needs. We may not be covering the opioid addiction problems. We may not be covering maternity benefits. We may not be covering pediatric dental coverage.  We don't know what plans will be offered. Today we know that under the Affordable Care Act we have the national protections so that everyone is on a level playing field. So a State could design a plan that would be totally unaffordable for people who need the coverage because they isolate the group into such a small number. That is not what we should be doing. That strategy would provide inadequate coverage.  Let me explain what I mean. I have a young family that came to me and told me about the circumstance of their child being born prematurely with significant challenges. They said that, if that child had been born before the Affordable Care Act, the parents' policy would have reached their lifetime cap within the first year. Then, the family would have had to make some horrendous decisions on how to take care of their child. That is why we passed the protection against annual lifetime caps. That could return again under the bill that could be brought to the floor next week.  I know circumstances where families have been able to get preventive healthcare and discover cancer at an early stage. That coverage wasn't there before the Affordable Care There is no guarantee that coverage will be there afterwards.  We could return again to bankruptcies. Healthcare costs were the leading cause of bankruptcy before we passed the Affordable Care Now we are going to say that because of inadequate coverage and lack of coverage, American families are going to be faced with taking care of their family, running up bills, and ultimately facing bankruptcy.  We are going to be affecting people's lives. Make no mistake about it.  But the real tragedy of this proposal, and why it is so different from some others, is that it is an abandonment by the Federal Government of the Medicaid system. It would institute draconian cuts to the Medicaid system, to the extent that it would cripple it and make it ineffective. The States would be unable to respond.  It is interesting that we just got a letter from 10 Governors in our country--five Democrats and five All of these Governors said: No, don't do this. We can't do what you are asking us to do. We would have to make horrible decisions on whether we are going to continue to provide long-term care to our seniors, whether we are going to expand coverage, whether we are going to narrow benefits, whether we are going to cover prescription drugs, or whether we are going to cut providers who may not be able to treat Medicaid patients. These are decisions the States are going to have to make if this bill ever becomes law.  It affects so many. Some of the things that maybe are misunderstood about the Medicaid system is that 1.75 million veterans are in the Medicaid system. Quite frankly, their coverage has never been enough, and the Medicaid system has helped fill the gap. That is going to cause a problem for our veterans.  I will just give one example. We pride ourselves on federalism, and federalism, to me, is very important. I served for several years in the State legislature. I am the former speaker of the Maryland General I take pride in the fact that Maryland has been an innovator in healthcare. They have been able to do that because of the partnership between the Federal Government and the That is federalism. It has worked.  If this bill were to become law--the Cassidy bill--it would prevent the States from innovating. It is not giving them more flexibility if you don't give them the resources and tools to deal with this because you can't.  For example, in Maryland we have what is known as an all-payer rate structure for hospital costs, regardless of who covers your insurance. Whether you are Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance, or you pay on your own, you pay the same rate in my State for hospital care at the same hospital. It is an all-payer structure. We don't have cost-shifting, and we don't have charity hospitals. Therefore, we have hospitals that are located in all of our communities. It saves the Federal Government money, it saves the State government money, and it has proven to be more cost-effective. The State experimented and it worked, and the Federal Government has partnered with us.  Can we continue that program if we get these draconian cuts in Medicaid? The answer is no. Can we continue this program if we see the uninsured rates go up in Maryland because of people losing their health coverage under this bill? The answer is no. You can't do this if the uninsured rates go from 6 percent to 12 percent to 15 percent of uncompensated care in our hospitals. That is what is at risk with the Cassidy bill.  To me, it really is also an affront to federalism in that you are creating States versus I am in a State that did Medicaid expansion. As the Cassidy bill has been scored, it will cost my State $2.1 billion. I know that our legislature doesn't have that money. I know the Governor doesn't have it. He just recently went to the Maryland Board of Public Works and reduced the State budget because they were running a deficit and they are not allowed to run a deficit. They can't possibly cover the $2.1 billion.  Here is another tragedy of this bill. The tragedy is that some States do much worse than other Why? Because Maryland expanded Medicaid,[[Page S5838]]as did many other States and, therefore, we got more Federal funds because we had more people in the program. That seems fair. We are covering more people. But the Cassidy bill takes away from those States that expanded coverage, and we lose more.  I thought this was the United I thought we were all in this together. The people of Maryland are proud to help the people of Texas or Florida because of the hurricane, and now you are coming back and saying you are going to hurt the people in Maryland because we did the right thing on  Is that what this country is all about? Is that the United States? Is this body going to condone that type of discrimination against States? I hope that is not the case.  So I hope, for many reasons, on substance and on process, that this bill is not brought up. Let's return to regular order. I heard Senator McCain say that so eloquently on the floor of the  For the last two weeks I have been working with my Republican and Democratic colleagues to come up with bipartisan ways to improve our healthcare system.

That is what we should be doing, in the best tradition of the  So I urge my colleagues: Let's work together, and let's reject this proposal. Let's not bring it up.

North Korea has developed an active nuclear weapons program and is making considerable progress in developing nuclear-capable ballistic missiles that can reach our allies and partners in the region, including South Korea and Japan, U.territories like Guam, and, likely, the continental United States as well.

If the United States continues on the path laid out by President Trump, there are only two realistic outcomes, both bad: North Korea becomes a nuclear power or a large-scale conventional war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula that would result in the loss of hundreds of thousands and possibly millions of lives.  If our policy options leave us with only capitulation or war as possible outcomes, those policies are deeply flawed. There should be a lot of space between war and capitulation on the Korean  I strongly believe that we must therefore adjust our strategy to fill that space with an all-out ``diplomatic surge,'' one that results in serious, hard constraints on North Korea's nuclear ambitions and a more peaceful, stable, and prosperous Northeast Asia for all.  The initial objective of this surge would be to begin a diplomatic process, with Pyongyang first verifiably halting[[Page S5740]]their nuclear and ballistic missile testing and the United States and our allies taking steps to deescalate the current tensions on the Korean  We have not arrived at the current situation with North Korea overnight. Where we are today is an outgrowth of two decades of steady progress by North Korea's nuclear and ballistic programs. The tense situation on the Korean Peninsula highlights the failure of the international community and multiple administrations, Republican and Democratic alike, to end North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and to promote greater security and stability in the region.  This year alone, North Korea has conducted at least a dozen ballistic missile tests, including ICBM tests, and now a nuclear test of what is likely a thermonuclear weapon.  We may not like this reality, but we must face the fact that North Korea already has a small but nonetheless operational nuclear arsenal.  At this critical moment, the President, instead of providing responsible leadership, has engaged in bluster and provocative statements about nuclear war with North He continues to show he lacks the temperament and judgment to deal with this serious crisis. He continues to increase tensions rather than reduce them and to issue threats when it is far from clear he is willing to back them up.  President Trump's dangerous rhetoric has painted the United States into a corner.  The President has zig-zagged from one extreme to the other, as the Washington Post recently put it, veering between bellicose tweets aimed at North Korea, threats to our allies and partners, efforts to flatter Beijing, offers of diplomacy, and then strident rejections of it at the same time. He has created an environment of uncertainty amongst our allies and partners, emboldened our adversaries, and confused and deeply concerned the American people about their safety.  I therefore feel a solemn responsibility as the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to put forward an approach to North Korea that I believe represents the type of responsible bipartisan leadership the world has come to expect from the United  When the United States leads with our values and interests at the fore, others follow, but when we abdicate or purposefully cause doubt, well, that kind of uncertainty makes the world less safe.  Therefore, the United States should put its full weight into creating and executing a comprehensive policy that includes the immediate imposition of additional sanctions, active engagement with our allies, vigorous support for human rights and the pursuit of principled multilateral measures to shape the regional environment.  Most urgently, we should begin immediate and direct diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang, guided by strategic clarity, to curtail North Korea's nuclear ambitions, protect our allies, and bring stability to the Korean  Underlying our current North Korea policy--or lack thereof--are a series of assumptions, which I believe must be reconsidered in light of our decades-long failure to achieve our strategic objectives.  First, will China, ever really ``carry our water'' on economic sanctions?  My assessment is China prioritizes its own interests in maintaining North Korea stability over denuclearization and will never place enough pressure on North Korea to force them to give up their nuclear program. That said, and as I will discuss further, China has a crucial role to play as a partner in this process, both imposing costs on North Korea up front and providing security and economic guarantees on the back end, but we should not expect that China will solve this issue for us.  Second, do we still think that North Korea wants and needs to rejoin the international community?  In other words, do they need us more than we need them? Based on its current actions, one would have to conclude no--and that holding out that possibility is not in fact an incentive for Pyongyang because it does not interest them.  We should also be clear about North Korean intentions. Indeed, for all the talk about how irrational and unpredictable North Korea is, they have pursued these weapons--and developed tactics to evade international sanctions and pressure--with clarity and determination. They have not hid their intentions, the reasons why they believe they are seeking these weapons, or their vision for the peninsula.  Even so, I believe Pyongyang will respond to incentives and to pressure, but we must get both the pressure and the disincentives right to be effective.  Third, is time still on our side?  The regime continues to move forward with its nuclear and missile programs, defying consistent predictions since the end of the Cold War that North Korea was on the verge of immediate collapse. All signs indicating that Kim Jung-Un is firmly in control and faces no serious challenges. He has even had members of his own family murdered to keep his iron grip on the country firm and in place. So while time has not run out, it is not on our side, either.  Finally, are negotiations with North Korea pointless because they will always renege on their commitments?  I recognize the history of numerous efforts to engage with North Korea that have ended in failure and acrimony, but it is also important to remember that while the 1994 framework agreement had many problems, it did limit and constrain North Korea's stockpile of plutonium for an 8-year period.  Yes, North Korea continued with a part of its nuclear programs in secret, but there is no question that, during this period, the United States and our allies were safer and more secure than they would have been given the alternatives, which were war or acquiesce to North Korea's nuclear program.  While it is certainly possible that the agreed framework would have fallen apart regardless, it is also possible, if the agreement had been maintained, it would have provided options for bringing the North's nuclear ambitions to a more permanent end.  So while the Agreed Framework was far from perfect, it does suggest there are pathways by which a diplomatic surge can succeed in constraining and binding North Korea and in creating a more stable security environment in the region.  I want to be very clear--I have no illusions about North Korea or about the low chances of success for even the best strategy for dealing with this regime.  Nevertheless, it is incumbent on those of us in Congress, as well as our colleagues in the executive branch, to think through a policy that gives us the best chance of success and to take the necessary steps to see if this approach might lead to a better outcome.  So, what would a policy geared for success with North Korea look like?  First, we must immediately begin a sustained diplomatic effort with the goal of first constraining and then ultimately eliminating Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Working with China is critical to these efforts.  We can't expect China to solve North Korea for us. However, that does not mean that there is no space to make common cause with Beijing to contain North Korean's nuclear and missile programs and thereby reduce tensions in East Asia, which would benefit our mutual national security interests.  At the end of the day, China understands that it, too, benefits from a denuclearized peninsula and that increased military tensions in the region, let alone war, do not serve China's interests well. So we can work with China to assure that sanctions are fully implemented--especially those which China has already signed up for at the United Nations but has been slow to bring into force, an immediate test being the unanimously passed Security Council sanctions just this week. We can encourage China to take necessary measures that can force Pyongyang back to the negotiating table.  To make this strategy work, we must indicate to China and Russia that we are ready and willing to engage in negotiations with North  As we turn the screws on North Korea and strengthen our alliances, we need to be open to wide-ranging talks. We should be willing to discuss measures to deescalate the conflict on the Korean Peninsula, ways to improve the lot of the downtrodden people of North Korea, and ultimately a pathway forward for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.[[Page S5741]]  To begin this process, Pyongyang will first have to verifiably halt their nuclear and ballistic missile testing, and the United States and our allies must indicate a willingness to take steps to deescalate the current tensions on the Korean  China's assistance will be necessary not only in getting talks started but also in helping them reach a successful conclusion. Only China can provide North Korea with certain kinds of security guarantees which likely will be necessary to enhance Pyongyang's confidence that any agreement will be enduring.  Second, it is worth emphasizing that an ``America Alone'' approach is not a formula for success in dealing with North Korea--or anything else for that matter. A complex threat like North Korea can't be successfully confronted without assistance from our allies and partners in the region--and any successful approach must start by strengthening our alliances and partnerships with Japan and  The scope and range of partnership with our allies--starting with Japan and Korea--is both dynamic and comprehensive and has been critical for maintaining peace, stability, and economic prosperity throughout the Asia-Pacific region.  This stability and prosperity has also made the United States more secure and more prosperous. It is why the United States, after the devastation of the Second World War and the Korean war, built partnerships with Japan, South Korea, and other Asian nations. These actions turned the region into one of the greatest foreign policy success stories of the past 70 years. Any successful policy toward North Korea must be built on this foundation and recognize that our strategic alliances combine not just military but also diplomatic and economic elements.  The election of Moon Jae-in as President of South Korea and our partnership with Prime Minister Abe in Japan have created new opportunities to reconsider and recalibrate our approach and encourage us to align and coordinate our approach with that of our regional allies. Nations such as Australia, Singapore, and our other ASEAN partners also have important roles to play.  The United States has worked diligently for the past several years, starting under the Obama administration, to strengthen our alliances and partnerships in the region by enhancing our defense and deterrence capabilities in light of emerging North Korean threats. This has included missile defense, extended deterrence, counterprovocation planning, and a suite of other capabilities relevant to the new security environment.  We must continue and deepen these defense efforts to assure that we can stay ahead of North Korean threats, to provide leverage for diplomacy, and to maintain an insurance policy for the sort of ``containment'' that will be necessary should diplomacy fail.  Third, the United States has an important opportunity to set the broader regional context for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula by engaging in forward-leaning, principled, multilateral diplomatic engagement.  Over the years, there have been numerous proposals for multilateral architecture in Northeast Asia proposed by the nations of the region, as well as by the United  While there is ample room for discussion and debate over which model might be best, it is clear we need a forum to draw the nations of Northeast Asia together to engage in confidence-building measures and to address outstanding diplomatic, security, and political issues so that the right context exists for a stable Korean When President Trump travels to Asia this November, he has an important opportunity to move the multilateral architecture debate forward as a necessary supporting element of a broader North Korea strategy.  Fourth and finally, the administration must seek to fully exercise our economic leverage, not incrementally but robustly and to the maximum extent feasible, and should immediately impose additional economic sanctions on  Secondary sanctions imposed upon firms that trade with North Korea, along with other targeted sectoral and financial measures through the UN Security Council, are essential to make it more difficult for the Kim Jong Un regime to support its prohibited nuclear and missile programs, including the financing that fuels its illegal activities.  The administration must also rigorously implement and enforce the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enforcement Act of 2016, the relevant sections of the recently passed Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act and UNSC resolutions 2270 and 2321 on North  I know several of our colleagues, including Senators Gardner, Markey, Toomey and Van Hollen, also have legislation to impose new and additional sanctions.  Critically, while many past efforts have been targeted at imposing costs on North Korea by curtailing trade leaving North Korea, to be truly effective a sanctions regime must have as its primary purpose halting the flow of goods, finances, and material into North We know that when oil shipments have been curtailed in the past or when we threaten the ability of North Korea to use the international financial system to bring its ill-gotten funds home, we have gotten Pyongyang's attention.  We will get their attention again if we cut off North Korean elites' ability to continue to enjoy luxury goods. By cutting off access to these goods, through existing sanctions that are often not seriously enforced, we will provide an opportunity to focus minds in  China plays a key role in bringing this sort of pressure to bear on North Korea, but so do others. Russia, for example, houses some 30,000 North Korean slave laborers, a key source of regime income, and has also supplied North Korea with oil and aviation fuel in the past, sometimes illicitly. Other partners, including Singapore, have been key hubs for North Korean activity. Robust implementation of current sanctions to address these activities is crucial across all members of the international community.  What I have laid out today are lofty goals to be sure, but we should stand up and try to reach them. Let's try to stop North Korea through diplomacy while watching to make sure North Korea will not cheat during negotiations or on any final agreement, as they have in the past.  While imperfect in the short term, a freeze on North Korea's nuclear and missile program serves our national security interests. If nothing is done to slow North Korea down, its nuclear program and delivery systems will continue to grow, imperiling our allies and the American people. Diplomatic engagement that allows us to constrain and eventually reverse North Korea's nuclear ambitions may not be ``perfect'' security, but it is enhanced security and by far the better option available.  Time is no longer on our side, but the clock hasn't run out yet. The United States and the international community have an opportunity to test the proposition of what a robust diplomatic surge to North Korea's aggression might look like. It is critical that we take the opportunity now.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgS5739-3.txt,,0915,2017.0,14.0,September

431,topic-id,1297,"Mr.President, the Presiding Officer has been presiding on many occasions when I have risen to speak about the need to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and although we did not succeed in our last effort in the beginning of August, I, personally, along with Senators Graham, Johnson and Heller, am making one more try, and folks ask why.  The simple answer I can give is, there is a fellow back home by the name of Moon He is a conservative talk show host who speaks with passion about the Affordable Care Why does he speak with passion? Moon Griffon is very open. He has a special needs child, and he has to buy insurance. His premium per year is over $40,000--$40,000, with a $5,000 deductible and an additional deductible for his pharmaceutical costs. He has to pay $50,000 a year for insurance, deductible, and pharmaceutical deductible. The mortgage payment for a $500,000 home is what he puts up because he has to buy insurance. He has a child with special needs.  Now, there are many Moon Griffons across our Someone said, kind of as a wag, but I think there is a ring of truth to it, that ObamaCare, the individual exchange, only works if you don't because if you do work and you don't qualify for a subsidy, then you cannot afford it.  By the way, I think there is bipartisan agreement on this. Senator Bernie Sanders is now putting forward what we would call BernieCare, a single-payer proposal. He would not be putting that forward if he thought the[[Page S5734]]status quo is working. He is putting it forward because he realizes it is not. He has 16 cosponsors, if you will. Cosponsors are a testament to the fact that the status quo is not working. Well, I can tell you, since Medicare is going bankrupt in 17 years, the seniors who are on it will have their benefits threatened by adding another 150 million more Americans to the program. Those who have employer-sponsored insurance, I don't think they will want to give up their employer-sponsored insurance and trust in  So our last hope, we think, is relieving folks from the burdens of the Affordable Care Act in a way that preserves President Trump's goals of caring for all, taking care of those with preexisting conditions, covering all, lowering premiums, and eliminating mandates.  We have the basis of an approach. This past week, the HELP Committee has been having hearings, as well as the Finance Both Democratic and Republican Governors, insurance commissioners, stakeholders of other sorts, Medicaid directors, and all, whether Democratic or Republican, Governor or Medicaid director or insurance Commissioner, have said that if we give the States the flexibility to come up with their own solutions, they will find solutions that work better for their State than the Affordable Care Act--and it makes total sense. Clearly, Alaska is different than Rhode Louisiana is different than If we can come up with solutions specific for each State, as opposed to a one-size-fits-all that comes out of Washington, DC, these Governors, Medicaid directors, and insurance commissioners of both parties think we can do a better job.  We have a model of this. The Children's Health Insurance Program, also known as the CHIP program, has been very successful. It works on a block grant that comes down to States pull down the dollars. They can roll over money for 2 years, and they provide a policy for the children in their There are certain criteria and safeguards regarding what that policy must look like.  In fact, Senator Ron Wyden, last night, finished up his remarks praising the CHIP program, that it was reauthorized and what a victory for the health of children because this is a program that will work. There is a little irony there, as Senator Wyden had just finished criticizing the Graham-Cassidy-Heller amendment, which is patterned after the CHIP program. The irony, of course, is that he says our amendment will not work, and then he goes on to praise the program through which the money will flow and after which it is patterned.  What we do through the program is take the dollars going to States currently through the Affordable Care Act, and we pool them together and deliver them to States in a block grant, very similar and, indeed, through the CHIP program. Along that way, we equalize how much each American receives toward her care, irrespective of where she lives.  Why do I say that? Right now, 37 percent of the revenue from the Affordable Care Act goes to Americans in four States--37 percent of the revenue goes to those who live within four That is frankly not fair. I have nothing against those four States, but I don't see why a lower income American in Mississippi should receive so much less than a lower income American in Massachusetts or why someone in Arizona should be treated differently than someone in New I think we should equalize that treatment. Americans think that is fair. We do that with Medicare and Social Security and other popular programs. It is something we should do, as well, as we attempt to provide insurance for all to achieve President Trump's goals.  One example of this, by the way--Pennsylvania has twice the population of Both of those States expanded Massachusetts gets 58 percent more money than does Again, Pennsylvania has twice the population of Massachusetts, but Massachusetts gets 58 percent more money. Both Northeastern States have cities with a high cost of living, but somehow Massachusetts does that much better.  Our goal, though, is through this grant that goes through the CHIP program--which Senators like Senator Wyden have praised, and rightfully so, as being an effective program for improving health, with safeguards needed to make sure the money is used wisely and that all States and all residents within those States will receive about the same amount of money toward their healthcare. This would be, if you will, not a Democratic plan, not a Republican plan but an American plan, in which Senators vote to trust the people in their State over a Washington bureaucrat.  We have critics who don't understand our bill. It is a partisan bill, we are told.  If you look at the residents of the States who do better under our plan, it includes States represented by Democratic Virginia does far better because they will get the dollars they currently do not--as do Floridians, represented by a Democratic Senator; Missouri does, represented by the Presiding Officer now but also by a Democratic Senator; and others that are represented by Democratic Senators, but the lower income Americans in those States actually have resources they currently do not have. Indeed, I implore those Senators not to vote a party line but rather to vote for those lower income Americans in their States so they can have the resources needed for their better health.  I will conclude by saying one more time: We have one more chance. On the Democratic and Republican sides, we recognize that the Affordable Care Act is unsustainable. On the Republican side, we want to give power back to the patients, back to the States, fulfilling the wish of those Democratic and Republican Governors, insurance commissioners, and Medicaid directors to give them the flexibility to do what they wish to do.  The Democratic vision, BernieCare, if you will, of which he has 16 cosponsors, is to consolidate every decision in Washington, As for me, I will vote with the States, I will vote with the people, and I will vote with the wisdom of the average American as opposed to the benign ``we know better than you'' attitude of Washington,  Thank you.

387,topic-id,1714,"Mr.President, the cost of health insurance has been a major problem with the Affordable Care Act and with many of the bills which have been advanced to repeal and replace this law.  I rise to introduce the Lower Premiums Through Reinsurance Act of 2017. This bill would provide States with the flexibility and support they need to create State-based reinsurance programs for their individual health insurance markets in order to lower premiums while ensuring continued coverage for people with preexisting conditions.  I am very pleased to be joined by my colleague and friend Senator Bill Nelson in introducing this bill. Senator Nelson is a former insurance commissioner who comes to this issue with a wealth of knowledge dating to his experience with Florida's innovative homeowners' reinsurance program, developed in the 1990s in the wake of Hurricane For my own part, I spent 5 years in State government overseeing a department which included the Bureau of  Over the past 2 weeks, the Senate HELP Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, completed a round of hearings under the able leadership of Chairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking Member Patty They[[Page S5863]]looked at the steps we could take in the near term to stabilize the individual market and help to bring down rates. Reinsurance was frequently mentioned as an option Congress should consider and adopt. Insurance commissioners from Alaska, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Washington State all spoke positively of its benefits, as did the five Governors who testified before the committee--three Republicans and two Although the witnesses presented different views on how a reinsurance mechanism might be structured, they were in broad agreement that reinsurance funding would help stabilize the markets and lower premiums.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has recommended that Congress provide reinsurance funding of $15 billion annually to help cover high-cost claims in the individual market. We realize, however, we are living in very tight budget times, and there is an understandable reluctance among many Members to provide that level of Federal funding. We believe the ACA's section 1332's flowthrough mechanism can effectively leverage that level of funding with a much smaller contribution of Federal dollars. Our bill, therefore, would appropriate $2.25 billion per year in 2018 and 2019, which should be sufficient to leverage $15 billion in total reinsurance funding annually, based on the ratios in Alaska's recently approved 1332 waiver.  As Alaska's insurance commissioner told the HELP Committee, next year her State will be able to fund its $55 million reinsurance program with just $6.6 million of its own money--15 percent of the total. The remaining $48.4 million will be provided in Federal flowthrough funding that matches the savings to the Federal Government resulting from the reinsurance program. Let me explain why there would be savings for the Federal  If we are able to reduce the cost of premiums, then the Federal Government will be paying less by way of subsidies to individuals who qualify for those subsidies because they make 400 percent or less of the Federal poverty level.  The bill we are introducing today would allow States to quickly stand up their own reinsurance programs through the Affordable Care Act's section 1332 waiver process. Broadly speaking, the bill would create a menu of options States could use to design reinsurance programs, which in turn would be eligible for Federal seed money grants. States may also obviously add funds from other sources to the mix.  States that want to set up their own reinsurance pools quickly could do so under our bill by using one of three options designed for expedited review: first, by demonstrating that their program is an ``invisible high-risk pool'' along the lines of the Maine and Alaska models, which I will describe in more detail in a moment; second, by showing that their program fits within the parameters of ObamaCare's ``transitional insurance program,'' which expired at the end of last year; and third, by submitting what I would call a ``me too'' application based on another State's program that has already received approval.  I wish to take a moment to explain why our legislation provides expedited review for different reinsurance pool designs. First, many of the witnesses who testified before the HELP Committee made the point that States would have difficulty quickly coming up with their own design. We acknowledge that, and that is why we provided expedited review for a pool based on the transitional ACA reinsurance program previously in effect and with which States are already familiar.  Second, we know from the experience of the States of Maine and Alaska how effective invisible reinsurance pools can be. Alaska's invisible pool reduced a projected 40-percent rate increase to just 7 percent this year and is expected to contribute to a 20-percent decline in premiums next year. Maine saw similar results in its program, the Maine Guaranteed Access Reinsurance  The Maine program, which was in operation from 2012 until the end of 2013, covered approximately 3,600 insured individuals, at a cost of approximately $12,500 per person, per year, and reduced rates in the individual market by about 20 percent on average.  It is important for us to keep in mind that the individual market is where people who do not have employer-sponsored insurance have to go to buy their insurance. If they make 400 percent or less of the Federal poverty level, they get premium tax credits--subsidies, in other words--from the Federal Government to assist them with the cost. But if they make a dollar over 400 percent of the Federal poverty level, they lose that assistance altogether.  Another problem that is in the ACA is those cliffs, which make no sense whatsoever and really penalize individuals who may work in the trades, such as electricians and plumbers, who don't know for certain what their income is going to be and can face an unexpected bill where they have to pay back the entire subsidy. But there are others who make above 400 percent who knew it and didn't qualify for the subsidy, but they still have to purchase in the individual market. I think that should be revisited, but that is a speech for another day.  My point is that they would benefit greatly from a 20-percent reduction in the premiums they pay. That was our experience in On average there was a 20-percent reduction in premiums when the reinsurance pool was in effect. The reinsurance pool even generated a surplus of $5 billion during its 18 months of operation.  The Maine pool was successful for several reasons. First, risks were ceded up front so insurers could not wait until a policyholder developed an unexpected serious health condition to decide who was going to be in the high-risk pool and who was not. The rules also required policies for individuals who suffered from certain high-risk conditions to be automatically ceded to the pool on enrollment.  I note that when an insurer made the decision to cede to the pool the risk for a particular policyholder, or if it was an automatic ceding, 90 percent of the premiums from that policyholder went to the reinsurance pool to help finance it.  Second--and this is important--the program was invisible to both individuals who were insured through it and to healthcare providers. Individuals were covered seamlessly and enjoyed the same benefits as nonpool enrollees. Likewise, healthcare providers did not know whose policy had been ceded to the pool.  Third--and also very important--Maine's program operated with the full set of consumer protection guardrails set by the ACA, including guaranteed issue, guaranteed renewability, and prohibitions against taking preexisting conditions or health status into account in issuing policies or setting rates.  Fourth, the Maine program was designed to provide true reinsurance. Insurers paid the first $7,500 in costs, plus 10 percent of the next $25,000. After that threshold, the pool picked up the rest of the costs.  Finally, Maine's program was backed by a stable funding source. In addition to receiving 90 percent of the premiums for ceded policies, it also received funding that was assessed at a rate of $4 per person, per month, on all healthcare policies.  While Alaska's reinsurance program differs from Maine's in some respects, the success of both models shows the promise and proves the promise of invisible reinsurance pools, and that is why our bill includes invisible reinsurance pools as an option for expedited review and approval.  Open enrollment in the ACA exchanges begins November 1, just about 6 weeks from now. In just days, CMS is expected to finalize the premiums insurers will charge in the ACA exchanges next year. While I personally remain ever hopeful that a bipartisan agreement on a targeted, consensus approach to stabilizing the markets and reducing premiums can still be reached, clearly, we have very little time. Beyond providing cost-sharing reduction funding, there is no step that would be more powerful in stabilizing markets and reducing premiums than providing reinsurance.  This Chamber is deeply divided on what to do on healthcare policy, but surely we ought to be able to come together and build on the good work that the leaders of the HELP Committee have done--work that more than 60[[Page S5864]]Senators have witnessed and participated in by attending coffees that Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Patty Murray have sponsored with our witnesses and by participating in the HELP Committee hearings. They have worked hard to produce a bill that would really make a difference.  The bill Senator Nelson and I are introducing today helps to fill out the reinsurance provisions that I know from attending each of those hearings have been widely supported by virtually every witness who testified before us. It would enable States to stand up their own reinsurance program simply and quickly, and it would reduce the costs of the Federal Government if we used the section 1332 flow-through mechanism far below what would otherwise be required. Most important of all, it is something that we could do right off, along with the cost-saving reductions, which help low-income people with their copays and their deductibles--their out-of-pocket costs. Those two steps are actions that we could take right now to help moderate premium increases that would otherwise occur and that would be of real benefit to anyone who is in the individual market.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-09-19-pt1-PgS5862.txt,2121,ELIMINATING GOVERNMENT-FUNDED OIL-PAINTING ACT,2017.0,19.0,September
316,topic-id,846,"Mr.Speaker, early this summer, on a Friday night, just about 30 miles from this Capital, I went on a ride-along in my district with our Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task  A young boy standing on the sidewalk along Sterling Boulevard in Sterling, Virginia, caught the eye of a veteran member of our task force. The young man on the street looked about 15 or 16 years old, but he was actually a 22-year-old member of the transnational violent street gang known as MS-13. He was covered in MS-13 gang tattoos--on his chest, his back, his feet.  It turned out, he had been in jail in El Salvador for murder as a teenager, and he had already been deported from the U.twice for engaging in violent crimes here.  Three other of the estimated thousands of MS-13 gang members that are just here in our Capital region were also picked up that night. There have been cases in northern Virginia where a suspected member of the MS-13 gang has been deported five times, yet returned again to continue their gang activity.  At a town festival in Herndon this year, the gang task force identified--because they go to these events and they see these people--an estimated 200 to 300 suspected gang members milling about among the families who were getting cotton candy and hot dogs for their kids. They are right there looking to recruit in their own communities.  Mr.Speaker, since November 2016, at least eight murders have been committed and tied to MS-13 and other[[Page H7391]]gangs in our area, representing a 166 percent increase over the last year in the northern Virginia region.  An MS-13-linked vicious murder occurred in November 2015. Of course, I should acknowledge that they are all vicious when you are talking about MS-13. This happened on an Alexandria playground in the evening just about 8 miles from this Capital, and it resulted in the death of 24-year-old Jose Luis Ferman He was nearly decapitated in the machete attack. His body was left on the playground and was found by a woman walking her dog the next morning. It could have been one of the kids playing on the playground finding that.  The Washington Post has highlighted how the 2014 border surge has contributed to the MS-13 problem, saying: ``The violent street gang is on the rise in the United States, fueled, in part, by the surge in unaccompanied minors.''  A recent Washington Post article documented the case of gang members who videotaped the murder of a 15-year-old girl, Damaris Reyes Rivas, who was savagely beaten by multiple people, and repeatedly stabbed by all of these gang members. The video of this was intended to be sent to MS-13 gang leadership in El Salvador to confirm that this greenlit murder had been carried out.  Tragically, MS-13 targets and preys upon their own community, on young people who may not have much of a family structure around them. Sadly, these children and young people were actually fleeing MS-13 in their own countries of El Salvador, Honduras, or Guatemala, only to come here and be targeted.  There was one case that, fortunately, the Norther Virginia Regional Gang Task Force was able to intercept, where a brother was trying to enlist his own brother to join the MS-13 gang. And when he refused to, he put a hit out on him. Fortunately, the gang task force was able to stop that.  We cannot allow this to stand. Mr.Speaker, the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force is battling this problem in our region, but they still need more resources. In our appropriations process, we have directed more resources for our regional task forces. I have personally talked to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is very familiar with this MS-13 problem, having been a U.attorney in the Maryland region.  Our regional task force is comprised of 13 local, State and Federal law enforcement agencies, and the task force has a three-pronged approach: education, intervention and prevention, and enforcement. We need to provide support on all three of these fronts.  I witnessed firsthand the exhausting work of the task force; the technology they utilize on the streets that was able to immediately identify just with fingerprints the background of this gang member that they were able to arrest; the detailed knowledge they have of our communities and our neighborhoods; the positive relationships they have with the people in these communities, the very people that are being victimized; and the challenges they face with this problem that has returned to our area.  That is why I sponsored H.3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act, with my colleagues, so it will provide additional tools to law enforcement. It will ensure that when ICE positively identifies a known alien gang member, they may act immediately. This legislation identifies gang membership and participation in gang activity as grounds for inadmissibility and removability. We don't have to wait until these brutal killers wield their machetes or leave another body on a children's playground.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

The bill preserves, as my colleague has already identified, all the due process and appellate rights afforded to any alien facing deportation.  An immigration judge must be convinced that the evidence in the record supports the finding. I encourage support of this legislation today, which will strengthen and enforce our laws against known violent gang members. I also will continue to work with my colleagues on other matters, such as the bill I introduced earlier this summer, to provide additional resources to our regional gang task forces for their education, intervention, and enforcement efforts.

343,topic-id,460,"Madam Speaker, in 2015, at an Alexandria playground in Mr.Beyer's district, 8 miles from this Capitol, the body of a 24-year-old man was left nearly decapitated in a grisly murder by one of the thousands of MS-13 gang members in our country. I should also mention that that victim was also an MS-13 gang member.  This very Capital region has the second highest number of MS-13 gang members. Criminal alien gang members are growing in numbers in our region around the country and wrecking havoc in my district and in this very region. Without stronger tools to specifically target those specific aliens--this bill targets them--that terrorize our streets, gangs like MS-13 will then continue to grow in numbers and strength if we aren't targeting them. The time has come to take action and provide a path for deportation for violent criminal gang members.  ICE has found that membership of these violent transnational gangs is comprised largely of foreign-born nationals. Often bearing the brunt of these gangs' violence are the very immigrant communities in which they reside. They target their own communities. We have seen that in my region and in my district, and that is why this is so troubling.  The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act will address this. Those gang members who have successfully evaded prosecution through witness intimidation, employing the tactics of fear and violence will now be within ICE's reach. The new grounds of removability provided by H.3697 will help get criminal gang members off our streets.  ICE's recent Operation New Dawn has resulted in almost 1,100 arrests of gang members. Had this bill been enacted prior, that number could have increased. This bill is only starting the removal process, however.  Make no mistake, regular immigration proceedings will still apply. The government must prove its case and provide evidence to convince an immigration judge. This bill preserves all due process and appellate rights afforded to any alien facing deportation.  The time for this bill is long overdue. It was introduced to target criminal gangs, as that term is commonly understood, and that is what it will do once it is enacted.  I urge my colleagues to vote down this motion to recommit, to vote for the base bill, H.3697, and to provide ICE with the tools it needs to keep dangerous criminal alien gang members off our streets, out of our communities, and out of our country.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit.  There was no objection.

337,topic-id,415,"Madam Speaker, H.3697 is yet another exercise in false advertising by the Named the ``Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act,'' this legislation is so overbroad that it would lead to the deportation of immigrants with absolutely no criminal record and would apply to individuals with no connection to gangs.  In short, this blatantly anti-immigration legislation casts a wide and dangerous net in furtherance of President Trump's mass deportation agenda. I say this for several reasons.  To begin with, H.3967 authorizes the Trump Administration to brand a group of immigrants a ``gang'' without requiring a conviction or even an arrest.  In fact, it would allow individuals to be deported or denied admission based on a mere ``belief''--however tenuous--of their connection to unlawful activity.  In addition, the bill's definition of a ``gang'' is so broad that it would apply to individuals who clearly are not members of criminal gangs.  I doubt that my Republican colleagues really believe that 5 Christian ministers providing shelter to undocumented immigrants constitute a criminal gang.  But by voting for this measure, that's precisely what lawmakers would turn them into. The bill instantly places such religious workers throughout America--from nuns to rabbis, imams to priests--into the same classification as MS-13.  Finally, we are rushing this deeply flawed legislation through the House today while nearly 800,000 young people--800,000 law abiding members of our communities--are facing deportation in as little as 6 months.  These are young people who are as American as any of us. They have grown up in our communities, attended our schools, and have become our neighbors, our teachers, first responders, doctors, and lawyers. But because of action taken by President Trump last week, they now are living in fear and uncertainty.  There is a bipartisan bill with overwhelming support across the country that would allow these young people to remain in the United States the only home most have ever known--and continue contributing to our communities and our economy.  But that bill, the DREAM Act, has languished for years.  Nevertheless, instead of taking up the DREAM Act, we are rushing H.3697 through just days after it was introduced and without any hearings, markups, or the opportunity for amendment.  This House should stop jamming through pieces of the Trump mass deportation plan and instead recommit itself to lifting up the young people of our communities by passing the DREAM act.  It is what's right for our economy, our Nation and it is our moral responsibility.  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.3697.  ",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgH7387-2.txt,229,0915,2017.0,14.0,September
6,topic-id,1196,"Mr.President, as the subway attack in London last week proves all too well, when terrorism goes underground, it doesn't disappear. Every day there are individuals operating in the world's shadows in places like the Parsons Green station in They mean to do our allies and us great harm, and they are not going away.  As President Trump said last week, in this era in which attacks like that in London are the new normal, we have to be proactive. We can't take our security for granted. We can't naively assume that when it comes to threats like that and others even bigger, our country is out of the woods. One way to be proactive and to keep our country safe is to reauthorize section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Earlier this month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats sent a letter to congressional leadership calling for this reauthorization. It is easy to see why. Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows the intelligence community to collect vital information about international terrorists, cyber actors, and other important foreign intelligence targets. Information collected under one particular section--section 702--produces particularly important foreign intelligence that helps prevent terrorist attacks and malign state actors as well. It does so by focusing on non-U.persons, which is important, because, as it is called, it is foreign intelligence surveillance. It focuses on non-U.persons located outside of the United States who are foreign intelligence targets.  But that is not all. Just as importantly, section 702 also includes a comprehensive oversight regime to make sure the privacy of U.persons is protected under the That is done by not only oversight here in the Senate and in the House through the intelligence committees but also by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which monitors compliance with the law.  There has been some criticism of this provision, but I must say that the overwhelming support for the section 702 reauthorization is quite remarkable in this polarized environment in which we live. Even the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board gave the program a ringing endorsement.  But the criticism that has been made is actually based on very few actual facts and often reflects a misunderstanding, both of the purpose of FISA and the controls that constrain government action. Just to be clear, section 702 does not allow intelligence personnel to evade the Fourth Amendment to the U.It may not be used to intentionally target a citizen of the United That citizen could be in New York or New It simply doesn't matter. He or she is off limits.[[Page S5827]]  Section 702 also does not allow for bulk collection or the unlimited dissemination of intelligence that is obtained. Rather, the government's capabilities are specifically circumscribed.  Finally, section 702 does not ignore the possibility that intelligence personnel will inadvertently obtain information about U.persons, but that statute requires intricate procedures to minimize this type of incidental collection to make sure that American citizens are not swept up in foreign intelligence surveillance targets.  Because of these safeguards, section 702 achieves a careful balance, preserving privacy and civil liberties while giving our intelligence personnel the flashlights they need to find terrorists and other adversaries operating in the dark.  This careful balance is why scholars at the U.Naval Academy, commenting on section 702, summarized that ``there is simply no good case for not reauthorizing when it comes up for renewal.''  I say to my colleagues that the time for renewal is fast approaching. That is why today I join the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence in recommending the speedy enactment of legislation reauthorizing title VII before it sunsets later this year.  Section 702 is only one piece of our dense security puzzle. It complements many other pieces of legislation that were designed to handle our incredibly diverse array of threats, and I just want to mention one other.  We need to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, also known as Yesterday we passed the National Defense Authorization Act which contains an important CFIUS provision. I would like to thank the senior Senator from Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, as well as the ranking member, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, for including it in the National Defense Authorization Act, which we approved yesterday.  This provision is critically important, as it could help strengthen the process by which we screen investment by foreign companies to ensure that our military superiority and our technological edge is not whittled away by foreign governments that might use our technology against us or to undermine our industrial base here in the United  As my colleagues know, many national security threats don't make the headlines. Some of them emerge gradually. They develop quietly when countries like China begin acquiring American technology in every way possible, knowledgeable of our laws, and with a conscious strategy to try to evade and circumvent those protections in order to grab our technological edge and undermine our industrial base.  It has been reported that the Chinese Government has already made investments in robotics and artificial intelligence, pouring some $30 billion into early-stage U.technologies over a 6-year period.  When the Chinese are able to get their hands on our cutting-edge technology, just imagine the boost for their long-term military capabilities.  But here is the problem. CFIUS needs to be modernized and brought up to date in order to plug these holes that currently exist in the protective regime. Secretary Mattis, the Secretary of Defense, said that CFIUS ``needs to be updated to deal with today's situation.'' I agree.  My provision included in the NDAA would begin that process. It requires the Secretary to find and propose ways to make the current CFIUS process work more effectively. The NDAA also sets the stage for more comprehensive reform that I will be discussing in the coming days and weeks.  I want to thank the senior Senator from Idaho, the chairman of the Banking Committee, for taking this important issue up in the Senate Banking Committee just this last As chairman, his leadership on the committee has been indispensable, and CFIUS reform is just the latest example.  The bipartisan legislation I am spearheading is called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization It will modernize the CFIUS process to prepare our country to meet the 21st century threats, and I plan to introduce it soon.  This bill would ensure, first, that the government scrutinizes closely those nations that are the biggest threats to our national security; second, that CFIUS obtains more authority to look at investment deals that, as of today, don't fall under its purview, just as certain joint ventures based overseas and minority-position investments in companies do not currently fall within its purview; and, third, it would give CFIUS the means to assess rapidly developing technologies our export control regime has not yet figured out how to handle.  Colleagues, I hope you will join me in supporting this important reform package, and I look forward to further debate on this topic.  I yield the floor.

270,topic-id,1241,"Mr.President, the men and women of our military defend us on a daily basis without a doubt, but now, today, is our time to do the same for them.  One thing I cannot defend is how we continue to tie our own hands when it comes to funding the U.military.  This week we are considering, of course, the Defense Authorization Act that will help ensure that our military has the resources it needs to achieve the mission of today and rise to the challenges of tomorrow, but there is a fundamental problem with the way we equip the men and women we task with defending us. It is called sequestration. The sequester was called for by the Budget Control Act, which puts annual caps on defense and nondefense discretionary spending, and enforces those caps with a kind of budget cleaver. In other words, any spending that exceeds the caps automatically gets axed.  That sounds like a good idea in the abstract. Who doesn't want to treat our addiction to spending? Who doesn't want to put the Federal Government on a diet? I certainly do, but I am not willing to sacrifice our national security and the 1 priority of the Federal Government when it comes to providing for our mutual defense. In the words of the junior Senator from Arkansas, himself a veteran, he said: ``Rather than attack America's spending problem at its root, the law only clipped a few stray leaves off the branches.''  If we are going to be serious about reducing our deficit, we must address our budget priorities by looking at and addressing all government spending, not just the 30 percent or so that is discretionary. The reason we are not serious about dealing with our looming deficits and debt is not because of defense spending, it is because of mandatory entitlement spending, which is the political third rail of our government, and politicians are so afraid to deal with that mandatory spending that we cut defense spending into the muscle, to the bone, and it leads to the sort of dangers the Senator from Arizona talked about, in terms of a lack of readiness and training.  The caps in sequester, mind you, do not represent any defense policy; instead, they were driven by our failure to get serious about the real budget threat: explosive growth in government-funded entitlement programs. Appropriated necessary funding for our Armed Forces should not be held hostage because of our inability to tighten our belts in other areas where the real runaway growth has occurred. It is past time to annually pass appropriations to fund the Department of It is past time to objectively assess and fund the actual and ever-changing defense needs of our country.  What are the results of the Budget Control Act? Well, we are not really saving money, but we are wasting time. We repeatedly raise the Budget Control Act's budget caps at the last minute, meaning they really don't keep spending down. Meanwhile, our military's ability to plan and forecast is severely hampered. When you can't plan, you are not ready, and it is no exaggeration to say that we now find ourselves in a true state of a readiness crisis. Our military, already under great stress and stretched thin around the world, has suffered from 15 years of continued operations, budgetary restrictions, and deferred investment.  According to General Walters, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, more than half of the Marines' fixed- and rotary-winged aircraft were unable to fly at the end of 2016--more than half of the Marines' fixed- and rotary-winged aircraft were unable to fly at the end of 2016. That is outrageous. The Navy fleet currently stands at 277 of the 350-ship requirement.  The Air Force had 134 fighter squadrons in 1991, when we drove Saddam Hussein out of Now it has only 55--in 2017, 55, and in 1991, 134, and we have 1,500 fewer fighter pilots than we need.  Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force, put it earlier this week, when she said, ``We have been doing too much with too little for too long.'' We need to hear these words, and we need to remember how they spell out in the real world--how they affect our sailors, our pilots, and our troops on the ground.  This summer, the Nation mourned 42 servicemembers who died in accidents related to readiness challenges. Mr.McCain, the Senator from Arizona, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, pointed out the death of 17 sailors aboard the USS John McCain and USS Fitzgerald alone, plus other separate actions claimed the lives of 19 marines and 6 soldiers.  Meanwhile, the world has not become a safer, more peaceful place. We keep trying to cash that peace dividend, but there is no peace. In fact, when our adversaries see us retreating from our commitment to fund, equip, and train our military, it is a provocation. They see an opportunity, whether it is Vladimir Putin in Crimea, Ukraine, or China in the South China Sea, or Kim Jong Un in North Korea, they see our retreat, in terms of our financial commitment to support and train our military, as a provocation and an invitation for them to fill the void.  I am reminded of a sobering quote from the former Director of National Intelligence during a hearing last year. Former Director James Clapper said: ``In my time in the intelligence business''--and he served for 50 years in the intelligence business--``I don't recall a time when we have been confronted with a more diverse array of threats.''  In 50 years, he didn't recall us being confronted with a more diverse array of threats. On top of these threats, never before has our country been at war for such an extended period of time, and never before have we done so much with an All-Volunteer military force strained by repeated deployments while defense spending was cut nearly 15 percent over the last 8 years under the previous administration.  So here is what I say. Let's pass the national defense authorization bill, which authorizes $700 billion for our Nation's defense. Let's give our troops the pay raise they deserve. Let's address our readiness problems by authorizing increases in the overall number of soldiers and marines. When doing that, let's also do away with the sequester on defense spending. Reductions to defense spending should be targeted--think scalpel, not meat cleaver--and our focus on cutting should be where the bulk of our spending is: outside of the military on mandatory spending, growing at a rate in excess of 5 percent a year, out of control and threatening the solvency of these important safety net programs.  Colleagues, while we take the fight to ISIS, while we seek to deter aggression in the Pacific and support our emergency responders here at home, including the military, we can't postpone our problems. Our challenges can't be postponed and are not disappearing.  As I said a moment ago, our adversaries are watching closely and modernizing while at home our readiness wavers. Sequestration causes our aircraft to age, our soldiers to tire, and our national security to deteriorate. Trouble is not going to wait on us getting our act together. Whether our military is ready or not, here it comes.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

90,topic-id,1837,"Madam President, I want to clarify something about what is going to happen this afternoon. Whenever a Democratic Senator says they are worried about the state of our military, that they are horrified about the kind of cuts we are making, and they can't sleep at night because of what we are doing to our troops in the field, don't believe them. They don't mean it. They are not serious. It is all for show because they had a perfect opportunity to stop all of these terrible cuts--and not just for the troops, for their own State, for their constituents, even for their little parochial projects. What did they do? They turned it down. They said no.  Well, actually I take that back. They didn't say no. They couldn't even bring themselves to say no. They didn't have the courage to say no. They did something much worse. They said nothing because we are not even going to vote on the amendment I wanted to offer, which would have repealed the sequester spending cuts for defense and nondefense--defense and nondefense spending.  Now, the Members of this body know I am no fan of frivolous, pork-barrel spending. A lot of the projects that my Democratic colleagues sponsored could easily fall in that category, and we should rein that sort of thing in at a time when we are $20 trillion in debt, but I understand the only way we were going to get something done about the radical spending cuts to our military was to forge a bipartisan compromise.  After all, it is not like the sequester spending cuts really did that much to control spending. Did spending go down in 2011, 2012, 2013? Yes, it went from $3.6 trillion to $3.5 trillion, to $3.4 trillion, but the sequester wasn't even in effect for those first 2 years. Spending went down because Republicans won control of the House in 2010. At the end of 2013, however, Congress raised the budget caps and pushed off the sequester for those 2 years ahead. So, by 2015, Federal spending was back to $3.6 trillion, and it has been growing ever since. Time and time again, Congress has proven itself utterly incapable of sticking to the caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011.  Instead of actually saving money, all the sequester does is create an endless series of crises for Congress to escape just in the nick of time. Take this year. We all know what is going to happen. We just passed a 3-month continuing resolution earlier this month. We are going to reach a 2-year budget agreement in October or November that doesn't control spending. We are going to have an omnibus in December, written in secret in our leaders' offices, and then we are going to have another omnibus spending bill, written in secret in our leaders' offices, next December, and we will repeat that cycle over again in 2019 and 2020. How do I know that? Because that is exactly what happened in 2013 and 2015. We will never make the cuts the Budget Control Act called for. We will just pass giant budgets that nobody has read in the last minute in an attempt to avoid the crisis of our own making.  My amendment was the last best chance in years to stop this bust-and-boom cycle of budgeting. But what did the Democrats do? They threw it away. They took a perfectly good, bipartisan opportunity to repeal these automatic spending cuts, and they threw it away.  You have to ask yourself what goes through Senators' heads when they make such a cynical political calculus. Do they not understand the implications of what they are doing? Do they not see the appalling lack of readiness that is so apparent to everyone else?  Did they not see what happened to the USS John McCain? Did they not see what happened to the USS Fitzgerald? Did they not see all those caskets carrying the dead bodies of America's young coming home to families in grief? Do they not see them or do they see them and just not care?  What do they think when they hear respected men like Secretary Jim Mattis say: ``No enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of our military than sequestration''?  What did they think when Secretary Mattis said, after 4 short years of retirement, when he returned to the Department of Defense, ``I have been shocked by what I've seen about our readiness to fight''?  Is it just background noise? Does it not register with Democratic Senators? In fact, what must they think when they have been saying the exact same thing for years?  The junior Senator from Connecticut said: ``The so-called sequester is another example of governing at its worst.''  The junior Senator from New Jersey said: ``It is blunt, brutal, and blind.''  He gets bonus points for alliteration.  The senior Senator from Virginia: ``Sequestration is stupidity on steroids.''  I could make that claim about a lot of things that have been said in this  The senior Senator from Washington: ``We need to replace sequestration as quickly as possible''; although, apparently, not if it requires a vote on the Cotton amendment.  The junior Senator from Minnesota: ``There are a lot of people suffering needlessly because of the sequester.''  That is not a joke, even coming from him. I guess all of these cries of anguish are falling on deaf ears.  The senior Senator from New Hampshire: ``The blind cuts of sequestration are not the right approach,'' but by all means, let's keep them in place rather than vote on the Cotton amendment.  The senior Senator from Connecticut: ``The safety and strength of our Nation also requires that Congress eliminate the rightly maligned sequestration straightjacket for all Federal programs''--maligned, yet not repealed.  My favorite is by the senior Senator from Rhode Island, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee: ``Instead of dodging fiscal responsibility, Republicans need to help end sequestration and get back to a normal budget process.''  Republicans gave you a perfect example with which to do that, sir, and you turned it down.  That is what this amendment would have done, but now we will not have a single dime more for the military. We will not give a dime more to FEMA or to the National Weather Service or to NOAA or to NASA or what have you. We will not give one penny more to all of those domestic priorities that the[[Page S5783]]Democrats claim to care about. It turns out that they must not care that much about them or maybe I am being too harsh. Maybe they do like them a lot. They like using them to gin up political support because, when the time came for them to actually put their money where their mouths were, they walked away.  The Democrats will tell you that they oppose this amendment because it will not repeal the automatic sequester of mandatory spending. Don't give me that. That is nonsense. That is pure pretext. The automatic sequester consists of a small, almost trivial number of cuts, and it would not have affected one penny--not one penny--of Social Security or Medicare or veterans' benefits.  Here is what is most important. Every single Democratic Senator has voted to extend that mandatory sequester into the foreseeable future. So, far from thinking it is a problem, they have voted to extend its life.  Hey, how about I strike a new deal? Here is my offer. I will support your hiding behind procedural niceties, hiding in your cloakroom, and not voting on my amendment, if you will agree to do one thing--to go home, in person, to your military bases that are in your home States and explain to the men and women of our Armed Forces, face-to-face, why you could not bring yourselves not just to repeal these spending cuts but not even to be tough enough to take a vote one way or the other.

He can look at all of these Americans in the eye and say: Sorry, just politics--hope you understand.  That is all this is. It is politics of the lowest kind. In maneuvering, posturing, and posing, they are caving to the demands of the Democratic leader simply because he wants more leverage for more pork-barrel spending when we had a budget deal that was negotiated in secret in He twisted their arms, and they screamed like little kids. They are putting politics ahead of our troops. They are holding our troops hostage to politics solely because their leader wants them to.  If they were not, they would allow a vote on this amendment. They would vote aye. They would vote aye eagerly, and they would vote aye enthusiastically, but they cannot even do that. They cannot even put their names down as a yes or a no on something that they have all said that they have supported for years.  They just hide behind procedure. They hide in their cloakroom. They hide from the voters. They hide in the back corridors and hallways of this building. They hide to save their own skin.

He pointed specifically to the effort to repeal ObamaCare as a failure by those standards. He used as an example the fact that ObamaCare, during the period of Republicans' efforts to repeal, was actually gaining popularity in this country--exactly the opposite of what the other party might have expected. It was an indication to him that we needed to do things better in Just a few days later, he cast a critical vote to stop what was a flawed process on the Republican side--to repeal ObamaCare without a good alternative, without a good substitute.  I remember that vote early in the morning, right here in the well of the Chamber, and I remember what followed when I saw Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Murray behind me in front of the cloakroom in a bit of a huddle after that historic vote. I later learned that they had decided it was their turn to step up on a bipartisan basis and find a way to strengthen our healthcare system, not what we had just seen but a different way--a way that kind of relied on experts at State levels to give us advice and experts in Washington to really cull through the ideas to find the very best. They invited other Members of the Senate to join them, even those of us not on the committee.  Senator Alexander and Senator Murray have had several meetings, which I have attended and which were very productive meetings--bipartisan gatherings over coffee and donuts with insurance commissioners from States all across the Nation, commissioners from both political parties, bipartisan meetings of Governors from States all across the United They were basically sitting down and saying: What can we do now? What can we all agree to do, regardless of party, that will reduce the increasing costs of health insurance premiums, provide coverage for more people, and provide better healthcare--quality care? It was a good-faith effort, and it was encouraging, after 7 wasted months of political debate on the floor of the Senate.[[Page S5829]]  I went to those meetings and came away feeling very positive. It was clear that some very basic ideas were emerging from all over the United One of the ideas was cost-sharing reduction so that health insurance companies that took on sicker, older patients and had worse loss experiences would be able to be compensated so they could reduce premium costs, bring the cost of health insurance down, and make sure more people had it available.  Another proposal was reinsurance. That is the same basic idea. Let's find a way to make the increase in health insurance premiums slow down. I remember the commissioner from the State of South Carolina, a Republican, who said that his experience was that in the next year, health insurance premiums in the individual marketplace were going up 30 percent.  He said that, if you bring in the cost-sharing reductions, which the Federal Government can do, it would only be 10 percent. Ten percent is bad enough. Thirty percent is painful.  Here is something we can do on a bipartisan basis to reduce the cost of health insurance premiums. It struck me as obvious that this is what we should be doing as the  I applauded Senator Alexander personally and publicly, and Senator Murray, as well, for doing what the Senate was supposed to do. Little did I know that at the same time they were making this bipartisan effort, there was another Republican effort under way to derail them, to stop them, to end the bipartisan conversation that was under way in the HELP  The Cassidy-Graham proposal, which may come to the floor as early as next week, is an effort to repeal ObamaCare, but it is a flawed effort.  Earlier this morning, the Republican leader came to the floor and spoke of the debate that we have had over and over about what we are going to do in the future, and he talked about the failed ideas of the past. I can tell you that the Cassidy-Graham proposal is a return to failed ideas--ideas rejected once by the Senate but certainly by the American people.  In this morning's Chicago Tribune, one of the business writers, Michael Hiltzik, wrote an article entitled ``The GOP's last-ditch ObamaCare repeal bill may be the worst one yet.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this article in its entirety.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Chicago Tribune, 16, 2017]  The GOP's Last-Ditch Obamacare Repeal Bill May Be the Worst One Yet                          (By Michael Hiltzik)       The Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act is      back, a zombie again on the march weeks after it was declared      dead. The newest incarnation is Cassidy-Graham, named after      chief sponsors Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham      of South       Compared with its predecessors, the bill would increase the      ranks of America's medically uninsured more--by millions of      people--cost state governments billions more and pave the way      for the elimination of all protection for those with      preexisting medical conditions.       Among the biggest losers of federal funding would be the      states that had the foresight to expand Medicaid under the      Affordable Care Act and the resolve to reach out to lower-     income residents to get them coverage; they'd be punished      with draconian cuts in healthcare funding. Among the big      winners would be states that have done nothing of the kind      for their residents--refusing the Medicaid expansion and      interfering with outreach efforts. They'd be rewarded for      their stupidity and inhumanity with an increase in federal      funds.       Over the last week or so, reviews of the measure have been      pouring in from healthcare experts, and they're almost      unanimously negative. Major health provider and consumer      organizations have turned thumbs down, as have analysts      looking at its economic effects.       Fitch Ratings, which keeps an eagle eye on the fiscal      condition of states issuing bonds, judges Cassidy-Graham      ``more disruptive for most states than prior Republican      efforts.'' Fitch finds that ``states that expanded Medicaid      access to the newly eligible population under the Affordable      Care Act (ACA) are particularly at risk under this latest      bill.''       The bill surfaced just as the political tide seemed to be      shifting away from the GOP campaign to roll back the gains in      health coverage experienced by Americans over the last seven      years under the Affordable Care Democrats are coalescing      around universal health coverage--``single-payer,'' as it's      typically termed--teeing up the issue for the 2018 election.      It's notable that the rise in public support for this      approach, at least in the abstract, has coincided with the      GOP's so-far unsuccessful repeal effort. The emergence of the      new bill also comes as other Republicans are scheduling      hearings and reaching across the partisan aisle to craft a      sensible plan to shore up the Affordable Care Act      marketplace.       Despite those drawbacks, Cassidy, Graham and their co-     sponsors are trying to push the measure through by Sept 30,      the last day it could be passed with only 50 votes (plus a      tie-breaker cast by Vice President Mike Pence) under Senate      reconciliation rules. After that, it would need a filibuster-     proof count of 60 votes, meaning it could--and presumably      would--be blocked by The deadline places more      pressure on the Congressional Budget Office, which must      analyze the bill before it can come to a vote, to move fast.       In recent days, the sponsors have claimed that their vote      count is edging toward 50. But Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has      stated that he's a ``no,'' since the bill isn't conservative      enough for his taste. Susan Collins (R-Maine), whose      ``no'' vote helped to scuttle the last repeal effort in July,      isn't expected to change her mind on this one. Lisa      Murkowski (R-Alaska), who also voted it down, hasn't been      quoted on her position, but there don't seem to be compelling      reasons for her to shift to the ``yes'' column now. The      position of John McCain (R-Ariz.), who also voted      against the last bill, isn't clear, but he's a close friend      and frequent ally of Graham's. In any event, the backers      still seem to be a vote or two short.       Those are the procedural issues. Now let's turn to the      text, and the issue of why anyone would think Cassidy-Graham      would improve America's healthcare system.       In broad terms, the measure would terminate the Affordable      Care Act's Medicaid expansion, premium and cost-sharing      reduction subsidies, tax credits for small businesses, and a      host of other pro-consumer provisions by 2020. It would      eliminate the act's individual and employer mandates      retroactive to 31, 2015.       The bill provides for no replacement of these provisions,      beyond a capped block grant to states. In effect, it's a      repeal-and-no-replace bill. The Congressional Budget Office,      as it happens, analyzed that approach in July in connection      with a different bill. It found that by 2026 the number of      uninsured Americans would increase by 32 million, compared      with under current law. That's about 50% more people      uninsured than it estimated for other Republican repeal-and-     replace measures, which the budget office said would cut      enrollments by 20 million to 22 million.       The block grant to states, which Cassidy and Graham portray      as one of their bill's chief virtues, is in fact a poisoned      chalice any governor would be a fool to accept. The proposal,      Cassidy said in unveiling the bill, ``gives states      significant latitude over how the dollars are used to best      take care of the unique healthcare needs of the patients in      each state.'' That papers over its significant drawbacks.       By their nature, when block grants are proposed to replace      existing programs, they're almost always back-door mechanisms      to reduce federal spending. That's the case here. The      Cassidy-Graham block grants would replace the money now being      spent on Medicaid expansion and the premium and cost-sharing      subsidies, and a couple of other spending provisions. But the      existing spending is pegged to demand--Medicaid funding      adjusts automatically to enrollment and the medical needs of      the enrollees, and the subsidies are pegged to enrollee      incomes and the premiums charged by insurers for benchmark      Obamacare plans.       Block grants would be fixed, changing only according to a      complex formula. And that formula would be ``insufficient to      maintain coverage levels equivalent to the ACA,'' the Center      on Budget and Policy Priorities calculated last week. Between      2020 and 2026, the center reckoned, the grant would provide      $239 billion less than projected federal spending for the      existing Medicaid expansion and subsidies. In 2026 alone, the      shortfall in Medicaid and subsidy funds together would total      $80 billion.       What's worse is that the grant would be unable to respond      to real-world conditions. Consider how healthcare costs are      likely to rise in Texas and Florida in response to this      summer's floods, which drove thousands of residents out of      their homes and increased the threat of water-borne disease.      They'd get no help from the block-grant formula. To provide      needed care to their residents under Medicaid or any other      state programs, they'd have no choice other than to limit      enrollments, cut benefits, charge higher premiums or co-pays,      or drain funds from other federally funded programs.       As set forth in the bill, the formula would ``over time      move money away from states, predominantly Democratic, that      have expanded Medicaid and aggressively pursued enrolling      their lower income populations in Medicaid and exchange      coverage,'' observes healthcare expert Timothy      ``Money would move toward states, predominantly Republican,      that have not expanded Medicaid.''       Some Medicaid expansion states would lose as much as 60% of      what they would be due under current law. According to the      numbers crunched by the Center on Budget and Policy      Priorities, among the states that went all-in on Obamacare,      including expanding Medicaid and mounting aggressive      enrollment support[[Page S5830]]     for the marketplaces, California would get $27.8 billion less      in federal funding in 2026, New York $18.9 billion less, and      Massachusetts $5.1 billion less.       States that shunned the Affordable Care Act would make out      like bandits: Texas, which showed absolutely no regard for      its ACA-eligible population, would get $8.2 billion more in      2026, and Mississippi, another black hole for healthcare      reform, would get $1.4 billion more. This is how carrot-and-     stick approaches to healthcare reform work--in the Bizarro      world. (Apologies to Jerry Seinfeld.) In any case, all the      federal funding would disappear after 2026, According to      Fitch, ``over time even non-expansion states will face      budgetary challenges given the proposed changes to Medicaid,      which will likely accelerate for all states over time.''       Another provision of Cassidy-Graham that is significantly      worse than its predecessors is the latitude it gives states      to eviscerate consumer-protection rules in the Affordable      Care The bill would allow states to request waivers from      the federal government allowing them to nullify the act's      requirement that all policies include 10 essential health      benefits, including maternity care, hospitalization, mental      health and substance abuse treatment, and prescription      coverage. This is an invitation to states to allow insurers      to market junk insurance to their residents.       The states could also request waivers of the act's all-     important protections for people with preexisting medical      conditions. The law forbids insurers to charge anyone more      based on their medical condition or history, except for a      modest increase in premiums based on age and a surcharge for      smokers. Previous GOP repeal bills have substituted a      ``continuous coverage'' provision, which protects applicants      who haven't let their coverage lapse for a month or two from      being surcharged when they renew.       Cassidy-Graham throws out that protection. It would allow      states to request a waiver allowing insurers to charge more      ``as a condition of enrollment or continued enrollment . . .      on the basis of any health status-related factor.''      Translation: Under such a waiver, insurers could check      applicants' health or medical histories before setting      premiums--even for renewals.       Finally, there's that crucial Republican litmus test--     abortion. The bill bars any insurance policy receiving      federal funds--that is, a policy whose enrollees get      subsidies or that is subject to payments under the Affordable      Care Act's reinsurance rule--from offering coverage for      abortions except when the mother's life is in jeopardy or in      cases of rape or incest.       Remarkably, this bill's sponsors are pitching it as a      moderate, common-sense alternative to its predecessors. They      may also be hoping that opposition fatigue has set in, and      that they'll be able to steamroll the measure through while      the public is distracted by other issues. As with other      repeal efforts, this one is being brought out without a      minute of hearings.       Cassidy asserts that this measure is a blow for equality.      The measure ``treats all Americans the same no matter where      they live.'' He's right, in a way: It treats all Americans as      potential victims of insurance company profiteering.

11,topic-id,1666,"Let me quote a few sentences from this article because I think they make the case dramatically about how bad the Cassidy-Graham substitute would be. Here is what he said:       Compared with its predecessors, the bill would increase the      ranks of America's medically uninsured more--by millions of      people--cost state governments billions more and pave the way      for the elimination of all protection for those with      preexisting medical conditions.

He goes on to write:       Among the big winners would be the states that have done      nothing of the kind for their residents--refusing the      Medicaid expansion and interfering with outreach efforts [to      bring more people into health insurance coverage].

Honestly, can my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in good conscience go home to their States and say: I voted to repeal ObamaCare and you are going to lose your health insurance as a result of it.  I can tell you what it means in my A million people would lose their health insurance because of this Republican repeal effort. I don't know how Members of Congress--House or Senate--from Illinois could in good conscience vote to take health insurance away from massive numbers of  We are blessed here. Those of us who serve in Congress have access to good health insurance. It is not cheap. It shouldn't be. But it is there. It is always there, and we don't have to worry about it. Some Members are wealthy enough that they take care of it in other ways. For most Members of Congress, we use the insurance marketplace and pay our share of the premiums. The government pays a share of it, just as it does for Federal employees.  We have access to health insurance. How then could we turn and say to the people we represent: I just voted for a bill to take away your access to health insurance.  That is what this Cassidy-Graham bill does. That to me is hard to imagine--that a Member can believe they were elected to the Senate for that purpose.  What does it do to the States with this capped block grant in terms of their loss of Federal funds? It is amazing. Some States would lose as much as 60 percent of what they currently receive under the current law.       According to the numbers crunched by the Center on Budget      Policy Priorities, among the states that went all-in on      Obamacare, including expanding Medicaid and mounting      aggressive enrollment support for the marketplaces,      California would get $27.8 billion less in federal funding in      2026, New York $18.9 billion less, and Massachusetts $5.1      billion less.  I looked at the list for my State of It would lose $1.4 billion in Federal funding by 2026. Just to show the contrast, as for the State of Texas, which did not expand Medicaid and which did not cover low-income individuals with health insurance, what would the Cassidy-Graham bill do for the State of Texas? They wouldn't lose a penny. They would add in Federal funding $8,234 million.  They would be big winners because they turned their back on low-income individuals and didn't expand Medicaid or increase the number of enrollees. What a perverse incentive for Governors and governments on a State basis to turn down coverage knowing that at some point they will be rewarded for that approach.       Another provision of Cassidy-Graham that is significantly      worse than its predecessors is the latitude it gives states      to eviscerate consumer-protection rules in the Affordable      Care  One of the most important parts of the Affordable Care Act was a reform that said: If you are going to buy health insurance, it is going to be there when you need it. First, you will be able to buy it, even if you have someone in your family with a preexisting condition. That is one of the first casualties of Cassidy-Graham--going back to a failed idea in the past, which said if you have a sick baby or if you have a spouse who survived cancer, you either can't buy health insurance or you can't afford it. We got rid of that once and for all. At least we thought we did. Cassidy-Graham brings it back to life. It says: Let the insurers decide if they want to cover you or not.  Another thing we said is that the disparity in premium costs between the most expensive policy and the least will be 3 to 1. Cassidy-Graham tosses it out and says it is 5 to 1. What it means--and AARP knows this better than any other organization--is that senior citizens are going to end up paying more for their health insurance under Cassidy-Graham than they currently do under the Affordable Care Act.[[Page S5831]]  When you look at the other protections that we built in to provide that your policy, when you bought it, would cover mental illness and substance abuse treatment, that is considered revolutionary but important. Finally, after all of these years in America, we are looking at mental illness as an illness rather than a curse. We are looking at it as something that can be successfully treated. Yet here comes Cassidy-Graham tossing out that requirement as well.  Let the insurers decide what they want to offer. I was talking to one of the Republican Senators the other day, and he said: Well, you know, some people just may not want to buy certain coverage.  I can understand that, but I can also understand the reality of life. Who can predict that next year or next month you would learn that perhaps your high school daughter has been taking opioids and now is addicted to heroin? You didn't know it before, not when you bought your health insurance policy. Now that you know it, who is going to cover the substance abuse treatment?  Under the Affordable Care Act, it is built into your health insurance policy. Under the Cassidy-Graham approach, it is an option. Try it if you like it. It doesn't work in a lot of circumstances. We buy insurance for things we pray will never happen, but we want to be covered in case they do. Cassidy-Graham walks away from that. They are for what they call ``flexibility.'' It is flexibility to buy insurance that isn't there when you really need it.  When you look at the litany of all of the States that are winners and losers under Cassidy-Graham, you have to shake your head. Why would we be richly rewarding States that have not done their part to expand Medicaid coverage? Why would we devastate the Medicaid Program, which is so important for so many people?  Medicaid is a program that many people didn't understand until we got into this debate, but it is a program that is essential if you have a disabled child.  A woman in Champaign, IL, with a young son in his twenties suffering from autism told me that without Medicaid coverage he would have to be institutionalized, and there is no way her family could afford it.  We know that Medicaid is there for that family and for many low-income families when it comes to pregnancies, to make sure that mom has a successful pregnancy and that the baby is born healthy and ready to thrive.  Is that an important asset? Of course it is, and it is an important element of The one thing that costs the most in Medicaid is something the Republicans don't want to acknowledge, and that is the fact that two out of three people in nursing homes--seniors who are under medical care--rely on Without that Medicaid assistance, who is going to pay that bill? The family reaching into their savings? Some can, but most will not be able to afford it.  How will the Republicans explain that away as just one of the benefits of flexibility--that Medicaid is not there when your parent or grandparent desperately needs it?  So now we have this debate before us, which will come up by the end of next week, and it is one that really will affect a lot of people across I, for one, will do everything I can to stop this. Any program that is going to take health insurance away from a million people in Illinois and up to 30 million nationwide is a bad start, a bad idea, a failed idea.  I yield the floor.

17,topic-id,887,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Noel Francisco to be the Solicitor General of the United  The Solicitor General--often called the ``tenth Justice''--argues on behalf of the United States in the Supreme It is a critical position in our government, and it is critical that we have a Solicitor General with the independence to tell the President when the position he wants the United States to take before the Court is indefensible.  Mr.Francisco already had a troubling tenure as Acting Solicitor General earlier this year. He led the effort to defend the original version of the President's controversial travel ban. That Executive order was blocked repeatedly in Federal courts and was then withdrawn. In defending this unconscionable order, Mr.Francisco argued that there should be no judicial review when a President makes decisions on immigration policy on the basis of his national security assessment. The Ninth Circuit stated that ``there is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.'' If he is confirmed, Mr.Francisco would likely be called upon again to defend President Trump's latest iteration of the travel ban when it is considered by the Supreme Court in  When he was under consideration by the Judiciary Committee, I asked Mr.Francisco many questions to give him the opportunity to show his independence from President For example, I asked him if he agreed with President Trump's absurd claim that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election. He refused to answer the question.  I asked him if he believed it was appropriate for a President to ask an FBI Director to pledge loyalty to him. He declined to comment.  I also asked him about the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prohibits government officials from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign states without Congress's consent and which many legal scholars believe President Trump has violated. Mr.Francisco actually had written an opinion on the Emoluments Clause when he was in the Justice Department's Office of Legal I asked him what he believed the Founding Fathers intended this clause to mean. His response? ``I do not have any well-formed views on the scope of the Emoluments Clause.'' It is puzzling that an originalist like Mr.Francisco would not comment on the original meaning of a constitutional provision, but he clammed up when it came to this particular clause which is directly relevant to President Trump's behavior.  While Mr.Francisco has been reluctant to demonstrate independence from President Trump, he has been willing at many points in his career to demonstrate loyalty to special interests. For example, Mr.Francisco gave a speech at the 2015 annual conference of the Community Financial Services Association, better known as the trade association for the payday lending industry. Here is what he said: ``The payday lending industry is facing the challenge of a lifetime. It is essential that, as an industry, you be prepared to respond on all fronts, and it has been my privilege to assist you in doing this over the last few years. This includes the legislative front, the regulatory front, and--my favorite--the legal front.''  Let's be clear. We don't need a Solicitor General who thinks it is a privilege to assist payday lenders.  Mr.Francisco also was a prominent lawyer for the tobacco industry. His advocacy on their behalf prompted a number of national antismoking and health organizations to call for Mr.Francisco to recuse himself from tobacco-related litigation matters if he were confirmed. I asked Mr.Francisco if he would commit to recuse himself from tobacco litigation, but he would not make that commitment.  Mr.Francisco has been eager to position himself alongside rightwing groups like the Federalist Society and the Heritage He made this particularly clear at a speech he gave to the Heritage Foundation on May 19, 2016, when he said: ``We live in an era where our views, traditional views, are under constant attack. Our adversaries have not even really tried to beat us through the democratic processes, but instead go straight to the courts, where they often win not by asserting that our views are legally wrong, but that they are so fundamentally illegitimate that the Constitution prohibits them. And they now have an increasingly compliant Judiciary that agrees with their policy views and that is unconstrained by legal principle.''  This is a troubling characterization, to claim that people who do not share the views of the Heritage Foundation are ``our adversaries.'' It is just as troubling to claim that the Judiciary is acting ``unconstrained by legal principle'' whenever it disagrees with the views of the Heritage Comments like this raise serious questions about the ideology Mr.Francisco would bring to the Solicitor General's office.  Make no mistake--President Trump is likely to keep the Supreme Court[[Page S5833]]busy. It has never been more important to choose a Solicitor General who displays independent judgment and who is willing to say no if the views the President wants to execute are improper or unlawful. In my questions to him, I repeatedly gave Mr.Francisco the opportunity to display that independent judgment, but he did not do so, and what I have seen in his speeches and his advocacy concerns me.  In short, I do not believe Mr.Francisco has demonstrated that he can be the Solicitor General that our Nation needs. I will oppose his nomination.

135,topic-id,601,"Mr.President, this week, we mourn the loss of Pete Domenici, a former Senate colleague, a respected and leading voice in bipartisanship, and, most of all, a friend.  Pete had the distinction of being the longest serving Senator in New Mexico's history. He spent almost half a century as a public servant.  Most knew Pete for his outspokenness on energy and budget issues, but I remember him best for his commitment and dedication on behalf of Americans struggling with mental illness.  In 2008, two Senators--Paul Wellstone, a liberal Democrat from Minnesota, and Pete Domenici, a conservative Republican from New Mexico--came together to pass legislation that prohibited health insurance companies from treating mental health differently from physical health benefits.  The Wellstone-Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act finally set mental health and substance abuse benefits on equal footing with other health benefits, ensuring fairness in deductibles, copayments, provider networks, and lifetime limits.  Those two Senators couldn't have been more different, but they each had family members who were touched by mental illness.  Pete Domenici and Paul Wellstone asked, Why should we treat illnesses of the brain any different than a cancer, diabetes, or heart disease?  That shared bond brought them together. It is why they spent years fighting with insurance companies about the importance of mental health coverage and ultimately got a law passed.  The Wellstone-Domenici Parity Act laid the groundwork for so much of what we fought for in the Affordable Care Act: the idea that people should have access to coverage, regardless of what their medical needs are.  You see, the ACA built off this law by requiring that all individual market insurance plans cover mental health and substance abuse services as an ``essential health benefit.''  Thanks to Pete's hard work, millions of Americans no longer have to fight for mental health benefits or addiction treatment benefits, so important in the face of today's opioid crisis.  Pete taught us that mental illness is exactly that--an illness--and that those who suffer from any illness deserve equal rights and access to care.  Senator Domenici was also a strong advocate for immigration reform.  Back in 2002, he signed on as a cosponsor of the original DREAM Act, legislation that I introduced to give a path to citizenship to talented young immigrants who grew up in the country.  As the son of an Italian immigrant mother and an Italian-born father who earned citizenship after his service in WWI, Pete understood firsthand the immigrant experience.  He once said, ``I understand this whole idea of a household with a father who is American and a mother who is not, but they are living, working, and getting ahead. I understand that they are just like every other family in There is nothing different. They have the same love, same hope, same will and same aspirations as those of us who were born here have.''  Pete didn't just talk; he put his money where his mouth was.  In 2006, he voted for the McCain-Kennedy comprehensive immigration reform bill that included the DREAM  It passed the Republican-controlled Senate on a strong bipartisan vote, but unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives never brought it to a vote.  Senator Domenici's work in the Senate is a great example of the good that can come from bipartisanship--of what can happen when we start working together to get something done for the American public.  It is my hope that we can carry on Pete's legacy of equal rights for all through bipartisan means.  My condolences to the Domenici family and thank you for sharing such an earnest man with us.

264,topic-id,2339,"Mr.President, each year the Department of Defense funds billions of dollars in military-relevant medical research--research that offers our servicemembers concrete treatments for the particular diseases and afflictions that impact them the most, research that offers families hope, research that improves lives, and research that saves lives.  Last summer, during consideration of the fiscal year 2017 Defense Authorization Act, there was a question as to whether Congress would permit this lifesaving research to continue or whether instead we would wrap it up in so much redtape that it would basically go away.  I was proud that this Senate Chamber, on a bipartisan basis, voted resoundingly to continue medical research in the Department of Defense by a vote 66 to 32. It was an important, bipartisan vote, especially in a Senate where we have a difficult time finding common ground. When it came to medical research in the Department of Defense for members of the military and their families, we said unequivocally that we are committed to it on a bipartisan basis. I was proud to lead that fight, along with Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a Republican, to protect defense medical research. Altogether, 40 of my Republican and Democratic colleagues co sponsored our effort.  That vote was not just a vote for medical research, it was a vote for the men and women in the military and their families. The vote recognized that right now, we are closer than ever to finding cures for dreaded diseases like cancer; closer than ever to understanding how to delay the onset of neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; closer than ever to developing a universal flu vaccine. That vote recognized that now is the time to be ramping up our investment in medical research, not scaling it back. The Senate spoke, but unfortunately it didn't end the debate.  This year, the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act now pending on the floor of the Senate repeats last year's research-killing provisions and, for inexplicable reasons, adds two more. Just like last year, these provisions in the bill pending on the floor of the Senate would effectively end the Department of Defense medical research program. Like last year, these provisions wrapped this research in more redtape than you could possibly explain. And we face the prospect for the second year in a row of the end of this critical, lifesaving medical research.  These provisions are dangerous, and by cutting medical research, they will cost lives--the lives of our military and their families. So I filed a bipartisan amendment, along with 53 additional cosponsors and my lead cosponsor, Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, to remove these provisions from this Defense authorization bill so that lifesaving research can continue.  The underlying Defense authorization bill has four provisions that, if enacted, will end the DOD's research.  The first provision, section 733, would require the Secretary of Defense to certify that each medical research grant awarded is ``designed to directly protect, enhance or restore the health and safety of members of the Armed Forces''--not veterans, not retirees, not the spouses of military members, not the children of military members.  To make matters worse, after the Secretary makes this certification in writing to the Armed Services Committee, the Defense Department is then required to wait 90 days before awarding the grant. It is not only redtape, it is built-in delay.  In my view, veterans, retirees, and spouses and children of servicemembers are all vital members of the Department of Defense's military community. They use the Department of Defense healthcare system. They deserve to be counted. When a member of the military deploys, the family deploys, and we ought to stand by all of them.  The second provision, section 891, requires that medical research grant applicants meet the same accounting and pricing standards that DOD requires of procurement contracts. That sounds simple enough, doesn't it? But these are regulations that private companies have to meet to sell the Department of Defense goods and services, like weapon systems and equipment.  The third provision, section 892, changes the ground rules for how to handle the technical data generated by this research--information related to clinical trials and manufacturing processes. How does this bill change it? This should sound familiar: by wiping away the existing regulations and imposing overly burdensome and unappealing regulations that would scare off research partners.  I am sympathetic to what this section may be attempting to do. In the face of ever-increasing prescription drug costs, it does make sense for the Federal Government to have more rights when it comes to products and treatments developed with Federal taxpayer dollars. However, we must be more strategic about how to approach this. I look forward to working across the aisle on ways to beef up the government's role in helping to keep drug costs down, especially for products that would not have been possible without Federal investments.  The fourth provision, section 893, requires the Defense Contract Audit Agency to conduct audits on each grant recipient.  For those who aren't familiar with this audit agency, it is currently backlogged with tens of billions of dollars' worth of procurement contracts that it has to audit. This provision in the bill would add to this pile, requiring it to conduct an additional 800 audits per month on medical research grants--more redtape; no real reason.  Taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent, and the existing system does that. The grant application must show that the research is relevant to the military. No grant makes it through the first round without showing clear military relevance. If an applicant fails this test, that is the end of the story. If they clear the hurdle, then they are subjected to a long list of critical defense researchers[[Page S5719]]and issue experts in the disease in question to ensure that their research proposal is worth the investment. But that is not it. Representatives from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs also have input at that point to make sure it doesn't duplicate any existing research. These rules are in place to protect taxpayer dollars, and they work.  This year's Defense authorization attempts to add redtape to the program in the name of protecting it but in reality ends it. Simply put, these provisions would strangle the Department of Defense medical research program in suffocating redtape. Don't take my word for it. The Coalition for National Security Research, representing a broad-based coalition of research universities and institutes, said:       [These sections] could jeopardize funding for research      activities that have broader relevance to U.military,      including the health and wellbeing of military families and      veterans, and the efficiency of the military healthcare      system.  We asked the Department of Defense how the new system proposed in this bill would work. Here is their analysis:       This language would, in essence, eliminate military family      and military retiree relevant medical research, inhibit      military medical training programs, and impact future health      care cost avoidance. Impacts will take place across all      areas. . . . [Researchers] would most likely not want to do      business with the . . . [The provisions] may create a      chilling effect on potential awardees of DOD assistance      agreements.  A ``chilling effect'' on medical research--is that what we want to go on the record to vote for with this bill? Is that what the Senate wants? Is that what we want to say to members of the military, their families, and retirees? I don't think so.  These provisions are simply put in the bill to erect roadblocks to critical, important medical research.  Let's talk for a minute about the medical research funded by DOD, the real-world impact.  Since fiscal year 1992, the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs has invested almost $12 billion in innovative medical research. This medical research command determines the appropriate research strategy, filling research gaps, and creates a public-private partnership between the Federal Government, private universities, and those who desperately need this research.  In 2004, the Institute of Medicine, an independent organization, looked at the medical research program that I have discussed, and what did they find? ``The CDMRP has shown that it has been an efficiently managed and scientifically productive effort.'' That is a pretty solid endorsement of $12 billion worth of medical research. They found that this program ``concentrates its resources on research mechanisms that complement rather than duplicate the research approaches of major funders of medical research in the United States, such as the National Institutes of Health.'' They also found that ``the program appears to be well-run, supports high-quality research, and contributes to research progress.''  The Institute of Medicine also reviewed the program in 2016. This was their conclusion just last summer about the same program:       CDMRP is a well-established medical research funding      organization, covering many health conditions of concern to      members of the military and veterans, their families, and the      general public. . . . In general--  And this is highlighted--     the committee found CDMRP processes for reviewing and      selecting applications for funding to be effective in      allocating funds for each research program.  This program has been closely vetted, as it should be. It is a matter of medical research critical to members of the military and their families. It is a matter of life and death. It is a matter of the integrity of spending taxpayers' dollars. It is a good program, a solid program. It has not been wrought with scandal. There is no reason for us to turn it upside down or to turn the lights out in the offices of these researchers.  The Institute of Medicine had this right. We have real results to back up the way we feel about this. What areas have they embarked on with critical successful research? One of the greatest success stories of this program is advances we have made in breast cancer treatment. In 1993, the Department of Defense awarded Dennis Slamon two grants totaling $1.7 million for a tumor tissue bank to study breast cancer. He began his work several years earlier with funding from the National Cancer The DOD kicked in to help.  Slamon's DOD-funded work helped to develop Herceptin, which is now FDA approved, one of the most widely used drugs to fight breast cancer. This research has not only saved the lives of countless women in the military, but it has had application far beyond the military. The same thing is true when it comes to prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease. What we found over and over is that money invested in this program for medical research is money well spent. Why, then, would we bury this program in redtape?  I am happy that some 54 or 55 Senators from both sides of the aisle are going to stand with me, and I see I have other colleagues preparing to speak. I will return to speak more specifically about the programs of this agency.  Is there a person in this country who believes that America is spending too much money on medical research? Well, perhaps there is, but I haven't met them. What I have found over and over is that Members of both political parties are committed to medical research. The Department of Defense does a great job with the resources given to them.  Let's continue this program as a salute to our men and women in the military, their families, and our veterans.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, let me state the bottom line up front. This year's NDAA, once again, focuses medical research dollars on the needs of servicemembers and military veterans, and it increases transparency on how these taxpayer funds are being spent.  The amendment of the Senator from Illinois would take hundreds of millions of dollars away from defense needs to spend it on research activities totally unrelated to the mission of the military and shield these activities from critical oversight by the Department and the  Let me state this up front: If these medical research dollars were invested in the proper branch of government, I would be one of its strongest supporters. What we are seeing here--what we see so often--is the Willie Sutton syndrome. They asked Willie Sutton: Why do you rob banks? He said: That is where the money is.  Why do you think medical research for autism, spinal cord injury, prosthetics, or many others have nothing to do with defense? Let's take it out. Let's appropriate the right amount of money to the right branch of government. So while we are watching the defense dollars--thanks to sequestration--going down over the last 20 years, Congress has provided more than $11.7 billion in medical research.  According to--what is aptly named over in Defense--the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, 12 out of 28 current research programs do not mention the military, combat, or servicemembers and their official mission or vision statements.  So let me repeat this for the benefit of my colleagues. Spending on medical research at the Department of Defense, nearly 15 percent of which has nothing to do with the military, has grown 4,000 percent since 1992--4,000 percent. So in the meantime, the Budget Control Act is constraining the DOD budget. It has done great harm to our military. Every single service chief and combatant commander over the last 5 years has testified to the Armed Services Committee that the budget caps imposed by BCA have hurt our military readiness and have made it more difficult to respond to the Nation's growing threats. Yet, during this time of severe defense budget restrictions, funding for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs has nearly doubled. Is that our priority?  I suggest to the Senator from Illinois: Why don't you go to the right place in the appropriations bill and allocate research funds there? Why don't you do that? You are not going there because it is the Willie Sutton syndrome.  What you are doing is you are taking away from the men and women serving[[Page S5720]]in the military what they need to defend this  ",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgS5712-3.txt,326,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,14.0,September
265,topic-id,1355,"Will the Senator yield for a question?  Mr.No, I will not yield.  The fact is that we have now had a rash of fatal accidents in the military--10 from the USS McCain and 17 more. We now have many more accidents due to the lack of readiness, training, and maintenance than we do in combat. So what do we do? Do we stop cutting the military? No, we add $11.7 billion for medical research.  I am for medical research. I know of no one who opposes medical research, but do we take it out of defense? This is the directed spending on medical research at the Department of  You may see that in 1992 it was a small amount of money for breast cancer research. Like other government programs, it has grown and grown and grown. If you will take a look at the pink side here, you will see that what also has grown is those programs that have no relevance to the military. I want to say it one more time. No, I will say it again and again and again. If the Senator from Illinois wants this money spent for medical research, then, take it out of the right place. Don't be Willie Take it from where it belongs, instead of taking it from the men and women in the military who are undermanned, undertrained, underequipped, and in harm's way.  So you have a choice here, my dear friends. Yes, who could be against medical research? Nobody who I know. But who could be in favor of taking money from the men and women and their training, equipment, and readiness, when every single service chief has testified before the Armed Services Committee that we are putting the lives of men and women serving in the military at greater risk? So we are going to see these billions of dollars taken out of defending the Nation and the arms, the training, and the equipment that the men and women in the military need.  Now, if the Senator from Illinois wants to fund those that are militarily relevant, I would be glad to go along with that, but see what has grown and grown and grown from 1992, when it was $25 million. Now it is billions of dollars. Let's see. Funding has increased by 4,000 percent from $25 million in 1992 to over $1 billion last year.  Spending on medical research--nearly 50 percent of which has nothing to do with the military--has grown 4,000 percent since 1992. So let's not say that we are shorting the men and women in the military when that spending has increased by 4,000 percent.  Again, I would like every one of my colleagues to listen to the leaders of our military and to the men and women who are serving. They don't have enough training. They don't have enough equipment. They are not ready, and it is being reflected in these kinds of accidents where we are killing more members of the military in training than we are in combat, and every one of the service chiefs will tell you that it is because of lack of funding for training and readiness and maintenance. This has to stop.  The NDAA this year prohibits the Secretary of Defense and the service Secretaries from funding or conducting a medical research and development project unless they certify that the project would protect, enhance, or restore the health and safety of members of the Armed Is that an outrageous requirement that we should spend tax dollars that are for defense that would actually be used for defense? Wouldn't that be outrageous?  So it requires that medical research projects are open to competition and comply with other DOD, or Department of Defense, cost accounting standards. So we are not only asking them to be responsible but to comply with other Department of Defense cost accounting standards. So why that should be unacceptable, I don't know.  So the Senator from Illinois has submitted an amendment that would strike these requirements--it would strike these requirements--to adhere to the Department of Defense cost accounting standards. Why? Why would you not want to go along with cost accounting standards?  So it is certainly not an accident that the largest spike in congressionally directed medical research funding coincides with the tenure of the Senator from Illinois as chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee Defense Subcommittee, in which, I say, he has done an outstanding job. Hundreds of millions of dollars in the defense budget will be used for medical research unrelated to defense, and it was not requested by the administration.  If this amendment passes, hundreds of millions of dollars will be taken away from military servicemembers and their families. If this amendment passes, hundreds of millions of dollars will not be used to provide a full 2.1-percent pay raise for our troops. It will not be used to build up the size of our Army and Marine It will not be used to buy equipment so that our airmen don't have to steal spare parts of airplanes in the boneyard to keep the oldest, smallest, and least ready Air Force in our history in the air.  So I say to my friend and colleague from Illinois, it is not that he is wrong to support medical research. We all support medical research. It is that he has proposed the wrong amendment to support medical research. Instead of proposing to take away hundreds of millions of dollars from our military servicemembers, he should be proposing a way to begin the long overdue process of shifting nonmilitary medical research spending out of the Department of Defense and into the appropriate civilian departments and agencies of our government.  I want to emphasize again that this debate is not about the value of this medical research or whether Congress should support it. I, of all people, know the miracle of modern medicine and am grateful for all who support it, and I am sure every Senator understands the value of medical research to Americans suffering from these diseases and to the family and friends who care for them and to all those who know the pain and grief of losing a loved one. But I will repeat again that this research does not belong in the Department of It belongs in civilian departments and agencies of our government.  So I say to my colleagues that the National Defense Authorization Act focuses the Department's research efforts on medical research that will lead to lifesaving advancements in battlefield medicine and new therapies for recovery and rehabilitation of servicemembers wounded on the battlefield. This amendment would harm our national security. The amendment of the Senator from Illinois would harm our national security by reducing the funding available for militarily relevant medical research that helps protect servicemen and servicewomen on the battlefield and for military capabilities they desperately need to perform their missions. It would continue to put decision-making about medical research in the hands of lobbyists and politicians, instead of medical experts where it belongs.  I would like to repeat for at least the fifth time that I strongly support funding for medical research. I do not support funding for medical research that has nothing to do with the Department of The dollars are too scarce. You can see the way that it has gone up and up and up. So what we are trying to do is to preserve medical research where it applies to the Department of Defense and not use it for every other program, which should be funded by other agencies of government. I am very aware of the power and influence of the lobbyists who lobby for this kind of money, knowing full well that this is the easiest place to get the money.  I just hope that some of us would understand that 10 sailors just died onboard the USS John They died because that ship was not ready, not trained, not equipped, and not capable of doing its job because they didn't have enough funding. Let's get our priorities straight.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgS5712-3.txt,326,0915,2017.0,14.0,September

369,topic-id,2255,"Mr.President, the Senate has spent a great deal of time over the last 6 or 7 months on healthcare in For years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Republican Party--the House and Senate--has called for repeal of the bill. Yet, when the time came, with the majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate and, of course, a Republican President, and the task was immediately before them, they faltered because they didn't have a replacement. They didn't have something to propose that was better. As a consequence, their efforts stopped short--one vote short--on the floor of the Senate several weeks ago.  We still face some significant challenges. Some of those are very immediate.  Before the end of September, we will face the prospect of needing to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as This program provides health insurance coverage for more than 9 million children and pregnant women across the country--350,000 in my This vital program, the CHIP program, has had two decades of broad bipartisan support, and it is going to expire in 12 days.  The good news is that the Finance Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch of Utah, and his ranking member, Ron Wyden of Oregon, have reached a bipartisan agreement on a 5-year reauthorization of the CHIP program.[[Page S5797]]  The bad news is that instead of preserving healthcare for low-income children and pregnant women, the Senate Republican leadership seems more interested in the next 12 days in calling a different issue--a different bill--altogether, the Graham-Cassidy bill, relating to health insurance across That bill would take health insurance coverage away from millions of Americans, including 1 million in the State of  From where I am sitting, reauthorizing the CHIP program is a priority to not only serve the 9 million children and pregnant women across our country but 350,000 in my  There is another bill we need to reauthorize before the end of September: the funding of our Nation's community health centers. Like CHIP, funding for community health centers expires at the end of this month--in just a few days. Also like CHIP, community health centers have enjoyed decades of broad bipartisan support. We have 10,000 community health centers across our country. They serve 26 million Community health centers serve 1 out of every 10 children, 1 in 6 Americans living in rural areas, and more than 330,000 of our Nation's veterans.  Illinois' 52 health center organizations receive $150 million in Federal funding in order to provide care to the 1.3 million people in 360 locations in the State of I have been to many of these locations, and I have said in real candor and honesty that if I had a medical issue or if there were one in my family, I would enter the community health centers in my State with confidence that I and my family would receive the very best of care. They are outstanding organizations.  If Congress doesn't act within 12 days, community health centers in my State and across the Nation will see their funding cut by 70 percent. That dramatic funding cut would result in 2,800 community health centers closing across America, 50,000 jobs lost, and 9 million people losing access to healthcare.  Well, there is good news here as well. Because of Senators Blunt and Stabenow taking the lead, they are pushing for swift reauthorization of community health center funding. But the problem is that there is another bill--the Graham-Cassidy bill--which has captured the attention and apparently the calendar time for the Senate--at least that is the possibility we hear. So why shouldn't Congress be spending the next 12 crucial days reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program across America and making certain our community health centers don't lose the critical Federal funding they need to serve so many people?  Right now, we know we face some challenges when it comes to the health insurance market in Approximately 6 percent of Americans--3 percent of people in my State--purchase their health insurance in the individual marketplace, with more than 50 percent of these people receiving some subsidies to help pay for costs. However, many of these people are seeing dramatic increases in premiums. We know that, and we know it is a challenge and one we need to address.  Here is the good news--and it is time for some good news when it comes to healthcare. Almost from the minute that the critical vote was cast ending the repeal of ObamaCare, meetings started taking place. I can recall, as the Senate was adjourning, I looked back by the cloakroom, and there was Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Patty Murray talking in the middle of the night--about 3 o'clock in the morning. I later learned that they had reached an agreement between them--a Republican, a Democrat--on the HELP Committee to start a series of hearings about what we could do as a Senate to actually strengthen the healthcare system in That was before our August recess.  When we got back from recess, they had kept their word. I attended three or four of the Member hearings, which they held before the official public hearings a little later in the morning. These were good meetings. At the first one, I recall Senator Alexander saying 53 Senators--Democrats and Republicans--showed up for coffee and doughnuts to meet with insurance commissioners from five different Just a few days after that, there was another coffee-and-doughnut session, another good bipartisan turnout of Senators as we sat down with five Governors, Democrats and Republicans, who talked about health insurance. A few days later, another meeting took place where experts came in and talked about the subject.  I felt there was more accomplished in those 3 hours with those outstanding witnesses from across the country than all of the time we had spent giving speeches to one another on the floor of the Senate in the previous 7 months. It was interesting. We brought in these people from different States, different political parties, and they virtually had the same thing to tell us. There were a handful of things which we could do that could make an immediate, positive impact to make the cost of health insurance a lot more predictable--not to say we are going to bring it down--I don't want to be overpromising--but to slow the rate of growth in health insurance costs as well as provide stability in the insurance market.  Here are the things that came out loud and clear from these bipartisan Senate meetings.  First, they told us to stop playing games with cost-sharing reduction subsidies. These are subsidies to insurance companies that take on individuals with expensive health histories. These insurance companies are given support by subsidies so that they can keep the premium costs for these individuals under control.  These cost-sharing reduction subsidies help 7 million Americans afford their copayments and deductibles on their health insurance policies. The current Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to stop the payments. As a result, individual market premiums keep going up because of the uncertainty of whether the government is going to keep its promise to make these cost-reduction subsidies.  I remember the commissioner from the State of South Carolina told us, I say to the Senator from Oregon, who is our ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee--he said: I am going to announce a 30-percent increase in health insurance premiums. If I knew that these cost-sharing reduction subsidies were coming, it would be 10 percent. I can eliminate 20 percent of the anticipated increase in premium costs if these subsidies come through.  It is pretty clear to me, this is sound policy, on a bipartisan basis, which would have a dramatic impact in reducing the cost of premiums to many individuals. That came through loud and clear in every meeting we had with Senators Murray and  The second thing they talked about was State reinsurance. I don't understand that as well as some, but it has worked in States where the State picks up a share of the liability for health insurance between certain dollar amounts so the private insurance companies don't end up with that burden. Because of this reinsurance, they are able to keep premium costs down.  The third thing is to provide States with more flexibility without undermining some really fundamental issues--without undermining, for example, the preexisting condition protection we currently have.  I left those meetings feeling encouraged. After 7 months of bitter political rhetoric, which led to nothing on the floor of the Senate, we were finally sitting down, on a bipartisan basis, with Democrats and Republicans all across our country with specific suggestions which could help our healthcare system. That, to me, is the way to move forward. That, to me, is the lesson learned from much wasted time so far this year. Unfortunately, this whole effort may be derailed.  Senators Cassidy and Graham have come up with a legislative alternative they want to move forward. Unfortunately, the measure they have proposed has not been scored by the Congressional Budget Office nor carefully measured to find out what impact it would have on the American healthcare system, which accounts for one-sixth of the American national economy.  Here is what we know about the Cassidy and Graham proposal. What they are suggesting is basically eliminating the subsidies which help individuals pay for private health insurance and bringing to a halt the Medicaid expansion which has covered millions of Americans and given them health insurance.  What they say instead is something which has been said many times on the[[Page S5798]]floor: We will just give all the money to the Governors, and they will figure it out. They will figure out how to save money in their It turns out, Governors of both political parties warn us: If you are going to give us a set amount of money as the cost of healthcare continues to go up, don't expect us to cover as many people or provide as good a coverage if we do it on a State-by-State basis.  So who supports this new Cassidy-Graham approach and who opposes it? Every single medical advocacy group--the hospitals, the doctors, the nurses--all across America oppose this Cassidy-Graham approach, as well as the medical advocacy groups, because they understand their approach would allow discrimination against individuals insured based on a history of preexisting conditions--going back to the bad old days before we passed the Affordable Care  The Cassidy-Graham approach, which they brought to us, doesn't add up. If you take $300 billion or $400 billion out of this healthcare system, dump it into the laps of Governors across this country and say, ``Good luck. Do it on a local basis. I am sure it will all work out,'' they will quickly tell you, as they have had in the bipartisan meetings we have had, it will not work. It does not compute. It may be able to check the box from some things to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but they certainly didn't replace it with anything of equal or better value. The opposite is true. That is why I think we ought to think twice.  There is a mad dash now in the last 12 days to do many things. From a political viewpoint, there is a limited opportunity for this repeal effort. That 12-day period is a limited window under the Senate rules of reconciliation. It is a mistake, as far as I am concerned, for us to move toward Cassidy-Graham--concepts which have been roundly opposed in my State and across the Nation, concepts which have failed on the floor of the  Let us roll up our sleeves and do three things that do make sense: Let's reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Let's make sure those kids and their pregnant moms are going to have the basic coverage they have enjoyed for almost 20 years.  Let's also reauthorize the community health centers. We know they work. We know when people have a medical home, they are less likely to let medical conditions get worse and more expensive. That, to me, is a good investment to make sure they continue.  Finally, let's turn toward a real bipartisan effort, a measure which can emerge soon--I hope within days--from Senators Murray and Alexander on a bipartisan basis. I know they are still working on it. They haven't reached a final agreement on what they are doing, but I hope all of us, in both political parties, will encourage them to do the right thing.  Remember when John McCain came to the floor after he had been diagnosed with the cancer he is battling now. He came here and cast a crucial vote to proceed to debate this whole issue of healthcare. Then he asked to speak for 15 minutes, and I stayed in my chair. I wanted to hear it. He reminded us of the importance of doing things on a bipartisan basis and doing them thoughtfully when it comes to something as important as healthcare. Let us keep that speech by John McCain and that lesson in mind. Let us resist this Cassidy-Graham approach, which has no support when it comes to the medical community, and instead work on the bipartisan approach from Alexander and Murray, together with the Finance Committee--which I know Senator Wyden is going to address next--so we can have a bipartisan solution.  The American people sent us here to solve problems, not to create them. Cassidy-Graham creates problems. Let's find solutions which solve problems.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

262,topic-id,728,"Mr.President, throughout my time as a Senator, I have heard our Service Chiefs testify time and again to the hollowing of America's military as a result of insufficient and unpredictable funding. Simultaneously, external dangers have grown in size and scope.  Sadly, for the first time in decades, we are forced to confront not one but multiple existential threats to the American way of life. An expressive Russia, expanding China, nuclear North Korea, nefarious Iran, and relentless global terror networks put our lives and the lives of future generations at risk.  America is once again in crisis. Inaction, obstruction, or partial commitment are not options. This year's National Defense Authorization Act provides us an opportunity to fulfill our duty--to provide America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and guardsmen the tools they need to accomplish all we demand.  I find it particularly fitting that this bill came to the floor the week of September 11, an anniversary of unparalleled adversity but also one of national unity. On that day, and the days that followed 16 years ago, the best of America eclipsed the evil of terror. We came together for the sake of our security, demonstrating to the world America's resilience.  There is no greater symbol of that resilience than those who serve in uniform. Secretary Mattis reminded us of that on Monday when he said: ``The men and women of America's armed forces have signed a blank check to protect the American people and to defend the constitution, a check payable with their lives.''  The least the Senate can do in return is authorize and prioritize congressional efforts to keep faith with that promise. At the same time, we are under no obligation to fund overbudget, behind-timeline defense programs with a blank check of their own. To the contrary, we have an oversight obligation to the American taxpayers, those in and out of uniform, to ensure proper stewardship of their hard-earned dollars.  That is why I, along with my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, crafted and passed unanimously the bill before you. In it, we have prescribed a clear and comprehensive plan to rebuild our military to decisively deter or defeat any adversary. However, we are also holding the Department accountable for each dollar it spends.  For my part, as a member of the Armed Services Committee and chair[[Page S5718]]of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, I focused on three priorities.  First, I supported our troops and their families by making senior enlisted pay scales commensurate with job requirements, by combating sexual assault and retaliation, and by facilitating Federal direct hiring authority for military spouses. I extended that support to the battlefield by promoting enhanced standards for things like parachutes, aircraft life support systems, and counterdrone technologies.  Second, I advanced policy initiatives to increase cooperation with international partners, to codify a more comprehensive counterterror strategy, and to reaffirm America's support for our European friends by putting Russia on notice for its aggression in Ukraine and  Finally, I included measures to optimize existing institutions, such as our National Guard's cyber capabilities, and to ease regulatory burdens, so the best ideas and products from our universities and private companies can bolster national security at a lower cost. I have led important efforts to hold DOD accountable by requiring enhanced program management standards and by joining Senators Grassley and Perdue in demanding that the Department finally meet its 26-year overdue statutory obligation to complete a clean audit.  Colleagues, let's be clear--no one wants America's military to be our first or only option, but we must also acknowledge this truth: It is fundamental to our security that a ready military remains an option. The fiscal year 2018 NDAA is a vital step toward providing that security. Seeing it through to fruition as part of a larger effort to reassert our ``power of the purse'' is the next step. There will be time to debate nondefense policies and budgets later, and as legislators, our job is to have these very debates.  Let's take the first step now. I urge all of my colleagues to support the Follow through in the months ahead. Fulfill our obligation to realize its goal. We can do no less.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgS5712-3.txt,2283,0915,2017.0,14.0,September
429,topic-id,1740,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak on the Defense authorization bill.  Congress has passed this bipartisan legislation every year for the past 55 years. Once again, this year, the Senate is debating this critical legislation to provide our men and women in uniform with the resources they need to keep America safe.  This is a bipartisan bill. It represents the combined efforts of Members from both sides of the aisle. It was approved unanimously by the Senate Armed Services All 27 of our members voted for it. That is more than a quarter of this body.  The distinguished chairman, the senior Senator from Arizona, spoke on the Senate floor on Monday about the geopolitical challenges we are facing and the need for this legislation. He is absolutely right.  The number and the complexity of the threats we face today are unprecedented. North Korea is relentlessly pursuing long-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to our shores. Americans are informed about the sobering threat from the Kim regime because it has dominated much of the recent news, but it is by no means the only significant challenge we face. We remain a nation at war, with thousands of men and women in uniform still deployed to the Middle East and Russia and China continue to undermine rules-based international order by developing advanced military capabilities designed specifically to counter U.defense systems. Iran continues to pursue regional dominance and regularly harasses U.ships and planes operating in that region.  These are needlessly provocative acts that carry risks of an accident or a miscalculation that could spiral into serious confrontation. Additional low-intensity conflicts continue to smolder across the globe, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula, and each one has the potential to impact U.national security.  The global turmoil of today highlights why the bill before us is so very important. It will provide the resources necessary to defend our Nation in the face of those challenges. But the NDAA is about more than just answering these threats; it is about helping us here at home as well.  Last Friday, I visited Naval Station Norfolk and had an opportunity to meet with some of our Nation's best--the sailors and officers of the U.As we stood on the pier, we watched the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier depart and head out into the Atlantic and join other U.Navy ships responding to the damage caused by Hurricane  Fighting and winning wars is the primary mission of our military, but the American people depend on it for so much more. The destruction and the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma have brought this point home.  This bill authorizes the resources our men and women in uniform need to respond to these crises and to do the job the Nation asks of them. It also begins to address the readiness gaps that have emerged in recent years as the Department has been asked to do more with less.  Upon returning to the Department of Defense 4 years after retiring from military service, Secretary Mattis testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee about this very issue. He said: ``I have been shocked by what I have seen about our readiness to fight.'' Additional testimony from other military leaders has borne this assessment out as well.  Only 3 of the Army's 58 brigade combat teams are ready to ``fight tonight.'' Sixty-two percent of the Navy's F-18 fighters cannot fly. Approximately 80 percent of our Marine aviation units lack the minimum number of ready basic aircraft for training, and flight-hour averages are below the minimum standards required to achieve and to maintain adequate levels of readiness.  Following the direction by President Trump to rebuild the military and prioritization by Secretary Mattis to improve readiness, this bill authorizes $30 billion to address unmet requirements identified by the military services and our combatant commanders, and it provides additional resources to address emerging threats.  In the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, which I chair, we provided[[Page S5733]]over $500 million in additional funding for cooperative missile defense programs with Israel to fully meet the needs of our ally.  We also authorized an additional $200 million to approve the Ground-based Midcourse Defense, or the GMD, system. These increases include funds for the development of more capable boosters and funds to improve what our military calls ``discrimination,'' or the ability of the system to distinguish between hostile warheads and decoys and other debris in space. The GMD is our only missile defense system capable of defending the homeland from intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the smart, targeted increases made by the subcommittee have only become more necessary as North Korea continues to demonstrate increased capabilities.  The subcommittee's mark also fully supports the modernization of our nuclear forces and the Department of Energy's nuclear enterprise and the sustainment activities. As part of this effort, the subcommittee added almost $200 million to help address the backlog of deferred maintenance activities at our nuclear facilities. More than half of these facilities are over 40 years old, and roughly 30 percent date back to the era of the Manhattan Dilapidated structures at these facilities pose safety risks to our workers and jeopardize essential operations.  This additional funding will enhance the administration's efforts to address the highest priority requirements and begin reducing the immense maintenance backlog, but more work will be required in future years to resolve this very longstanding issue.  The jurisdiction of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee also includes outer space. In the subcommittee's mark, we added over $700 million to address unfunded needs for space operations. This includes over $100 million to expand the development and testing of advanced prototypes in response to the urgent operational needs of our warfighters and an additional $35 million to expedite the development of advanced jam-resistant GPS receivers.  Our forces rely heavily on the capabilities provided by our satellites, and our adversaries know it. They are developing capabilities to target our space assets, and these investments are critical if we want to ensure our forces never have to face a day without space.  I am proud of the strong provisions the Strategic Forces Subcommittee contributed to the bill before us today. In addition to the steps taken in this bill to address current threats, it makes important investments in advanced technologies to stay ahead of the challenges we might face tomorrow. For example, the bill authorizes over $500 million in additional funding to support the Department's Third Offset Strategy and improve the U.military's technological superiority. It also prioritizes cyber security--an area of growing risk and opportunity as technology becomes more and more sophisticated.  I serve on the Cybersecurity Subcommittee, and last Congress I served as chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, which then had jurisdiction over our cyber capabilities. In this year's bill, we are adding to those efforts that I worked on in past years to improve how we man, train, and equip our military's cyber forces. The committee added over $700 million for cyber-related requirements and included a number of policy provisions in this area, such as a requirement for the Department of Defense to undertake the first-ever cyber posture review, which will evaluate the military's policy and capabilities in the cyber domain.  Before concluding my remarks, I would like to reply to an argument that was made earlier today by the Senator from Massachusetts against a provision in this bill responding to Russia's violation of the INF  The bill before us today authorizes $65 million for researching a ground-launched cruise missile system. The committee's report on the bill explains this in greater detail, but I would like to make a few quick points, if I may.  First, the senior Senator from Massachusetts described this provision as a ``knee-jerk reaction.'' I would like to remind my colleagues that Russia's violation of the INF Treaty reportedly began in 2008. That was almost a decade ago. The United States formally raised it with Russian officials in May of 2013--4\1/2\ years ago.  This issue has been with us for some time and the provisions of this bill are anything but a knee-jerk reaction, which leads to my second point. The Senator argues that further study is needed and has proposed an amendment preventing any action from being taken before a report is complete.  In the last three Defense authorization bills, Congress has required some sort of study on this issue. The solution to this problem is not to require further studies. Costs must be imposed on Russia for violation, and that is what this provision does.  Finally, there was some discussion of the views of our military leaders, and the Senator quoted heavily from Paul Selva, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of The General and I have discussed this issue, and we have discussed it when he appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee in He specifically identified using research and development programs, within the limits of the treaty, to increase pressure on the  That is exactly what this provision does. It does not violate the INF It takes the first step to impose costs on Russia for its violation of this agreement.  Years have gone by, no action has been taken, and Russia has only increased its violation of the treaty. Waiting for more studies to be complete only ensures that Russia's actions will continue to go unanswered. Failing to hold Russia accountable risks undermining this agreement and our broader nonproliferation agenda.  In the words of President Obama:       Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words      must mean something.  In closing, I want to express my thanks to the bill's managers for their hard work. I have truly appreciated all they have done to bring this bill to the floor. This legislation upholds the bipartisan tradition that has characterized the National Defense Authorization Act, which has enabled it to pass for 55 years in a row. This is a strong bill that will strengthen our military. It will help ensure the military can protect our Nation in a world full of challenges. From North Korea's belligerence to severe storms damaging our coasts, our military has a tough job to do. They must be prepared to do it. I hope my colleagues will join me in swiftly passing this bill.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

59,topic-id,1740,"Mr.President, in May, Jimmy Kimmel shared the story of his newborn son Billy, who was born with a life-threatening condition that required open-heart surgery. Kimmel said that he was fortunate to have had good health coverage and was able to pay for the care that his son needed, something he believed every American deserved.  A few weeks later, as efforts to repeal ObamaCare were gaining steam, Senator Bill Cassidy explained that the bar he believed any healthcare bill had to clear to get his vote was what he called the Jimmy Kimmel test. He said: ``Will a child born with congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in the first year of life?''  When Kimmel interviewed Senator Cassidy a few days later, Kimmel explained the test this way: ``No family should be denied medical care, emergency or otherwise, because they can't afford it.'' Well, I am here to report that this latest version of TrumpCare, offered by none other than Senator Cassidy himself, fails the Jimmy Kimmel test miserably.  Over the past few weeks, there have been two ongoing conversations about the future of healthcare in the United The first has been conducted in an open, bipartisan manner in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in full accord with the traditions of this body. In the HELP Committee, Republicans and Democrats alike have been talking with Governors, insurance commissioners, and other experts on ways to address concerns of States and consumers by stabilizing the individual market and lowering premium costs. That is how the Senate is supposed to work, and the bill that emerges from that process will be one that makes things better, not worse. It will create certainty. It will bring down costs for consumers. It is a bill that any Senator should be proud to vote for.  The second conversation is a model of how things shouldn't work. It has occurred behind closed doors between Senate Republicans and party operatives. It is not about making the system work; it is about passing something--anything that can be said to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and along the way, it destroys the Medicaid Program as we know it. As many of us have argued before, this conversation is an affront to the traditions of this body and, more importantly, to the will of the American people.  I urge my Republican colleagues to oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill--the newest iteration of TrumpCare--which will rip healthcare coverage from tens of millions of people, create higher[[Page S5845]]costs for consumers, and ensure the destabilization of the individual health insurance market.  While I have worked closely with Senators Cassidy and Graham on other bills, and I respect them, I have grave concerns with this legislation.  First, the bill undermines protections for people with preexisting conditions.  States could apply for waivers that would allow them to charge people more based on their health status, age, or any other factor other than race or ethnicity. This means premiums would be higher just for being older or sicker or having had an illness in the past. In other words, there would be no protection for people with preexisting conditions.  Additionally, States can also seek waivers to remove the ACA's essential health benefit requirements, which mandate that insurers that are offering plans on the exchanges include coverage for vital services, such as prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health, and substance use disorder services.  While the bill technically requires States to describe--just simply describe--how they will ``maintain access to adequate and affordable health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions,'' there is no definition of what that means, and there are no enforcement mechanisms. Insurers would still be able to charge people with preexisting conditions more for their care or exclude services altogether. Under this plan, millions of people with preexisting conditions could face much higher costs, if they can get coverage at all. Again, this bill rips away protections for people with preexisting conditions.  Second, the bill would undoubtedly reverse the significant coverage gains we have seen in recent years and drive up the number of Americans without health insurance.  The Graham-Cassidy proposal eliminates the ACA's premium subsidies, eliminates the Medicaid expansion, eliminates cost-sharing reduction payments, and more. Instead of funding these critical aspects of the ACA, the bill would return some but not all of this funding to the States in the form of block grants, which are authorized in this bill from 2020 to 2026.  The bill also proposes to dramatically reduce funds for States that have expanded Medicaid and have successfully enrolled more adults in ACA exchanges--States like Instead of incentivizing success, the bill will reward failure, initially increasing funds for States that refuse to expand Medicaid and have done little to encourage enrollment. But even these States lose out in the end. In fact, the funding stops completely after 2026, resulting in enormous losses for every State, and even prior to 2026, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates, most States will receive significantly less funding from the Federal Government under this block grant than they do under current law. Minnesota could lose $2.7 billion. Other Senators who have expressed various levels of concern with this legislation could see their States lose significant sums. Those include Arizona, which would lose $1.6 billion; Alaska, $255 million; Maine, $115 million; Colorado, $823 million; and the list goes on. Healthcare isn't free. These shortfalls will mean that families don't get the services they need.  On top of all that, the Graham-Cassidy proposal caps and cuts Medicaid--a program that provides coverage to seniors, families with children, and people with disabilities. In Minnesota alone, that is 1.2 million people facing cuts to their benefits or losing coverage altogether.  I believe many of us truly want to help our constituents access the care they need. As I have said before, the ACA is far from perfect, but it has resulted in significant improvements in millions of people's lives.  I have heard from countless Minnesotans who have literally had their lives or the life of a loved one saved by the ACA--the same way that Billy Kimmel's life was saved by the treatment he was able to receive at the beginning of his life. Take Leanna, for example. Leanna's 3-year-old son, Henry, has been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. His treatment will last until April of 2018. He often needs round-the-clock care to manage his nausea, vomiting, pain, and sleepless nights--a 3-year-old.  Henry's immune system is so compromised that he is not supposed to go to daycare, so Leanna left her job to care for him. Leanna and Henry are supported by her spouse, but they couldn't pay for Henry's treatment on one salary.  Leanna says:       It is because of the ACA that Henry gets proper healthcare.      Henry can get therapy and the things he needs to maintain his      health and work towards beating cancer. Henry is still with      us because of the  Let me say that again: Three-year-old Henry is still with us because of the  Consider Maria's story. Maria enrolled in Minnesota's Medicaid Program after finishing her graduate degree and while looking for full-time employment. Maria was grateful for the coverage because she needed access to treatments for her endometriosis, which was diagnosed a few years prior while she had insurance through her employer.  Soon, Maria found her dream job, but it came with a catch: no health insurance. Days before she was set to move and start work, she decided to go in for one last big checkup. The results were unnerving. At the age of 35, Maria was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. Maria had to give up her job offer and aggressively pursue treatment for the cancer.  Fortunately, because Minnesota had expanded Medicaid, all of Maria's treatments were covered, and lucky for her, they worked. Maria's cancer is in remission. Maria said: ``The Medicaid expansion of the ACA literally saved my life.'' She told me that anyone could find themselves on She said: ``Without that comprehensive, affordable, accessible health insurance, I wouldn't be here.''  But now that all of these programs are in jeopardy, my constituents are generally scared. They have come to me in tears, explaining that if the Affordable Care Act is repealed or if draconian changes and cuts to Medicaid go through, they don't know how they will care for their elderly parents, keep their rural hospital open, or afford treatments they or their children need.  I believe it is legislative malpractice to pass partisan legislation that would undermine this progress, people's economic security, and their livelihood, all to achieve a destructive political end--to do it without holding thorough hearings in the committees of jurisdiction, without hearing from experts, and without a complete assessment from the Congressional Budget Office on how this legislation would affect the American people.  I urge my Republican colleagues to once again abandon their efforts to ram through dangerous legislation that would fundamentally restructure our healthcare system. This new iteration of TrumpCare fails the Jimmy Kimmel test. It is the result of a horrible process that is not worthy of this body.  We have a better option. Over the past few weeks, Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray have held four bipartisan hearings on individual health insurance market reforms and are working to forge a legislative compromise to reduce premiums for consumers. We have heard from Governors, we have heard from insurance commissioners, and we have heard from experts--all of whom span the ideological spectrum. This is what regular order looks like, and this is the way the Senate is supposed to work.  I have worked with all of my colleagues on this committee in good faith, and I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish so far, but all of that work is in jeopardy because of a destructive, partisan, last-ditch effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and end the Medicaid Program as we know it.  Do not shortchange those important legislative developments. Do not shortchange the American people. Think of the millions of children and families who need our help right now. Oppose TrumpCare, and, instead, let's work to improve care, lower costs, and ensure access to healthcare when people need it the most. It is within our reach.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

274,topic-id,677,"Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote for a bipartisan amendment, 1051, to protect transgender servicemembers in our military.  I want to thank my dear friend and colleague, Senator McCain, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and his staff, for working with us on this bipartisan amendment to protect transgender servicemembers and for agreeing to support it here on the floor today.  The amendment, which I was so proud to write with my Republican colleague from Maine, Senator Susan Collins, would prohibit the Department of Defense from discharging members of the military or denying them reenlistment opportunities because of their gender identity. It is essential that this Congress does not break faith with these brave servicemembers who have served their country honorably and with great sacrifice.  As Members of the Senate, one of our most serious responsibilities is to stand up for the men and women who serve in our armed services. We have an obligation to represent their interests, to value and respect their service, and to give them the tools and resources they need to defend our country. Kicking out thousands of servicemembers simply because of their gender identity doesn't make our military stronger, it makes our military weaker. It doesn't save taxpayer money, it wastes taxpayer money. We have spent millions recruiting and training these highly skilled servicemembers.  I want to be clear to those who misunderstand our U.military members, to those who somehow think our military cannot handle diversity among its servicemembers: Do not underestimate the men and women who serve in uniform. They represent the best and strongest among us.  An argument against diversity in the military is wrong. We heard this argument during the fight to end racial segregation. We heard it during the fight to allow women to serve. We heard it during the fight to end don't ask, don't tell, which I was proud to work on with the Republican Senator from Maine once again. And here, once again, this argument is wrong. Our military is strongest when it represents the Nation it serves.  Rather than shrinking the talent pool and telling patriotic Americans that they cannot serve, we should be doing everything we can to encourage and support them. We should thank them for their devotion to service, for their willingness to leave their families for months at a time and risk their own lives and safety to protect us.  This transgender ban affects individuals who were brave enough to join the military, men and women who were tough enough to make it through rigorous military training, men and women who love our country enough to risk their lives for it, to fight for it and even die for it. To suggest these brave, tough, and selfless transgender Americans somehow don't belong in our military is harmful to our military readiness, and it is deeply insulting to our troops.  Don't tell me that U.Air Force SSgt Logan Ireland, who deployed to Afghanistan and has earned numerous[[Page S5725]]commendations since the ban on transgender service was lifted, should be kicked out of our military. Don't tell me a young recruit like U.Marine Aaron Wixson, who left college to enlist in the field artillery and worked diligently with his chain of command during his gender transition to meet every requirement asked of him, should be kicked out of the military. Do not tell me that Navy LCDR Blake Dremann, who identified as transgender while serving in Afghanistan and has deployed 11 times and won the Navy's highest logistics award and now shapes our military policy at the Pentagon--don't tell me he should be kicked out of the military. Any individual serving in our military today who meets the standards should be allowed to serve, period.  I urge my colleagues to join me, the Republican Senator from Maine, and Senator John McCain, on our bipartisan amendment to allow transgender men and women to stay in the military and continue to serve our country and keep us safe.

179,topic-id,1987,"Mr.Speaker, it is always an honor to be here on the House floor.  We passed appropriations bills. It is a rare thing to hear it coming from me, but the Appropriations Committee for the Republican majority here in the House of Representatives has actually done an extraordinary job this year. It hasn't been easy. They have spent a tremendous amount of hours taking votes, during which it was made particularly partisan.  It is just a shame when people will take votes just along party lines and not even reach out in the areas where there is mutual interest. But, as with any bill, there are things that could have been better. But our appropriators took some tough votes, and some of them tough politically, but, overall, they did a remarkable job and they are to be commended for the work they did.  We actually got our 12 appropriations bills passed in the I look forward to the day--it may be years away, months away, weeks away, days away--when the Senate is capable of passing 12 appropriations bills.  It is very important, too, that we note the agreement that President Trump reached. Widely reported, the President made a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck But whether it is one of the worst votes I have taken or not, I knew, number[[Page H7418]]one--Texas had been going through Hurricane Harvey, but Texas had planned for the future. And God bless the Texas Governor Greg Abbott has been a dear friend since we started as district judges together back in January of 1993. And I think the world of Governor Greg He is doing a superb job through the emergency situation that Hurricane Harvey has created in  Also, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick is a very good friend. I think the world of him. He has done a remarkable job leading there in Texas from the standpoint of being the head of the He's a very conservative man of principle. It is just a pleasure to have such able, competent, not just conservatives, but very smart people who are people of principle.  They created a rainy day fund. It has billions of dollars in it. Obviously, Harvey was definitely a rainy day.  But when we took this vote on getting money into the emergency, the FEMA, our emergency system, we were assured by people that I believed to be very honest that they really were out of money for That vote had to be taken to get money into our emergency system so they could help Florida prepare as Hurricane Irma approached.  Like I said, Texas had prepared for a rainy day as far beyond the extent of their preparation. But I knew we could haggle over emergency funding, we could haggle over the debt ceiling, we could haggle over a CR coming up, and Texas would be okay while we were debating for 2, 3, 4 weeks, whatever it took until we got agreement. But Florida did not have a rainy day fund. They needed help. Irma was approaching.  But the other thing that struck me about the need to get that vote done, give the President 90 days, was that we still have not changed the law to give Americans the help that so many tens or hundreds of millions needed. We have got over 300 million here in the country and, of course, there was bragging about the millions that got healthcare under  Well, that is a misnomer. It is a misstatement because the truth is that some people got health insurance, but there were millions of people that got--well, they lost the insurance. So all the statements about, ``If you like your insurance, you can keep it,'' those were lies. Those people making those statements have been now shown they knew they were lies at the time they were being made. The architect of ObamaCare knew that people would lose their insurance they liked; knew that they would lose doctors they liked.  The way ObamaCare was designed, it even gave huge incentives, financially, to the remaining big monopoly health insurance companies not to bring into their network hospitals like MD Anderson or Cleveland There were actually incentives built in ObamaCare to have health insurance companies not put chronic care facilities like cancer and heart disease in their network because that meant people that had those conditions would get that insurance because they had things like MD Anderson or Cleveland Clinic or Mayo, whatever it was, in network, and they didn't want them because that would be costly.  So it was a very subtle way ObamaCare was designed in order to encourage insurance companies to actually avoid giving people the doctors they had had before, the facilities they had had before and, in many cases, lifesaving and life-lengthening facilities.  So there are just so many people hurting. In August, as I went all over east Texas--from the very southeast end down in Sabine County to the very north end, up in northwest end, up in Wood County, to the northeast end, up in Harrison County, down to the southwest corner of my district, down below Diboll in Angelina County--people are hurting, and they are begging for Congress to keep its word.  We said: If you gave us the majority in the House and Senate, we would repeal  And, by golly, the American public gave us the majority in the House and Yes, President Obama was in the White House, but we got the majority in the House and And, holy smoke, we were able to get--it wasn't a total repeal, but, under reconciliation procedures, we were able to repeal most of ObamaCare in the House and in the Senate, and send it to the President's desk, where he vetoed it. Well, that wasn't a big surprise.  So Republicans were saying: You give us the House, the Senate majority, and the White House, then it is a no-brainer because then we have a President who will sign the bill that we passed when Obama was President, and this time the Republican President will surely sign it.  Well, not only do we know we have a Republican in the White House, but President Trump--God bless him--made clear: If you just send me that bill that you passed in the last Congress that Obama vetoed, I will sign it, and then we can work on a healthcare system where people can get the care they need.  Now, what has not been talked about in the alt-left media--some people call them the mainstream media. But the alt-left, mainstream media, whatever you want to call them, they have talked about all the millions of people that now have health insurance.  Most of those--it may be a few, but most of them have got That is not the most desirable insurance you can have.  And another thing that needs to be made clear: health insurance is not healthcare. Anyone in America here legally, illegally, criminal, non criminal, it doesn't matter, if you are in the United States and you have a problem, you can go to the emergency room.  I have been in emergency rooms with my immediate family members, including kids, in-laws. I mean, I have been there. And we wait in line behind people that may have a cold or a cut or a minor this or that. They have got healthcare.                              {time}  1315  And most of those people aren't going to pay anything, and they got the healthcare they needed. Now, they don't have health insurance, apparently, most of them that I have been in line behind, because you could hear the discussion as they go through filling out the forms with the hospital people. It would be far better if we had a better system of clinics for people like that so they didn't have to go tie up the most expensive healthcare there is in the emergency room. They could go to a clinic and get the things they need.  I was yanking a hook out of a catfish that my youngest daughter had caught some years back, and it is kind of embarrassing, a Member of Congress, and the hook had not set until it was well down in the catfish, so I was having a lot of trouble getting it out. And I got a long needle-nose pliers and I was pulling it out, and I just strained as hard as I could and, lo and behold, pulled the hook out and embedded it very deeply in my hand down at the base of the thumb.  People started freaking out. It was no big deal. I mean, I just had a hook buried about three-quarters of an inch or so in my thumb.  I went down for an emergency. I didn't want to. Somebody said: Look, we will take care of your daughter. You need to get a tetanus shot. When I found out the line was going to be about 2 hours before they could get around to messing with the hook that was embedded in my thumb, well, I went home and ended up using ice, and I eventually got it out myself.  But I know, even without one of my kids or relatives, just by myself, I have been there. I have sat there. I have listened to conversations. There is no question, health insurance is not healthcare.  People are still hurting, and they relied on our promise; and if we don't get the big part of ObamaCare repealed, at least at a minimum, and get a system in place that gets people back toward the kind of healthcare they once knew and loved--if we weren't part of the government, as an old judge, I know those lawsuits would be brought.  The allegation in the pleadings would be that a promise was made which lured someone in to act to their detriment based on those promises. The doctrine, legally, is called promissory estoppel. The judge could issue an order, if you win the case, and prevent someone from going back on their word after they made a promise on which another party relied to their detriment.  Unfortunately for the American public, when it is Congress, or, in particular, the Senate, and in particular a Republican Senator, or more, who makes an absolute repeated promise[[Page H7419]]over and over that they are going to do something if you elect them or reelect them and people rely on that, they vote them in and it turns out it is to their detriment because that Senator was not being honest in running for office, well, it is kind of a shame that you can't get a judge to come in and say: ``I am issuing an order under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. You will not be allowed to back down off of your promise. You will make good on your promise.''  When it is the government, you can't sue them and force that, because promissory estoppel does not apply in a government situation, not normally.  So what are we left with? Well, people can say, well, you know, wait until the next election. We will have to replace people. This is it. This is the chance. This is a generational chance. We promised people certain things we would do, and I was fully supportive of the promises that President Donald Trump made that helped him get elected. Particularly, he promised to repeal and replace For heaven's sake, we ought to be helping him in that.  I am very grateful. We had some difficult times there between some of us, particularly the House Freedom Caucus and the House leadership, but Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise, they came through. We worked together and we got an agreement that repealed most of ObamaCare, and we got it down to the  I have my friend from West Virginia, and I would be glad to yield to him.

This is such a critical promise we made about healthcare that, just like the Reid rule, when it is really, really important, we will set aside the 60-vote cloture rule so that we can get something done, whether it is a confirmation, whatever it is, that saves lives, helps  Well, if there was ever a bill that fit that situation, it would be one that helped save lives through repealing at least the biggest, worst parts of  Nonetheless, under that reconciliation procedure, we have until September 30 to get it done with 51 votes. I have got to say, earlier this summer--I have been here 12\1/2\ years. I have never seen a situation where the majority party in the Senate was calling those in the majority party in the House, including the Speaker and the leadership team, and calling those of us in the House Freedom Caucus, calling those in the Tuesday Group, and their one big question--I have never heard of this happening in American history--their big question was: Would you please promise us that, if we pass this bill in the Senate, you promise us you will not take up our bill and pass it as it is, because the only chance we have, we are told, of passing this bill in the Senate is if we know for sure it won't become law.  I have never heard of that happening before, but that is what happened this summer. From our Speaker on down, our different groups: Yes, we promise you we won't let that bad bill you're voting on become law. We will make sure it goes to conference, and we will get something a lot better than that that we send to the House and Senate to vote on.  It didn't get passed, and we have until September 30 to keep from being about as big a bunch of liars as has ever been in That is it.  I am very grateful--again, here, I appreciate the Appropriations Committee, and I will express appreciation here, now, for Speaker Paul Ryan, because he has agreed with me and some others about the kind of pressure we are going to put on when we get back the last week of September if the Senate has not passed their ObamaCare repeal bill. They have got to pass something or we can't get it to conference. We can't get the American public what they need.  Now, some of you have said: Well, if you had just passed that first bill the Republican leaders had put together. Well, I am not sure who put it together. It may have been the remaining health insurance companies and Big Pharma, from what I could tell, but it was not going to do anybody any good except the insurance companies and Big It was not going to help rank-and-file Americans the way we promised them we would help them.  There are some that say: Yeah, but, Louie, if you guys had just voted ``yes'' immediately on that bill, it would have gotten wind in the sails of the President and we would already have tax reform.  Well, I am here to tell you, Mr.Speaker, if we had passed that first bill, and when people saw their premiums continuing to shoot up and their deductibles continuing to shoot up and just these overwhelming prices, it would not have been wind in the sails of President It would have meant that people would have been so angry, a lot of Republicans would have stayed home and a lot of Democrats who voted for Donald Trump and Members of the Republican House and Senate, they would stay home or they would go out and vote for someone else, and the first order of business in January 2019 would probably have been, when we lost the majority, the impeachment of President It shouldn't be. It is not appropriate, but that is probably what would have happened if we had just jumped on that first bad bill.  We have got a good bill. We have still got a chance. We have got to get this done for the good of If we can't get this done, we have no business being in the majority. It just brings you to just throw up your hands: My goodness, what good is this?  I will also say, Mr.Speaker, the old adage is true: democracy ensures a people are governed no better than they deserve.  We have got too many Americans across this country that are not paying attention. They are like some friends I had in high school that said: Well, Louie, I don't care what the government does as long as they stay out of my business. Well, they have come to find out, if you don't care what the government does, they are not going to stay out of your business; they are going to take it over--your life, your business, everything.  People have got to get reengaged, pay attention, get out and vote, and we have got a chance to get it fixed. It is absolutely essential before September 30, at midnight, that we get something done to help the American people.  I am looking forward, if the Senate doesn't get a decent bill done, I want us to pass a sense of the House bill right here in the House that says it is the sense of the House that the Senate absolutely must pass a bill to give the American public the help they need with healthcare by repealing the worst parts of ObamaCare, at a minimum.[[Page H7420]]                                {time}  1330  And then follow the Speaker out here on the steps, and every one of us point to the Senate, and keep putting the pressure on. Keep on putting the pressure on until, hopefully, they do something.  But it may be that they get it done. We don't have to get into a battle of words and wits like that. The American public is expecting it. We promised it. We have got to get that done. In the meantime, I know there is a lot of discussion, a lot of calls today about, oh, gee, the President is talking about DACA this, and DACA that.  I have spent so many hours, so many nights, down on the border all night long, and I always heard the same things from my friends in the Border Every time anybody in Congress, or in the administration, starts talking about, well, we are working out a deal for amnesty for this, or to legalize that, then we get a huge surge in people coming across our southern border.  So I will continue to refuse to make statements about what I think about--should we agree to this; should we compromise on this legalization, this amnesty? Because every time we do, people get lured into the United  When that happens, there are always some that get drawn into sex slavery. Some get drawn into being mules and drug dealers for the drug cartels; and some--we have seen the video, we have seen the evidence--they die trying to get in.  We should not be luring people in. We need to secure the border. That includes building a wall where we need it. We don't need one in Big Bend National Park, in my opinion. If you can get across Big Bend National Park carrying all of the water you are going to need to get clear across there, then I want you in America, and I want you in our military. You are an extraordinary person. We don't need a wall through Big Bend National Park, most of it, anyway, but there are places we do.  We have got to secure the border. If you go down there, south of McAllen, the river is wide, flowing fast. If you just have people along the river--I have been there, I know. The coyotes will not bring people across if they see there is law enforcement that will stop them. The trouble was, during the Obama administration, they didn't stop them. They didn't even process them when they got across. I have seen it.  Why wouldn't you stop them? Why wouldn't you say: No, you are not coming on to U.land. Go back. Come in legally. We want you, but you have got to come in legally.  It is time to secure the border. President Trump is making great strides in that area. General Kelly--God bless him--he was making great strides when he was head of Homeland I was so thrilled he was there. I knew about the things he was doing, and I sure hope it continues, whoever replaces him. But we have got to secure our border, build a wall where it is needed.  We have got to repeal ObamaCare--the worst parts of it, anyway--and get people the help they need.  We have also got to give them the tax reform they need. As Art Laffer told me--he was asking me: Louie, you know, once we got that 30 percent tax cut in 1983, the third year of the President Reagan administration, do you know what the rate of growth was? Here we have been talking about 1.92 percent. It was 8 percent or over when they had the big tax cut.  People got jobs. They made more money than ever. It was incredible. It is time to get back to that kind of growth. It is time to get back to a healthcare system where we are not slaves to a health insurance company, and we are not slaves to the U.Government, where we have control of our doctor-patient relationship, and America can heal; it can grow; it can prosper.  We can bring back manufacturing jobs, which are so critical to this Nation, but we have got to get it done, and it has got to start this month.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgH7417.txt,1801,CONGRATULATING SHAWNEE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY,2017.0,14.0,September
324,topic-id,759,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Idaho and the chair of our subcommittee for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal  Transnational criminal gangs have declared war on the United Their tactics of intimidation and unspeakable mutilation and killing have permeated most every part of our country, including multiple instances in my own district. Most recently in Bedford County, Virginia, a young man was killed by alien members of MS-13.  The Department of Homeland Security reports an ever-growing number of criminal aliens joining international gangs, such as MS-13, which alone has over 10,000 members within our borders. Whether these criminals came to this country illegally as unaccompanied minors, adults, or have valid visas or even green cards, it is time to send the message that this behavior will simply not be tolerated.  Yet current immigration law includes no provision allowing for the removal of criminal gang members based on their membership in dangerous gangs or participation in gang activities. The result is unconscionable. ICE must sit on the sidelines and wait for known gang members to be arrested and convicted of specific offenses before removal proceedings may commence. Of course, with many victims and witnesses too petrified of retaliation against them and their families to cooperate with police, many gang members are never convicted of their crimes.  This legislation provides a crucial tool so that ICE can seek to remove alien gang members before they are able to extort businesses and murder innocent  In addition, this bill allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate organizations as criminal gangs utilizing the same transparent procedures used by the Secretary of State to designate foreign terrorist organizations. Finally, the bill ensures that criminal alien gang members cannot receive asylum and be released back onto our streets able to resume their criminal activities while being eligible for a vast array of Federal benefits.  Eradicating the death grip that transnational criminal alien gangs hold over many of our communities, especially immigrant communities, is an important piece of immigration reform. I am pleased that this bill, which stems from legislation that the House has approved in the past and which has been approved by the Judiciary Committee in multiple Congresses, is being considered today.  Now, I want to address the allegation that this bill targets priests, nuns, and garage band members. It is preposterous. This bill deliberately includes the longstanding Federal criminal offenses for alien smuggling as predicates for criminal gang activity. Coyotes and other criminal gangs make billions of dollars and put countless lives at risk through their alien smuggling activities.  As former U.Attorney David Iglesias, who emigrated to the United States from Latin America as a child, stated: ``Smuggling aliens across our borders is a dangerous business. All too often, people entrust their lives to smugglers, only to die in the broiling desert, or suffocate in the back of locked, airless trucks while the smugglers profit.''  ``These smuggling rings, which facilitate illegal entry into the United States and mercilessly exploit human beings for money, are a danger to immigrants and a threat to our national security. . . .''  The Democrats are engaging in a huge amount of obfuscation. In the past, House Democrats claimed the House passed legislation that would have strengthened Federal alien smuggling laws, would have had the effect of putting priests and nuns at risk of prosecution. The Democrats' clear implication was that these problems didn't exist under then-current law which remains current law.  Let me quote. Democrat members of the House Judiciary Committee, including John Conyers, Jerry Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, and Sheila Jackson Lee, they stated that the bill then under consideration goes far beyond increasing penalties for alien smuggling and jeopardizes the well-being of millions of Americans, neighbors, family members, faith institutions, and others who live and work with undocumented immigrants.  Former Speaker Pelosi, the current minority leader, stated: ``Under the guise of an expansive definition of smuggling,''--the bill--``it could make criminals out of Catholic priests and nuns, ministers, rabbis, and social service workers who provide assistance and acts of charity to those in need.''  The Democrats can't have it both ways. They can't argue one day that we can't change current law because that would result in putting priests and nuns at risk and argue the next day that, without any evidence, current law already puts them at risk. To add to the hypocrisy, the House Democrats supported an amendment which passed by voice vote.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

Of course, as in the sanctuary movement in the 1980s, when religious organizations engage in the smuggling of illegal aliens into the United States, they would be subject to prosecution, just as anyone else would be.  This bill is based upon the same precedent that has been passed through this House by voice vote dealing with human smuggling.

432,topic-id,4066,"Mr.President, is this a partisan approach to healthcare? I don't think so, if Missouri does better. There is a Democrat representing There is a Republican representing Here is the good news. We got the Republican on board. We appreciate the  Let me tell you how this works.  I like Massachusetts, I like Maryland, I like New York, I like California, but I don't like them that much to give them a bunch of money that the rest of us will not get.  If you live in Massachusetts, you don't get twice the Social Security or 50 percent more than if you live in How can this happen? ObamaCare, for whatever reason, favors four blue States against the rest of us.  Now, our friends in Mississippi, like South Carolina--we have a 31-percent African-American population in South Carolina--I think the highest in the country is Under this block grant approach, our friends in Mississippi get a 900-percent increase. How can that be? Well, that is money that was going someplace else other than  So what have we learned about ObamaCare? Rural poor, particularly African Americans, don't do so well. These four States--New York, California, Massachusetts, and Maryland, they have a lot of high wage earners.  We have some rural poor Missouri is a very wonderful State, with big cities and rural areas. How do you get more money? Well, under this formula, you are getting money that would have gone to the four other So 50 to 138 percent of poverty, and there are 45 million people in America who fall in that demographic. We can figure out how many live in We use that as the basis for the formula. You are not limited to spending the money on 50 to 138 percent of poverty, but that seems to be a fair way to redistribute the money. By 2026, the goal is, no matter where you live, Missouri, South Carolina, or California, you are going to get the same basic contribution from the Federal Government, regardless of where you[[Page S5735]]live. What a novel idea. That means places like Missouri and South Carolina do better.  To our friends in New York and California, we are giving you a long time to come down. To our friends in Massachusetts--and we have a great Republican Governor--I don't know how to explain the system where you get that much more money than everybody else. The goal is for you to have time to adjust, become more efficient, and Charlie Baker can do this.  Is it unfair for people like me, and Louisiana and Missouri, to say: No four States should get twice the amount of money for their population. I am trying to fix the problem in  Who should get the money is another question. Should some bureaucrat you will never meet in Washington be in charge of your healthcare or should somebody you actually know and vote for be in charge of your healthcare?  The block grant has a beautiful concept to it. The people we empower, you actually live with them, and you vote for them. If you don't like ObamaCare and, God knows, if you don't like BernieCare, whom do you complain to?  You can tell me: I don't like My premiums have gone up. My deductibles are going through the roof. You can complain to me all day long, and I will call somebody up who could care less what I think.  Now, if you have South Carolina responsible for the money instead of some bureaucrat in Washington, let me tell you what would happen. You would call me up, say: Hey, listen, this is not working for my family. I will find out who the statehouse person is, and we will call them together, and I guarantee you the Governor will listen to you because the Governor wants you to vote for him or her.  The bottom line is, the concept of who should be in charge of your healthcare is what this is all about.  Our friends on the other side deserve a great compliment. You know where you are going on healthcare. You have a plan to get there. I just don't agree with your plan, and I don't agree with where you are taking the country. But I will say this for you: You have a plan. I will say this to my Democratic colleagues: When it comes to your ideas, you fight like tigers.  I remember voting on ObamaCare on Christmas Eve, for God's sake, and we would have been here on Christmas Day if that is what it would have taken for Harry Reid to have passed  Now, on our side, have we done everything we can to repeal ObamaCare? They did everything they could to pass it.  President Trump is now behind this bill.  Thank you, Mr.I appreciate it very much. Without your voice, we cannot succeed. With your voice, we will be successful, but it is going to take more than a letter. Get on the phone. Start calling people. Obama did.  Senator McConnell was very good today at lunch, saying that this is a good idea and that we need to get behind it.  A CBO score is necessary. I am sure there are a lot of good people at the CBO, but if I had one place to go before I died, it would be at the CBO because you live a long time. We need to get the CBO to score things in a timely fashion.  To my friends at the CBO, this is a block grant. We are going to spend $1.2 trillion in the next decade--not more, not less. I didn't do that well in math, but I can figure out how much we are going to spend. I don't mean to be super critical, but we have not had scores on the Portman language or on the Cruz language in 8 weeks.  Let me tell my Republican friends, if you are upset about our not successfully repealing and replacing ObamaCare after 7 years, count me in. We tried, and we were one vote short. We have 17 days left. What would the Democrats have done? They would have been fighting. There would have been no August break. We would have been right here on this floor. We would have been arguing about their view of healthcare.  So I am encouraged that our leadership is going to push the CBO and get behind this bill. I am encouraged that the President came out for the bill. The Vice President, above all others in the administration, has been on the phone, calling We have over 15 Governors now on the Republican side who are saying: Give me the money. Give me the power. I can do a better job than some bureaucrat in  To the other Republican Governors, check it out for your States, but here is what I would ask you to consider. The money that you are getting from ObamaCare is unsustainable. It is a false promise. It is going to collapse. We can never match that system because that system is unsustainable, and it is going to fail.  What have I learned about Republican Governors? Most of them practice what they preach, and some of them have been hard to get on board. It is almost like crack cocaine, in terms of ObamaCare dollars.  I am telling you right now, Republican Governors and Democratic Governors, that this system is going to collapse in There is not enough money to keep it afloat, and I am not going to spend good money after bad. This is a chance for you, at the State level, to have control over funds and for us to be as flexible as we possibly can be in our designing systems that make sense for your If California wants to go to single-payer healthcare, it can. If it wants to reimpose the employer mandate and the individual mandate, it can. We will repeal the individual mandate and the employer mandate for the country at large, but if you want to put it back in place, you can.  Here is the good news. California cannot take the rest of us down the tubes with them, and we will have the debate in California about what works and what does not.  Give South Carolina, Louisiana, and Missouri the space they need to design healthcare based on their individual demographics. You cannot spend the money on football stadiums. You have to spend it on healthcare. You have to take care of people who are sick. There are guardrails around this block grant, but innovation will flourish.  Under ObamaCare, where is the incentive to be innovative? All you need to do is print more money. Under BernieCare, there is zero incentive to be creative. Just tax the rich. This is what happens. We go from four States getting 30-something percent of the money and representing 20 percent of the population to where, basically, everybody gets the same.  Let's talk about Bernie Sanders, who is a good man with a good heart, is an avowed socialist. He is the most honest guy in this building. If you left it up to Bernie, we would have a rowboat for a Navy, a gun for the Army, a prop plane for the Air Force, and everything else would be spent on entitlements. Most of us are not in that camp.  As to Medicaid, it is a program for low-income Americans to help them with their healthcare. There is a State match. Right now, we are spending almost $400 billion on By 2027, we are going to be spending over $650 billion. That is more than we spend on the military right now--with no end in sight.  So we do two things in this bill. We tell the States that we are going to give them more flexibility. This is what we spend on the military--$549 billion under sequestration. I hope that number goes up, but, by 2027, we are going to spend more money on Medicaid, let alone Medicare, than we do on the military. That is just unsustainable.  So what do we do?  We keep Medicaid in place as it is today. We try to give more flexibility because Indiana was a good example of what can happen if you give States the flexibility to help poor people. The one thing about Medicaid that I do not like is that, if you get a headache, you can ride to the emergency room, and we will pay a big Medicaid bill. I want to put Medicaid people into managed care. I want them to have some ownership over their healthcare. If you smoke, then that is something that ought to be considered in terms of cost. I like copayments. I want to treat fairly the people who are low-income and poor, but all of us need to be responsible for our healthcare.  Rather than having a Medicaid Program that just writes checks no matter what the outcomes are, we are going to, in year 8, begin to slow down the growth of It grows faster than medical inflation. Medical inflation is what it costs for you and your[[Page S5736]]family. Medicaid is way beyond that. Why? Because it is inefficient. We have proven at the State level that you can get a better bang for your buck from  The bottom line is that the first block grant begins to slow the growth of Medicaid to make it affordable for the rest of us and incentivize innovation in year 8.  If we do not do that, here is what will happen to the country. By 2038, all of the tax money that you send to Washington will go to pay the interest on the debt, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social There will not be one penny for the Department of Education or the Department of That is how quickly these programs are growing.  So we do two good things. We put Medicaid on a more sustainable path because it is an important program, and we allow flexibility in order to get better outcomes for the taxpayer and the patient. What a novel idea.  The second block grant is money that would have been spent by a bureaucrat in Under the first Republican proposal, you would get a refundable tax credit to go out and try to buy insurance somewhere, and we would give insurance companies money so that they would not collapse on the ObamaCare exchanges.  Instead of giving a refundable tax credit to an individual to buy a product that is going to go away because ObamaCare will not work and instead of giving a bunch of money to the insurance companies to prop them up, we are going to take that same amount of money and give it back to the States so that, by 2026, they will all get the same basic contribution.  Now, what did we do?  We repealed the individual mandate and the employer mandate. That is $250 billion in savings. The States can reimpose it if they would like. That is up to the We repealed the medical device tax because that hurts innovation. We left the other ObamaCare taxes in place. There is no more taking from the poor and giving to the rich. I wish that we would not have to do that, but we need the money to transition in a fair and sound way to a State-centric system.  To my friends on the other side, we leave the taxes in place. We just give the money to somebody else. It is called State control, local control, not Washington-based healthcare. We do it in a way in which, basically, everybody gets the same contribution from the Federal What a novel idea.  Now, to President Trump, without you, we cannot do this. Your pen will be the one that signs the law if we can ever get it to your desk. You said today that you would veto  Let me tell everybody in America not to worry. Single-payer healthcare will never get through the Republican-controlled House, and we have the majority in the  Mr.President, we are not going to need you to veto single-payer healthcare. What we need you to do is to put in place a new system to stop the march toward single-payer healthcare because, if we do not change where we are going, the Federal Government is going to own it all from cradle to grave. On your watch, you can stop that.  Once we get the money and the power out of Washington, that will be the end of single-payer healthcare. Once people know that they have somebody to respond to their needs at the State level versus some bureaucrat they will never meet, there will be no going back to Washington-based healthcare.  President Trump, you have the chance in your first term to set us on a new path: healthcare that is closer to the patient, money based not on where you live but parity, and innovation versus bureaucracy. What a legacy it would be. For that to happen--and I know you are busy with hurricanes and North Korea--you are going to have to get on the phone, and you are going to have to help us sell this. I believe you will, and I know you can, and I am asking you to do it.  To Senator McConnell, thank you for what you said today. Thank you for being willing to push this forward.  To my colleagues on this side, there are three options left for America: propping up ObamaCare, which will never work; BernieCare, which is full-blown single-payer healthcare; or this block grant approach.  I ask this question: Who are we, and what do we believe as Republicans? Our Democratic friends are pretty clear on who they are and what they believe when it comes to healthcare.  Here is what I believe. Send the money home. Send the money back to where the patient lives. Put it in the hands of doctors and hospitals in the communities and make sure that the people in the State are responsive to the needs of the individuals in that Replace a bureaucrat with an elected official. You will improve quality, and outcomes will be better, and it will be more fiscally sustainable.  At the end of the day, that Governor, whoever he or she might be, who can figure out quality healthcare in a sustainable fashion, will not only get reelected, but other people will copy what he does. If we leave the money and power here, there is never going to be any innovation. It is always going to be more money. Single-payer healthcare only works with a printing press--with unlimited dollars. Just keep printing the money. A block grant will bring out the best in It will create better outcomes for patients, and it will take us off the path of becoming Greece, because this is where we are headed.  Senator Cassidy was a doctor in a low-income, nonprofit hospital. He knows more about this than I could ever hope to learn. There is a reason that I did not go to medical school. I could not get in. I just cannot tell you how impressed I have been with Bill Cassidy's understanding of how healthcare works for average, everyday working people. He has dedicated his life to that segment of the population.  Rick There would be no Graham, Cassidy, Heller, Johnson without Rick said: Lindsey, we did this with welfare reform. They said that we could not do it, but we block-granted the money and unleashed innovation at the State level, and not one dime of extra spending has occurred since 1996 because we were generous in the beginning. The Governors figured it out. It was a better way of dealing with the welfare population.  I had a bill to opt out of ObamaCare, and Rick said: Why don't you just do a block grant like we did with welfare reform. So, when you look at it, it is such an elegant, fair, commonsense solution to a complicated problem.  Dean Dean Heller is in the fight of his political life. A lot of people around here--and I understand it; I am included sometimes--just wish hard problems would go away. This is a tough business to be in. Dean was told by all of the experts--and he said this today--to just lay low. Do not get your fingerprints on this healthcare debate. There are no winners. Healthcare is too complicated. Just stay away from this fight. Lay low.  Dean told us today in the conference: I didn't get elected to lay low. If we don't now get healthcare right, all of us are going to pay later. So Dean Heller, who is in one of the most competitive seats in the country, said: Sign me up.  Nevada gets 30 percent more money under this formula. It gets more control than ObamaCare would ever give them. Dean Heller believes that Medicaid is worth saving and that this is a way to save it. With the second block grant, 20 percent can be used to help traditional  The bottom line is that Dean Heller stood up today and said: Nobody in this conference has a tougher race than I do.

Mike, thank you for working with us to make this as flexible as possible.  Senator Lee has really driven this very hard in order to give as much flexibility to the State level as possible.  Thank you. Your Governor has been just absolutely awesome.  Asa Hutchinson in Arkansas stepped up. Our good friend Governor Bryant in Mississippi is all in. I could go on and on and on.  I know John McCain likes the concept of the block grant. John McCain wants to reform healthcare. He knows what happens to Arizona under ObamaCare, and this is our last, best chance to stop what I think is a march toward single-payer healthcare. I hope we can find a way to get our friends in Arizona at the State level on board because ObamaCare is failing your If we don't find a replacement--and I think this is a great replacement for the people of Arizona--everything is going to collapse.

I don't think I have worked on anything more important than this. It has been fun. It has been frustrating.

To my Republican friends: They know what they are for. Do we know what we are for? They are committed to their causes. Are we equally committed to ours? I hope the answer is yes. And if we can get 50 of us here, I will make a prediction. A few of them over there are going to sign on because their State does so well. There are some Democratic Senators who are my dear friends who are going to have to turn down more money and more power for their State to keep the status quo.  I can tell my colleagues this about bipartisanship. I am a pretty big believer in bipartisanship. I have taken my fair share of beatings--working on immigration; I believe climate change is real. I have done deals, and I understand that you have to work together. But our friends on the other side are never going to vote for anything that fundamentally repeals and replaces They just can't do it. They are not bad people; they are just locked into a different way. And their way is that the government makes these decisions, not the private sector. My belief is that healthcare closer to the patient, like government, is better healthcare.  This is the last, best chance we will have to stop the march toward single-payer healthcare.

61,topic-id,913,"Mr.President, I rise today to oppose the latest disastrous iteration of TrumpCare, the Graham-Cassidy proposal.  It is disappointing that we are here once again. In July, Granite Staters breathed a sigh of relief when the Senate defeated a proposal that would have raised healthcare costs and stripped health insurance away from millions. When that bill failed, I was hopeful that we would move forward on a bipartisan process to make key improvements to the Affordable Care That is exactly the process we have started on in the HELP Committee, focusing on bipartisan solutions to stabilize the health insurance market.  Now, in direct conflict to this important bipartisan work, some of our colleagues are making one last-ditch effort to pass partisan legislation. Make no mistake, Graham-Cassidy is more of the same, and it is every bit as dangerous as the TrumpCare plans we saw this summer, if not worse.  Granite Staters and all Americans should be concerned if this bill is rushed into law. My colleagues are moving so quickly to try to get this bill passed that the CBO says it will not be able to score it by September 30, but it is clear that this bill would make things worse for most  If you have a preexisting condition, including cancer, asthma, or diabetes, you could once again be discriminated against with higher costs that make health coverage unaffordable. This bill would end Medicaid expansion, a program that Democrats and Republicans in New Hampshire came together on to pass and reauthorize. Medicaid expansion has provided quality, affordable health insurance coverage to over 50,000 Granite Experts on the frontlines of New Hampshire's heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis say it is the one tool we have to combat this epidemic. Ending Medicaid expansion would pull the rug out from under those who need its coverage. It would put thousands of people at risk.  In addition, Graham-Cassidy would cut and cap the Medicaid Those words, ``cut'' and ``cap,'' are really just code for massive cuts to the funding that States receive, including New Hampshire, losing hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal funding for Medicaid over the next decade. This cut would force States to choose between slashing benefits, reducing the number of people who can get care, or, in some cases, having to do both. It would impact some of our most vulnerable citizens--children, seniors who need in-home care or nursing home care, and people who experience disabilities.  Graham-Cassidy would allow States to get rid of important protections in current law--protections called essential health benefits, which make sure that all insurers cover things like maternity care, prescription drugs, and substance use disorder services.  Finally, this bill would continue Republican efforts to roll back women's access to healthcare by defunding Planned Parenthood, which provides critical primary and preventive healthcare services to thousands of New Hampshire women.  As we continue to debate the future of our Nation's healthcare system, we have to understand how things would actually play out on the ground for the people we are trying to serve. Over the course of this year, the people of New Hampshire have laid themselves bare and shared story after story of how they would be impacted by these dangerous attempts to roll back access to healthcare.  It is people like the Keene resident who has a preexisting condition and had health insurance through his job, but when he lost that job, he was able to start a new successful small business all because he knew he would be able to get quality health insurance under the Affordable Care It is people such as the Granite Staters who experience disability but are able to live independently in their home and community as a result of the personal care services they receive through Medicaid and people like the mom from Rochester who is benefiting from substance use disorder services that are included in Medicaid expansion and would be taken away under this bill.  It really shouldn't be necessary for people to have to come forward and share their most personal stories, all in an attempt to get their elected representatives to work together in a bipartisan manner and not take coverage away. We actually should be able to do that in the U.Senate on our own.  Now, just as we are starting to work on a bipartisan basis, as our constituents asked us to do, the American people are faced with another harmful, partisan TrumpCare bill that will destabilize our healthcare system, drive up premiums, and make care less affordable.  We must come together to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act and ensure that every American has meaningful, truly affordable access to the type of care each of us would choose for our own family. We must reject this proposal and continue moving forward on the bipartisan path we have started on in the HELP  I am going to keep standing with my Democratic colleagues, and I urge the people of New Hampshire and all Americans to continue to speak out and to share their stories. Together, we will, once again, defeat this attempt to undermine the healthcare of millions of Americans, and we will make clear that in the United States of America, all of our people must be able to get quality, affordable care.

Pete was a true legislator, the kind we just don't see all that often any longer. He was at his best when we were here getting things done--and often we were getting things done because of his efforts. He will be sorely missed by those of us who had the distinct privilege of serving alongside him.  Pete's life was a testament to the American Dream; born to immigrant parents, Pete grew up working in his father's store before going on to earn his degree in education. Later, he would teach math at a local junior high school, before making his way into city politics and, from there, join the Senate in 1972. Some will no doubt recall that he was the first Republican elected as Senator of New Mexico in nearly 40 years, but most will remember that he always put the people of his State and his Nation ahead of partisan interests.  While serving in the Senate, Pete fulfilled his charge with diligence, passion, and decorum. His time here still serves as an example to many of us. Pete was regularly willing to reach across the aisle, always willing to take the first step, and never one to shrink from an opportunity presented, whether difficult or not. Pete's efforts to bring the Federal budget under control were especially admirable, and his leadership was crucial in achieving the balanced budget of 1997. That has proven a rare accomplishment. His work as an advocate for the mentally ill showed[[Page S5739]]his deep levels of compassion, and his efforts helped create a more just and equitable society for all.  Even after he retired, Pete, as was his way, refused to rest. He continued to promote bipartisan solutions in Washington and continued to remind each of us of our duties to the American people.

That was in 1994, Mr.We don't have much to show for that effort.  In January, in the State of the Union, 2002, President Bush 43 described North Korea as part of the axis of evil, including Iraq and Clearly, the North Koreans were not complying with Mr.Clinton's agreement, but the post-9/11 world of the United States had our government, our diplomacy, our military, our sanctions regime focused on the Middle East, focused on Afghanistan, Iraq, and, indeed,  And then you come to the period of President Obama, where his strategy with North Korea was one of strategic patience.

So, Mr.Speaker, after over two decades, it was time for a change.

Mr.Speaker, I want to congratulate our Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Haley, for not one, but two 15-0 votes in the U.Security Council on ratcheting up the pressure on sanctions. Those are important.  But the most important thing is, Mr.Speaker, whether it is secondary sanctions and sanctions in the United States put on others by the U.alone or multilateral sanctions imposed by the U.Security Council, the secret is enforcement. We must have enforcement.  When you look back over this two-decade period, you can't really come to the conclusion that we have ever seriously sanctioned the rogue government in North Korea, not to the extent that we have done with Iran, not to the extent that we did with Iraq, the two other partners in President Bush's axis of evil.  So the time is now, Mr.Speaker, to use all of our skills and abilities: diplomatically, as led by Secretary Tillerson; economically, as led by Secretary Mnuchin and our worthy, great leader, our Ambassador at the United Nations; and in military strategy with our allies, under Secretary We have the support of the world now, Mr.Speaker, and this is no time to not bear down and get that kind of enforcement.

95,topic-id,1104,"Madam President, 2 months ago, millions of Americans rose up and defeated In doing so, we reaffirmed that, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, healthcare is a right and not a privilege that is reserved only for those who can afford it.  The President and the Republican Party believe the opposite. To them, healthcare is just another commodity to be bought and sold, but we all know that this is not like buying a new car or a big screen The Republican position shows no heart, no care, and no compassion. It is the exact opposite of what so many of you showed me when I was diagnosed with kidney cancer.  Although we successfully defeated TrumpCare in July, we face fresh assaults to deny every American's right to healthcare, but it does not have to be this way. In July, so many of us were moved by Senator John McCain's impassioned plea for the Senate to return to regular order in order to debate how to strengthen our healthcare system on a bipartisan basis. Since then, Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray have worked to build consensus for a bill that would strengthen insurance markets and reduce out-of-pocket costs for consumers. They have done this the right way--through committee hearings, bipartisan meetings, and careful deliberation.  Instead of embracing and endorsing this effort, the President and the majority leader have now chosen to double down on their obsession with depriving healthcare to millions of people across the country through the Graham-Cassidy bill. Let me be clear. This bill is not a compromise. It is not a new and better idea for delivering healthcare in this country. It is just a new version of TrumpCare and, I might say, an even worse proposal than the one we defeated in  The details matter. This version of TrumpCare eliminates the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, and that threatens the coverage for more than 110,000 Hawaii residents who are now receiving such coverage. There are millions all across the country who now get healthcare coverage thanks to Medicaid expansion in their  This bill establishes a healthcare block grant, including a per capita cap on Medicaid spending that would severely limit Federal funding for healthcare--funds that States rely upon. Republicans, including the cosponsors of this bill, argue that this approach would provide more local control over healthcare. This, however, is what we in Hawaii call ``shibai''--or Local control through a block grant is just an excuse that Conservatives and Republicans use as a pretext to make deep cuts to programs that Americans depend upon. You see them resorting to block-granting everywhere--from education to healthcare.  A new study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reveals the cost of this latest version of TrumpCare firsthand. Under the proposal, Hawaii would lose $659 million in Federal funding for Medicaid over 10 years--part of some $80 billion in cuts across the country. This is a lot of money for Hawaii to lose--money that is being put to great use across our  Last month, I visited the Bay Clinic in Hilo, on the Big Island, where the Medicaid expansion under the ACA has improved health outcomes in poor[[Page S5785]]rural communities across that island. Bay Clinic is the primary healthcare provider to 6 of the 10 poorest ZIP Codes in the entire State of Hawaii, where many residents went years without having health coverage. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the Bay Clinic has successfully enrolled thousands more people in Medicaid and decreased the number of uninsured patients who have gone through their doors. It is astounding what the numbers show.  The number of patients who have gone through their doors has been cut from 29 percent in 2010 to only 10 percent in 2015. That is how many more people on the island of Hawaii are able to get healthcare coverage. Over that same time period, the Bay Clinic has seen an almost 20-percent increase in the number of patients it has served every year.  In the years following the passage of the ACA, the Bay Clinic and community health centers all across Hawaii have hired more doctors and nurses, and they have expanded the types of services that they provide. The Bay Clinic, for example, has expanded its Mobile Health Unit, by which doctors go to rural communities, such as in Keaau, where residents would otherwise not have access to primary care providers.  This program and others like it in Hawaii and across the country face an imminent threat from this newest version of Unfortunately, this bill's devastating cuts to Medicaid are only part of what makes it so mean and so dangerous.  It eliminates all premium subsidies that allow lower income Americans to afford coverage, and it eliminates cost-sharing subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. These are the very issues relating to the Affordable Care Act that Chairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking Member Patty Murray are addressing through regular order--how to provide healthcare for more people in our country.  The Graham-Cassidy bill creates a process by which States can receive waivers to roll back essential health benefits and eliminate important consumer protections, like guaranteed coverage for millions of Americans who are living with preexisting conditions--people like me.  I have said many times on the floor of the Senate that we are all only one diagnosis away from a major illness. Every day, 6,540 people are diagnosed with cancer in our country. There are 4,109 who are diagnosed with diabetes. There are 1,309 who are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease every day in this country. We are all one diagnosis away from a major illness. These are people like me--many of them--going about their business when, wham, suddenly, you get a devastating diagnosis. Not all of these people will have health insurance, and under this version of TrumpCare, even more of them will not have access to it.  When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer, I had insurance. Instead of worrying about how to pay for my treatment, I could focus on fighting my illness. No one facing cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or any other chronic or life-threatening medical condition--or, I should say, any kind of circumstance in which one needs to have access to a healthcare provider--should have to worry about whether one can afford the care that might, one day, save one's life--not in the richest country in the world, not where healthcare should be a right and not a privilege.

However, I fear the committee report directive in question will slow future innovation, lead to a more complex and burdensome regulatory scheme, and make it less likely that our military personnel will be able to access cutting-edge medicines in the future, while doing nothing meaningful to address healthcare costs. The DOD relies on its partnerships with industry to develop vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics that target unique threats faced by our warfighters during operations in theater. As such, the biopharmaceutical industry plays a critical role in enhancing our military and civilian defenses against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats.  Federal agencies, such as the DOD, already face significant challenges in attracting top drug and vaccine developers as partners to develop lifesaving medical countermeasures necessary to protect the warfighter. These challenges include low procurement quantities, high regulatory risk, complex Federal contracting regulations, and inconsistency in funding, among others. The added risk of diluting or compromising intellectual property protections as a means of price control will not only fail to meet its objective, but will serve as an additional deterrent to private sector development of critical medical capabilities offered by  Furthermore, companies who partner with the Federal Government rely heavily on the strength and scope of their intellectual property to generate investment to take their technologies to commercialization. The report language invokes the Bayh-Dole Act, the purpose of which is to encourage the prompt commercialization of federally funded patents. Prior to Bayh-Dole, collaborations between private industry and public entities were rare. The act has fostered a delicate balance of collaborations between Federal agencies, public research institutions, and private industry that have resulted in the commercialization of inventions for use by all Americans, especially in the area of medical countermeasures for our servicemen and women.  In the drug development context, Federal funding under the Bayh-Dole Act has facilitated the discovery of 153 marketed drugs and vaccines over the last 30 years. The act included the creation of so-called march-in rights to allow agencies to compel additional licensing if good-faith efforts toward development are not being made. Agencies can also march-in if a licensee cannot produce enough products to meet a national emergency. It is these provisions to which the report language refers and I believe inappropriately expands the statute's reach to include Federal price controls and increases the scope of the government's authority.  Nothing in the Bayh-Dole Act, whether in march-in rights or otherwise, provides a Federal agency the authority to influence the price of a commercialized invention. Regulating the price of commercialized intellectual property was never intended by Congress when passing the Bayh-Dole Act,[[Page S5784]]as evident by the Senate and House reports. Congress contemplated the use of march-in rights only ``when the invention is not being used.'' Further, Senators Bayh and Dole have subsequently explained that the absence of any reference to reasonable pricing in the statute was intentional. As Senator Bayh--the author of and driving force behind the Bayh-Dole Act--has said: Any attempt to use the Bayh-Dole Act to support price controls is a ``flagrant misrepresent[ation]'' of Congress's purpose in enacting the statute. Consistent with this position, a Federal agency has never invoked the Bayh-Dole Act to interfere with the price of a commercialized invention. I am aware of petitions to both the NIH and the DOD requesting march-in rights be exercised on the basis of pricing, and in all of those cases, the petitions were rejected in accordance with the law.  The committee report language seeks to authorize something that the statute itself does not. I believe the item of special interest does not accurately reflect the current intent of Congress with respect to the Bayh-Dole Act, and I encourage the DOD to continue to rely on the existing interpretation of Bayh-Dole law when addressing these matters.

58,topic-id,2696,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about a topic that is consuming much attention--our efforts to improve healthcare for Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, Americans with preexisting conditions faced serious barriers. Since 2010, the rate of uninsured Americans has declined to a historic low, with 20 million more Americans--the combined population of 16 or 17 States--getting access to health insurance coverage.  Over 410,000 Virginians have received care through individual marketplaces just last year. An additional 400,000 would be eligible to receive Medicaid if Virginia ever chooses to expand it. Since being put on the HELP Committee or being notified I would be put on it in December, I visited community health centers, medical schools, behavioral treatment centers, nursing programs all across Virginia talking to people about their healthcare needs. I am committed to working together with my colleagues to improve the healthcare of Virginians and There is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  After there was the failure of an effort in late July or early August to pass a partisan repeal and replacement of ObamaCare using the budget reconciliation process, the success of which would have taken health insurance away from 20 million Americans, I am disappointed that we haven't learned the lesson about the right way to do this and are apparently poised to explore yet again doing it the wrong way.[[Page S5843]]  There is a proposal on the table that is designated the Graham-Cassidy proposal, and it is just as threatening as the ACA repeal we voted on just 2 months ago. It restructures traditional Medicaid funding using per capita caps and block grants. The core of this bill is an effort to dramatically go after, restructure, and shrink Medicaid, which is critical to so many people.  It ends protections for people with preexisting conditions by allowing States to essentially rewrite essential health benefits. It would eliminate Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act subsidies and replace them with a block grant that would be insufficient to cover the needs of Even that block grant funding would end after 2026--as if the need to help low- and moderate-income people afford coverage would dramatically disappear overnight.  The proposal is new and is newly on the floor. There isn't a full CBO analysis of it, but initial indication has led groups like the American Medical Association and the AARP to come out against it. They are worried it will leave insurance out of the reach of millions of In Virginia alone, more than 301,000 marketplace enrollees would have their tax credits to help them afford insurance jeopardized.  What would it mean for the healthcare system? We are not completely sure. At least on the earlier versions we voted on, we had CBO scores telling us how many millions might lose insurance. There seems to be a desire to rush this through prior to a full CBO analysis. I can't understand why. But we do know it would be devastating to those on Sixty percent of those on Medicaid in Virginia are children, but the majority of spending on Medicaid is for our parents and grandparents, the elderly, and folks with disabilities.  I was just in Bristol, VA, on the Virginia-Tennessee border this weekend. I heard very palpable requests for the need for better healthcare, especially in rural  Here is what we know about the Graham-Cassidy proposal, at least based on the analysis of it thus far by my State healthcare officials. We will see a $1.2 billion cut in Medicaid under this plan over the next number of years, and the cuts would impact families like those I visit as I travel around  I recently had a roundtable in Northern Virginia with parents of children with severe disabilities who, though they have disabilities, are doing some remarkable things because they receive support from Medicare for assistive technologies and in school programs.  A mother, Corinne, told me about her son Dylan has a very rare neuromuscular condition SMARD--spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress. He has a tracheostomy tube and relies on a ventilator to breathe. He also gets all of his nutrition through a G-tube. He requires in-home skilled nursing services, and he also requires a nurse to attend school with him. But he goes to public school, and he is a successful student because Medicaid funding enables him to go. Medicaid helps reimburse the school system for the services they provide him.  ``For us, affordable and quality healthcare means that Dylan can lead a fairly normal life despite his medical issues.'' That is what his mom said. He can lead a fairly normal life on a ventilator with a tracheostomy tube in a wheelchair with a nurse. He can lead a fairly normal life, despite his medical issues. He can live at home, go to school, and participate in activities any kid his age enjoys. Without the assistance of Medicaid, he wouldn't be able to do those things.  Reducing Medicaid spending would limit States' abilities to provide waivers for medically complex kids. The mother adds that ``the possible return of lifetime caps and limitations on preexisting conditions would be devastating.''  I also met with a mother, Amy, from Richmond, who has a son, Medicaid covers her son's care, therapy, and medical supplies. Medicaid helps her son have the best quality of life possible and helps him with the prospect she prays deeply for--that one day, despite his medical condition, he can live independently as a productive adult. The Graham-Cassidy funding cuts to Medicaid could take away this protection for countless Virginians, especially these children.  Here is what I ask for: Why don't we have an open process to truly debate improvements to our healthcare system, instead of a rushed, closed, secretive process that threatens mothers like Amy and children like Declan?  After the efforts last summer, I hoped that the colleagues in the world's greatest deliberative body would stop a secretive, harmful rush and, instead, embrace dialogue, hearing from experts and witnesses as we would improve healthcare, attempting to stabilize the individual marketplace, lower premiums, and expand care rather than reduce it.  We gave a standing ovation on the floor of the Senate in late July when our colleague, Senator John McCain, returned from a very difficult diagnosis of brain cancer. We gave him a standing ovation after he spoke to us, and here is what he said. He talked about the fact that we had a challenge on healthcare. He talked about the skinny repeal bill that was on the floor of the He said:       We've tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind      closed doors in consultation with the administration, then      springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them      it's better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and      force it past a unified opposition. I don't think that is      going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn't.       Why don't we try the old way of legislating in the Senate,      the way our rules and customs encourage us to act. If this      process ends in failure, which seems likely, then let's      return to regular order.       Let the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee      under Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray hold      hearings, try to report a bill out of committee with      contributions from both sides. Then bring it to the floor for      amendment and debate, and see if we can pass something that      will be imperfect, full of compromises, and not very pleasing      to implacable partisans on either side, but that might      provide workable solutions to problems Americans are      struggling with today.  To my great satisfaction, after the skinny repeal bill went down--and this body decided that it didn't want to precipitously take healthcare away from 20 million people--that is the course that this body embraced. It is what our heroic colleague suggested that we embrace. The HELP Committee--which, as a member of this, I am very aware had refused to hold a hearing on any of the proposals in the House or in the Senate around the repeal of ObamaCare--decided finally to do what the HELP Committee should do. The ``H'' is for ``Health.'' To pass a bill reorienting one-sixth of the American economy around the most important expenditure that anybody ever makes in their life without letting the HELP Committee hear from it was foolish to start with.  So now we have embraced doing it the right way. Under the leadership of Senator Alexander and Senator Murray, we have had four robust bipartisan hearings. We invited Governors to come from around the country. They had to turn their schedules topsy-turvy to do it--insurance regulators, insurance executives, patients, doctors, hospitals. There were four hearings, each with multiple witnesses. We turned their schedules topsy-turvy. We had them here. We had coffees before each hearing and invited all Members of the Senate, not just those on the HELP Committee, to interact and hear from these experts. We have gotten advice from them on what we need to do to stabilize the individual insurance market and what we can do in the long term to make healthcare better for everyone. We should take advantage of those recommendations.  When the fourth hearing was completed last week, the chairman of the Committee, Senator Alexander, and the ranking member, Senator Murray, with the support of this very diverse committee--left, right and center, Democrats and Republicans--have embarked on a bipartisan process to find, after a full and transparent airing of the issues, a way to stabilize the individual insurance market. We are on the verge of doing that.  Yet what we are told is, instead of going through our committee process and hearing and airing it before the public, now there is a new bill that has just recently come out with no full CBO score. The idea is to force that through, with no CBO score, with no full committee process that would enable us to hear from witnesses, with no[[Page S5844]]opportunity for members of any of the committees--Finance or HELP--to offer amendments, with no meaningful floor debate, and with no opportunity for amendments on the Senate floor.  Why did we give Senator McCain a standing ovation just 6 weeks ago when he suggested that when it comes to something as important as healthcare, we should treat it with seriousness, so we can get it right and not rush and get it wrong?  I stand here--and I hope I am on my feet a good bit more between now and the end of the month--to ask this question: Why backslide? Why go backward when we had embraced a process of bipartisan discussion?  I am fully aware that as a Member of the minority party, I have no power except my ability to convince Republicans that I actually have a good idea. But a one-party process on the floor that tries to end run the relevant HELP Committee is guaranteed to fail. It might pass, but it is guaranteed to fail because it is guaranteed to hurt people. It is guaranteed to have some consequences that are harmful and known and other consequences that are harmful and unknown because it has been rushed, and it hasn't been done in the view of the public with the ability to fully listen to them. Just think about it this way: What does it say about your commitment to your legislation if you are not willing to have it subjected to a normal review by the committees that have jurisdiction over it?  The Graham-Cassidy bill has some provisions in it that are relevant to the Finance Committee's jurisdiction, but Finance is apparently not going to do a markup of the bill, and they are not really going to hear from experts about the bill.  There are other provisions in Graham-Cassidy dealing with essential benefits that are squarely within the jurisdiction of the HELP Committee, but the HELP Committee isn't going to have a hearing either. So in spite of the good recommendation we were given by our senior colleague who was just on the floor--who was characteristically here to talk in kind words about the public service of someone who has worked with his staff for 30 years--we gave him a standing ovation, and we are prepared to violate everything that he just suggested we do.  As I conclude, I will just say this. This isn't about healthcare. Healthcare is important enough. No one ever spends a dollar on anything that is more important than their health. It is the most important thing that anyone ever spends a dollar on--health, my health, the health of my family. I think we can all share that. Nothing is more important. It also happens to be one of the largest sectors of the American economy. Between 15 and 20 percent of America's GDP is healthcare. This is a very important issue. If you are trying to reorient one-sixth or one-fifth of the economy, if you are touching the expenditure of priority that is the single most important priority in anyone's life, that is important enough.  I would argue, in closing, that there is something I think is equally important; that is, this body. We celebrated the 230th anniversary of the Constitution this past James Madison and others in Philadelphia, tried to figure out how this government should work. They made a very unusual decision that would be different from the decisions that are made in many countries; that is, they put the legislative branch first.  There are three coequal branches. In most societies, the executive is first, but not here--first among equals. We are meant to really play an A game. We are really meant not to be an article-II-and-a-half branch reacting to a Presidential tweet or encouragement; we are supposed to be an article I branch.  In the legislative branch in article I, the Senate is given a very particular role. We are called the world's greatest deliberative body. We are the saucer into which the partisan heat of the day is poured and allowed to cool, so the decisions made in the Senate are supposed to be more careful and more deliberate.  This is a great body that has been sadly hobbled by partisan gridlock, and we have not achieved what the Senate should achieve. We learn in math as we grow up that the whole is equal to the sum of the parts, but what you find in life is that often the math doesn't work out. Sometimes the whole can be equal to or greater than the sum of the parts in life if teams work well together. But sometimes--and this describes the Senate now--there are 100 wonderful, accomplished people in this body. Yet again and again, and now for years, the whole has been equal to less than the sum of the parts.  We have done very little of meaning, very little of substance. Yet now we are poised to tackle the most important issue that most affects people and the biggest sector of the American economy. If we get it right, we can send a message to the public that the Senate will once again be the We will once again be a deliberative body. We will once again do what we are supposed to do.  I think this country now needs to see some adults in the room, some group of people willing to work together--Democratic and Republican--to solve problems and do the right thing for the American public. If we do this right, we can send that message. If we do it wrong, we will hurt people, and we will also hurt the credibility of this institution in a way that I think will last for years.  We have a choice. It is up to us. We either follow the advice that our colleague gave us on the floor 6 weeks ago, which we gave him a standing ovation for, and we gave him the ovation because we knew he was right--we either follow that advice or we decide to ignore it and continue the downward spiral of a great body.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-09-19-pt1-PgS5836.txt,2176,TRIBUTE TO TYLER SMITH,2017.0,19.0,September
73,topic-id,426,"Mr.Far too many students leave our Country's classrooms ill-equipped to keep up with the demands of the 21st century job market. Many enter high school and postsecondary education uninformed of the range of careers available to them. For our Country's continued success, it is essential that our young people have exposure to the vast range of available work and career options early in their academic careers so that, by the time they begin high school, they are more knowledgeable about future paths and what they need to do to pursue them.  Wherever I travel through Virginia I hear the same thing from business owners, manufacturers, and plant managers: there are good paying jobs out there, we just need to train our students with the skills to fill them. Middle school is a time for students to begin thinking about what they want to pursue in life. Helping them explore how their coursework could support those interests can make a valuable difference down the road.  Programs that focus on career and technical education (CTE) allow for students to explore their own strengths and passions, as well as how they match up with potential future careers. But limited funding for middle school CTE programming often requires students to wait until high school for access to this type of experience.  This is why I am pleased to introduce today the Middle School Technical Education Program Act, or Middle STEP This bipartisan legislation creates a pilot program that allows for middle schools to partner with colleges and local businesses to develop and implement CTE exploration programs that give students access to apprenticeships or project-based learning opportunities. Additionally, middle school CTE programs funded through the Middle STEP Act would give students access to career guidance and academic counseling to help them understand the educational requirements for high-growth, in-demand career fields. Programs would assist students in drafting a high school graduation plan that demonstrates what courses prepare them for a given career. The programs must also provide a clear transition path from the introductory middle school program to a more narrow focus of CTE study in high school, and must be accessible to students from economically disadvantaged, urban and rural communities.  I believe this meaningful legislation can propel young students toward the careers of the future, and help to fill workforce shortages across the Commonwealth and the I strongly encourage my colleagues to consider this legislation to allow for students to have opportunities to explore potential career choices and pathways early on in their academic careers. Their futures depend on it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgS5746.txt,2176,0915,2017.0,14.0,September
64,topic-id,1502,"Mr.President, I wish to change the subject slightly. I will be back on the floor next week to defend my good friend and colleague Senator Cassidy's ideas on the reform of healthcare for He received a letter today from our Governor and the Secretary of our Department of Health and Hospitals, which, in my opinion, espouses points of view on healthcare[[Page S5848]]that are not in the best interests of the people of  Just for a moment, I want to talk about tax reform because that is the other big issue in front of us.  Like the Presiding Officer, I have been in government for a while. I have great respect for professional economists, but it has been my experience that for every economist, there is an equal and opposite economist, and they are both usually wrong.  Economics today is more art than science. That is why I say it doesn't take an expert economist to see that something is wrong with the American economy.  Mr.President, 2016 was the 11th straight year our economy failed to achieve 3 percent annual growth, which has been our average annual growth every year since 1960. I have heard numerous pundits act like returning to 3 percent growth is something special, something extraordinary. No, sir, look at the numbers. It is just average, and I think the American people deserve better than just average growth, but even average growth is optimistic if we keep hamstringing the men and women who create the jobs in this country.  Our 40 percent business tax rate--let me say that again. Our 40 percent business tax rate and our broken Tax Code are chasing our ideas, our jobs, and our investors into the open, waiting arms of foreign countries. Our 40 percent business tax rate and our broken Tax Code are keeping wages and productivity low, they are crippling our small business women and small business men, and they have to go.  When we are talking about tax reform, I think it is very important that we not forget the primary vehicle--not the only vehicle but the primary vehicle for economic growth in America is the middle class, which is what I want to talk about for a moment, tax relief for ordinary people.  My constituents tell me every day: Kennedy, we look around in our economy today, and we see too many undeserving people at the top getting bailouts, we see too many undeserving people at the bottom getting handouts, and we are in the middle and we get stuck with the bill.  They say: Kennedy, we can't pay it anymore because our health insurance has gone up--thanks to ObamaCare--our kids' tuition has gone up, and our taxes have gone up. I will tell you what hasn't gone up, our wages and our income.  They feel that we in Washington don't listen and we don't care. They feel like they have no voice and no chance, and that anger is understandable.  This bar graph shows U.real median household income going all the way back to 1999. We can see where it was in 1999: slightly over $58,000. This is median household income. Of course, it took a dip in 2012 as a result of the recession, but look where we are in 2016. We are practically right where we were in 1999.  The middle class--the ordinary people of America--has made virtually no progress, and they have every right to be angry about that. It has been 16 years since President Bush's tax cuts, since the middle class has gotten a tax break. That is why I wanted to come to the floor today. Somebody has to speak up for the ordinary people of America and for our middle class.  Middle-class families drive our economic engine. We are a consumer economy. Seventy percent of our economy is based on consumers. They buy the goods and services our businesses are selling. They work hard to be able to spend and save and invest. Most middle-class Americans get up every day, go to work, obey the law, pay their taxes, try to do the right thing by their kids, and they are falling further and further and further behind. Now, as they are trying to balance a checkbook, nearly one-third of their income is automatically withheld and sent off to Washington, They never even see it. Come April, they may owe even more on their savings and investments. If you don't believe me, look at the numbers. You think America is broke? Between October 2016 and January 2017--just one quarter--the U.Treasury set a brandnew tax revenue record of $1 trillion--$1,084,840,000,000. A lot of that money came out of the hides of ordinary people.  I will give you an example. Right now, if you are a middle-class family in Alexandria, LA--right smack dab in the middle of my State--you have a household income of $59,000. You have two children. You want your children to have a better future than you had. You claim all your exemptions and you take the standard deduction. You are going to be paying the Federal Government about $3,500 a year.  That is not even counting what that middle-class family has to pay in State and local taxes or their payments to Social Security or By the time their bills are paid and by the time they put gas in the car, that doesn't leave them much to work with.  I have an idea about how tax reform can target the middle class and bring ordinary people some badly needed relief. Seventy percent of Americans opt to take the standard deduction when filing their taxes--70 percent. They do that because it is simple, it is fair, and it requires less documentation than itemizing. In 2014, this option--this standard deduction--saved taxpayers of America about $217 billion. Yet they are still having trouble getting ahead. If Congress were to make one simple change as we enter upon this endeavor that we call tax reform--I call it tax cuts--like doubling the standard deduction across the board for everybody, including but especially the middle class, that would potentially inject about $600 billion back into our economy over 10 years. That is according to a 2014 CRS report. That would be an immediate shot in the arm to the American economy.  That family of four in Alexandria, LA, whom I just talked about would have their Federal tax bill cut to $1,700, freeing up almost $2,000 of their hard-earned income. That is $2,000 toward a new car, a new lawn mower, fixing their home, putting money back into their business, or saving money for their children's college education. It is pretty simple. It is also $2,000 right back into the economy.  As the cost of earning more is reduced, people will want to work harder. I believe people respond to incentives--not just Americans, but that is human nature. That means more productivity and more growth. It is economics 101. Unless you were throwing a frisbee in the quad, you were in an economics 101 class, and you know that if you give people more to spend and they spend it, the economy is going to grow in the process. I believe, Mr.President, as I know you do, that people can spend their own money better than the government can.  The strength of the middle class was the cornerstone of our past economic growth, and I think it will be the key to our future.  I have said it before, and I will say it again: We do need tax reform for businesses. I repeat: We do need tax cuts for businessmen and businesswomen--not just for the large C corporations but also for the passthroughs, the LLCs, the LLPs, the sub S corporations, and the sole proprietorships and family farms.  If tax reform does not include relief for the middle class, if it doesn't include relief for ordinary Americans, then we will lose a historic opportunity. It will be another generation before we will have this opportunity again, and we will never get our economy back on track unless we can close that loop.  We need to liberate the middle class and their power to spend and their power to save and renew their belief in the American dream. A tax reform policy that provides relief to the middle class, such as doubling the standard deduction--that certainly is not the only way to do it, but it would certainly do the trick--will give people the incentive to work and to save and to invest.  Our economic fate is tied to the health of our middle class. I am not saying that other parts of our great Nation, our economy, are not important, but the bedrock is the middle class. The bedrock is small business. And it is high time that we offer ordinary Americans a tax code that believes in them.  With that, Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

They said thank you, and they said to tell Susan Collins thank you for the vote to preserve our healthcare. Yet here we are, back at it again.  I think we need to understand what this bill does. Essentially, it does two things. It shifts all the responsibility for the healthcare provisions for the most vulnerable Americans entirely to the States, with very little in the way of guardrails or protection, and it gives them less money in order to provide that kind of healthcare. That is called shift and shaft. Shift the responsibility, and shaft the people who have to try to meet that responsibility.  I have been a What we are talking about here is cutting off the support and the dollars that are needed to meet those responsibilities. Everyone says: Well, this is all flexibility. We are providing flexibility--flexibility to make agonizing decisions between providing healthcare to seniors or to children, to people who are disabled or to people who are just trying to get on their feet and go to work without the specter of a healthcare disaster hanging over them.  I suspect we will have more to say about this next week, but it is a travesty.  I understand there is going to be a little hearing on I call it a figleaf hearing. There is going to be a hearing.

This is not a responsible way to legislate, and the people of this country expect more of us. I hope both parties--both parties--will recognize the folly of what is being proposed here and say no. Then, let's go back to talking, on a bipartisan basis, and fix the problems with the American healthcare system which certainly need to be addressed.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson). Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided between the two parties.

22,topic-id,2332,"Mr.President, I rise to join my colleagues on the floor to share concerns I have been hearing from people in my State about the latest healthcare repeal bill.  Minnesotans and patient groups, such as AARP, oppose this bill because eliminating the Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act's help for millions of people means they would lose coverage, and it would increase their out-of-pocket costs.  People in my State are concerned about this bill's impact on rural hospitals, especially--as are the rural hospitals--because it makes deep cuts to Medicaid, and the new block grant in the bill would end completely by 2027.  I am very concerned that this bill would reverse the progress we are making in addressing the opioid epidemic by putting a cap on Medicaid, a program that has been critical for substance abuse treatment for people struggling with this addiction.  A few months ago, I pointed out that we were on plan F in the Plans A and B were the two House versions of a repeal; plans C and D were the two Senate versions of the repeal; plan E was the repeal bill without a replacement plan; and then we were presented with plan That, of course, went down after the Senate Democrats were joined by three Republican Senators in voting it down. I actually thought we couldn't get lower than F, but apparently we can because now we are here.  Many of the Minnesotans I have talked to don't like A, B, C, D, E, F, or the plan we are discussing that has been proposed. I have heard from people all over my At the Minnesota State Fair, I heard from Democrats, Republicans, and I heard from people from our cities and people from our rural areas. There are a lot of people--nearly 2 million people--at the Minnesota State Fair, which is the biggest State fair in the country. A lot of people stopped by my booth. I heard from the old and the young, from men and women, cancer survivors, people with disabilities, and many more. None of them wanted us to keep going down a partisan path when it comes to healthcare.  That is why I was so happy to tell them over the recess that new work--bipartisan work--was being done with Senator Alexander and Senator Murray, two Senators who proved that they could work across the aisle on the education bill, which they did last year. They are the leaders on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and they have been moving forward together with truly bipartisan hearings and discussions. I have attended a number of them with Governors and with experts on this issue to figure out the best ways to strengthen the individual markets and to reduce costs. That is something we have done successfully in our State with an all-Republican legislature and a Democratic We worked on it in our State, so I figured we could maybe bring this out on the national level. But it isn't enough that the work that is going on with Senator Alexander and Senator Murray on a bipartisan basis could be imploded in favor of another version of a repeal bill that hasn't even gone to a hearing before the HELP Committee in regular order, as we would expect--the regular order Senator McCain spoke up for in the incredible speech he gave when he came back to the If that isn't enough, we heard yesterday that we will not even be able to get a full Congressional Budget Office analysis of this bill this month. Why would we rush to take a vote before we have that critical information?  I have repeatedly heard my colleagues criticize moving forward with bills when we don't know their impact. Our constituents are owed this. This is the entire healthcare system of Why would we be taking a vote on a bill when we don't even know the full impact--when we do not have a full score of the bill--either financially or, most honestly, the impact it would have on people's healthcare? Our constituents are owed this. It is their healthcare and their money we are messing around with.  When I talk to my constituents, none of them ask me to do what we already know this bill does. It cuts Medicaid, eliminates the Medicaid expansion, threatens protections for people with preexisting conditions, and kicks people off their insurance coverage. Instead, they want us to work together on bipartisan solutions to fix what we have when it comes to healthcare: to strengthen the exchanges, support small businesses, reform delivery systems, and lower the cost of prescription drugs. I don't see anything in this bill that would lower the cost of prescription drugs--nothing.  I have heard the same message from senior groups and the Children's Hospital Association, which are strongly opposed to this bill. I have heard the same message from the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association, the American Cancer Society, and several other patient groups that have said this ``proposal just repackages the problematic provisions'' of the bills that were voted down earlier this summer.  This bill, the Graham-Cassidy bill, is not the only option. Instead of making these kinds of cuts and moving backward, Senator Alexander and Senator Murray have invited all Senators, as I noted, to participate in their process. They have had dozens of Senators show up at early morning breakfasts or, as Senator Alexander calls them, coffees, with 30, 40 Senators showing up. I know because I was there. Why do they show up? Because they know we must make changes to the Affordable Care They also know, based on the work we have seen in Minnesota and other places, these changes can be made across the aisle.  In these hearings and discussions on bipartisan solutions, we have talked about the State-based reinsurance program passed in While we are still waiting for the Federal waiver--I will make a pitch for this at this moment--from the administration, even passing it alone helped us to bring promised rates down. I know Alaska has a State-based reinsurance program and recently got approval from the administration, and New Hampshire and other States are pursuing similar plans. That is why I support Senator Kaine and Senator Carper's legislation, the Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act, to reestablish a Federal reinsurance program. This bill would lower premiums by providing support for high-cost patients.  Another topic we have discussed frequently as part of the HELP Committee process over the past few weeks is the cost-sharing reduction payments. These are crucial to stabilizing the individual market and reducing uncertainty. That is why I support Senator Shaheen's Marketplace Certainty  It is clear that this type of legislation could get support from both sides of the aisle to improve the system, but beyond these immediate fixes, it is long past time that we come together to pass legislation to address the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. I have a bill that would harness the negotiating power of 41 million seniors on Medicare to bring drug prices down. Right now, Medicare is actually banned by law from using their market power to negotiate for better prices. I would bet on 41 million seniors for getting better prices, but we are not giving them that chance.  Senator McCain and I have a bill to allow Americans to bring in safe, less expensive drugs from  Senator Lee and I have a bill that would allow temporary importation of safe drugs that have been on the market in another country for at least 10 years when there isn't a healthy competition for that drug in this country. This would let patients access safe, less expensive drugs.  Senator Grassley and I have a bill which would stop something called pay-for-delay, where big pharmaceutical companies actually pay off generic companies to keep less expensive drugs off the market. That bill would save taxpayers $2.9 billion and a similar amount for individual consumers.  Are those bills in this latest proposal from our Republican colleagues? No, they are not. Instead, what does this bill do? While it devastates the Medicaid Program, it repeals big parts of the Affordable Care Act that help people afford insurance and, instead, puts in place an inadequate block grant which completely goes away in 10 years. This bill does the opposite of what the people came up to me and talked to me about in my State over the August break.  So before we rush through a vote on it, before we even know the impact of[[Page S5835]]it, before it has even gone through the committee process as it is supposed to do, before we even give an opportunity for Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Patty Murray--the two leaders on the committee that matters for healthcare--to come up with their plan, no, the proposal would be to rush the vote on this, and that is just wrong.  What is this in real terms? It is a woman from Pine Island, Her husband has struggled with mental illness for years, but she told me she felt so fortunate that he was able to get mental health treatment through their insurance coverage. She is worried that if these types of repeal efforts succeed, people like her husband will go back to being desperate for help.  This debate is about people with preexisting conditions who would see their costs skyrocket under this bill. Teri from my State has ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, it is not the first time she has had it. She said that when she was diagnosed back in 2010, she ended up declaring bankruptcy due to the cost of her treatment. Teri said bankruptcy was ``just a reality for a lot of people with cancer.''  Luckily, under the Affordable Care Act, Teri can afford insurance and is currently responding well to treatment, which, by the way--I see Senator Durbin here--is based on NIH-funded research. It is treatment based on that research, which, unfortunately, we cut back on in the bill, and Senator Durbin will continue to fight to get that treatment through the Department of Defense included.  But the bill we are facing now, the Graham-Cassidy bill, would allow insurers to charge sick people or those with preexisting conditions much more than healthy people. Teri is worried that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for people like her to afford health insurance.  This debate is about all the parents whom I have spoken to over the last few months who have children with disabilities. These parents would literally come up to me at parades over the summer, bring their kids over in the middle of the parade route, and introduce those children to me--kids in wheelchairs, kids with Down syndrome--and say: This is a preexisting condition. This is what a preexisting condition looks like. That is why they oppose repeal.  In Minnesota, one out of four children get their health coverage from Medicaid, and 39 percent of our children with disabilities or special healthcare rely on Medicaid or children's health insurance. We should be spending our time this week reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program before States like mine run out of money at the end of the month, before debating another repeal bill for which we don't even have a Congressional Budget Office score on the impact. That word ``score'' sounds technical, but it is about what the bill would mean to people like those kids who came up to me in the parades with their parents and to people, like Teri, with ovarian cancer.  This debate is also about our seniors and our rural communities. Our hospitals are essential to rural communities. They don't just provide health services; they employ thousands of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers. These rural hospitals often operate at margins of less than 1 percent. That is one reason Senator Grassley and I introduced the Rural Emergency Acute Care Hospital Act a few months ago to help rural hospitals stay open. But cutting Medicaid by billions of dollars and repealing the Medicaid expansion would move us in the opposite direction.  In my State, Medicaid covers one out of five people living in rural areas. I know my colleagues, Senators Collins, Capito, and Murkowski, have previously expressed real concerns about the impact of Medicaid cuts in their States, which also have big rural populations. Cutting Medicaid and eliminating the Medicaid expansion doesn't just threaten healthcare coverage for these populations; it threatens the local communities where these hospitals are located.  These rural hospitals are on the frontlines of one important fight; that is, the fight against the opioid epidemic. We just found out that in our State last year, over 600 people died from opioid and other drug overdoses--over 600 people. That is about two per day. It is more people than we see die from car crashes in our It is more people than we see die from homicide. Deaths from prescription drugs now claim more lives than either of those two issues. This epidemic affects our seniors too. One in three Medicare part D beneficiaries received a prescription opioid last year.  While there is much more work to do to combat the epidemic, I want to recognize the progress we have made with the CARA Act and the Cures Act, with all the work that has been done, but making cuts to Medicaid will move us in the other direction.  We have all heard the voices, not just of those on the frontlines of the opioid crisis but from doctors and hospitals, patients, seniors, nursing homes, and schools saying that this bill is not the way forward. Instead, let's do what we all heard people wanted us to do in August; that is, to work across the aisle on actual solutions that help people afford healthcare.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING Under the previous rule, all postcloture time has expired.  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Francisco nomination?

259,topic-id,3020,"Mr.President, I first thank Senator McCain and Senator Reed for their leadership, a model of bipartisanship at this incredibly important time with the rest of the world and the need to have a strong military. We know that. I think that is why we see this bill proceeding, but this bill will be so much stronger if we make sure that we not only defend our shores and stand by our troops but if we also defend the security of our democracy.  I so appreciate Senator McCain and Senator Reed supporting this amendment I have with Senator Lindsey Graham of South This must be included in this bill. We are having a situation where one or two Members on the other side of the aisle are not allowing it to proceed. The timing is critical. The 2018 election is only 400-some days away, which is why you see us pushing this bill and doing everything we can to get it either included in the managers' package or to get a vote.  This amendment is supported by the Freedom Caucus, and in the House is led by the head of the Freedom You may ask why. There are a lot of Republicans who would like to see States be able to keep running their own elections. I agree with that. I like the fact that we have decentralized elections, but the hacking was so real in this last election that our intelligence agencies have now established there were 21 States where there were attempts made to hack into their election software. We know this is going to happen again, and we must stand ready. We must protect our democracy.  Instead of having a successful hack attack in this next election, why don't we prepare ourselves so we can keep the decentralized nature of our elections? That is why we see such broad support for this amendment.  I came to the floor yesterday to fight for a vote--a simple up-or-down vote--on the bipartisan Klobuchar-Graham amendment. I also thank Senator Lankford of Oklahoma, as well as Senator Harris of California, for their bipartisan work and support for this amendment. This amendment has support, but one or two Members are blocking it--an amendment which has the support of the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee because they understand that election security is national security.  This provision simply says that it is the policy of the United States to defend against and respond to cyber attacks on our democratic system. You[[Page S5714]]have to have your head in the sand if you don't know that this has been a problem, whether you are in business and have had information stolen, whether you are someone who has been scammed or have had stuff sent to you on your email, or whether you are a voter who is concerned simply that when you are exercising your freedom to vote, someone is going to come in and steal your own private information or--worse yet--change what you did and change the result of an election.  In the words of Bruce Fein, a former Reagan official, ``Passing the Klobuchar-Graham amendment is imperative because public confidence in the reliability of elections is a cornerstone of national security.''  I am stunned we weren't simply able to include this amendment. I still have hope that we can. I am here to fight for this amendment so vigorously today because we need to get this done now. We need to get the authorization done now so we can start the process of putting grants out to States so they can upgrade their election equipment, have backup paper ballots, and simply employ the best practices that we believe we need to protect ourselves from the perpetrators in Russia or in any other foreign entity.  We need to make sure our election equipment in every big city and in every small town in America, in every county is as sophisticated as the bad guys who are trying to break into it. That is all this is about. I don't think anyone can go home to their constituents and say they blocked this. How on Earth can we pass a bill which authorizes billions of dollars in spending and refuses to simply authorize a relatively smaller amount of money to upgrade our election equipment?  Predictions are that this would cost about the same amount of money we spend on military bands every year--bands--music bands. I love military bands. There is nothing I like better, and I want to keep our military bands strong, but all Senator Graham and I are saying is, I think maybe the protection of our entire election--guaranteeing the freedom of Americans to pick the candidate they choose, whether Republican or Democratic or Independent--is just as important as the music they hear celebrating our democracy. You can't have music celebrating our democracy if you don't have a fair democracy.  U.national securities have been sounding the alarm that our voting systems will continue to be a target in the future. The idea that we would pass the Defense authorization bill and not address this threat is mind-boggling. It is literally congressional malpractice.  According to the Department of Homeland Security, now run by the Trump administration, Russian hackers attempted to hack at least 21 States' election systems in 2016. Earlier this year, we also learned that Russia launched cyber attacks against a U.voting software company and the emails of more than 100 local election officials.  The former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, recently testified that Russia will continue to interfere in our political system. This is what he said:       I believe Russia is now emboldened to continue such      activities in the future both here and around the world, and      to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a      clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the      very foundation of our democratic political system, this      episode is it.  Vigilance, that is what we need right now. This is not about one party or the other. I think Senator Rubio said it best when he said, well, one election it might affect one party and one candidate; the next election, it is going to affect the other. No one has any idea, when you are dealing with outside foreign entities that are trying to interfere with our democracy and trying to bring down our democracy in the eyes of the world--you don't know who they are going to affect. You just know they are trying to do it. So what do we do? We put in the necessary money in the Defense Authorization Act, an authorization for that to stop this from happening.  In order to safeguard future elections, State and local officials must have the tools and resources they need to prevent hacks and safeguard election infrastructure. They don't need those resources in 2 years. They don't need us debating this for 3 years. They need these resources now. Ask the secretaries of States--Democratic and Republican--who are supporting this bill all over the country, ask the local election officials, and they will tell you they need it now.  The next Federal election in 2018 is just 419 days away. As we know, it takes time for them to plan, it takes time for them to get the right equipment, and it takes time for them to get the information from cyber experts to make sure whether their systems are secure.  Experts agree that if we want to improve cyber security ahead of the 2018 election, we must act now. That is why I am fighting so hard for this amendment. I don't think we can just wait around and see if there is another bill we can attach it to next summer. No, that will not work. In order to protect our election systems, we need to do three things.  First, we must bring State and local election officials, cyber security experts, and national security personnel together to provide guidance on how States can best protect themselves. These recommendations should be easily accessible so every information officer and election official in every small town can access them. As we know, a lot of the States themselves still don't have full information about the hacking in the 21 That is a problem.  Many State officials I have talked to say they are still in the dark about threats to their election systems. That can't continue. We need our national security officials to be sharing information about the potential for attacks--not the day before the election, when they can't do anything, when they have a system that doesn't have paper ballot backups. No, they need that information now, and we need to help them not just get that information but make the changes they need. This means creating a framework for information sharing, which acts as an alarm system against cyber intruders. Our amendment would simply establish that alarm system.  Second, the Federal Government must provide States with the resources to implement the best practices developed by States and cyber security experts. A meaningful effort to protect our election systems will require those resources. As I mentioned before, predictions are that it is about the same amount of money that we spend every year on military bands. I think that is a bargain when you are looking to protect our democracy.  I think most Americans would agree with me--Republicans or Democrats, which is why there is such widespread support for this amendment--when I say that protecting our democracy from foreign cyber attacks and letting Americans have the freedom to decide who they want to elect, instead of someone in Russia, are probably money well spent.  Finally, we need better auditing of our elections. That means voter-verified paper ballot backup systems in every That is fundamental to protecting our elections and improving public confidence in the reliability of elections. Our amendment would accelerate the move to paper ballots by providing States with the resources they need to get there. The vast majority of our States simply don't have that system in place.  In short, our amendment would help States block cyber attacks, secure voter registration logs and voter data so that people don't get their addresses in the hands of a foreign government--or maybe even the data on whom they voted for or what party they belong to--upgrade auditing election procedures, and create secure and useful information sharing about threats.  I am not alone in this fight. As I mentioned, Senators Graham, Lankford, and Harris are also pushing for the Senate to do its job and include this provision. Representative Meadows, the leader of the House Freedom Caucus, and Democratic Congressman Jim Langevin have introduced companion legislation in the  Again, why is the Freedom Caucus strongly behind this bill? They are behind this bill because they want to preserve States' elections. They want to preserve the rights of States to have their own elections, and they are concerned enough because they have looked at the intelligence reports and have seen that this next election could blow it all up.[[Page S5715]]  Are we just going to look back at it then? People who are holding this up, whose names will be revealed--are they then going to say ``Oops, I guess we made a mistake''?  No, it is going to be on their hands. It is going to be on their hands. This is the moment to do it.  I repeat: We need to get the authorization in place, so we can get the grant money out to the States so that they can upgrade their election equipment.  Dozens of former Republican national security officials are pushing for the Senate to pass this amendment. They have written op-eds, called their representatives, and worked to inform the public about the need to take action now.  Michael Chertoff, who served as Secretary of Homeland Security under President George Bush, published a piece this month in the Wall Street Journal, calling on Congress to take action and pass the Klobuchar-Graham amendment. He noted that our amendment would address the cyber security challenge in a way that is ``fiscally responsible, respectful of states' policy-making powers, and proactive in dealing with the most pressing vulnerabilities.''  As I noted, Bruce Fein, a Reagan Department of Justice official, said: ``The amendment would enormously strengthen defenses against cyber-attacks that could compromise the integrity of elections in the United States and undermine legitimacy of government.''  A bipartisan group of former national security officials sent a letter to Senate leadership pushing for a vote on this amendment. They noted that attacks on U.voting systems threatened the most basic underpinnings of American self-government. These attacks are growing in sophistication and scale.  As we all know, States administer elections. If you talk to the local election officials--call any of them up--you will find that they are adamant about protecting States' rights in this area.  We want to help them. A bipartisan group of 10 Secretaries of State sent a letter urging the Senate to pass this amendment. They want this amendment to pass because it would provide vital resources.  How do you truly expect someone in a town of 1,000 people to be up on the latest cyber security attacks from some sophisticated hackers in a warehouse in Russia? Really? I don't think so. That is why we want to keep the decentralized nature of our elections. In some ways, one, we like it; two, it gives us protection because it is not all in one system. We know we have to realize that in these small towns and in these rural areas, they are not going to have the updated, sophisticated cyber security protection equipment unless we tell them how they can do it and give them help to get there.  The National Association of Counties, a group that unites America's 3,069 counties, also endorses this amendment. Why? Because in our country, most of our elections are run by county officials.  As I noted, our decentralized system is both a strength and a weakness--a strength because we have multiple systems, so all of our information isn't in one place. American elections are increasingly an easy target because many local election systems are using election technology that is completely outdated.  A survey of 274 election administrators in 28 States found that most said their systems need upgrades. Forty-three States rely on electronic voting or tabulation systems that are at least 10 years old. Do you think the Russians and those other foreign entities that want to mess up with our democracy are not aware that this equipment is 10 years old? I am not telling them anything new right now. Of course they are aware of it.  What are we doing? We are letting people in these small towns in Alaska or in Iowa sit there and wait to see if it happens. Guess what. If they get into one locality or if they get into one State, do you think that doesn't undermine the integrity of our whole democracy in our country? Of course it does.  Local election officials who are passionate about keeping the Federal Government out of State elections support our amendment because it strikes the balance that our Federal system demands when it comes to the administration of elections.  As I said, despite the strong bipartisan support for this amendment--the strong support and leadership of the Freedom Caucus--there are Members of this body who are still blocking a vote. They happen not to be on my side of the aisle, so I implore my friends the other side of the aisle to figure this out and let this either be included in the managers' package or come up for a vote where I know it would pass.  Republican and Democratic Senators support this amendment. Cyber security experts support this amendment. Republican and Democratic former national security officials support this amendment. State and local officials support this amendment.  I ask you, why is this not included? We don't have an answer. Actually, there is no good answer, except for a bunch of procedural gobbledygook, which, of course, if it had gone through the regular order and had been allowed a hearing--which it was not--then we would have had a hearing. We were blocked from having a hearing. Now, as is my right, I am bringing this before this body.  The integrity of our election system is the cornerstone of our democracy. The freedom to choose our leaders and know with full confidence those leaders were chosen in free and fair elections--that is something Americans have fought and died for since our country was founded.  Obstructing efforts to improve election security is an insult to everyone who has fought for freedom and those who work every day to protect our democracy. Members standing in the way of this bipartisan amendment to protect our election infrastructure are literally committing democracy malpractice.  Our attitude must be to roll up our sleeves to get this done. The American people deserve nothing less.  I see my friend Senator McCain is on the floor. Again, I appreciate his support and his and Senator Reed's work, not only on this bill but their work to try to include this amendment in the package.  I yield the floor.

313,topic-id,915,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of H.3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal I introduced this bill with Chairman Goodlatte and Representatives Comstock and King for a very simple reason: the United States is facing an ever-growing danger from transnational gangs, and U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, needs more tools to deal with this danger.  The Federal Government's most important responsibility is the safety and security of the American people. However, we are not fulfilling that responsibility when we allow gangs to illegally enter our country with the express purpose of victimizing innocent  In communities across our country, transnational gangs are using violence and the threat of violence to create a climate of fear that allows them to operate with near impunity. They regularly target local business owners and law enforcement officials. Innocent bystanders, those unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, are also paying a price.  According to ICE, these gangs ``have grown to become a serious threat in American communities across the Nation--not only in cities, but increasingly in suburban and even rural areas. Entire neighborhoods and sometimes whole communities are held hostage by and subjected to their violence.''  Furthermore, ICE has found that, ``membership of these violent transnational gangs is comprised largely of foreign-born nationals.''  The most infamous transnational gang, of course, is MS-13, which entered the U.in the 1980s. Today, it has over 10,000 gang members operating inside the United States alone. At every level, our enforcement officials are working to curb this growing threat with large-scale enforcement actions. These include Operation New Dawn, which netted almost 1,100 arrests over a 6-week period.  However, we all know that prosecution of criminal gang members is notoriously difficult. This is because victims and witnesses of gang crime are often reluctant to testify because of the quite reasonable fear of retaliation against them or their families, thus many gang members are never convicted of the crimes they have committed.  The question is often asked: Why should law-abiding Americans have to wait until an alien gang member has committed a deportable offense? Why not deport the gang member before he has a chance to victimize more innocent people? The answer is that current immigration law contains dangerous loopholes that alien gang members are exploiting.  Currently, an alien may not be deported, even if he is known to be a member of a criminal gang or participating in gang activities. ICE must wait for the gang member to be first convicted of a deportable offense.  H.3697 changes that. For the first time, ICE will be permitted to place alien gang members into removal proceedings on the grounds of being criminal gang members. Our bill sets out clear specifications for what crimes are considered to be gang related, relying on longstanding Federal criminal law to determine what a gang or group consists of.  In addition, our bill permits the Secretary of Homeland Security, using procedures already used by the Secretary of State, to designate a gang as a criminal gang. This would be done in a transparent way through notification to Congress and publication in the Federal Register and with meaningful judicial review.  The conclusive decision as to whether to place an alien in removal proceedings would rest with the Department of Homeland When an alien is charged, the charge must be proven by evidence on the record in immigration court.  I have heard some uneasiness that ICE will use these provisions to charge any alien they encounter with gang activity. Our bill does not allow that. As a former immigration attorney, I know the importance of due process and know how important it is for illegal immigrants and for Americans and everyone within the jurisdictions of the immigration court to receive due process. I can tell you that our bill is consistent with due process.  Under H.3697, ICE has the burden of proof when charging an alien with a deportable offense. While the alien has the burden of proof when they are inadmissible, a denial of gang membership should be sufficient to shift the burden back to the government. The government must convince an immigration judge of its case. Of course, an alien ordered removed as a gang member has every right to appeal that order to the Board of Immigration Appeals and then to the Federal courts.  Ultimately, H.3697 is about providing law enforcement with the necessary tools to combat gang activity in every community in our country. This is essential if we, as elected officials, are committed to our responsibility to keep the American people safe and secure. That is the purpose of H.3697.  This is the third time this year the House is holding a floor vote on portions of the Davis-Oliver Act, which I introduced back in May, to make our country safer through stronger immigration enforcement.  I am proud that the House passed the first two bills that came from Davis-Oliver, Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.3697 as well.  We must take action now or watch crime rates rise in our There is no place in our country for criminal alien gang members, and any legislation which makes it easier to deport them deserves the support of every Member of this body.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

They are willing to talk about the gang violence, but they don't want to actually craft and pass legislation that does something about it.                              {time}  1015  I hope it is something that the American people are listening to, because as we have debates over the next few months about what we should be doing with regard to immigration, I hope everyone understands that every time we try to do something about enforcement of immigration laws, about stopping gang violation, about stopping illegal immigration into the United States, it is very difficult to get agreement on the other side.  Criminal alien gang members are wreaking havoc in this country. Without stronger tools to specifically target those aliens that terrorize our streets, gangs will continue to grow in numbers and in strength.  The time has come to take action and to provide a path to deportation to those that so unabashedly seek to destroy our society.  ICE has found that ``membership of these violent transnational gangs is comprised largely of foreign-born nationals.'' Often bearing the brunt of these gangs' violence are these very immigrant communities that the other side claims that they want to protect.  The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act takes a tough approach. I agree with that. Those gang members who have successfully evaded prosecution through witness intimidation, employing the tactics of fear and violence, will now be within ICE's reach. The new grounds of removability provided by H.3697 will get criminal gang members off of our streets.  ICE's recent Operation New Dawn resulted in almost 1,100 arrests of gang[[Page H7399]]members. Had H.3697 been enacted prior, that number would have almost certainly increased.  This bill is only starting the removal process, however. Make no mistake--and there was a lot of obfuscation today about this--immigration proceedings do not equate to deportation. The government must prove its case and provide evidence to convince an immigration judge that gang-related activity occurred.  As a former private immigration attorney, I have seen this process in action, and it does work. ICE will not use this new charge as pretext, as this ground will never be sustained by an immigration judge without sufficient evidence.  The time for this bill is long overdue, and we cannot afford to be distracted by extreme hypotheticals and issues not germane to what we are discussing today.  This bill was introduced to target criminal gangs, as that term is commonly understood, and that is what it will do once enacted. There is no place in our country for criminal alien gang members. By removing them from our streets, H.3697 will help make our communities safer. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

92,topic-id,553,"Madam President, I want to thank Senator McCain and Senator Reed for their leadership in producing the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018. Both veterans, they have a particular understanding of the sacrifices that members of our Armed Services make every day.  Every year, this authorization bill is drafted to reflect our commitment to the men and women serving in uniform, to authorize resources needed to maintain our national security, and to demonstrate the values and principles on which our country was founded. While I believe this bill reflects many sound defense policies, I regrettably cannot support its passage.  Yet again, this Defense authorization bill continues to include the shameful and counterproductive measures that block us from ending the terrorist recruitment tool that is the Guantanamo Bay detention mission, but the core reason for my opposition to this bill is the reckless price tag its implementation carries. This bill authorizes $700 billion in Defense spending, far above the caps currently established by the Budget Control Act and far more than the increase requested by the President in his budget proposal. If we met this authorization with real dollars, sequestration would take effect for Defense spending. Secretary Mattis has testified about the perils of sequestration. His message was clear: We must raise the budget caps.  What is more, this authorization relies on the same tired gimmick we have seen for years and includes $60 billion in overseas contingency operations funding. For fiscal hawks who call for us to reign in Federal spending to reduce the deficit, we cannot continue to treat OCO funds as privileged dollars--outside the scope of our budget caps--as a means to pay for what should be base spending.  Further, we cannot unilaterally boost Defense spending without similarly addressing other budgets that contribute to our national security. Earlier this year, in a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, Secretary Mattis clearly asserted that ``history is pretty clear, nations that did not keep their fiscal house in order and their economies strong lost their military power.'' We cannot simply raise spending for the Department of Defense without investing in programs that advance our diplomatic missions overseas and strengthen our domestic security through economic development, infrastructure improvements, environmental protections, and that meet the core needs of all Inflating our Defense spending at the cost of all other programs makes us neither stronger nor more secure.

This kind of collaborative process is what has, in the past, yielded results in the I regret that the amendment process was not more extensive, but hyperpartisan amendments that seek to upset the discussions of how to responsibly fund our government are not the way to reach consensus for further votes.

150,topic-id,518,"Mr.President, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of its founding, I would like to share a few remarks about the Nyumbani Children's  Marcelle and I have always enjoyed learning about and celebrating the continued growth and successes of Those successes are because of the people who choose to dedicate their time, valuable skills, and scarce resources to a noble cause--that of saving and improving the lives of others.  We have been particularly touched and moved by the stories of the children of Despite confronting tremendous personal medical and social challenges, these young people have been nurtured, nourished, educated, and cared for in a safe and loving environment.  These children have also benefited from advances in medical and therapeutic care that were unimaginable when this refuge was founded on September 8, 1992. To know that many of the children raised there have now grown into magnificent young people is a testament to the mission of this center.  When the Nyumbani Children's home was founded, there was certainly no assurance that these results would necessarily follow. The inspired efforts of our friend, Father Angelo D'Agostino, or Father D'Ag, have led to these successes. Father D'Ag was a man of faith who combined an incredible work ethic with vision and an insatiable, indomitable will. He was a man whose friendship I cherished.  Father D'Ag realized that the terror, stigma, and uncertainties associated with the transmission of the AIDS virus was responsible for a generation of orphans. Cruelly, AIDs also denied these children a home because Kenyan orphanages would turn them away out of fear and an inability to provide appropriate medical care, but Father D'Ag would not walk away.  It began when Father D'Ag took on the care of three children who had been abandoned and were destined to die alone. From that modest beginning, the Nyumbani Children's Home became a forerunner in providing care to those affected by the scourge of  In the decades since, Father D'Ag's vision has grown to encompass not only the original Children's Home, but also an advanced diagnostic laboratory, the unique Nyumbani Village, and an indispensable community outreach program that provides medical care to residents of distressed communities in  As a doctor and Jesuit priest, Father D'Ag innately understood the principle that every life has value and dignity. His character and his knowledge compelled him to act when others stood paralyzed by fear and doubt.  Sharing his compassion and conviction from the outset was Sister Mary Owens, Nyumbani's remarkable executive director since Father D'Ag's passing in 2006. Each of us is enormously thankful for the work of extraordinary people like Father D'Ag and Sister We are grateful for the many lives that have been saved and all that has been accomplished by Nyumbani over the past 25 years and look forward to success stories in the next 25 years.  Nyumbani is a representation of what good can come when dedicated people cast aside fear and doubt, bring forward the true human spirit, and help those in need.

359,topic-id,347,"Mr.President, I want to speak briefly about the funding to combat HIV/AIDS in the fiscal year 2018 Department of State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which was reported unanimously by the Senate Appropriations Committee on September 7.  In May, the Congress received the President's fiscal year 2018 budget request, which included a $1 billion cut to international HIV/AIDS programs. The White House proposed to focus the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief--the PEPFAR program--in 12 priority countries, while only maintaining current treatment levels in the other 24 countries in which PEPFAR works. This would mean no lifesaving drugs for new patients in any of those 24 countries and the end of initiatives PEPFAR has undertaken to accelerate progress in those countries.  Fortunately, the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Graham and of which I am ranking member, rejected the President's proposed cut and restored HIV/AIDS funding to the current level. The committee-reported bill includes a total of $6 billion for HIV/AIDS programs, including $4.32 billion for PEPFAR, $1.35 billion for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and malaria, and $330 million for HIV/AIDS programs administered by the U.Agency for International  The committee report accompanying the bill also reaffirms the key role PEPFAR plays in HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment around the[[Page S5855]]globe. In 2016, PEPFAR supported more than 11 million people with lifesaving antiretroviral treatment and provided testing and counseling for more than 74 million people.  During the committee markup of the Department of State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, I offered an amendment that would have increased PEPFAR by $500 million. Funding for PEPFAR has been stagnant for several years, and the additional funds in my amendment would have enabled millions more people infected with the AIDS virus to receive lifesaving treatment. Regrettably, my amendment failed on a party-line vote.  Nonetheless, the bill still succeeds in rejecting the administration's nonsensical and unacceptable reduction to HIV/AIDS funding. I want to be sure that all Senators are aware of this critical funding, which has received widespread, bipartisan support for many years.

360,topic-id,520,"Mr.President, in 2004 the United States voted to establish the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, MINUSTAH, to police the country following years of political turmoil.  While MINUSTAH was successful in bringing a semblance of order to the country, its mission was severely impacted by the 2010 earthquake which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and left hundreds of thousands more in need of assistance. Haiti has not fully recovered since then.  Unfortunately, that was not the only tragedy that befell Haiti in 2010. In October of that year, a cholera outbreak spread throughout the country, sickening hundreds of thousands and claiming the lives of more than 9,000. Even more tragically and unlike the earthquake, the outbreak could have been prevented, and the UN peacekeeping mission--tasked with protecting the people--was at fault.  The cholera outbreak was caused by an act of extreme negligence, when some UN peacekeepers disposed of human waste in a manner that contaminated the local water system. Before it happened, cholera was not a problem in Today it is. In 2016, after years of refusing to accept responsibility, the UN acknowledged its role in the cholera outbreak and established a trust fund to address the problem, but so far, very little has been contributed.  A provision I authored, which was adopted unanimously by the Senate Appropriations Committee and included in the fiscal year 2018 Department of State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, would provide the Trump administration with the authority to enable the United States to do its part to help.  With MINUSTAH winding down in Haiti, $40 million in unused contributions are available to donor countries, and the UN has agreed that those credits may be used to help address the cholera problem caused by its own peacekeepers.  The United States share of those credits is $11.7 million, and the provision I mentioned makes clear that the committee believes contributing to the trust fund would be an appropriate use of those funds. While this amount still falls far short of what is needed, if we believe in accountability for the UN, we should join other nations in providing our share of these funds to address this tragedy.  This is not a tragedy that only harmed a few families. Nearly 10,000 innocent people lost their lives through no fault of their own. They need help, and this is a small way for us to contribute.  When the United States responds to natural or manmade disasters, whether the tsunami in Indonesia, earthquakes in Nepal, drought in Africa, or war in Syria, we don't debate whose responsibility it should be to care for the victims. We respond because we are able to, and that is what global leaders do when tragedy strikes. We did not cause the cholera outbreak in Haiti any more than we have caused countless other calamities around the world, but we can help. Even $11.7 million will make a difference in Haiti, including by leveraging contributions from other governments.  I hope other Senators will follow the lead of the Appropriations Committee and lend their voices in support of this effort.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-19-pt1-PgS5854-2.txt,1383,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,19.0,September
458,topic-id,580,"Mr.President, I want to speak briefly about a provision that was included for the first time by myself and Senator Lindsey Graham in the fiscal year 2018 Department of State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which was reported unanimously by the Senate Appropriations Committee on September 7.  Specifically, the committee-reported bill includes $15 million to implement a U.interagency strategy, led by the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, to[[Page S5854]]support and protect civil society activists, including human rights and environmental defenders and independent journalists, in countries where such activists have been threatened or killed for peacefully exercising their rights of free expression, association, and assembly.  Nearly 1,000 violations were reported against human rights defenders in 2016, including killings, detentions, judicial prosecutions, physical attacks, and other threats and harassments. Civil society activists are targeted by both state and nonstate actors, including private companies and investors, seeking to obstruct the rights of voters, minorities, landowners, environmentalists, indigenous peoples, and refugees, among other vulnerable groups. These attacks are not limited to a particular region or a handful of countries--they are common in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East--nor are they limited to countries with authoritarian governments, such as Cambodia, Rwanda, Eritrea, Egypt, and Democratically elected governments are also culpable, such as Honduras, Philippines, Kenya, Ecuador, and Ultimately, democracy cannot survive if the rights of civil society and the independent media are not protected.  Last year was the deadliest year on record for land and environmental defenders. There were more deaths reported in more countries than ever before. Competition for land and natural resources has intensified to an alltime high, with companies around the globe putting greater emphasis on profit margins than on environmental protection or land ownership rights. As these pressures increase, the risk to civil society activists will also increase.  Similarly, although the number of journalists killed on assignment dropped slightly in 2016, the number of journalists in prison reached its highest level yet. More than 250 journalists are imprisoned worldwide because of their work. This is an egregious violation of the universal right of free expression.  These statistics are almost certainly underestimates, given the suppressions of free speech and lack of transparent and effective judicial systems in many countries where civil society activists face the most severe threats to their work and lives.  It is important for all of us to be aware of the growing threats to civil society activists worldwide, as well as the relevant funding and language included in the committee-reported Department of State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill.

86,topic-id,871,"Mr.President, I rise to speak in support of the nomination of Makan Delrahim as the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the U.Department of  Mr.Delrahim is someone I have known for over 15 years. He is eminently qualified, and I have no doubt that he will make an outstanding Assistant Attorney  Mr.Delrahim has a long and distinguished career within the antitrust world. His service in this area includes service as senior staffer for the Senate Judiciary Committee of the Antitrust Modernization Commission and previously at the U.Department of  I could go on and on regarding Mr.Delrahim's accomplishments, regarding his character and his aptitude as a lawyer, generally, and as an antitrust lawyer, in particular. But instead of taking my word for it, allow me to read just a little bit of the wide-ranging support Mr.Delrahim's nomination has from both sides of the aisle. People within the Senate and outside the Senate on both sides of the aisle have been supportive of this nomination.  A bipartisan group of former Assistant Attorneys General for the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice--including AAGs for Antitrust under President Obama, President Clinton, and President Carter--submitted a letter expressing strong support for Mr.Delrahim's nomination. They explained that ``Mr.Delrahim has the experience, intelligence, judgment, and leadership skills necessary to serve as an excellent Assistant Attorney General.''  Similarly, a bipartisan group of former Commissioners of the Antitrust Modernization Commission, a group of well-respected, seasoned anti-trust officials, submitted a letter supporting Mr.Delrahim's nomination. The letter said that Delrahim will ``serve with high distinction and be an outstanding Assistant Attorney General for antitrust.'' The authors of this letter also ``strongly urge[d] the Committee to look favorably upon his nomination, with the hope that the Senate can confirm him as soon as possible.''  Because Mr.Delrahim is so well respected, his nomination is one that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support, including broad bipartisan support within the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I serve. He was voted out of the committee by a vote of 19 to 1. That is not all that common these days. Ranking Member Feinstein went out of her way to explain that Mr.Delrahim ``will fully and fairly enforce our antitrust laws.''  Despite this strong bipartisan support, Mr.Delrahim's nomination has languished on the floor. In fact, the wait to confirm Makan Delrahim is the longest for someone appointed to this[[Page S5777]]position in 40 years. Not since the Carter administration has a new administration been forced to wait this long to fill the vacancy at the Antitrust President Carter's wait was largely due to the fact that he took more than twice as long to nominate an Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division than did President  Apparently, some Democrats are still so eager to resist that they are unwilling to allow us to confirm a nominee who many of them support. This is unacceptable. Democrats understand that antitrust is essential to ensuring that consumers receive the benefits of a competitive economy: lower prices, more innovation, and more choice. You see, when you have competition, good things happen. When you have competition, it inevitably brings down prices, and it inevitably results in higher quality.  In fact, last month some Democrats reiterated the importance of a strong antitrust enforcement to our economy, and they did so by releasing their Better Deal plan. The Democrats' plan describes the effects that anticompetitive mergers can have, such as harming consumers, customers, and suppliers.  Senator Klobuchar, along with several Democratic colleagues, followed up on this plan by proposing legislation to enact some of these policies into law. Although I don't agree with all of their proposed solutions, I do agree with my colleagues from across the aisle that antitrust enforcement should be a priority.  The best way to ensure that antitrust laws are being properly prioritized is to make sure our antitrust agencies are fully staffed and have leaders in place--leaders who have the requisite expertise and ability; leaders who have broad bipartisan support from sitting Senators, practitioners, and former agency leaders who know the position and the exacting demands required by the position; leaders who fit the description of Makan  Given his broad support, his impeccable qualifications, and the importance of this position, there is no good reason to delay this confirmation--quite to the contrary. This is a position that is neither Republican nor It is a position that is neither liberal nor conservative. This position is there to advance bipartisan issues that affect every And Makan Delrahim in this position at a critical time in our Nation's history, at a critical time for antitrust law--it is especially important that we have him in place.  Antitrust law is an area in which the United States has excelled above and beyond what its peer nations have been able to achieve. We developed this area of the law, and we did so with an eye toward protecting consumers and competition itself rather than protecting individual competitors. We have to lead, and the best way we can start is by confirming Makan So I call upon the Senate to confirm Makan Delrahim as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the U.Department of  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

433,topic-id,1083,"Mr.President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about an amendment I have offered to the National Defense Authorization The name of this amendment is the Due Process Guarantee  Alexander Hamilton, writing in Federalist 84, called arbitrary imprisonment one of the ``favorite and most formidable instruments of tyrants.'' The Constitution includes safeguards against this form of tyranny, including the right of habeas corpus and the guarantee that American citizens will not be deprived of life, liberty, or property by the government without due process of law. Our commitment to these rights is tested from time to time. It is most tested in times of crisis. We have not always passed these tests.  During the Second World War, President Franklin Roosevelt unilaterally authorized the internment of over 100,000 Japanese Americans for fear they would spy against the United The government presented no evidence that these Americans posed any threat to their country because the government had no evidence. Most of the detainees were themselves native-born citizens of the United States of Many had never even visited Japan during their entire lives. That episode in our Nation's history is sadly personal to the State I represent. The U.Government unjustly detained thousands of Japanese Americans in Utah at the Topaz War Relocation  Japanese-American internment is the most dramatic and shameful instance of detention in our Nation's history, but it is far from the only instance. In 1950, in a climate of intense fear about Communist infiltration of government, Congress enacted the McCarran Internal Security Act over the veto of President Harry That law contained an emergency provision allowing the President to detain any person he felt might spy on the United  More recently than that, in the post-9/11 era, there has been renewed pressure to diminish our constitutional protections in the name of security. Lawmakers from both parties have authorized the detention of Americans suspected of terrorism without charge, without trial, and without meeting the evidentiary standard required for every other crime--potentially for life. In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Congress authorized the indefinite military detention of suspected terrorists, including American citizens arrested on American soil.  These episodes--Japanese-American internment, the McCarran Internal Security Act, and the NDAA for 2012--are teachable moments, if you will. In all three cases, the United States faced real threats from totalitarian foes--foes hostile to our very core values and ideals as a nation. But instead of defying our foes by holding fast to our core values, we jettisoned them in a panic. Fear and secrecy won out. The Constitution and constitutional values lost.  Thankfully, that isn't the whole story, for there have also been times when Americans have stood up for the Constitution in the face of threats, thus sending a strong message to the totalitarian forces arrayed against us. For instance, in 1971 Congress passed the Non-Detention Act, stating that ``[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.''  Congress can make another stand for the Constitution by allowing a vote on the bipartisan Due Process Guarantee Act, by correcting the mistake--the very same mistake--it made in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 and protecting Americans from indefinite detention by government.  What, one might ask, is the Due Process Guarantee Act? In short, the amendment would raise the bar that the government has to clear in order to indefinitely detain American citizens and lawful permanent residents who are apprehended on U.soil. It would forbid the government from justifying such detentions using general authorizations for the use of military force, such as the 2001 AUMF against the 9/11 plotters. Instead, the government would have to obtain explicit, written approval from Congress before taking such action with regard to Americans if they are detained within the United  The Due Process Guarantee Act is based on a simple premise: If the government wants to take the extraordinary step of apprehending Americans on U.soil without charge or trial, it has to get extraordinary permission and should, at a bare minimum, require[[Page S5738]]an express act of Congress authorizing such extraordinary action. And if my colleagues want to grant the government this power over their constituents, they should authorize it themselves; they shouldn't hide behind vague authorizations so the voting public doesn't know what they are doing.  This begs the question whether we would ever want to do this--whether we should ever do it. It is difficult for many of us to imagine any circumstance in which anyone would want to authorize such extraordinary action, but that is exactly the point--the point contemplated by the suspension clause in the U.If something like that is going to be done, Congress needs to do it and needs to do it expressly and identify exactly what the threat, the war, the insurrection is that is being addressed.  I am offering this amendment because of my faith in our law enforcement officers and judges. And I have great faith in those people who fill those roles in our country, who have successfully apprehended and prosecuted many homegrown terrorists. Their example to us proves that our security is not dependent on a supercharged government and a weakened constitution.  Moreover, we must remember that our security and our privacy are not necessarily at odds with each other. Indeed, our privacy is part of our security. It is part of what makes us secure. We can secure the homeland without using the formidable instruments of tyrants.  It is with this objective in mind that I propose to my colleagues and request the support of my colleagues for the Due Process Guarantee Act, which should be adopted so as to make sure we are both free and safe, while remaining secure.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

314,topic-id,1368,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.3697. Gang members and serious criminals should not be granted admission to the United That is not a controversial position. I think almost every Member of Congress, Democrat or Republican, agrees with that. It is our highest priority to protect the safety of the American people. That is a duty I think we all take seriously, but this bill does something other than that.  The title of the bill is the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act, and, as we have seen in the past, there are times when the name of a bill is not always reflected in the actual proposed language of the statute, and that is true in this case.  First, section 2(a) of the bill defines criminal gang as ``an ongoing group, club, organization, or association of five or more persons that has as one of its primary purposes the commission of one or more'' of a wide range of offenses. This may seem reasonable until you look at the offenses listed.  These offenses could sweep in many people that no reasonable person would think of as a gang member--for example, one of the offenses relates to the harboring of undocumented immigrants. This statute includes people who give shelter to, transport, or provide other kinds of aid to undocumented immigrants. That means that,[[Page H7390]]under this bill, a religious organization that aids undocumented immigrants could be a criminal gang.  This isn't just theoretical. During the 1980s, members of the faith community were repeatedly criminally prosecuted for providing transportation to undocumented immigrants. In one case, the FBI even infiltrated a Bible study group to learn about the group's plan to support undocumented immigrants. Under this bill, DHS would have expanded authority to go after all such groups as criminal gangs. In one fell swoop, it could turn nuns into gang members.  The bill also refers to felony drug offense, which would include the repeated possession of marijuana. In California, my State, along with several other States, voters decided to decriminalize marijuana--first, for medical uses, then later for broader uses. Under this bill, a group that regularly gets together to use marijuana that is legal under State law would still be committing a felony under Federal law and would be a criminal gang. That could include groups of people who are using marijuana for medicinal purposes to treat epilepsy or cancer who are taking marijuana consistent with State law.  Second, the bill authorizes DHS to deny admission or to deport any immigrant, including one who has no criminal history or gang affiliation whatsoever, so long as DHS merely believes the person is associated with such a group.  Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of the bill expressly authorize DHS officers and immigration judges to deport an immigrant on nothing more than a reason to believe that the individual has been a member of a gang or has participated in the activities of a gang as defined under these rather broad provisions. There is no need for conviction or even an arrest. All DHS needs is a belief that the individual has assisted any group of five or more people that DHS believes has committed one of these long list of offenses.  This belief could be as minimal as the color of a person's shirt, the neighborhood they live in, or the individuals in their family. This is not just unreasonable, it is probably unconstitutional. Chairman Goodlatte had a self-actualizing amendment when the rule was adopted to change the evidentiary standard. I think it recognizes the problem with the bill.  The amendment really doesn't cure the problem with the breadth of the criminal gang definition, and it doesn't change the standard that applies to people seeking admission to the country, including those who are seeking to reunite with U.citizen spouses, parents, and children.  Just this week, I met with actual police officers who asked me to do what I could to defeat this unwise bill. They know, because they are out on the front lines, that gangs are a real problem, and they told me that bills like this, which could turn religious individuals, nuns, cancer victims into targets, is just going to get in their way as police officers.  If we want to keep America safe and admit immigrants who do not have a felony record, I would suggest that we consider the bipartisan Dream Act, H.3440. This bill would provide a path to legal permanent residence for 800,000 young people who were raised in America, who consider this to be their home, who represent the very best of our country.  Instead of debating whether we should allow ICE officers to target religious workers, we should focus on what really makes this country great.  I would like to note that there has been much discussion about the drafting of this bill, and at the Rules Committee just last night, Republicans defended the bill by asserting that the broad provisions would not be abused by ICE officers. Even if they could target the nuns, they wouldn't do that. Even if they could target the cancer victims or the teenagers smoking marijuana after school as gang members, they wouldn't do that.                              {time}  0930  Now, I am not suggesting that the teenagers smoking marijuana after school is a good thing. But it is not MS-13. And that is what we are trying to make a distinction here between, a gang abatement bill and garden-variety activity that we may not like.  One really very good and very thoughtful Member on the other side of the aisle suggested that, if there is a problem with the bill, we will just come back and fix it. Here is why that is a problem: We know that when we draft something in a poor manner, it often goes on to be enforced and we never get around to fixing it.  I will give an example. We passed years ago, and I objected at the time--Henry Hyde was chairman of the committee--a provision that barred people from gaining status if they provided material support to terrorists.  Well, that sounds like a good idea, but what does it mean?  It turns out that material support--which was never qualified to include support given under duress or given in the ordinary course of a commercial activity--has now been used to bar people who are not terrorists, who didn't give material support.  I will give you an example. A group of women called the Tortilla Terrorists are women who were threatened with their lives and made tortillas because they were threatened with death by guerrilla actors. Now, they were denied asylum because of the tortillas, hence the name the Tortilla  I think most of us would agree that is not terrorism. Yet, we drafted the bill in such a way that the Department felt that they had to enforce it in that way, and we have never gone back to it.  So to think that somehow if we write a law poorly, it is going to be fixed in the administration, that is just wrong. We should step back from this. We should work together. This was just introduced last week.  Now, I know the SAFE Act had hearings years ago, but I think we would be better off if we sat down together, if we reasoned together, if we worked through the defects in this draft, and came up with a bill that really targeted MS-13 members, something that we could all support and that well-served our country.  I will just say that Sister Simone Campbell, one of the leading nuns in America, explained her opposition to this bill. She said:       The bill's harboring provisions under INA 274 are so      sweeping that religious workers who provide shelter,      transportation, or support to undocumented immigrants could      be found liable of criminal activity. This statute has been      used against religious workers in the past, and the bill      tries to make it a weapon for the future.  Let's listen to the nuns like we did in school, and step back, redraft this bill, and oppose this poorly crafted measure today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

INA 274(a)(1)(A)(iii), 8      U.S.1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) [hereinafter the ``harboring      provision'' or ``Section 1324 (a)''].             The Harboring Prohibition Applies to Everyone       The harboring prohibition is not restricted to those      individuals who are in the business of smuggling undocumented      immigrants into the United States or who employ undocumented      immigrants in sweatshop-like conditions. As interpreted by      the courts, harboring can apply to any person who knowingly      harbors an undocumented immigrant. See, e.g., United States      v. Shum, 496 F.3d 390 (5th 2007); United States v.      Zheng, 306 F.3d 1080, 1085 (11th 2002), cert denied, 538      U.925 (2003); United States v.

Cantu, 557 F.2d      1173, 1180 (5th 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.1063      (1978).                  What Are the Elements of Harboring?       To establish a violation of the harboring provision, the      government must prove the following in most jurisdictions      ``(1) the alien entered or remained in the United States in      violation of the law, (2) the defendant concealed, harbored,      or sheltered the alien in the United States, (3) the      defendant knew or recklessly disregarded that the alien      entered or remained in the United States in violation of the      law, and (4) the defendant's conduct tended to substantially      facilitate the alien remaining in the United States      illegally.''

The U.Court of Appeals for      the Seventh Circuit has rejected the fourth element asserting      that the phrase ``conduct tending substantially to      facilitate'' is a judicial addition to the statute that is      unnecessary for a conviction because the statute requires no      specific degree of assistance. United States v. Xiang Hui Ye,      588 F.3d 411, 415-416 (7th 2009).                   What Actions Constitute Harboring?       Although Congress passed legislation to prohibit and punish      the ``harboring'' of undocumented individuals, it never      defined the term. The work of defining what constitutes      ``harboring'' has been left to the courts. As shown below,      the federal courts have not settled on one uniform      definition, but rather many of the circuit courts have      adopted their own definition of ``harboring.''       Harboring is conduct that substantially facilitates an      immigrant's remaining in the U.illegally and that prevents      the authorities from detecting the individual's unlawful      presence (U.Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit)       Harboring includes affirmative conduct such as providing      shelter, transportation, direction about how to obtain false      documentation, or warnings about impending investigations      that facilitates a person's continuing illegal presence in      the United (U.Court of Appeals for the Third      Circuit)       Harboring is conduct tending to substantially facilitate an      immigrant's remaining in the U.illegally (U.Courts of      Appeals for the Fifth Circuit)       Harboring is conduct that clandestinely shelters, succors,      and protects improperly admitted immigrants. (U.Court of      Appeals for the Sixth Circuit)       Harboring is conduct that provides or offers a known      undocumented individual a secure haven, a refuge, a place to      stay in which authorities are unlikely to be seeking him.      (U.Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit)       Harboring is conduct that affords shelter to undocumented      individuals. (U.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit)               Explanation of Harboring Through Case Law     U.Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit       In the influential case, United States v. Lopez, the U.     Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit went through the      legislative history of the harboring provision and stated      that the term harbor ``was intended to encompass conduct      tending substantially to facilitate an alien's `remaining in      the United States illegally,' provided that the person      charged has knowledge of the immigrant's unlawful status.''      521 F.2d 437, 441 (2d Cir 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.995      (1975).

I think it is a given that every Member of this body wants to do something about gangs. I have gangs in my district. I think I heard Mr.King speak so passionately about the problem in his district. It is a pervasive problem.  The concern is that this bill goes far beyond targeting those gangs. That is why we, with great reluctance, have to say we can't do this. We can't do this.  If we wanted to target just the gangs, we wouldn't have included language that would allow charging people who are not gang members as gang members. We wouldn't have included provisions that the victims of gangs would be denied asylum. Section 2(f) of the bill denies individuals who are suspected of alleged gang membership the opportunity to apply for asylum.  Here is the problem. In certain parts of Central America, you have rampant gang activity. Women and girls are terribly abused. They are beaten, turned into sex slaves, tattooed, and they escape.

335,topic-id,530,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  It has been mentioned that there are terrible activities being undertaken by gang members. I don't think there is any dispute in this body about that. Our obligation is to craft bills that will allow for remedies for that problem in a specific, targeted, and effective way. I think this bill falls far short in that regard.  We had mentioned earlier the great concern that has been expressed to us by religious people across the United States about the provisions relative to harboring. Five nuns on a religious worker visa who help provide sanctuary for an undocumented person is a gang under this bill. They are not MS-13.  We could craft a measure that avoids that outcome while still going after MS-13. We didn't do that. For one thing, we didn't actually sit down, both sides of the aisle, to work together, to reason together, to make that happen.  I would like to note that the smuggling issue is a big problem. We have unanimous agreement on the smuggling issue. We have worked together, actually, with the Wilberforce Act and other acts in a bipartisan way to deal with that. But we didn't bifurcate smuggling from harboring in this bill. That is why the nuns and the Catholic bishops have contacted us asking us not to support this bill.  I would like to note, just finally, that the first obligation that we have is to keep America safe. We fail to do that if we craft language that really is just part of a broad deportation agenda under the guise of an antigang bill. There is great concern that is what has happened here.  One of the elements that is referenced as a predicate for gang activity--the five people who are working together--is that documents are false. A lot of people are highly agitated when undocumented people have false documents. Opinions differ. Almost every undocumented person in the United States who works has a fake ID; otherwise, they can't get a job.  You can agree with that, you can think it is terrible, you can think it is maybe not so terrible. I think most of us would agree it is not MS-13. Why would we craft this in such a way to treat that activity as an MS-13 activity and to blow up all the procedures we have in place to make sure that justice is done?  I hope that Members will vote against this bill. Despite the name, it goes far beyond attacking gangs. It would drift into allowing for the deportation of religious people and others who have done nothing related to gang activity.  I hope that, if this bill is defeated, we can sit down, as we often have on various items and worked collaboratively on patent reform and other issues, and do the same on this. I hope, if this bill is defeated, we will take the opportunity to do that.  I, for one, pledge my best efforts to come up with a measure that is targeted and effective. This bill, unfortunately, is not.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgH7387-2.txt,701,ISSUES OF THE DAY,2017.0,14.0,September

20,topic-id,1182,"Mr.President, in July, millions of Americans awoke from a months-long nightmare, as the Senate did the right thing and voted down multiple Republican proposals to repeal the Affordable Care The American people breathed a sigh of relief when the future of their healthcare and of their children's healthcare was safe for the time being.  Unfortunately, Republicans want us to go back to that nightmarish time by reigniting their proposal to threaten healthcare coverage for millions of While the bill the Republicans are supporting today may have a new name, it contains the same mean, devastating policies. It is a zombie bill that despite best efforts and against the will of the American people, will not die.  Like its TrumpCare predecessors, the Graham-Cassidy bill will result in less coverage and increased costs. It eliminates the built-in protections for Americans with preexisting conditions, causing many of them to see their premiums skyrocket just because of a diagnosis. Some experts estimated that an individual with diabetes could face a premium surcharge of $5,600 under Graham- Graham-Cassidy will also allow States to decide what insurers have to cover and what they don't; meaning, once again, your ability to have comprehensive healthcare coverage would depend upon where you live.  This is not the type of healthcare reform people in this country want or need, and it is certainly not the type of reform to help us overcome our Nation's opioid use disorder epidemic.  With 91 Americans dying every day from an opioid overdose, we are clearly in the midst of our Nation's preeminent public health crisis. Over these last few months, we have heard time and time again that access to substance use disorder care is the linchpin to stemming the continually rising tide of opioid overdoses. Unfortunately, it appears our Republican colleagues have not been listening.  To be fair, access to treatment today is still a challenge. Only 1 in 10 people with substance use disorders receive treatment. Right now, an estimated 2 million people with an opioid addiction are not receiving any treatment for their disorder.  Yet the solution is not to block-grant funds which would otherwise be used to help people get care for their substance use disorders. The answer is also not kicking people off their insurance, but that is what my Republican colleagues are yet again proposing to do.  As with the previous versions of TrumpCare, Graham-Cassidy would threaten insurance coverage for 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder. It would end Medicaid expansion and cap the program, slashing its funding and decapitating access to lifesaving care. This bill would simply take a machete to Medicaid--the leading payer of behavioral healthcare services, including substance abuse treatment.  Also, in the same vein as earlier proposals, Graham-Cassidy would allow States to waive the essential health benefits the Patients' Bill of Rights put in place under the Affordable Care Act that ensures that every plan provides comprehensive coverage. Because covering mental health and substance use disorder treatment is expensive, this would likely be one of the first benefits to be cut. As a result, someone struggling with opioid use disorder would have to pay thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, likely forcing many to forgo lifesaving substance use disorder care.  This epidemic of opioid abuse and overdose deaths will only get worse as long as we have a system that makes it easier to abuse drugs than to get help for substance use disorders. Graham-Cassidy would only exacerbate this already dire problem in our country.  Just last week, a leading sponsor of the bill said: ``We recognize there are circumstances where states that expanded Medicaid will have to really ratchet down their coverage.'' ``Rachet down,'' that is not improving healthcare. That is ripping insurance coverage away from the one in three Americans struggling with opioid use disorder who relies on That is gutting billions of dollars in addiction care and treatment.  Graham-Cassidy isn't a new block grant program, it is a chopping block program--for Medicaid, for coverage, for access to critical substance use disorder services.  I believe past is prologue here. Just as Americans rejected the inhumane and immoral TrumpCare of months past, they are already seeing this new attempt is more of the same and, in some cases, worse. Many patient, provider, and other healthcare groups have already come out against Graham-Cassidy, citing the bill's inability to maintain the healthcare coverage and consumer protections currently provided in the Affordable Care It is deja vu.  Enough is enough. Republicans newest shortsighted stunt is detracting attention from bipartisan efforts to stabilize the individual insurance market and to help decrease costs. Let's end this partisan gambit to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and start focusing on ways to make the healthcare system in our country better, not worse.  We need all of you, in every corner of the country, to once again stand up and fight against these mean attempts to harm the health of our family members, our friends, and our neighbors. We need your energy, your commitment, and your passion to do what you did a few months back to help make sure our better angels once again will prevail. You have done it before, and I know you can do it again.  My Democratic colleagues and I will be fighting right here with you to finally put this zombie healthcare bill to rest.  This is the time. This Chamber will be the place where we have this debate within the next week on whether there is going to be a destruction of the Affordable Care Act, a destruction of the promise of access to healthcare for every The Republicans are coming back, once again, to try to destroy that promise.  The Republicans harbor an ancient animosity toward the goal of ensuring that there is, in fact, universal coverage for every single American; that it is a right and not a privilege. What they want to do is to leave these programs as debt-soaked relics of the promises that have been made to ensure that there is, in fact, coverage for every  So this is going to be the debate.  Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the great Senator from New York, used to say that when you do not want to help a program or to hurt a program, you engage in benign neglect--benign neglect. What the Republicans are doing is engaging in a program of designed neglect--of ensuring, after this designed program is put in place, that there is a reduction in coverage, that there are fewer people who get the help they need, that older people have to pay more, that fewer people get access, and that Planned Parenthood is defunded. It is all part of a program of designed neglect of the healthcare of all  This is a historic battle.

188,topic-id,956,"Mr.President, before I start my remarks on the dangers of nuclear war, I want to take a moment to congratulate the Watertown High School field hockey program in  Up until this past week, the Watertown Raiders had not lost a single field hockey game since November 12, 2008. For nearly 9 years, the Raiders have been truly perfect. Their 184-game winning streak was our Nation's longest in high school field hockey history. Their leader, Head Coach Eileen Donahue, is one of the most historic figures in Massachusetts high school athletics.  To all the former and current players, coaches, parents and supporters, I offer my congratulations on this incredible accomplishment.  Go, Watertown Congratulations on a historic streak of victories.                            Nuclear Weapons  Mr.President, now on the issue of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons give the President of the United States an unprecedented and awesome power. Nuclear weapons are the most destructive force in human history. Yet, under existing laws, the President of the United States possesses unilateral authority to launch them. If the President wants to, he has the power to initiate an offensive nuclear war, even if there is no attack on the United States or its allies. This is simply unconstitutional,[[Page S5729]]undemocratic, and simply unbelievable.  Such unconstrained power flies in the face of our Constitution, which gives Congress the sole and exclusive power to declare war. While it is vital for the President to have clear authority to respond to nuclear attacks on the United States, our forces, or our allies, no U.President should have the power to launch a nuclear first strike without congressional approval.  Such a strike would be immoral. It would be disproportionate, and it would expose the United States to the threat of devastating nuclear retaliation, which could endanger the survival of the American people and human civilization. If we lead potential enemies to believe that we may go nuclear in response to a conventional attack, then we create the very pressure that encourages them to build nuclear arsenals and keep them on high alert. This increases the risk of inadvertent nuclear war, a prospect that is just plain unacceptable.  We have the world's most powerful conventional arsenal--the strongest Air Force, the largest Navy, and the most capable Army and Marine And we have the most powerful nuclear arsenal to deter nuclear attacks. We don't need to threaten to be the first to attack with nuclear weapons to deter others from launching attacks on us or our allies.  Nuclear weapons are meant for deterrence and not for warfighting. As President Reagan said: ``A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.''  That is why I introduced legislation earlier this year and submitted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which we are now considering, to put an appropriate check on the American President's unilateral authority to launch a nuclear first strike.  Let me be clear. I am not proposing we restrict the President's authority under the Constitution to launch a nuclear attack against anyone who is carrying out a nuclear attack on the United States, our territories, or our allies. Under article II of the Constitution, the United States President has authority to repel sudden attacks as soon as our military and intelligence agencies inform him that such an enemy strike is imminent. What I have proposed does not change that.  But what I am proposing is that we take a commonsense step to check nuclear first use by prohibiting any American President from launching a nuclear first strike, except when explicitly authorized to do so by a congressional declaration of war.  Unfortunately, the need to submit this into law is more important now than it has ever been, and that is because today we have a President who is engaged in escalatory, reckless, and downright scary rhetoric with North Korea, a nation with nuclear weapons. President Trump has threatened ``fire and fury'' and has declared our military ``locked and loaded'' and ready to attack North On what seems like a daily basis, President Trump uses the kind of inflammatory rhetoric backed by his unchecked authority to launch nuclear weapons, which highlights the very situation I described earlier.  The United States threatens military action that could include nuclear weapons, North Korea responds with increasingly provocative behavior, and the world faces an ever-increasing risk of miscalculation that can lead to nuclear war.  I have been talking about no first use and the need to provide an appropriate check on any American President for a long time, but President Trump and his Twitter account have made it painfully clear why the need for a no-first-use policy exists.  No human being should have the sole authority to initiate an unprovoked nuclear war, not any American President, including Donald As long as that power exists, it must be put in check.  We need to have this debate in the United States of We don't need an accidental nuclear war. We don't need nuclear weapons to be used by the United States when we have not been attacked by nuclear weapons. And if any President would want to use that power, then he should come to Congress and ask us to vote on the use of nuclear weapons in the event we have never been attacked by them. That is the least I think the Congress should do.  We have abdicated our responsibility to declare war under the Constitution for far too long. It actually began with the Korean war. Now we face the prospect of a second Korean war. If nuclear weapons are going to be used and we have not been attacked, it should be this body that votes to give the President the ability to use those weapons.  I yield the floor.

187,topic-id,1427,"Mr.President, the most important words in our Constitution are the first three words: ``We the People.'' That is the mission statement for the United States of It is written in big, bold, beautiful letters so that even from across the room, if you can't read the details, you know what our Nation is all about. As President Lincoln summarized, a Nation ``of the people, by the people, for the people.''  What we have seen this year is quite an assault on this vision of government of, by, and for the people. It came in the form of President Trump's plan to rip healthcare from millions of Americans in order to deliver billions of dollars to the very richest among us--plan after plan, version after version, wiping out healthcare for 24 million, wiping out healthcare for 23 million, wiping out healthcare for 32 million, and so on and so forth, always over 20 million, and always delivering this enormous gift of hundreds of billions of dollars to the richest  You look at this from a little bit of distance, and it is just incredible to imagine that this could have occurred--that any member, a single member of our Nation would possibly[[Page S5728]]have supported such an outrageous, diabolical, dangerous, damaging plan to the quality of life for so many people across our  It wasn't just that it ripped healthcare from more than 20 million people. It wasn't just that it delivered billions of dollars to the wealthiest among us. It also ensured that those with preexisting conditions wouldn't be able to get care. It was also that it would have raised our premiums an estimated 20 percent for those who were able to secure insurance.  If one set out to design the worst possible healthcare plan you could ever imagine, you probably couldn't come up with one as bad as President Trump and the Republican team came up with. It seems incredible that we are still debating the basic premise of whether healthcare should be part of a standard foundation for families to thrive here in this century. Every other developed nation understands that healthcare is so essential to quality of life, so essential for our children to thrive, so essential for our families to succeed that they make sure that, just by virtue of living in a country, you have that healthcare.  Well, I have to salute the millions of Americans who weighed in to say that this diabolical plan needed to be dumped. They filled our streets and overflowed our inboxes and flooded our phones. They made it perfectly clear that healthcare is a basic human right, not a privilege reserved for the healthy and the wealthy. I certainly agree with them. We decided collectively that we were not going to allow this diabolical plan to undo the progress we made. We made significant progress with After decades of being essentially unable to change the uninsured rate, we made significant progress. There we are with a big drop in the uninsured rate--a big increase in the number of people who have access to healthcare. But we are not in that place yet where this number drops to zero. We still have 10 percent of our country that doesn't have insurance. The costs are still too high, and the deductibles and copays are too high. One out of five Americans can still not afford their prescriptions.  In addition, we have this incredibly complicated set of healthcare systems. We have Medicare and We have on-exchange, and we have off-exchange. We have the Children's Health Insurance We have workers' compensation. We have self-insurance. We have a multitude of varieties of healthcare through the workplace--some covering just the individual, others covering the entire family, some covering just a small percent of the healthcare costs and some more. Some are certainly so complicated that even the folks who have them aren't sure what the insurance company should pay.  So we found in this conversation with Americans about healthcare that Americans weighed in very strongly about the stresses and the challenges of ordinary Americans to secure healthcare. It is an ongoing lifelong effort. Do you have an employer who covers you but not your children? Can you get them on the Children's Health Insurance Program? Do you have an insurance plan at work that you have to contribute to, but the costs of contributing are so high that you really can't afford it? Do you opt out of that? Then, what happens? Or perhaps you are under Medicaid--up to 138 percent of the poverty level for those States that have expanded Medicaid--and you gain a small increase in your pay and maybe now you don't qualify. In the middle of the year, can you apply to the healthcare exchange? Will you get tax credits credited to you or will you have to pay a big sum at the end of the year when your taxes are reconciled? It is continuous applications, continuous change, and continuous stress. Why do we make it that hard?  In my 36 town halls a year--one in every county in Oregon, mostly in red counties because most of the counties in Oregon are red counties--I have had people coming out yearning for a simple, seamless system that says: Just by virtue of being an American, you have healthcare when you need it and you will not end up bankrupt. What is that vision all about? It is about taking an existing model, one that has worked so well for our seniors--the model of  Folks used to come to my town halls and they would say: I am just trying to stay alive until I reach age 65 so that I can be part of that wonderful healthcare plan--that Medicare plan. So this is a well-known commodity. I have heard some of my colleagues mocking it in the last few days. Well, certainly, maybe they should get out and have town halls. Maybe they should talk to our seniors about how well this system works. Maybe they should recognize that the overhead costs are much lower--2 percent versus 20 percent, and sometimes much more in private insurance healthcare. That is more than a fifth of our healthcare dollars simply wasted--a waste that disappears with Medicare for  This is the type of healthcare system that addresses and changes this enormous, fractured, and stressful system. We currently spend twice as much as other developed nations per person on healthcare--twice as much as France, twice as much as Canada, twice as much as Germany, and the list goes on. Yet the healthcare we receive provides less health in America than in those countries.  We should be ashamed that our infant mortality rates are higher, even though we spend twice as many dollars per capita as those other countries. So it is clear that there is significant room for improvement. By the way, there are so many opportunities to move in this direction.  We laid out this Medicare for All plan, and I salute my colleague Bernie Sanders and my additional cosponsors. There are now 17 Senators who have said: We are cosponsors to this because we know that it addresses the fractured, stressful nature of our system. We know it is more cost-effective than our current system. We know that it will lead to greater peace of mind than our current system.  Shouldn't peace of mind be what we are all about? That is the peace of mind that if your loved one gets ill or injured, they will get the care they need. The peace of mind that if your loved one is in an accident, they will get the care they need and you will not end up bankrupt.  It is time for America to have this conversation, and it is my intention, certainly, to have this conversation with the citizens of Oregon and to encourage my colleagues to have this conversation with their citizens. How can we move to a system where you can stop worrying about whether you will get the care you need, whether your loved ones will get the care they need, and that you will not end up bankrupt when you are sick or injured? That is the goal.  Let's have that conversation, America, and keep pushing toward making it a reality. I am proud to sponsor this bill. I certainly am proud to fight for quality affordable healthcare for every single American because it is a basic human right.

320,topic-id,831,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, it has been said about this body that if you invent a nice enough title for a bill, it doesn't matter what you write in the bill because all people know is what the title is. This bill is a good example of that.  Who is in favor of criminal alien gangs?  No one. But this bill has received no committee consideration in which the questions could have been asked and the answers given to make sure that the bill would do what its sponsors say it does.  But this legislation wouldn't provide decent protections against gang violence. It would shred due process protections and would allow deportation of innocent immigrants based on the flimsiest of evidence.  It would establish a Star Chamber-like process for designating criminal gangs that would provide virtually no opportunity for them to contest such a designation. Once a group is designated as a gang, an immigrant who is determined to be a member of that gang--determined under undefined procedures and standards--would be almost assured of being deported and would be subject to mandatory detention while awaiting removal.  The procedures under this bill would be laughable if they did not have such deadly consequences for so many innocent people. Suppose there are some people in my neighborhood that I think are up to no good. Maybe I have good evidence that they are committing crimes, or maybe I just don't like them. Either way, I submit a tip to Homeland Security that the group is engaged in activity that qualifies as a criminal gang under this bill.  Then, based on undefined and unknown procedures, the DHS can designate that group as a criminal gang. In doing so, it would amass some sort of administrative record, which is also completely undefined in the bill, but we know it can include secret evidence. No notice would be given to the group that is under review, and no opportunity would be given to present evidence contesting the designation; no exculpatory evidence.  After designation, there is a process for judicial review; but unless the group has the habit of scouring the Federal Register, it would have no idea that it has been labeled a gang and that it needs to go to court in 30 days. If, somehow, the group does learn of its designation, it has just 30 days to contest it, and only in a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D. That review, however, would be based entirely on the administrative record amassed by the government. The group would have no opportunity to submit evidence to rebut the designation, which renders the entire review process meaningless. That is not due process under the That is a sort of stacked process you would expect in a banana republic or in  It gets even worse. Under this bill, any alien is deportable if he or she is or has been a member of a designated gang or has participated in the gang's activities, knowing that would further its illegal activity.  But who determines that a person is a member of a gang? By what procedure? In what forum or what court? Using what standard?  The bill, given the Goodlatte amendment, does not say.  A person need not have been convicted or even charged with a crime to be deportable under this bill; and even when they are in removal proceedings, they would not be permitted to challenge the gang designation that landed them in those proceedings. Thus, we will have people deported on the basis of an unfair and secret process, with no notice and no meaningful opportunity to contest the basis for the deportation. That turns due process completely on its head.  Keeping out members of MS-13 and other deadly gangs is a worthy goal,[[Page H7392]]but this bill would not do that. It would have disastrous consequences for thousands of people each year who may or may not be members of a gang, who may or may not have any evidence against them, who will inevitably be caught up in its hash and overbroad provisions.  Mr.Speaker, just last week, President Trump upended the lives of 800,000 DREAMers who now face the possibility of being dragged away from the only country they know. Our highest priority should be providing these young, undocumented Americans the legal status they need to continue serving our Nation and being productive members of their communities.  I notice that the Speaker has said that, while he supports relief for the DREAMers, that the bill has to go through a committee.  Why didn't this bill have to go through a committee?  Instead, the Republican majority seeks to distract us from the plight of the DREAMers by returning to its mass deportation agenda based on the fear and dehumanization of immigrants.  This bill brings shame upon this House and this Nation's tradition of due process and fundamental fairness.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this unconstitutional and unconscionable legislation.  ",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgH7387-2.txt,850,0915,2017.0,14.0,September
87,topic-id,2278,"Mr.President, I wish to speak about the Defense bill, but before I do, I want to give the Senate a report.  Senator Rubio and I have been together quite a bit this past week, as Florida has not only encountered a hurricane, but this was quite unusual in that it basically affected almost all of the State of  Florida is a big If you went from Key West to Pensacola, it is as far as going from Pensacola all the way to That is how big our State is. With almost 21 million people, it is the third largest State, with 75 percent of that a population along the coast. Of course, we know what happens when hurricanes start threatening those coasts.  This was an unusual one because it was first going to hit the east coast of That was the track. The National Hurricane Center has gotten quite good in their ability to project the path and the velocity of the winds. But once it took an unexpected turn, hitting the north coast of Cuba as a category 5, its velocity and forward motion were reduced, and it then took a more westerly path, making landfall in the Middle and Lower Keys of Florida, where the winds were category 3, approaching category 4. Residents were not even let back in to see their homes until Sunday morning.  As of now, although FEMA is present in the Lower Keys--Key West--and in the Upper Keys--Key Largo--individual assistance and disaster teams were still trying to get into the areas that had the biggest impact, the areas around Big Pine Key and It is a painfully slow process. FEMA is having to deal with the problems in Texas and now the enormity of the storm affecting almost all of FEMA is stretched. But FEMA is supposed to bring emergency assistance to people, organizations, and local governments in the aftermath of a natural disaster. That will be a work in progress as we go on.  There are places where Senator Rubio and I have gotten personally involved in asking FEMA to come in, areas in Lee County and Collier Areas where FEMA had not visited, they now have come in--Lee County, east of Fort Myers, and Lehigh  The little farming community of Immokalee was exceptionally torn up. There is a great story there. The university president opened up the fieldhouse so that a lot of the poor people in Immokalee had a place to go if they didn't have another shelter. Indeed, they took in some 400 people. Elderly people in an apartment complex whose caregivers had left were picked up by the sheriff and taken to the university, and the students cared for them for 4 nights. This is a great example of Floridians helping Floridians, which we have seen throughout.  This Senator has been all over the State, much of it with my colleague, demonstrating that the two Senators, in a bipartisan way, actually get along and were there to try to help the people.  First, right after the storm in the Florida Keys, we saw damage in Key West and Boca But that was the back side of the storm. The eye of the storm had gone farther to the east, so the damage was in the northeastern quadrant since the most severe winds were in the Big Pine Key and the Marathon area. The military, the Coast Guard, FEMA, and the engineers came in immediately after the storm. Floridians helping Americans helping  Then Senator Rubio and I went to the Jacksonville area. Quite unusual was that all the extra rainfall had flowed into the Johns River The river had swollen, and all of that water was trying to get its normal outlet into the Atlantic Ocean at But lo and behold, the winds covering up the entire peninsula moving northward, now the eye over land between Tampa and Orlando and that northeastern quadrant of those winds coming from east going west--what did it do at Jacksonville? It pushed back all of the water that needed to get out into the That, combined with the incoming high tide--what you had was phenomenal flooding, an overflowing of the banks of the Johns River in many places in the Upper Johns, at considerable loss of property and considerable distress to the citizens. A good part of downtown Jacksonville was flooded.  The next day, Senator Rubio and I ended up in a citrus grove in Lake Wales, Fifty percent of the fruit in this citrus grove was on the ground. Farther south, 75 percent of the citrus crop was on the ground. They can't salvage that. That is a huge percentage of the loss. So it made Senator Rubio and me all the more determined that we are going to try to pass an amendment to the Tax Code that would give the citrus growers of Florida--not only because of this loss but also because of every grove now infected by a bacteria called citrus greening that will kill the tree in 5 years--that would give the citrus industry a chance to start over by plowing under the grove of those diseased citrus trees and replanting new stock that has new promise to outlast the bacteria--at least for a number of years more than the 5 years that will kill the tree--until we can find the cure, and we are working on that. But do that in the IRS Code by allowing them to expense in the first year the plowing under and replanting in order to save the citrus industry.  Senator Rubio and I were in that grove and saw all of that lost crop. That was going to be a promising crop[[Page S5778]]for the first time in 10 years of declines of the citrus crop because of the bacteria. This was going to be a good year, but we saw half of that crop on the ground in that grove, lost, gone. Citrus crop insurance is not going to really help them--only if it is a much greater loss.  From there, the two of us went on to a poor part of Florida, east of Lake Okeechobee, called Belle A lot of the residences were torn up by the winds.  This was a hurricane whose winds affected virtually all of the peninsula of Florida and even reached over into the panhandle as far as Tallahassee and even other parts west.  In Belle Glade, we served a meal. Charities had come together to bring food to hungry people because they had no power and they had no refrigeration. It had been several days since the hurricane, and therefore they had no food.  From there, we went to another very poor part of Florida, Immokalee, FL, which I described earlier, which had been torn up considerably.  Whether it was what I just described or whether it was feeding poor people in Apopka, FL, who at that point had been without power for 5 days, and they had no food because there was no refrigeration, or whether it was going down to Lehigh Acres, where the Florida National Guard had organized the distribution of MREs, which are meals ready to eat, and gallons of fresh water because so many of those homes out in Lehigh Acres, east of Fort Myers, were on water wells, and without electricity, there were no pumps to give them water--there are so many things that we often take for granted. If power is taken away, you suffer not only because of the 90 degree-plus heat and humidity but also because you can't even get any water because you are on a water well.  It was a privilege to be there with the Florida National Guard, handing out food, handing out water, and talking to those local residents who are living paycheck to paycheck--and now they have no paycheck. Where is the FEMA assistant to help them? Because there is no power, they can't go online to apply for individual assistance. In fact, they can't pick up the phone because of the intermittent cell service. Even if they could get a cell signal, they couldn't get through to the FEMA number. That is why we wanted the FEMA representatives to come in, and fortunately, just yesterday, they finally did come in.  It has been quite a couple of weeks--first, anticipating the storm coming in and getting all of the emergency operation centers ready. Fortunately, people obeyed the evacuation orders. It was estimated that out of the population of almost 100,000 in the Keys, there were only 10,000 left. That was a huge evacuation. Those folks did not get in to find out what was left of their homes until yesterday. You can imagine, a week after the storm had hit--the weekend before the Keys--all of that water was in there, setting in with the heat and the humidity, the mold and the mildew. You can imagine the mess, the cleanup.  All the while, FEMA has to worry about Texas, now Florida, and maybe another hurricane that is going to come up. It looks as though it is going to turn out to sea but is still going to have some of the wind effects along the northeast Atlantic  Floridians helping Floridians--and then there was a great, great tragedy that occurred 4 days after the hurricane. Why there is not a requirement that every nursing home or assisted living facility, an ALF, have a generator not only for power, for lights, but have a generator capacity that will run air conditioning units--I think this is going to be the subject of great debate that I hope will change that requirement in the State of Florida because eight people died. Eight people died in a nursing home right across the street from a major hospital in Hollywood, FL--eight frail elderly, from ages 70 to 99--eight needless deaths as a result. A criminal investigation is underway.  All the phone calls that had been made that were not answered, both to the government as well as to the power company, as reported by the press, specifically a Miami television station--we don't know all the facts; they will come out in the criminal investigation. But it is inexcusable that eight frail, elderly people would die from heat exhaustion by being left so that their condition deteriorated over the course of 3 or 4 days.  What is wrong with a regulatory scheme that does not have a backup generator that would kick in when, in fact, the hospital right across the street had one? What was the disconnect there? Why did it take days and days until 911 was called? We will find out in this great tragedy.  I can tell you, the Miami Herald had done a series, over the last couple of years, of three investigative pieces, which pointed out that these ALFs and these nursing homes had not been properly managed or regulated by the State of That is to be determined.  Hurricane Irma is just another reminder that we are going to confront huge natural occurrences and maybe, just maybe, people will realize there is something to the fact that the Earth is getting hotter. Because of that, two-thirds of the Earth is covered by oceans, with the oceans absorbing 90 percent of that heat. What happens to water when it is heated? It expands. Thus, the sea levels are rising.  Mr.President, as we turn to this Defense bill, this is an issue of national security. As Secretary of Defense Mattis has said, ``Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today.''  Maybe we should pay attention to issues like those I have just described in Florida or maybe in Or what about tornadoes causing damage to military depots in Georgia? Or what about the severe heat canceling military training and hail storms damaging aircraft in Texas? What about the coastal erosion, not only in Florida but also threatening early-warning radar in Alaska? What about the wildfires causing ranges to be closed and the flooding that we saw in not only Texas but also the flooding damaging military logistics rail in Louisiana and affecting warehouses containing hazardous materials in Virginia?  That is why, in this version of the Defense bill that we will pass today, there is a provision that this Senator had something to do with, which calls for the Defense Department to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the threats to the training and readiness of our Armed Forces and the military infrastructure caused by climate-related events.  It is critical that we recognize the threat so we will ensure that our forces and installations are resilient enough to withstand and quickly recover from all of these natural disasters that we have been talking about. Not only must we ensure that our military infrastructure is resilient, we must also ensure that it provides our warfighters with the space they need to train and the technology they need to stay ahead of our adversaries.  I have opined on this subject over and over in speeches to the I have opined over and over about the Gulf Test and Training Range that the Air Force needs to make huge investments in for the precise measurements of all of our sophisticated weapons and our systems.  I thank Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed for their good work on the bill. It begins to address some of the training and readiness shortfalls in our military. I look forward to continuing to discuss this.  I yield the floor.                   Recognition of the Minority Leader  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There is no known cure, and there is no known reliable treatment to relieve its symptoms nor prolong the life of its victims.

101,topic-id,14677,"Thank you, Mr.As we approach the final vote on[[Page S5786]]the fiscal year 2018 national defense authorization bill, I would like to make a few closing comments.  When we began considering this bill last week, Senator McCain and I were interested in returning to regular order and having debate and votes on any amendment that needed a vote. We actually started off very well.  While I disagreed with Senator Paul's amendment to sunset the current authorization for the use of military force, I am pleased we were able to follow regular order on his amendment and have a debate. It is my hope that we can use this as a step to restore regular order going forward and work together, along with Senator Paul, in drafting a new AUMF that more precisely addresses the threats we face and resolves the issue, which is very critical, that Senator Paul has raised; that is, updating the  After the Paul amendment, however, we were unable to come to an agreement on further votes. As a result, several issues that are important to both sides were not fully considered. On the Democratic side, Senators Baldwin, Stabenow, and Donnelly had very important amendments that would have ensured important protection for American workers and that our servicemembers receive high-quality, domestically produced equipment.  In addition, Senator Durbin had an important amendment that supports the world-class medical research DOD conducts and has a profound impact on the health of our servicemembers and citizens alike. Senator Warren would have liked a discussion on the INF Treaty, and Senator Gillibrand was interested in a full debate on protections for military personnel who are transgender.  As I indicated, I also know there are Members on the other side of the aisle who also had important issues they wanted to debate. I regret we were not able to have those debates and votes.  I am pleased, however, that we are able to include several dozen agreed-upon amendments in this bill from both Democrats and Republicans which will strengthen the legislation. In the end, this bill represents a strong bipartisan effort to provide the military with the resources they need and the support they deserve.  Moving forward, more work needs to be done. It is clear we need to find a sustainable, equitable path forward that will end sequestration and provide the additional resources needed for our current readiness shortfalls. I look forward to working together to continue to address the needs of the Department and our servicemembers.  I would like to close by thanking Senator McCain in my remarks about the NDAA for his leadership in guiding this bill through our committee markup process and the floor. I believe this bill truly exemplifies Senator McCain's unrivaled dedication to the men and women of our Armed His firm hand and unwavering resolve for a bipartisan approach were invaluable in achieving a bill that reflects the priorities of many Members on both sides of the aisle.  Additionally, I would like to thank the committee staff who worked tirelessly over many weeks to make this bill a reality. I thank the majority staff director, Chris Brose, and his staff for their hard work and commitment to a bipartisan process. I would also like to thank my staff for their expertise and dedication to creating the best bill possible--Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon Clark, Jonathan Epstein, Jorie Feldman, Jon Green, Creighton Greene, Ozge Guzelsu, Gary Leeling, Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara, Bill Monahan, Mike Noblet, John Quirk, Arun Seraphin, and Elizabeth Finally, I would like to thank the floor staff, without whom none of this could be accomplished.  I must say, having completed a truly bipartisan process using regular order, I am disappointed to hear that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to bring back the partisan efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with preexisting conditions and decimate Medicare as we know it.  We have already spent so much time this year having this fight--time we could have spent working on a bipartisan basis to improve our health care system and lower costs. We voted decisively in July to reject the partisan bill. With these votes, Senators on both sides of the aisle decided we would return to regular order and work toward bipartisan health care solutions that could get at least 60 votes in this body.  As I have highlighted, this kind of bipartisan approach is why we have been successful in bringing the NDAA to the floor each year, and Senators Alexander and Murray have been doing just that with respect to the HELP They have had four hearings over the last two weeks, with witnesses from both parties, from Governors to health insurance commissioners, to leaders in the industry. I have great confidence in my colleagues and their ability to craft a bipartisan bill to improve the ACA that a majority of Senators could support. This is a bipartisan, inclusive process, and I should note, it is undertaken by one of the two committees that have jurisdiction for health care.  So for my Republican colleagues to now decide, after this critical work is already underway, that we are going to scratch those efforts and return instead to a partisan process, in which not even Republican Senators have had the opportunity to fully review the bill, make changes or even get analysis of the bill, I think that process is wrong. Let's not be fooled by the new effort. The legislation would have the same effects as the other versions of TrumpCare we saw rejected.  We have heard the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on the latest version of This is not the right process. It is not representative of the legislative process.  I would urge my colleagues to reject this approach and, rather, follow the example I think we have tried to set in NDAA--a bipartisan, regular process, in which amendments are offered by both sides, in which debate is undertaken, in which we come to a conclusion based on 60 votes and move forward to improve the country, particularly to protect the men and women in the armed services.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Lankford). The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, today the Senate will vote on final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. This is the culmination of months of bipartisan work, and it is a product in which all Senators and all Americans can take great pride. I want to thank, once again, my friend and colleague the Senator from Rhode His partnership on this legislation has been invaluable.  The fundamental purpose of this legislation, which has united Senators from both sides of the aisle, is to provide our Armed Forces what they need to do the jobs we ask of them. We, in this body, have no higher duty than to do everything we can to support our fellow Americans who serve and sacrifice every day to keep us safe.  This legislation does that. It keeps faith with our men and women in uniform. It supports a national defense budget of $700 billion for fiscal year 2018, which exceeds the administration's request by $37 billion and the defense spending caps in the Budget Control Act by $91 billion. The decision of the Committee on Armed Services to authorize these additional resources was unanimous and bipartisan, and it is a significant statement on the troubling state of our military today.  My friends, for too long, our Nation has asked our men and women in uniform to do too much with far too little. Much of the blame lies with the last administration, but we in Congress cannot escape responsibility. Our military's job is hard enough, but we are making it harder through continuing resolutions, unpredictable funding, and arbitrary spending caps that we put into law 6 years ago before the rise of ISIS, before the current crisis with North Korea, before Russia's return to aggression on the world stage, and before so many other dangerous developments.  We have been warned--we have been warned, my friends--that we can't go on like this. We have been warned. Earlier this year, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joseph Dunford, warned us: ``In just a few years if we don't change the trajectory, we will lose our qualitative and our quantitative competitive edge, [and] the consequences will be profound.'' The Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis,[[Page S5787]]also warned us, saying: ``We are no longer managing risk; we are now gambling.''  We are gambling, my friends. We are gambling with the lives of the best among us, and we are now seeing the cost--the tragic but foreseeable cost--of an overworked, strained force, with aging equipment and not enough of it.  On June 17, seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off the coast of On July 10, a Marine KC-130 crash in Mississippi killed all 16 troops on board. On August 5, an Osprey helicopter crash off the coast of Australia resulted in the deaths of three On August 15, an Army helicopter crashed off the coast of Hawaii, with five soldiers presumed dead. On August 21, 10 sailors perished when the USS McCain collided with a tanker near On August 25, an Army Black Hawk helicopter went down during a training mission off the coast of Yemen, and one soldier died. Earlier this month in Nevada, two Air Force A-10 aircraft crashed into each other. Thank God the pilots safely ejected, but the planes were lost, at a cost of over $100 million.  Just last week--just last week, as we debated this legislation--there were additional accidents. Last Tuesday, one soldier died during helicopter training at Fort Last Wednesday, an amphibious vehicle explosion at Camp Pendleton injured 15 marines. Last Thursday, a demolition accident at Fort Bragg killed another soldier and injured seven others.  My friends, more of our men and women in uniform are now being killed in totally avoidable training accidents and routine operations than by our enemies in combat. Let me repeat that. More of our men and women in uniform are now being killed in totally avoidable training accidents and routine operations than by our enemies in combat.  Where is the outrage? Where is our sense of urgency to deal with this problem? Congress can criticize this administration or the last administration all we want, and there is plenty of blame to go around, but the constitutional responsibility is to ``raise and support Armies'' and ``provide and maintain a Navy.'' That responsibility is ours. How can we believe that we are meeting our responsibilities when young Americans in uniform are not receiving the necessary resources and capabilities to perform their missions? My friends, that blame rests with us, the  I know many of my colleagues agree. I have heard them--both Republicans and Democrats--speak for years about the harmful effects sequestration is having on our military and many other Federal agencies with a national security mission. How do we explain our failure to deal with this problem last week? We had an opportunity. This legislation was open for amendments under regular order for an entire week. There was an amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas to repeal sequestration. The amendment was written in a bipartisan way and would have ended sequestration, not only for defense but nondefense spending as well. We had an opportunity to tell all of our men and women in uniform that the Senate finally was doing everything it could to support them. We had an opportunity, and we failed. Worse than that, we didn't even try. We couldn't even agree to vote.  It makes me so angry, but more than that it makes me sad. It breaks my heart.  How do we explain our failure to our men and women who are serving? How do we explain to Americans who are risking their lives for us that we could not summon the courage to take some hard votes? How can we explain we couldn't come together and vote together when it mattered most? How do we explain the signal our inaction sends to all who are serving that Congress has higher priorities than rebuilding our military? We should be ashamed of ourselves.  For those of you who will soon vote for this National Defense Authorization Act, which will authorize the necessary resources to begin rebuilding our military, let me thank you; let me thank you; let me thank you. You can be proud that you are voting for a good piece of legislation, but this legislation is only part of the solution. We still have no path to actually appropriate the money that we are about to authorize. That requires a bipartisan agreement to adjust the spending caps in the Budget Control  For all of you who will join me in voting to authorize these vital additional resources for our military, I would also urge you to join me in demanding and passing a bipartisan agreement so that we can appropriate those resources. This will require some hard work. It will require some teamwork and some trust in each other. It will require having the courage of our convictions. But in the end, it will require much less of us than the service and sacrifice we ask every day from our men and women in uniform, which they so dutifully provide us.  I do not want to have to call another grieving mother or father or spouse after their loved one has perished in a mishap that might have been prevented if Congress had done its job. Let's find a way to appropriate the resources for our military that we will soon authorize. Our men and women in uniform deserve no less.  Mr.President, I will suggest a short quorum call while we get these final agreed-upon amendments on the bill at this time. It shouldn't take more than 3 or 4 minutes.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Mr.Mr.President, I yield back my remaining time.  The PRESIDING All postcloture time has expired.  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a third time.

139,topic-id,199,"Madam President, I want to join the chairman with respect to noting the progress we have made with respect to 100 amendments. They have been bipartisan. They have been carefully weighed by the staff.  We are still continuing to work together to see if there are additional amendments we can incorporate before we conclude this bill. I think the amendments have strengthened the bill. I think it does reflect the bipartisan effort.  Also, along with the chairman, we would have liked to have been able to do more and have more debate, more votes, but at the end of the day, we are going to have a national defense authorization bill that responds to current threats, that responds to the stresses and demands on our personnel across the globe, and also be well positioned to go into conference and hopefully further improve this legislation in the conference process.  Once again, I will say this is in large part the result of Chairman McCain's leadership--creating an atmosphere of bipartisan cooperation, of thoughtful debate, and doing it in a way that brings out the best in all of us. I thank him for that.  Madam President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgS5727-3.txt,1982,ELIMINATING GOVERNMENT-FUNDED OIL-PAINTING ACT,2017.0,14.0,September
236,topic-id,317,"Mr.President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators Klobuchar, Brown, King, Franken, and Whitehouse in introducing the Weekend Voting This bill makes voting in Federal elections easier and more accessible through one simple change: moving Election Day from Tuesday to the following Saturday and Sunday in November of an election year.  We know from surveys and common sense that Tuesday voting stands in the way of greater voter participation. In 1845, Congress set Tuesday as Election Day because it was the easiest day for farmers--then travelling by horse and buggy--to make it to the polls in the course of their regular Tuesday trips to bring goods to market. Tuesday voting has no such benefit for farmers, or anyone else, in the 21st It does, however, force many Americans to choose between their workday and family responsibilities, and participation in our democratic process.  According to the Pew Research Center, voter turnout in the United States regularly lags behind other developed countries, many of which hold elections on one or more days during the weekend. According to U.Census data, the most consistent reason Americans give for not voting is that they are too busy to get away from their daily lives to make it to the polls.  The Weekend Voting Act would give Americans the ability to vote during times that make better sense for them. Rather than on a Tuesday, polls would stay open during the first Saturday and Sunday after the first Friday in November of an election year. States would retain full autonomy to continue to offer alternatives to Election Day voting, such as early voting or voting by mail, and States are encouraged to give special consideration to accommodate weekend religious practices.  Mr.President, I urge my colleagues to support the Weekend Voting Act so that more Americans can take part in our democratic process by voting at times that work for them.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-18-pt1-PgS5802.txt,1982,TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NYUMBANI CHILDREN'S HOME,2017.0,18.0,September
257,topic-id,394,"Mr.President, I again thank the chairman for his leadership. It has been critical, as has been demonstrated throughout the process during our subcommittee hearings and our committee hearings, but even before that, the chairman insisted upon hearings that were comprehensive so, as we prepared for this NDAA, we had a sense of the threats we faced, the resources we needed, and, as a result, as the chairman pointed out, we were able to send to the floor, with a unanimous vote, a very strong defense bill.  Since that time, working together, we have been able to incorporate over 100 amendments which improve the bill. As the chairman pointed out, we are still working on issues we hope we can bring forward for either adoption or, through debate, a vote, and I hope we can do that. Again, as the chairman pointed out, this is a rare instance of regular order--of the committee report coming to the floor, moving to it by a strong vote, taking up and working to get amendments that are not controversial into the package, and then going ahead and, we hope, setting up debate, discussion, and votes on more difficult and challenging issues. I was encouraged by Senator Schumer's comment that we can anticipate a date for final passage of this bill.  We are confident we will have a national defense bill leaving the Senate and going to conference now. The final outline of that bill is still to be determined, and I hope we can add more to it. That is a very principled process of talking back-and-forth.  Again, I don't think any of this would have been done without the leadership of the chairman and his insistence that we adhere not only to regular order but that we don't forget this is ultimately about the men and women who serve us overseas.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, the Senator from Rhode Island, my dear friend, Jack Reed, is too kind. It takes two to tango. The partnership we have developed over the years has made it possible for us to get to the place we have in the past and we are today.

261,topic-id,2361,"Mr.President, I would like to turn to discuss my amendment to counter malign Russian influence.  Amendment 939, sponsored by Senators McCain, Portman, Cardin, Brown, Warner, Whitehouse, Durbin, and myself, would advance U.national security interests by requiring the President to submit to Congress a strategy for countering the threat of Russia's influence activities intended to undermine democracy in the United States, Europe, and across the world and to disrupt the global international order.  The amendment would require the President to provide Congress a strategy that is comprehensive, using every tool at our disposal to counter Russia's malign activities. The strategy would direct actions across the whole of government, including the following areas: security measures, the strategy would include actions to counter Russian hybrid warfare operations, building the capabilities of allies and partners to identify, attribute, and respond to Russian malign activities, short of conflict, and supporting the NATO alliance[[Page S5716]]and other security partnerships against Russian aggression; on information operations--the strategy would seek to counter Russia's use of disinformation and propaganda in social media as well as traditional media and to strengthen interagency mechanisms for coordinating and effectively implementing a whole-of-government response to Russian active measures; in the area of cyber, the strategy would require steps to defend against, deter, and when necessary respond to malicious cyber activities by the Kremlin, including the use of offensive cyber capabilities consistent with policies specified elsewhere in the act; in the political and diplomatic arenas, the strategy would be required to set out actions to enhance the resilience of U.democratic institutions and infrastructure and to work with countries vulnerable to malign Russian influence to promote good governance and strengthen democracy abroad; in the area of financial measures, the strategy would address the corrupt and illicit Russian financial networks in the United States and abroad that have facilitated and Russia's malign influence; and finally, on energy security, the strategy would include steps to promote the energy security of our European allies and partners, reducing Russia's ability to use energy dependence as a weapon of coercion or influence.  The amendment would also require that the administration's strategy be consistent with prior legislation relating to Russia's malign activities, including the Russian Sanctions Act that recently passed with overwhelming support in Congress; the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014, and the Magnitsky Act of 2012. This amendment would fill an important gap in our current approach to relations with To date, the Trump administration has been unwilling, for whatever reason, to articulate and implement an appropriate response to the threat to our democratic institutions and security posed by Russia's malign influence activities. This amendment would address this critical national security requirement.  It is both appropriate and critically important that this requirement for a strategy to counter Russian malign influence be amended to the National Defense Authorization Act because ultimately this is fundamentally an issue of national security. The administration's failure to acknowledge the insidious interference by Vladimir Putin and his cronies for what it really is--an attack by a foreign adversary on Western democracies and the institutions underpinning the global order--has real implications to our national security. The administration's lack of action to counter this malign influence only encourages the Kremlin to continue its aggression against the United States and its allies and partners.  The Russians know they cannot win in a conventional war, so they have adapted their tactics asymmetrically to leverage their strengths. These tactics pose a real threat, and we need to appropriately posture ourselves, using all tools of statecraft, to counter Russian malign influence.  Before President Obama left office, he ordered an intelligence review of Russian interference in U.elections.  On January 6, the U.intelligence community released a report on its findings on Russian interference in our democracy. This report included the consensus view of all 17 intelligence agencies, including the CIA, the National Security Agency, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Among the key findings were President Putin ``ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.presidential election''; ``Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency''; ``Russia's influence campaign was multifaceted, combining old-fashion Russian propaganda techniques with cyber espionage against U.political organizations and mass disclosure of government and private data:; ``Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards''; and ``Russia's state-run propaganda machine contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.''  These findings were made public on January 6--over 8 months ago--with the additional warning from our intelligence experts that ``Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes.''  Furthermore, with each passing week more evidence comes to light about the depths to which the Kremlin went to interfere with our democracy.  Just last week, we learned that a Kremlin-linked troll factory bought $100,000 worth of Facebook ads which were further disseminated through bot networks as part of Russia's attempt to influence our 2016 Presidential election. The ads traced back to 470 fake accounts and pages on Facebook and mostly focused on pushing politically divisive issues such as gun rights, immigration, LBGT rights, and racial discrimination. Further reporting by the New York Times laid out in lurid detail how these fake accounts amplified other tactics of Russian malign influence and ginned up web traffic to DCLeaks--the site where Russian military intelligence first posted hacked emails.  The New York Times also reported that hundreds or thousands of fake Twitter accounts regularly posted anti-Clinton messages and used Twitter to draw attention to hacked materials during last year's campaign. Cybersecurity firm Fireye concluded that many of these Twitter accounts were associated with one another and linked back to Russian military intelligence.  This is just one tactic of influence that Russia is using as part of the wide ranging campaign it is waging against us.  Again and again, Russia has used the range of coercive tools at its disposal--including political pressure; economic manipulation; collaboration with corrupt local networks; propaganda, deception and denials; and, increasingly, military force--to try to intimidate democratic countries and undermine the further integration of NATO, the European Union, and other Western institutions.  It is clear that we need a strategy and we need it soon; yet what is surprising and disturbing is that the White House has failed to direct that a plan be developed to counter this Russian malign threat and to prepare our country for renewed Russian interference in the upcoming 2018 and 2020 elections. Time is running out.  We are now 8 months into the Trump administration.  During this time, numerous administration officials have publicly reinforced the findings of the intelligence community's January assessment of the threat posed by Russia's malign influence activities.  On May 11, Director of Central Intelligence Mike Pompeo said he hoped that we learn from Russian activity in the 2016 election and be able to more effectively defeat it.  On May 14, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, ``I don't think there's any question that the Russians were playing around in our electoral processes.''  On May 23, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats stated, ``There clearly is a consensus that Russia has meddled in our election process . . . Russia's always been doing these kind of things with influence campaigns but they're doing it much more sophisticated through the use of cyber and other techniques than they did before.''  On June 13, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis stated, ``We're recognizing the strategic threat that Russia is provided by its misbehavior.''  On July 9, 2017, U.Ambassador Nikki Haley stated, ``Everybody knows that [the Russians] are not just meddling in the United States' election. They're doing this across multiple continents, and they're doing this in a way that they're trying to cause chaos within the countries.''  On August 5, National Security Adviser H.McMaster described the threat from Russia ``as a very sophisticated campaign of subversion and disinformation and--and propaganda that is ongoing every day in an effort to break apart Europe and to pit political groups against each other to sow dissension . . . and conspiracy theories.''  Yet, despite the assessment from the intelligence community and these acknowledgements from the President's[[Page S5717]]own national security team that Russian malign influence and interference in our 2016 election and the elections of our close allies in Europe pose a national security threat, the President has yet to direct that actions be taken to counter Russian malign influence. As far as we know, the Oval Office has not ordered the national security team even to formulate a strategy to address these pressing threats from Putin and his cronies. Time is running out.  In fact, 8 months in, and despite the assessments of his Cabinet, the President can't even clearly admit that the threat is coming from  On January 11, President Trump stated, ``As far as hacking, I think it was But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.''  On April 30, President Trump said, ``It's very hard to say who did the hacking . . . I'll go along with Could've been China, could've been a lot of different groups.''  On May 11, President Trump said, ``If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it's a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it.''  On July 6, just prior to his meeting with President Putin, President Trump said, ``It could have very well been Russia but it could well have been other countries and I won't be specific but I think a lot of people interfered. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure.''  Let's stop and think about that for a minute. ``No one really knows for sure''? That this is even a question runs completely counter to the informed assessments of the entire intelligence community and the President's own national security team. It is time President Trump admits what the rest of us know to be true.  We also know, from multiple administration officials' testimony to Congress, that the President has not directed his Cabinet or senior staff to work on a strategy.  On May 11, when our colleague and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee Senator Warner asked DNI Coats where we stand in terms of preparation against a future Russian attack, he couldn't think of a single thing. He replied, ``Relative to a grand [Russia] strategy, I am not aware right now of any--I think we're still assessing the impact.''  On June 8, when our colleague Senator Heinrich asked whether the President had inquired about what the FBI Director, our government, or the intelligence community should be doing to protect America against Russian interference in our election system, former FBI director James Comey stated, ``I don't recall a conversation like that.''  When I asked Defense Secretary Mattis on June 13 whether the President had directed him to begin intensive planning to protect our electoral system against the next Russian cyber attack, he was not able to point to any guidance indicating that the President recognizes the urgency of the Russian threat or the necessity of preparing to counter it next year during the midterm elections.  On June 21, officials from the Department of Homeland Security testified that 21 States were potentially targeted by Russian Government linked hackers in advance of the 2016 Presidential election. When I asked these officials whether the President had directed them to come up with a plan to protect our critical elections infrastructure, they also responded no.  On June 28, Representative Sherman asked U.Ambassador to the U.Nikki Haley whether she had even talked to the President about Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election. She replied that she had not talked to the President about the subject.  On July 7, in a press conference at the G-8 summit after the President's meeting with President Putin, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated, ``I think the relationship [with Russia]--and the President made this clear as well--is too important, and it's too important not to find a way to move forward.''  It is long past the point where anyone can deny that Russia interfered in our election and the elections of our allies and partners in This should have been a priority on day 1.  We need to formulate a strategy and take action across the whole of government to counter the threat from  We cannot just ignore this problem or sweep Kremlin attacks on our elections and those of our close European allies under the rug and move forward. We need a strategy to counter Russian malign influence that leverages all our tools of power across the government.  Though President Trump may be unwilling to confront or condemn Russian interference in our democracy, we in Congress have been willing and able to take a stand to put pressure on Russia and push back against Russian malign influence.  As you are all aware, we took an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 98-2 this summer and passed long-overdue Russian sanctions. That was an important first step, but more must be done. We must act because the Trump administration has refused.  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Members from both sides of the aisle in sponsoring this amendment. As former FBI director James Comey said when he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, ``It's not a Republican thing or Democratic thing. It really is an American thing. They're going to come for whatever party they choose to try and work on behalf of . . . They're just about their own advantage. And they will be back.''  This amendment will ensure the administration does take appropriate action. It will direct the President to formulate a comprehensive strategy to ensure that, when Putin and his minions come back in 2018 and 2020, we will have appropriate measures in place to detect, deter, and counter this serious threat to our democracy.  I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this important and necessary amendment.

424,topic-id,296,"Mr.President, the Senator from Wisconsin has pointed out one of the shortcomings in this process, which is that we have not had a series of amendments on the floor to vote on.  Through the chairman's leadership, we have, as he has indicated, cleared 103 amendments on a bipartisan basis. We think we have legislation that is important for the Nation, particularly for our men and women in uniform.  Senator Baldwin raises an extremely important question. ``Buy American'' is not only for the people we represent all across the country but for the quality of goods and services that our men and women in uniform will receive. I thank her, and I join with her in the frustration of not having a vote, despite the progress we have made in so many other areas. This is something that both the chairman and I would like to see remedied in the next national defense debate on the floor.  As the chairman pointed out, this will be an issue at conference. I know Senator Baldwin will not cease her efforts. She has been incredibly tenacious in pushing forward this ``Buy American'' provision on behalf of her constituents and all of our constituents. I do, in fact, support this provision, and I will work to my utmost to see that we can move this issue forward. I appreciate very much the fact that it will be considered in conference.  Again, I think we have done a lot over the last several days with the leadership of Chairman I regret that we can't wrap up this legislation with several votes on issues, which each side would like to see, but I commit myself to work with the Senator from Wisconsin to see if we can move this ``Buy American'' provision forward.

67,topic-id,4150,"Mr.President, 2 weeks ago this very evening, I had just finished my time as Presiding Officer over the Senate, and I made the decision that early the next morning I would be returning to Florida instead of staying here the following day. The reason was that at that time and in that moment, the strongest storm ever recorded out of the Atlantic was bearing down first on the Caribbean and headed not just toward Florida but actually toward the city in which I live. Then the Nation and State watched over the next few days as that storm took its track.  There has been a lot said about Hurricane Irma since that time. I have heard some say that it could have been worse, and I imagine in some particular instances perhaps that is true. Had that storm entered through Tampa Bay, FL, the loss would have been incalculable. Had it hit directly throughout the southeast coast, right through the major metropolitan areas of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, the economic costs would have been very significant. So it is possible that the storm could have had an even greater impact, but it is difficult to say that to the people who were impacted by it.  It was a unique storm in a lot of different ways, like the sheer scope of it. One of the things that really perplexed people in Florida, including myself--we were thinking perhaps we should move our families to another part of the We have a very good building code in Florida, but there are no structures under our building code that can withstand the hurricane winds of a category 4 storm. It is very difficult to do that, given the height and level of construction.  One of the difficult things about figuring out where to go is that the whole State was covered by it. It was a huge storm in its size and an enormous storm in its impact. I know for a fact that dozens of people left South Florida, as an example, and drove to another part of the State, only to find themselves actually worse off than they would have been had they stayed home. There was no way to know that at the time.  I can tell you, maybe it is because of our history with hurricanes. Obviously, in 1992, as a student at the University of Florida, I was home, the semester was about to begin, and Hurricane Andrew came barreling through there. It fundamentally altered what South Dade looked like.  Whether it was the impact of the storms in 2004 or 2005 or perhaps it was the images from Harvey from just a few weeks ago and the impact it has had on Houston and the State of Texas, people took the threat incredibly seriously, and there was a massive evacuation, perhaps the single largest evacuation in the history of the United  In any event, the storm did come. We measure the impact of the storm first and foremost by the loss of life, and there were 59 people who lost their lives--directly related to the storm in one way or another. Eleven of those people died after the storm from carbon monoxide poisoning. When power is lost, people run generators, sometimes even running them inside their homes. Carbon monoxide gets on them, and before you know it, they are dead. At least a dozen more didn't die, but they had been poisoned. It is an incredible threat after storms that we see every single time.  Nine people died in Monroe County, some from natural causes, although it[[Page S5851]]is hard to imagine that having a heart attack in the middle of the storm or in the aftermath wasn't somehow related to the stress such a storm brings.  Of course, we all heard the horrifying news last week that eight senior citizens had lost their lives because a nursing home's air-conditioning unit failed them in the middle of the night. The heat became unbearable, and they passed.  You can only think, despite these horrible tragedies of losing 59 people, how many more would have died had they not heeded the warnings to evacuate.  So I begin talking about the storm today by thanking the men and women who responded before and after the storm--and even during it--who kept so many people safe, and they did so even though their own families were being impacted by the storm. If you see a police officer or a firefighter from a community in Florida, they have homes, they have children, they have families, and they, too, are concerned about the impact it could have on them. Even as they are out there getting the rest of us ready, they have to think about themselves and about their own families. We thank them for the extraordinary work they do every day but in particular--at this moment--because of the storm.  We think about the National These were people who, on Monday or Tuesday of that week, were at the accounting firm or doing whatever their job might be. They were called up, and within a matter of hours found themselves on the road and headed toward an uncertain number of days that lay ahead.  We think of all the people throughout the emergency operations centers--from the State center in the capital to all of the counties--who put in over a dozen hours a day, if not more, preparing to handle the storm.  We thank the Coast Guard for the extraordinary work they do and the Department of Defense, particularly the Navy, which were prepared to respond--and did so--to the storm, even as many of them were coming off similar duty just a few weeks earlier responding to  Of course, we thank the first responders, who came in from all over the country. I was in the Florida Keys on Friday, and I ran into firefighters and police officers from as far away as Colorado, and we thank them for coming all the way to Florida to help us. We could not have done it without them.  I would also be remiss if I didn't thank the National Hurricane The improvements that have continued to happen year after year have helped improve not just the forecast track of the storm but its intensity, even though I can tell you, all hurricanes are bad. Obviously, the stronger they get, the more damaging they become. I would just say that the work they do--we had 5, 6 days to get ready for this, and it all began because of the National Hurricane They don't always have that much time, but they were able to give us and everyone proper notice. You can't carry out these evacuations unless you have accurate meteorological information, and they did an extraordinary job and continue to do so now, monitoring the new storm that tomorrow is going to make landfall over the island of Puerto Rico, potentially as a category 5 but certainly a category 4; I will talk about that more in a moment. We thank them and so many others. There are so many to mention that we would run out of time, but we thank them.  Let's first talk about some of the challenges. The first challenge, as I said earlier, is the scope of the storm. If you know anything about Florida, it is a peninsula, the third largest State in the country in terms of population. But it is a peninsula that sticks out into the Gulf of Mexico and into the Caribbean Basin in the Florida It is a huge  From Jacksonville, FL, in the northeast all the way down to Key West is a long distance, and we are talking about a storm that had damage in Key West, damage in Jacksonville and the southwest in Naples and the central part of the State and the southeast. Literally, the entire State of Florida was impacted by the storm because of its size and because of the route that it took, and that poses all kinds of challenges.  Our emergency operations system is built on the idea that if two counties are hit, all the other counties help respond. Well, every county was being hit. Every county was getting ready. So that right away put a real strain on our emergency operations system. We were counting on other counties being able to help us, but they couldn't because they themselves were getting ready to deal with the impact of the storm.  There were prepositioned assets in Alabama and Georgia getting ready to come down and help us, but they themselves were also in the track of the tropical storm and winds headed in their direction, not to mention the impact it had on their ability to get there. So it impacted the entire  You know, we have gotten trained, in watching these storms, to see images of destroyed buildings. Obviously, that is a terrible thing. We lived through that with Andrew, and we have our share of that. If you see the images of the Florida Keys, you can tell quickly that a storm went through there. But underneath the surface, underneath the structures that might still be standing and the roofs that might still be intact are deep scars and damage that will be around and will impact us for months if not years to come.  Think, for example, of the Florida If you haven't been there, it is an incredibly unique place. There is only one way in and one way out. It is a chain of small islands built on a coral rock formation, and it is truly unique. The further south you get in the Keys and the further southwest you get as it turns, the more unique it gets. It is a place where I have spent many days, especially with our family. Some of our best memories with the family were made in the Florida We spent a number of days there not long ago before the storm.  If you know anything about the Florida Keys, this is not a place with Johnny Rockets or TGI It has a lot of small businesses, not just in the restaurant industry but in the hotels, the bait shops, the charter captains, and everything in between. There are a lot of small businesses, and many of them are generational businesses. The families have been there and have been doing it for 60 years. Those businesses are literally going to have no customers now or for the foreseeable future. They still don't have power in many places. They don't have internet. They don't have fuel. They certainly don't have tourists.  Imagine for a moment that you are the owner of a small restaurant and you have to go 30 to 60 days without any revenue. I can tell you that most businesses don't have that kind of reserve, not to mention your employees who may not get paid.  When you think about the Florida Keys, it is an expensive place to live because it is a valuable piece of land right on the water, which is an enormous challenge for the workforce. The people who work in the Keys don't want to drive 3\1/2\ hours a day from South Dade to get down to the Lower Keys, or anywhere, for that matter, depending on the day. That housing stock in many places is trailer parks, mobile homes, or small apartments. The trailers are gone. The apartments have suffered water damage, and they certainly are not livable now, in many cases because of water and wind damage.  Think about agriculture. I know Florida is not thought of as an agricultural I promise you, there is an extraordinary presence of agriculture in our State and a great variety of crops.  Florida is one of the largest cattle producers in the country. You don't associate Florida with cattle, but it is an enormous part of our agriculture. Our signature crop is citrus, the sugar cane growers, fresh vegetables, and the nurseries. The nurseries produce tropical plants that you see in big developments or all of the indoor plants. Much of that is grown in  There are also dairies. Florida is a dairy provider to much of the Every single one of them has suffered significant damage and, in the case of a couple of them, catastrophic damage.  The citrus industry was already being hurt by citrus greening, a disease that kills trees. Senator Nelson and I went to a grove two days after the storm, and more than half the fruit was already gone and more was dropping. That fruit is gone. Those farmers live off of that fruit. The whole fruit[[Page S5852]]goes to the whole fruit market, and the bulk of it goes to the juicing market. Much of it was green. So it wasn't even ready to pick. But once it hits floodwater, it cannot be used or sold. The FDA says it can no longer be consumed safely. They lost all of it, on top of the fact that their yields were already lower because of greening. They lost the fruit they had.  It gets worse. They lost trees. It is not simple. You don't just go to Home Depot and buy an orange tree and next year it produces oranges. These new trees take at least 4 years before they begin to produce the fruit to sell, if it survives greening. They lost trees, and they are still losing fruit, and they will still lose more trees because all of those groves are under water. All that water is sitting on the roots, and those trees will not survive. This is a catastrophe.  I don't mean to leave anything out. I can tell you the truth that there will be no Florida fresh vegetables. There will be no Florida vegetables in Those green beans that many of you eat on Thanksgiving Day will not come from We will have to make up the gap from foreign producers because that crop is gone entirely. I don't mean to leave anything out. I am just stating that the hit to agriculture was extraordinary. Unfortunately, for agriculture, this has happened, but there has not been a lot of media coverage about it because not a lot of agriculture is near metropolitan centers. There is not a lot of media coverage.  Look, I am not here to beat up on the media. I thank the media, and I have done so because a lot of the work they did on the national and local news was what got people motivated to get up and go and get out of harm's way. But there are not a lot of camera crews stationed live in a citrus grove. So the power gets put back on and the schools reopen, and most people forget that these farmers--most of them--are not wealthy landowners. Some of these are fourth generation growers who have been on that land and are producing and are already stretched because of some of the challenges they have, whether it is with trade or citrus greening or whatever the challenges might be. It has just gotten worse for them.  Do you know who else got hurt? The entire industry that serves them. Everyone in the towns built around them. This is big trouble. It is truly a catastrophic agricultural event in every part of the Virtually none of Florida's agriculture went without being impacted by this.  I think about the migrant workers who work there. Some were afraid to come forward because of their immigration status. They thought that, if they showed up at a shelter, they would be deported, but more importantly, in terms of life, some of them have nowhere to live. Their housing, to begin with, is precarious. A lot of the mobile homes are damaged by water. There is no electricity. They are not near a metropolitan center, and they are afraid to come out. Thank God for so many groups that have come forward to try to help them.  We scoff about power outages. I don't know how people lived in Florida before the invention of air conditioning with the heat and humidity. It is an inconvenience for a lot of people, but it is life threatening in the case of senior citizens or people who require refrigerated pharmaceuticals for their survival. It has had an extraordinary impact on them.  All of these circumstances have a true impact and are among many of the challenges that we now face. There is a special focus, for example, on Monroe County, in the Florida This storm threatens to fundamentally alter the character of Monroe County if we do not help the Florida Keys, because these trailer parks are on valuable land, and the owners of that land are going to be tempted to build on them, not mobile homes, again, but to build structures designed for visitors that have more money. That means that we will lose our housing stock, but ultimately it means that we will lose the character of the place--all of the small businesses that service the fishing boats and the diving.  We have some of the greatest collections of coral reefs in the world right off Marathon, by Sombrero Key in the Florida All of that will be out of business for a long time. Can they survive? I don't know.  There are small business owners that might own an apartment building. They use it in the summer for their family and rent it in the winter. It is damaged. So they can't rent it this year. So guess what. They may not be able to pay the mortgage, which will lead to foreclosures.  I mentioned agriculture. I don't know how Florida agriculture--particularly citrus--can recover from the storm without significant help.  This storm exposed a real vulnerability to a State with so many senior citizens. It is not just the nursing homes and the We have apartment buildings, section 8 HUD housing and the like--entire apartment buildings with 13, 14 stories. There are towers of apartment buildings populated by senior citizens. What happens when the power goes out? The first thing is that all of the food in their refrigerators rots. So within 48 hours, I don't care how much they stored for the hurricane, they can no longer eat a lot of the food they need for their nutrition.  You might say: Why don't they get up and go see to a relative's or go somewhere where they are handing out food?  They are on the 13th or 12th floor of a building where the elevator doesn't work. They can't walk down 13 flights of stairs. This exposed a real vulnerability that we will have to examine.  Then there is debris removal. Some of these counties are small counties. Some of these counties still owe money from storms last year. FEMA dispersed the funds to the The State hasn't dispersed it to them yet. Now they have to go out and hire, and they need hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up these roads, and they don't have that in their budget. There is a huge strain in that regard.  Senator Nelson and I spent 2 days together traveling last week. We will continue to work together to help so many different people. On Friday we had an event in Immokalee, which is a migrant community in Southwest Florida, and 800 people applied for assistance.  We were in Augustine yesterday, and close to 1,000 people applied for assistance.  In Jacksonville today, there were 1,800 people applying for assistance. We will be going to Naples, FL, and Fort Myers later this week. We will be back in Immokalee again on Friday, and we are about to start out in the Florida Keys helping people.  It is funny. They say: FEMA--go online and apply there. Here is the problem, when you have no internet and no power, how do you go online and apply? So we are trying to get out there to help as many people as we can.  Now, I don't want to leave on a negative note. There is nothing positive about a storm, but there are some uplifting things to point out. I will be brief and to the point. I am uplifted by these crews sent down by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or the LDS church, who are out there helping people who can't afford it or who don't know how to do it. Professionals are out there helping people cut down trees and remove debris from their homes and put tarps on their roofs. They are volunteers who came on their own to do it. I was uplifted on Saturday by visiting the North Carolina Baptists' men's relief society, who were in South Florida, and 120 people were preparing hot meals to send down to the Florida They have fed thousands of people in a very impressive operation. I am uplifted by the Red Cross volunteers from New York and New Jersey who I have run into who flew down, rode out the storm, and were there working in the shelters. I am uplifted by stories of school principals who took over these shelters because people didn't show up to run them who were supposed to show up. So these principals, custodians, and cafeteria managers showed up and took care of all these people. I am uplifted by stories like the one today in Jacksonville, where a gentleman and his wife who were disabled came forward. They lost their home and they had to be saved from floodwaters. They were living in temporary housing. A donor had put them up for a week. It ran out, and they had nowhere to go tonight. We were able to match them with a donor, who insists on remaining anonymous, for another week of temporary housing while, hopefully, we can get them the housing they need.[[Page S5853]]  One of my favorite stories--and I believe Senator Nelson shared this the other night--is this one that I wanted to close with. He and I ran into this at Ave Maria Catholic University, which is literally out in the Everglades, between Naples and We went out there to visit, and we were told extraordinary stories of some of their students.  On the night before the storm, there were about 300 migrants from nearby communities--many of whom are probably undocumented, in the country illegally--who didn't want to evacuate. They were afraid of being deported. Ultimately, they saw that the storm was bad. They showed up at Ave Ave Maria opened its doors and welcomed them into the gym. There were students who stayed behind and played with the kids, entertained the kids throughout the storm, and took care of them.  What was really uplifting was the story of two nursing students. Right before the storm hit, right before you could no longer go out, the sheriff's office shows up at Ave Maria with eight seniors from a nearby The staff at the ALF quit. They literally left. They didn't show up. They abandoned them. The sheriff's office brings them, and these two nursing students bring the eight seniors into their dorms. They brought them into the women's dorm and cared for them for two days, triaging the medicine they needed to take, understanding how to do this, that, and the other. These are amazing stories about these young people. If there is any doubt about the future of America, think about the extraordinary work these young people put in. Nobody told them to do it. They could have left. They could have gone back to wherever they were from, but they stayed and took care of them.  We have a long way to go, but we want to thank all the people for the great wishes we got from all of my colleagues and from people around the country. This is a storm that impacts Florida in ways we are going to feel for a long time.  Let me close by asking all of you to take a moment tonight, if you can and you wish, to pray for the island of Puerto Rico, a U.Territory, where millions of our fellow Americans are staring down the barrel of the most powerful storm that ever has perhaps hit that island, and this after already getting hit by Irma just a week ago. It has the potential to be an extraordinary catastrophe. We pray that is not the case. I hope we stand ready to assist our fellow Americans on the island of Puerto Let's pray for them tonight because tomorrow morning is going to be a very difficult time for them as this extraordinary hurricane, Hurricane Maria, is about to slam right into them.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-19-pt1-PgS5836.txt,2084,0915,2017.0,19.0,September

7,topic-id,1346,"Mr.President, there is a possibility that by the end of next week, the Senate will have a vote again on a Republican healthcare bill assembled in the dark of night by one party, without a full account of what the bill would do. It will be a shameful return to the same process the majority used to try to ram a bill through in July, unsuccessfully.  To consider a bill like this without a full CBO score is worse than negligent; it is grossly irresponsible. We were told yesterday that CBO may be able to provide a baseline estimate of the cost of the bill but not the coverage numbers or a detailed analysis of how the bill would affect Americans' healthcare choices.  We are talking about one-sixth of the economy; we are talking about the healthcare of the Nation; we are talking about the lives, day in and day out, of millions of Americans who need healthcare; and we are not going to really know what the legislation does.  Senators will be voting blind. They say justice is blind, but the Senators on the other side of the aisle should be walking around here with a blindfold over their eyes because they don't know what they are voting on. Maybe they don't care. I don't know how any Senator could go home to his or her constituents and explain why they voted for a major bill with major consequences to so many of their people without having specific answers about how it would impact their  What we do know is that this new TrumpCare bill, the Graham-Cassidy legislation, is worse in many ways than the previous versions of The new TrumpCare would devastate our healthcare system in five specific ways.  First, it would cause millions to lose coverage.  Second, it would radically restructure and deeply cut Medicaid, ending the program as we know it. It has been the dream of the hard right to get rid of Medicaid, which could happen, even though it is a program that affects the poor and so many in the middle-class--nursing homes, opioid treatment, people who have kids with serious illnesses.  Third, it brings us back to the days when insurance companies could discriminate against people with preexisting conditions. The ban on discriminating against people with preexisting conditions would be gone. We have had a lot of promises from the other side that they would never vote for a bill that didn't protect people with preexisting conditions. That seems to be going by the wayside in a headlong rush to pass a bill so that they can claim a political victory. What about that mom or dad who finds out his or her son or daughter has cancer, and the insurance company says: Yes, we will cover you; it will cost you $50,000. And they don't have it, so they have to watch their child suffer. This was an advance that almost all Americans supported. It was an advance most people on the other side of the aisle believe in--gone.  Fourth, the bill gets rid of the consumer protections that guarantee Americans' access to affordable maternity care, substance abuse treatment, and prescription drugs. All of those could be out of any plan. You can pay a lot for a plan and not get much for it in this bill.  Fifth, it would throw the individual market into chaos immediately, increasing out-of-pocket costs for individual market consumers and resulting[[Page S5828]]in 15 million people losing coverage next year--15 million people.  On the first point, the new TrumpCare would cause millions to lose health insurance in two ways: first by undoing the Affordable Care Act's major coverage expansion under Medicaid and premium and cost-sharing assistance, instead putting that into an inadequate and temporary block grant, and, second, by radically restructuring and cutting the traditional Medicaid Program through a per capita cap.  We don't have a CBO score yet, and we may not get one in time. But previous CBO scores of similar schemes have shown that 30 million Americans could lose coverage under this bill--30 million Americans--10 percent, approximately, of our population.  On the second point, the new TrumpCare would end Medicaid as we know it by converting Medicaid's current Federal-State financial partnership to a per capita cap, which cuts current Medicaid funding levels on an annual basis. This is a direct blow to nursing home patients and folks in opioid treatment, and CBO has said that 15 million fewer people would receive Medicaid under similar proposals.  On the third point, the new TrumpCare actually brings back the ability of insurers to discriminate against folks with preexisting conditions, as I mentioned.  Fourth, the new TrumpCare would no longer guarantee consumers affordable access to maternity care, substance abuse, and prescription drugs.  Fifth, like previous repeal and replace, it would immediately eliminate the individual mandate, which would raise the number of uninsured by 15 million, relative to current law, in 2018 and increase market premiums by 20 percent.  So vote for this bill, and right away 15 million will lose coverage, and premiums will go up by 20 percent. People who vote for this bill are not going to be happy with its results. Each one of these five things represents a major step backward for our healthcare system, bringing back discrimination against folks with preexisting conditions and ending Medicaid as we know it. These are overwhelmingly popular with Democrats, Independents, and The hard right doesn't like it. The big financiers of the other party don't like entitlements, but Americans do. We are going to go backward--backward. We are going to go backward and not even know the effects.  Why is the other side rushing this through? They are ashamed of it. They need to have that political scalp: See, we abolished But what they are putting in its place, even for those who don't like ObamaCare, is worse. They don't want to know that. The joy they will have--misplaced joy, in my opinion--of abolishing ObamaCare will evaporate quite soon when their constituents feel the effects of this bill and they hear about it from average folks who are so hurt.  The Washington Post summed up Graham-Cassidy yesterday. They said the bill ``would slash health-care spending more deeply and would probably cover fewer people than the July bill--which failed because of concerns over those details.''  Republicans couldn't garner the 50 votes for their various healthcare plans earlier this year because of how much damage those plans did to Medicaid, how they rolled back protections for preexisting conditions, and some opposed it because the process was such a sham. Well, all three conditions are here again with this bill: cuts to Medicaid, no guarantee for preexisting conditions, a sham of a bill.  There is a better approach. Right now, Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray are working in a bipartisan way--holding hearings, working through committee, coming back and forth between the parties with discussions. Each side is going to have to give; that is how it works around here--or should work--in trying to get a proposal that will improve things. That is the kind of legislating many Members of the Senate have said they want to get back to. That is the kind of process worthy of the world's greatest deliberative body.  After a rancorous and divisive healthcare debate, which took up the better part of this year, Democrats and Republicans have been working in good faith to come up with a bipartisan agreement on healthcare in the HELP The Republican majority would toss all of that away if they pursue Graham-Cassidy next week the way they are pursuing it--returning to reconciliation, not working in the committees, no CBO report, making a mockery of regular order.  I hope, for their sake and the country's sake, my Republican friends will turn back from this new TrumpCare and join us again on the road to bipartisanship. We have seen bipartisan sprouts bloom in the last month. Graham-Cassidy would snuff them out. Nobody wants that--nobody.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Thank you.  Mr.President, we will vote today on the final passage of I am pleased with the bipartisan manner in which the Senate has worked on this important legislation. Senators McCain and Reed managed the bill with great skill. I commend them for their bipartisan work on this important legislation.[[Page S5779]]                                 Healthcare  Mr.President, I am going to use the rest of my time to address something that is not so bipartisan. It is terribly partisan, and that is the issue of healthcare. I hope the American people listen closely.  After a few months of lying dormant, TrumpCare is back, and it is meaner than ever. TrumpCare now lives under the name of Cassidy-Guess what. It is another bill that would drastically cut back on healthcare funding for Americans who need it most.  My colleagues, my fellow Americans, this is a red-alert moment for the entire country. Our healthcare system again is threatened by a hastily constructed piece of legislation, put together in a back room by only one party--no CBO score, no committee process, not a single hearing. Everyone is totally in the dark about the effects of this bill, yet there is an effort to rush it forward.  This Frankenstein monster of a bill that would harm so many Americans keeps coming back and back, and somehow each time it has managed to get worse.  Here is what we know the new TrumpCare bill would do. It would roll back protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. It would allow States to impose burdensome requirements as a condition on Medicaid coverage. It would defund Planned Parenthood, stripping millions of women of their right to access affordable healthcare. Most crucially, the new TrumpCare would plunge a dagger deep into the heart of Medicaid, immediately ending Medicaid expansion and establishing a per capita cap on Medicaid spending. That jeopardizes coverage for 11 million Americans and puts at great risk the coverage and affordability of insurance for the 12 million who buy insurance on the marketplaces.  It would take the money used for Medicaid expansion and subsidies and block-grant it to the States, imposing a massive cut on funding that helps so many Americans well into the middle class.  The term ``block grants'' may sound harmless, but in practice they are anything but. Right now, our healthcare system reimburses States for the costs of what their citizens actually need and use. Block grants are a fixed amount of money given to each State, forcing people who need healthcare to fight among each other as to who gets those dollars. People with parents in nursing homes will fight with those on opioid treatment, who will fight with those who have kids with preexisting conditions, who will fight with those who simply need to go see a doctor. They will all be pitted against one another in a heartless scheme, a heartless scheme that will hurt so many.  Block grants are a not-so-clever way of disguising a massive, massive cut to healthcare--cutting back care, raising premiums, hurting millions and millions of average  That is the case with this new The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities took a look at the new TrumpCare and found that the block grants in the bill would deprive States of hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars. I am going to mention a few States here. My colleagues should know the effect of the bill. They don't.  CBO has told us--I will talk more about this later--that they cannot give us a full score but simply notes whether it meets the budget reconciliation numbers. They say it will cut a billion dollars. That is all it will say. We will not know how many citizens are hurt, but the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, whose numbers are very reliable, has done a calculation. I would ask my colleagues to pay attention. I just picked out some There are more. Arizona would lose $1.6 billion in Federal funding. Alaska would lose $255 million in Federal funding. Maine would lose $115 million in Federal funding. West Virginia would lose $554 million in Federal funding. Colorado would lose $823 million in Federal funding. Ohio, the State most racked by the opioid epidemic, would lose over $2.5 billion in healthcare funding. Iowa would lose $525 million in Federal funding. These are devastating numbers. My colleagues, if you don't believe the accuracy of these numbers, then have the courage and decency to wait for a CBO score. To pass this legislation before CBO measures out the effect on your State would be legislative malpractice of the highest order. These numbers, we believe, are accurate. They come from a group that has had years of expertise and accurately predicted healthcare effects. There will be devastating cuts to so many in so many  If you don't believe these numbers, then show us what yours are. Wait for CBO, an impartial arbiter, and see what they have to say. The numbers are devastating. They represent millions of Americans, especially middle-income and low-income, who will receive poorer healthcare, face higher costs, or both. Whom do they represent? You are an American family--a nice, middle-class family making a good income. You have a parent in a nursing home. It is likely to be paid for by That parent is at risk if this Graham-Cassidy bill passes. You have a young son or daughter afflicted by opioids. The treatment they receive would often be at risk if this bill passes. You give birth to a child with a preexisting condition who desperately needs help. We met so many of these families, every one of us. That child's life, in many cases, would be at risk if this bill passes. This is the poorest way of legislating I have seen in all my years here. To try to rush this bill through with no hearings, no CBO score, no knowledge of how it actually affects your constituents--how can we do that?  Already, some Republican Governors have spoken out against this legislation. Governor Kasich, Governor Baker, and 16 patient and provider groups have come out against this TrumpCare, including the American Cancer Society and the American Heart The ratings agency Fitch says Graham-Cassidy would be even ``more disruptive'' than all the other ACA bills. The American people have rejected TrumpCare repeatedly. Its numbers in the polls are below 20 percent. Hardcore supporters of Donald Trump do not want us to pass this bill. Virtually only one in five Americans wants us to pass this bill--hardly anybody--and we are going to go do it for a political scalp? No, we can't.  I know there are some on the other side of the aisle who say they can work it out so each State wouldn't be hurt as badly as under the current draft of the bill--these bad numbers--that they can tweak the formula for one State or another that would make the cuts less devastating. First, they are never going to come up with that kind of money. I heard one Governor was told by a Senator: Don't worry about the big cuts to your We will make it up with disproportionate share payments--uncompensated care. It is impossible. The amount of money in the DSH Program is so much less than the amount of these cuts that we couldn't even come close. That is what is being thrown around here. There are lots of different surmises: Maybe we will do this, maybe we will do that. We are playing with people's lives. That is so wrong. States will end up facing a harsh cut--most of the States in the Union--many States represented by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who voted for the previous bills.  We shouldn't do it on substance, but we also shouldn't do it on the basis of regular order. To have such a major bill that affects so many people be rushed at the last minute in the dark of night--no discussion, no analysis, no real knowledge of how it affects each of our States--is legislative malpractice of the highest order.  If the Founding Fathers were looking at this Chamber now and watching, they would be turning over in their graves. An America founded on debate and discussion and sunlight is veering off all of that in a really nasty way. There is no regular order here. There are no bipartisan public hearings on the Graham-Cassidy bill. The HELP and Finance Committees are not debating the legislation. It is the same backroom, one-party sham of a legislative process that ultimately brought the previous bill down. A contrived, eleventh-hour hearing on block grants in the Homeland Security Committee--a committee that has very little jurisdiction over healthcare matters--does not even come close to suggesting regular order.  In conclusion, I think many of us on both sides of the aisle thought there was a ray of light in the last few[[Page S5780]]weeks. The partisanship that had governed this place for the last 8 months seemed to be breaking. I had good meetings in the White House--hopes of working together. Senators Alexander and Murray began talking about how we move forward. I was joyful that maybe the partisanship could end and we could work together. The majority leader and I are getting along very well. This bill, if done this way and passed, would dash those hopes.  There is a way out. Senators Alexander and Murray have had hearings. They have had discussions. They are negotiating at this moment. What they will come up with will have some things I don't like and some things people on the other side of the aisle don't like. That is the legislative process. It is not to rush a bill through in the dark of night without even knowledge of how it affects people. CBO has said they cannot measure how many people would lose coverage and how they would be affected until a few weeks because this is a block grant. It takes a long time to weigh it.  So after 2 weeks of thinking bipartisanship--that flickering candle might gain some new light--this is the last thing we need. Let's not go back to the divisive, destructive healthcare process that paralyzed the Senate for much of this year. Let the leader and I encourage our Members to talk to one another and come up with bipartisan solutions--not just on this bill but on bills to come. Let's pursue the bipartisan path courageously used by Senators Alexander and  In conclusion, I would ask every American who hears these words, who longs for us to work together, to call your Senators and Congressmen and let them know. Tell them this bill is even worse than the previous bills. Tell them it hurts average families dramatically. Tell them there is a better way. The same level of activism that we saw on the previous bills must be garnered now or this will just slide through in the dark of night, with effects that are desperate, devastating, and unknown. Democrats in the Senate, we have no choice. Our constituencies, our consciousness impels us. We will oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill in every way we can, using every tool at our disposal, and we ask the American people to speak out, once again, and make their voices heard.

256,topic-id,1015," Mr.I hope we can do that.  I again thank the leader from New York, who has been very cooperative to me and to the Senator from Rhode Island as we have moved forward with this legislation. I thank him.                  Training Accident at Camp Pendleton  Mr.President, I wish to begin by offering my thoughts and prayers to the marines who were injured yesterday when their amphibious assault vehicle caught fire during a training exercise at Camp Pendleton in With 15 marines hospitalized and 5 in critical condition, I join all of my colleagues in hoping for a full and speedy recovery for each of these brave young servicemembers.  Last night, unfortunately, the majority leader was required to file cloture on the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018. We have gotten a lot done in the short time this legislation has been on the floor. I know I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that it is my hope that we will be able to do more.  I thank my friend from Rhode I thank Members who have been very helpful and cooperative in this effort, as we have considered a 27-to-0 vote through the committee. It passed unanimously. We have engaged in spirited, thoughtful debate, and we have ultimately adopted 277 amendments from both Republicans and  I sound like a broken record, but this is the way the Senate should conduct business. The authorizing committee reports out legislation that has been examined with hearings and debate and amendments, and it appears on the floor, and we have additional debates and amendments, and people can vote yes or no, but they are informed.  It is a violation of our oath of office when we are told that one-fifth of the gross national product--i.e. healthcare--is going to be decided by a ``skinny repeal'' that none of us had seen until an hour or two before. That is not the way the Senate should do business.  We are not perfect. We are going to have to invoke cloture on this bill. We are not going to have some debate and votes on some very important--at least four--issues. But while we have been on this bill, we have adopted 277 amendments. We had hours and hours of hearings. We had a week of putting this bill[[Page S5713]]together on a bipartisan basis, and it was reported out by over one-quarter of the Senate, to zero. That is the way we should be doing business.  I will freely admit that national security probably is at a higher level of importance--and should be--than the average legislation, but shouldn't we learn from this that if we sit down together, we argue, we fight, we debate, and then we reach consensus, we come to the floor of the Senate and to the American people with something that we are proud of and that we can defend?  As I mentioned, there are still some issues that we are negotiating on, back and forth--and we are negotiating--and hopefully we can get those done before cloture is invoked. I hope the majority leader and the Democratic leader will agree to a time certain for final passage.  Let me just say that I support beginning to move toward final passage, which will provide our Armed Forces the resources they need.  By the way, again, I want to emphasize that on the Armed Services Committee, we have had dozens of hearings on topics such as the global threat environment, the effects of defense budget cuts, and military readiness and modernization. Those hearings informed the work of the committee as we moved toward the legislation.  I know that all of us from time to time like to take credit for accomplishments that maybe we are not as responsible for as we would advertise, but I want to say that I am not just proud of John McCain and Jack Reed, I am proud of the 27 members of the Armed Services Committee who--and the debate was spirited. It is not the Bobbsey We fight in a spirited fashion. We defend what we believe in. But once the committee is decided, then we move on.  So my colleagues have embraced the spirit of that process, and we have submitted more than 500 amendments for consideration this week. The Senator from Rhode Island and I negotiated a number of very good amendments that have the support of both Republicans and We still have some hard issues that are remaining, and I will be talking more about them. We are still negotiating to see if we can find agreement on those, and I am guardedly optimistic we can get most of that agreement done. We will know more later on this morning or early this afternoon.  Let me also point out to my colleagues what we are talking about. We have seen Navy ships, Army, and Marine Corps helicopters, Air Force planes crashing during routine training and operations, and these incidents have cost the lives of dozens of our men and women in uniform. There are many reasons for these tragedies, but the one this body cannot avoid responsibility for is that we are failing to provide our military with the resources they need to perform the missions we are asking of them. We are asking them to do too much with too little. The result is an overworked, strained force with aging equipment--and not enough of it.  We can point fingers and assign blame all we want, but at the end of the day, the constitutional responsibility to raise moneys and maintain Navies lies with us, with the That, of course, brings up sequestration, which I will address later on.  I just want to point out, again, the men and women who wear the uniform of our country are the best of our country, and they do everything we ask of them with great courage. It is time for this body to show a similar measure of courage and end the threat sequestration poses to their mission and their lives.  I yield the floor.

296,topic-id,779,"Mr.President, last night, Leader Pelosi and I had a constructive meeting with President Trump and several members of his  One of our most productive discussions was about the DACA Program, to which we all agreed on a framework: to pass DACA protections and additional border security measures, excluding the wall. We agreed that the President would support enshrining the DACA protections into law. In fact, it is something, he stated, that for a while has needed to be done. The President also encouraged the House and Senate to act.  What remains to be negotiated are the details of border security with the mutual goal of finalizing all of the details as soon as possible. While both sides agreed that the wall would not be any part of this agreement, the President made clear that he intends to pursue it at a later time, and we made clear that we would continue to oppose it.  If you listened to the President's comments this morning and to Director Mulvaney's comments this morning, it is clear that what Leader Pelosi and I put out last night was exactly accurate and was confirmed again this morning by our statement, by the President's statement before he got on the helicopter to go to Florida, and by Director Mulvaney's comments. We have reached an understanding on this issue, but we have to work out details, and we can work together on a border security package with the White House to get DACA on the floor quickly.  Let me talk for a minute about border security. We Democrats are for border security. We passed a robust border security package as part of immigration reform in 2013, as the Acting President pro tempore knows better than anybody else. We are not for the wall, and we will never be for the wall. It is expensive, it is ineffective, and it involves a lot of difficult eminent domain--taking people's property--and, apparently, it is not being paid for by In fact, I listened to FOX News this morning--I am starting to do that to see what is going on over there--and they keep saying that in the campaign the President promised a wall. He[[Page S5711]]also promised that Mexico would pay for it. Where is Mexico? It has said 12 times that it is not paying for it. That is not the promise he made.  Finally, on the wall, it sends a terrible symbol to the world about the United States--about who we are, what kind of country we are. Since the 1880s, a beautiful statue in the harbor of the city in which I live has been the symbol of America to the world--that great torch that symbolizes what a noble land we are. Can you imagine, if in future decades, that symbol were to be replaced with a big, foreboding wall? That is not who America is, was, or, hopefully, will be.  As I mentioned, we are for sensible border security, and there are many more effective ways of securing the border than by building a wall. A wall can be scaled over. I am sure that those who love the wall have heard of ladders. A wall can be tunneled under. I am sure that those who support the wall have heard of shovels. It is a medieval solution for a modern problem--a ``Game of Thrones'' idea for a world that is a lot closer to ``Star Wars.'' The thing is that we have new, modern solutions that use our best technology. We discussed some of them at the White House last night.  These drones can spot the difference between a deer and a human being crossing the border. We have great sensory equipment, and our military has specialized in this kind of stuff. A lot of it is made in Syracuse, NY, I am proud to say. We can rebuild roads along the border. Talk to the people in the Border Patrol, and they will say that a lot of places do not have roads so that, if they see someone crossing the border, they cannot get to them. Of course, there is the bipartisan McCaul-Thompson bill in the House--McCaul, a Republican, and Thompson, a Democrat--that has broad, bipartisan support and that sets certain standards. Every one of these ideas would provide better, more effective border security than would a medieval wall.  There is still much to be done. We have to put meat on the bones of the agreement, and the details will matter, but it was a very, very positive step for the President to commit to DACA protections without insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgS5710-4.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,14.0,September
302,topic-id,856,"Mr.President, on the Equifax data breach, what has transpired over the past several months is one of the most egregious examples of corporate malfeasance since Equifax has exposed the most sensitive personal information of over half of the citizens of the United States--names, addresses, Social Security numbers, driver's licenses, and, in some cases, even their credit histories. Clearly, there were inadequate data security standards at Equifax, which is deeply troubling on a number of levels.  When you are a credit agency like Equifax, you have two principal jobs: calculating and reporting accurate credit scores and protecting the sensitive information of individuals that is funneled through that process. Stunningly and epically, Equifax failed to perform one of its two essential duties as a company--protecting the sensitive information of the people in its files. That is unacceptable, and there is no other word for it.  Even following the failure by Equifax--this huge, massive failure--the company and its leadership failed to effectively communicate this breach to the public and, in the aftermath of the announcement, failed to address public concern. The company knew about the breach and did not notify consumers that their information had been compromised for far too long a period. Because Equifax waited so long to report the breach, consumers were put behind the eight ball. Their information was potentially compromised without their knowledge, and they had no ability to protect themselves. Meanwhile, hackers could attempt to take out loans in their names and potentially use the information for identity fraud or they could perpetrate a number of fraudulent schemes with the sensitive information that these horrible hackers had obtained.  Once the breach was eventually announced, consumers found themselves being forced to provide sensitive information to Equifax in order to verify whether they were impacted by the breach. In order to sign up for the company's credit monitoring services, customers were forced to agree to terms prohibiting their ability to bring a legal claim against Isn't that disgusting?  Equifax creates the problem and then says: Customer, if you want to solve it, you have to give up your rights.  That is outrageous.  Equifax is saying: We royally screwed up, but trust us. We will not screw up again, but if we do screw up, you cannot sue us.  To make matters worse, in the weeks leading up to the announcement of its breach, while customers were in the dark, several executives at Equifax sold off their stock in the company. They claim that they had no knowledge of the breach. If they did, it would be one of the most brazen and shameful attempts of insider trading that I can recall.  We need to get to the bottom of this--the very bottom, the murky bottom, the dirty bottom. The Senate must hold hearings on the Equifax breach during which these executives will be called to account. There is no question about that. Beyond that, five things need to happen in the near future. I would like to see them in the next week.  First, Equifax must commit proactively to reach out to all impacted individuals and notify them that their personal, identifiable information may have been compromised and, if known, inform them of exactly what information has been released.  Second, provide credit monitoring and ID theft protection services to all impacted individuals for no less than 10 years. If an individual chooses not to use the credit monitoring service offered by Equifax because they naturally don't trust them, then Equifax should reimburse that individual for the costs of the alternative credit monitoring service they sign up for.  Third, offer any impacted individual the ability to freeze their credit at any point for up to 10 years.  Fourth, remove arbitration provisions from any agreement or terms of use for products, services, or disclosures offered by This means that Equifax will proactively come into compliance with the CFPB's forced arbitration rule, and there will be no question that an individual will not have all legal rights at their disposal.  Fifth, Equifax must agree to testify before the Senate, the FTC, and the SEC, cooperate with any investigation, and comply with any fines, penalties, or new standards that are recommended at the conclusion of these investigations.  If Equifax does not agree to these five things in 1 week's time, the CEO of the company and the entire board should step down. These five steps are common sense. They are the baseline of decency. If Equifax can't commit to them, their leadership is not up to the job, and the entire leadership must be replaced.  Let me tell my colleagues, if Joe Public--if the average citizen did anything close to what the corporate leaders of Equifax did that led to this data breach and the awful response to it, that average citizen would be fired immediately. To give Equifax a week to implement these things is overly generous to people who did horrible stuff and then, after it happened, did nothing--virtually nothing--that showed they had remorse.  It is only right that the CEO and board step down if they can't reach this modicum of corporate decency by next week.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgS5711.txt,1036,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,14.0,September
404,topic-id,956,"Finally, Mr.President--a lot to say this morning--a word on taxes. Last night at the White House, President Trump said he didn't want his tax plan to benefit the very wealthy. That is a good thing. We Democrats agree. Forty-five of the forty-eight of us signed a letter that no tax breaks should go to the top 1 percent. They are doing great. God bless them. I am glad they are doing well. They don't need a tax break. Middle-class people do.  But the devil, when the President says that, is always in the details, and we haven't seen any details. We haven't seen anything resembling a[[Page S5712]]plan yet. We hear it is being written in a back room by the so-called Big 6--all Republican--but I haven't seen it, Ranking Member Wyden hasn't seen it, and no Democrat in the Senate has seen it.  I can tell you one thing: If the President's tax plan repeals or rolls back the estate tax, it will be clear that a lot of this plan benefits the very rich, contrary to all of his words.  I would remind everyone that only 5,200 of the over 2.7 million estates in this country will pay any taxes this year. The estate tax only kicks in when couples with estates of nearly $11 million transfer their wealth. Go to North Dakota--and I know the Acting President pro tempore has nice family farms out there--and ask how many have an estate worth $11 million, and if they do, I am willing to exempt from the estate tax a family farm that is over that. But almost no one does.  A study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities showed that of the 5,200 estates--here we have 2.7 million estates. Only 5,200 qualify for the estate tax because they are worth $11 million, and of those, 50 are small farms or businesses--50. Let's exempt those 50. Let's make all of these other guys pay. We need the money. They are rich. God bless them.  So when President Trump says the estate tax is a burden on the family farmer, I honestly don't know what he is talking about. There may be a few. They may make a lot of noise. God bless them. That is their right as There are very, very few. That is not what the facts say.  Let me show my colleagues the next chart. Of 2.7 million taxable estates, just 50 are farms and small businesses that would benefit from the repeal of the estate tax--2.7 million; 50.  There was an amazing moment last night at the meeting we held at the White House when the estate tax came up, and a few of the President's advisers said: Oh, no one pays the estate tax. There have even been news reports that Gary Cohn has told Members of Congress that ``only morons pay the estate tax.'' What they mean, of course, is that rich people--people rich enough to be levied estate taxes--can find ways around paying them; they can afford all of those lawyers and estate planners.  Well, first, they are wrong. Repealing the estate tax would add $269 billion to the deficit over 10 years--$269 billion. So there are a lot of people paying the estate tax. Maybe they are morons, as Gary Cohn once called them, maybe they are not, but there is a lot of money out there that comes in from these very wealthy with the estate tax.  Second, Mr.Cohn and the others who say this bring up an important point. The right thing to do is not repeal the estate tax but close the loopholes. If you have an estate worth that much, you should be paying the estate tax, not finding clever ways to avoid your tax obligation. Again, if you are rich, if you have a big estate, God bless you. That is the American way. But pay your fair share. Pay your fair share.  Democrats want to participate in reforming our Tax There are lots of good things we can agree on--closing loopholes like this one, cutting taxes for the middle class, helping small businesses, bringing offshore deferred income back into the United  We have laid out three principles: no reconciliation--that means do it together, not how they did healthcare, which didn't end up with a great result; second, no tax cuts for the top 1 percent, who are doing just fine, God bless them; third, fiscal responsibility--we should not increase the deficit as we cut taxes, particularly now that we are going to have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to help the beleaguered States of Texas and  Some Republicans have characterized those three principles as lines in the sand that show that Democrats aren't serious about tax reform. So I would ask my Republican colleagues, which of the three do you not agree with? Do you think we should cut taxes on the top 1 percent? Do you think we should create deficits by cutting taxes on the wealthy? Do you think you should just go at this alone? If you agree with those, fine. Say so. Don't say that these are lines in the sand. We are offering some policy guidance that has virtually unanimous support in our caucus.  By the way, these three principles guided the 1986 tax reform, which was the most successful tax reform we have had in decades.  It seems to me it is not Democrats who would move the goalpost on tax reform but some Republicans who no longer want to play by the same rules  Mr.President, I yield the floor to my dear friend, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who is doing a great job getting this bill through.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-14-pt1-PgS5711-2.txt,1036,VOTE EXPLANATION,2017.0,14.0,September
52,topic-id,1006,"Mr.President, it feels like Groundhog Day again because, once more, we are seeing Republican leadership in the Senate advancing another bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to make radical cuts to the Medicaid  As with previous efforts, this new bill--they call it Graham-Cassidy, but it really is TrumpCare 3.0, the third version, and it is strictly partisan legislation, crafted in secret outside of regular order, without hearings or consultation with most Senators or stakeholders. But here is what is different: This bill is even more reckless and more destructive than previous bills to repeal the Affordable Care  It would take away healthcare coverage from an estimated 30 million It would effectively end protections for people with preexisting conditions by allowing insurers to charge exorbitant rates. It would make profound cuts to the Medicaid Program, which is a lifeline for 33 million children, 10 million people with disabilities, and 6 million seniors in nursing homes. It would be a tragic setback in the fight against the opioid epidemic because it would end access to lifesaving treatment for an estimated 1.3 million people with substance use disorders. In New Hampshire, where we are at the epicenter of the heroin and opioid epidemic, it would have a huge and tragic impact.  President Trump said that the previous Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act was ``mean,'' and make no mistake, this bill is far worse. As I have said repeatedly, the only constructive way forward is for Democrats and Republicans to come together in a good-faith, bipartisan effort to repair and strengthen the current law.  As Senator McCain said to this Chamber in July: ``Let's return to regular order. We've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from the other side.''  When Senator McCain said that, we gave him a standing ovation on the floor of this In the weeks since the vote on the last attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Senate has actually been acting on his advice. We have been working under the leadership of Senators Alexander and Murray, the chair and ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on bipartisan legislation to restore certainty to the health insurance markets, to fix problems with the Affordable Care Act that we all acknowledge. This effort includes a version of legislation that I have been working on to make regular appropriations for cost-sharing reduction payments. Those are payments that keep copays and deductibles affordable for low- and middle-income  I have participated, as have so many Senators, in the bipartisan meetings they have held with Governors, providers, stakeholders, insurers, and State insurance commissioners to craft a positive way forward. It is very disappointing that we are here today with another attempt to blow up all of these bipartisan efforts by bringing to the floor yet another divisive, partisan bill.  To understand why people are upset and fearful about this latest attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I would call our attention to the many positive impacts the Affordable Care Act has had across the country--and in my home State of New Hampshire--and the consequences of repealing that law.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more than 49,000 Granite Staters have been able to get health insurance coverage through the marketplace. Thanks to the Medicaid expansion, more than 11,000 people in New Hampshire have gotten lifesaving treatments. The Medicaid expansion, which has been a bipartisan effort between then-Democratic Governor Maggie Hassan and a Republican legislature, has been a critical tool in our fight against the opioid epidemic, and hundreds of thousands of Granite Staters with preexisting conditions at one time or another no longer face discrimination by health insurance companies. In one fell swoop, this Graham-Cassidy TrumpCare legislation would put all of these gains in jeopardy.[[Page S5841]]  I would appeal to my colleagues in the Senate to stop and reconsider what is going on. Listen to the stories. Look at the faces of everyday Americans whose lives would be devastated by this legislation--from children, to seniors, to veterans.  Several months ago on Facebook and other social media platforms, I asked people across New Hampshire to tell me their stories--stories about how the Affordable Care Act has made a lifesaving difference or has improved their lives and the well-being of their families. I was overwhelmed by the response.  Here in Washington, some seem to think that repealing the Affordable Care Act, no matter how destructive the consequences, is just about politics; it is about notching a win for their team. But for the people in New Hampshire and across the country, repealing the Affordable Care Act and slashing Medicaid isn't about politics. It is about life and death. It is about people being cut off from vital, lifesaving treatment for substance use disorders. It is about families losing affordable health coverage, about seniors being unable to pay for nursing home care, and about millions of vulnerable people with preexisting conditions who would effectively be denied health coverage. It is about returning to the pre-ACA days when simply being a woman was considered a preexisting condition, justifying much higher rates.  I urge Republican leaders to stop this latest effort of destructive partisanship. There should be no retreat from the progress we have made in recent years, including the progress against the opioid epidemic. I encourage Senators who support this ill-conceived legislation to listen to the Governors, listen to the insurance commissioners, listen to patient and provider groups, and, most importantly, listen to their constituents.  Let's fix what is not working about the Affordable Care Act, and let's not pass legislation to take healthcare away from people. Let's support bipartisan efforts now under way in the Senate to stabilize the marketplaces and to provide access to quality, affordable healthcare for every  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

161,topic-id,1603,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his inspiring words.  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to update the House on what has occurred in Florida after the aftermath of Hurricane  First, I want to start by thanking so many Members of Congress for supporting a package that doubled from $7 billion to $15 billion, the emergency relief. Not only was it so critical for the great State of Texas, but it was absolutely essential for anticipating the effects that Irma would have on the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, Georgia, up through South Carolina, and southeast United  When I arrived back on Friday--you know how important it is to go back to your district when there is a crisis on hand--I saw people taking the notice of evacuation seriously. I saw people stocking up on gas, stocking up on water, stocking up their cupboards, making sure to be ready.  While it was initially supposed to hit the southeastern portion of Florida, as you know, these predictions can be somewhat accurate, which is why we always need to be sure to always prepare, whether you think you are in the eye of the storm or not. Because, in fact, after it went through the central Keys and leveled a lot of Marathon and other central Keys islands, it hit southwest The eye went right through the Naples-Fort Myers area, and a lot of those folks are still struggling with that. It actually went up through the western center of the State, through the western portion of my district in Polk County, as well as Hillsborough County, Pasco County, and other areas, and then finally going up through the Big  That night, the wind was so loud and the rain was so hard that you couldn't even hear the trees snapping. When I woke up the next day, I knew it was bad, but, to my surprise, there were trees down everywhere.  Right outside our door, right down the street, in Osceola, Orange, and Polk Counties--all the counties that I represent--one of the first initial acts of courage that I saw was neighborhood folks with nice F-150s, chainsaws, and all of this construction equipment, volunteering their time to get these major trees out of the roads. We saw that throughout Kissimmee, east Orlando, Winter Haven, Haines City, Lake Wales, and so many areas, like Cloud, that I represent.  That debris removal that the State was approved for by FEMA is going to make sure, now that those trees are on the sidewalk or they are on the median, that they are going to get picked up. It is going to be so critical that we have that either 75 or 90 percent reimbursement for debris removal to make sure that these neighborhoods can come back to normal.  One of the other impacts of having all of these trees down, since we haven't had a hurricane with major winds since 2004, was that it absolutely decimated the power grid. If our fellow Members remember nothing else about what I have to say here today, it is that our power grid was absolutely annihilated--the worst that Duke Energy, FP&L, and municipal electricity providers like KUA and OUC said they have seen in their history.  There are people that are without power now--several hundred thousand--and it is primarily because we saw so many of these trees go down on power lines.  When I went through my district, I saw rivers swell to floods. We saw worse in Harvey--far worse flooding in We know with the supplemental FEMA packages that we are going to have to take care of Texas and But there are areas that are still under water as of yesterday, as of last night, and as of this morning. A few of them in east Orlando, where the Econlockhatchee River swelled over into the swamps and over into apartment buildings.  There were still, unfortunately, some UCF students that needed to evacuate; and I think, after the firefighters got there with the fire trucks, they heeded that warning.  I saw in Kissimmee flooding in the Mill Slough area. The slough flooded over. And we saw in Buenaventura Lakes flooding in the streets in many neighborhoods.  I witnessed folks throughout the area in mobile homes suffer pretty extreme damage in certain areas of Polk  I commend FEMA for allowing these counties and many others on the central and southern part of the State to get the designation of individual assistance. These folks are still without power--many of them worried about the dangers that are still going on. So to know that the Federal Government--Congress--has their back is absolutely a hope that they can hang on to as they sit day after day without[[Page H7416]]power, slowly but surely getting back on their feet.  I will be having outreach events throughout the district. Some of my fellow peers who went through Harvey have suggested that it is critical to have these, not only major FEMA centers, but ones that are embedded in the various neighborhoods, because some people have trouble getting gas and transporting around, and have trouble through mass transit getting to some of these major centers.                              {time}  1245  So we will be following the cue of others, our brothers and sisters in Houston, by having localized FEMA outreach centers in the district, and I look forward to hosting some of those this week.  Throughout the State, we see the Federal and State government working hand in hand with our local governments.  It is key that we are going to need a supplemental package for Texas, parts of Louisiana, Florida, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Georgia and South I know that Congress, like last Friday, will hopefully come together to pass that package.  One of the things that we are going to need to do going forward is continue encouraging local governments and utilities to harden their infrastructure. We in the Federal Government should be promoting and matching funds with those utilities that are going to put their power lines underground. The cost of keeping them up aboveground is going to continue to exacerbate these disasters.  Just understanding by the numbers, we had one of the largest evacuations in the Nation's history. Nearly 7 million people were asked to evacuate from central and southeastern Florida to shelters or other facilities. As of Monday morning, over 200,000 Floridians were still in shelters.  Nearly 33.8 million Floridians lost power to their homes and businesses, with hundreds of thousands still without power.  We saw a massive hit to our citrus crop, which is already struggling with citrus greening, and we have bipartisan letters going out from Congressman Ross, Congressman Rooney, myself, and others making sure that the USDA follows along with FEMA to make sure that our citrus growers can have some relief as they grapple with what will be a dismal 2017-2018 crop.  We saw Florida's coasts, especially in cities like Jacksonville, experience historic flooding. The Atlantic came into the The Johns, being one of those rivers that flows north, took much of the water from central Florida and brought it forward to create a terrible situation of flooding of 2 to 3 feet in downtown Jacksonville alone.  For the first time in U.history, we saw two Category 4 hurricanes make landfall in the same year. Obviously, we need to continue to prepare for the increasing weather events caused by man-made climate change, and that will be why, whether you agree or not with the cause of it, that we will need to harden our facilities, our infrastructure, our buildings, and our utilities. Whether or not you agree with what the cause of it is, we know that the solutions are making sure to have more resilient infrastructure, building up our coasts, and making sure that we have, through the Federal Government, incentives for our local and State governments to do that.  Officials have reported 31 dead across three States in connection with this hurricane, 24 of those in  One other area that Congress needs to look at is generators for our nursing homes. This is already required under Florida law, yet we saw several people yesterday, eight of them, pass, our seniors in their golden years, who should be protected.  And when you are talking about no power in Florida, you are talking about not only no ability to turn on the lights, but air-conditioning, which is critical when it is 90-plus degrees out, particularly for our seniors, our children, and our persons with disabilities.  I want to thank all of our first responders: our firefighters; our cops; our EMTs; all the county officials and city officials who put together all this demanding information to get the FEMA Individual Assistance designation; our local officials for continuing, to this moment, to give us information on hardest hit areas; and also our community for coming together, our volunteers, those who are helping get the trees out of the streets, for providing water and food to hardest hit areas, to people opening up their homes, contributing through nonprofits such as the Red All these issues, all these commitments, all this volunteerism is coming together to help out our constituents.  I am appreciative, Mr.Speaker, for this time to be able to brief Congress on some of the issues affecting central Florida, and I thank my peers for their help and for their continued efforts in Texas, in Florida, in Puerto Rico, in the Virgin Islands, and in South Carolina and Georgia, where we saw a lot of this damage happening.

It is a huge decrease--just pick up the paper and see what is going on in the world--when we know that the national security threats to the United States have dramatically increased. We have decreasing budgets and increasing national security challenges, and this NDAA begins the much needed process of changing that.  I would like to focus on one such threat that we need to address right now that is at the doorstep of our great Nation and what the NDAA is doing specifically about that threat. The threat is North Korea's nuclear intercontinental ballistic activity and capability. As the Presiding Officer knows, that has now literally become a threat to every city in the United States, not just to frontline States like mine, which is the great State of Alaska, or Hawaii, as they are closer to Asia than is any other place in the United This threat is now on the doorstep of every American city.  For years, a lot of the ``experts'' and intel officials were saying: Hey, don't worry about this. They are trying, but this threat is a long way off into the future.  Some of us were skeptical of those estimates, and now we know those estimates were wrong. It is no longer a matter of ``if'' but ``when'' the North Korean regime will have the capability of launching a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile that will be aimed at the United States of  Recently, there was a disturbing article written in the Washington Post, the lead paragraph of which reads:       North Korea will be able to field a reliable, nuclear-     capable intercontinental ballistic missile as early as next      year, U.officials have concluded in a confidential      assessment, that dramatically shrinks the timeline for when      Pyongyang could strike North American cities with atomic      weapons.  This assessment was leaked by someone within the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, and it shaves almost 2 full years off of what we thought North Korea's capability was. Right now, the threat is here. Think about this threat with regard to who is leading North Korea--an unstable dictator who has shown that he is not rational.  Let me go into a little bit more of the threat here. When you look at the different regimes--Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Un, who is the current dictator of North Korea--in just the 5 years since he has come to power, he has conducted more than 80 missile tests and over twice as many nuclear tests as both his father and grandfather did in their 60 years of ruling North Look at this chart. It shows missile tests, nuclear tests--5 years--way more than his father and grandfather ever did.  And while several of these missile tests have been failures, we have obviously seen clear successes. In fact, while many Americans were celebrating the Fourth of July holiday--our patriotism, our liberty, our military--Kim Jong Un launched a successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile.  On the nuclear side, we have seen activity even more recently, allegedly a test of a hydrogen bomb with an estimated yield of 120 kilotons--their third nuclear test since January 2016. It was eight times more powerful than their last test.  The bottom line with regard to this threat from a very unstable regime is they are making very significant progress.  So that is the threat. It is very real--on our shores--led by an unstable dictator who has threatened to use these weapons.  What are we doing about it? Well, we have the capability to defend against this threat, and that capability is through much more enhanced missile defense for the homeland of the United States--for our cities. That is what this National Defense Authorization Act does.  Unfortunately, over the past several years, the Federal Government has not taken homeland missile defense very seriously. One study recently found that in its history, our homeland missile defense has been characterized by a ``trend of high ambition followed by increasing modesty.''  The ``high ambition'' has been largely driven by the threats to our Nation, but the modesty component has been largely a function of decreasing budgets for the Missile Defense In fact, from 2006 to 2016, the Missile Defense Agency's budget has declined nearly 25 percent. Homeland missile defense testing has declined by nearly 83 percent. So when our adversaries are testing and advancing, we have been going in the opposite direction.  I am glad to say that this year's NDAA reverses this long-term trend of homeland missile defense neglect.  Earlier this year, with a number of my colleagues in this body, we introduced the Advancing America's Missile Defense Act of 2017. This is a bill that we worked on for months, with experts in missile defense, the military experts, the civilian experts, to say: What do we need to better protect the United States of America? What are the key elements? We put this together in a bill that we introduced several months ago, focusing on the following key areas:  First, the Advancing America's Missile Defense Act would dramatically increase our capacity for what are called our ground-based missile interceptors--up to 28 more interceptors--and require our military to look at fielding 100 more--up to 100 missile interceptors--to fully protect the United  Second, our bill would advance the technology to not only have more ground-based missile interceptors but the kill vehicles on top of those missiles--the bullets from which the missiles could shoot additional warheads. This is technology that is advancing, but it needs to advance much more quickly.  Third, our bill looks at integrating the different missile defense systems throughout the world. So in theater, for example, in South Korea, we have the THAAD system, and we have that on We have Aegis systems with our Navy ships, and then we have our ground-based system back home, in the homeland of the United Our bill looks at integrating these systems with a space-based sensor, to have an unblinking eye, in terms of the technology, that can track and shoot down missiles coming to the United States and integrate with regional defenses and our homeland defenses.  Fourth, our bill focuses on more testing for missile defense.  As I mentioned, the decline of the testing has inhibited the development of these systems. It focuses on the testing but also doing the testing with our allies that are also advancing missile defense in different areas of the world.  As I mentioned, we worked on this bill for months. One of the key elements I am most proud of in this bill is the strong bipartisan support it has received in the Senate and in the Importantly, when we introduced it as part of the NDAA markup, we had over one-quarter of all of the Members of the U.Senate who were already cosponsors--Democrats and Republicans[[Page S5724]]from literally every region of the United  This is a first and important development in a long time with regard to missile defense. Unfortunately, for years, that has been viewed as a partisan issue, not a bipartisan issue. And what we were trying to do as we developed this bill was to say this shouldn't be partisan. This is a threat that every city in America is going to have to deal with. Let's work together and get a bipartisan bill together.  I was proud when the Wall Street Journal editorial wrote about this bill and emphasized that bipartisan nature. A few months ago they wrote:       [The Advancing America's Missile Defense Act] has united      conservatives such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and liberal      Democrats such as Gary Peters and Brian Schatz, no small feat      in the Trump era. . . . Mr.Sullivan's missile-defense      amendment would be a down payment on a safer America in an      ever more dangerous world.  Why did they write this? Because they understand the importance of having bipartisan support for missile defense but also the importance of making sure that Congress leads on this important issue. Thankfully, that is what the NDAA does this year--both versions--the Senate version and the House version.  The vast majority of our bill that we introduced we debated in the markup for the NDAA this year. Again, I thank Senators McCain and Reed and other members of the committee for the way in which the broader NDAA came together. But we debated this bill, and the vast majority of our bill on advancing America's missile defense is now in this NDAA--one of the many reasons I am encouraging all of my colleagues in the Senate to vote to pass it.  Something else that I think is important for my constituents to know but also for all Americans to know is the role that Alaska plays in America's missile defense. For those of my colleagues who sit on the Armed Services Committee, they have heard me say this many, many times. There is a famous quote in congressional testimony back in the 1930s by the father of the Air Force, Billy His quote in front of Congress was: Alaska is the most strategic place in the world because of its location on the top of the world. Whoever owns Alaska literally controls the world.  Fortunately, the United States owns So we are, because of that strategic location, the cornerstone of our Nation's missile defense. If there were a missile launched from North Korea or Iran or anywhere else in the world, the trajectory would take it over It would be tracked by radars in It would be shot down by missiles based in The 49th Missile Defense Battalion located at Fort Greely, AK, is a National Guard unit. They have a fantastic motto: 300 protecting the 300 million--young men and women serving in the Guard on duty 24/7, protecting the entire country--300 of them protecting the entire United That is a worthy mission that we are glad is done so well by the members of the Alaska National  So this bill does a lot. The NDAA this year, which we are debating on the floor now, finally takes seriously this important mission of missile defense. As I have noted, it does a lot to advance it.  We have a couple of additional amendments that we are working on and hopefully are going to get passed out of the managers' package that would make even more advances to missile defense. We are going to continue to work those, and, hopefully, we will continue to have the bipartisan support that we did when this bill was marked up.  I remain hopeful that we are finally starting to reverse the trend in missile defense that, as I noted earlier, was one of high ambition followed by increasing modesty.  Today we need ambition, and we need action. The threat warrants it. The American people demand it. The Congress must step up and deliver it. That is what is happening in this NDAA, along with many other important and critical provisions for our Nation's military. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of passage of this important bill.                       Tribute to Micah McKinnis  Madam President, Micah McKinnis began working for me 2 years ago as my military legislative correspondent.

373,topic-id,321,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the passage of the Dream Act, and I request my Democratic and Republican colleagues to stand together to try and address this very important issue in our country.  The issue of undocumented immigrants has been plaguing this country for almost 30 years now, going back to the 1980s, when people flowed over in the thousands from El Salvador during the death squads and the civil wars during that time.  As the mayor of the city of Glen Cove back in the 1990s, we dealt with this issue in my city, on one side people saying, ``Get those people out of here,'' on the other side people saying, ``They are just trying to live the American Dream like your father did.'' My father emigrated from I am a first-generation ``They are just trying to live the American Dream like your family did, trying to work hard and live a better life here in this country.''  When dealing with these difficult questions, we have to rely on the fundamental principles of this country, namely, that all men and women are created equal--not all men and women with a green card or all men and women with a passport, but all men and women are created equal and are entitled to be treated with human respect and dignity.  When looking at the DREAMers, we are talking about people who came to this country under 17 years of age, who have lived a productive life, who have either graduated from high school or received a GED and have now either gone to college or are serving in the military or have been working for the past 3 years and have no criminal background.

I want to thank the chairman, my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and my counterparts on the House Armed Services Committee for their commitment to continue this conversation in conference. It is essential that we provide both the Department and industry the proper tools, protections, and incentives necessary to continue these mutually beneficial partnerships on the commercial off-the-shelf and the custom-developed software side. I am confident we can reach consensus and send the President language that clearly articulates a fair and sustainable model for existing and future contracts.  Madam President, as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel, I would like to make a statement for the record about an item of special interest related to the Department of Defense's use of its intellectual property rights in certain drug products within the committee report on the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018.  The committee report contains language that directs the Defense Department to exercise its rights under the Bayh-Dole Act ``to authorize third parties to use inventions that benefited from DOD funding whenever the price of a drug, vaccine, or other medical technology is higher in the United States'' as compared to prices in foreign countries.  This language is of concern to me for several reasons. The DOD and other Federal agencies face significant obstacles such as low procurement quantities, high regulatory risk, and complex Federal contracting regulations when working to attract the top vaccine and drug developers as partners in medical countermeasure development to protect the warfighter and America's citizens. Diluting intellectual property protections as a means of price control will not only fail to meet its objective, but it could significantly hamper the government's efforts to develop these critical medical capabilities. The report language could lead to decreased investments in medical countermeasures development and a drop-off in industry partnerships with DOD that can ultimately result in few new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics.  Bayh-Dole has created a fragile ecosystem of collaboration among Federal agencies, public research institutions, and private industry, resulting in the commercialization of inventions for use by the American people, especially in the area of medical countermeasures often developed specifically for our servicemembers and veterans. The idea of regulating the price of a commercialized invention was never contemplated by Congress when passing the Bayh-Dole  I have concerns that the committee report language could chill medical innovation by raising the risk of a Federal partnership to a level that is unacceptable for many private entities. This is problematic for small businesses that have less capital to risk on products subject to unpredictable price controls. While the availability of medical innovations to the American public remains an area of great interest to me, I strongly believe that we should pursue more appropriate and effective ways to achieve this goal without stifling innovation or discouraging public private partnerships.

Additional utilities joined the coalition over the following decades, and in 1956, it became known as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland--PJM--Interconnection, the name used today. Around the same time, PJM expanded its use of new technology by installing its first online computer to control electric generation and later to monitor grid operations in real time, which led to improved reliability and better customer service.  PJM is also celebrating its 20th anniversary as an independent system operator, In 1997, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, approved PJM as the Nation's first fully functioning ISO, which operates but does not own electric transmission systems. Five years later, PJM became the first regional transmission organization in the country when FERC encouraged the formation of these entities to increase access to competitive wholesale energy markets. Over the past two decades, PJM has continued its focus on innovation and customer service by expanding utility membership, developing generating capacity, and diversifying its energy portfolio to include coal, natural gas, and nuclear.  In addition, PJM is recognized by its peers as a leader in the competitive wholesale electricity sector. The firm continues to focus on improving energy storage, grid technology, and demand response.

45,topic-id,1207,"Mr.President, 12 days ago, Equifax, one of the Nation's largest credit reporting agencies, disclosed that hackers had breached its system and stolen highly personal information on nearly half of Social Security numbers, birth dates, home addresses, phone numbers, even credit card numbers--all in the hands of criminals.  Since then, I have heard from working families in Massachusetts and all across the country. The Equifax hack is a nightmare. At best, it is a giant hassle--time on hold with the credit reporting agencies, fees for this service and that service, confusion about what has been stolen and what to do about it. At worst, it could be ruinous--a lifetime of responsible spending and borrowing wiped out by identity theft and fraud. People are outraged, and rightly so.  Bad enough that Equifax is so sloppy that they let hackers into their system, but the company's response to the hack has been even worse. First, Equifax hid the information about the breach for 40 days--40 days. Equifax gave criminals a 40-day headstart to use the information they had stolen, while the rest of us were left in the dark.  Then, when Equifax finally decided to disclose the breach, they didn't call or send letters to the millions of Americans who were victims of the hack. No, they announced the breach and then made everyone go to an Equifax website and turn over more personal information to see if they were one of the people who had been affected. Once Equifax had the new information, they provided confusing and misleading information about whether the person had actually been a victim of the breach.  Worse still, while Equifax was unclear about whether someone's information had been stolen, they were very clear about one thing: Everyone, whether or not their information was stolen, should sign up for a supposedly free Equifax credit monitoring service called TrustedID The terms of use for this program initially required anyone who signed up to have a credit card. Why? Because after the first year, Equifax could start automatically charging the credit card for the service if the customer hadn't already canceled. That is right. Equifax was trying to impose secret fees and profit off the hack of their own system.  But wait, it got even worse. To sign up for this credit monitoring service, Equifax at first forced consumers to give up their right to go to court and sue Equifax if they had any disputes about the product. Equifax changed some of the terms after there was a lot of public pressure.  Let me see if I can recap all this. After allowing hackers to steal personal information on as many as 143 million Americans, Equifax hid the breach from consumers for more than a month, failed to clearly inform people whether the information had been stolen, then tried to profit off the breach by tricking people into signing up for a costly credit monitoring product that also required them to give up their legal rights.  In the last decade, there has been so much corporate misconduct, so much bald-faced contempt for consumers, that at times it seems as though we have all just grown numb to it. But even against that backdrop, Equifax's conduct is just jaw-dropping.  It is time for us to fight back. It is time for all of us to fight back--Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Libertarians, vegetarians--it doesn't matter. We have all been victims of the Equifax hack, or we know someone who has, and we all deserve better. That is why I partnered with Senator Schatz and 10 of our colleagues to introduce the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation Act, or FREE Act, last Our bill empowers consumers to take back control of their personal credit data.  The Equifax hack has highlighted the strange role of credit reporting agencies like Equifax and how they interface with our financial system. Banks and other big companies feed agencies like Equifax information about every financial transaction you make, from purchasing a car, to taking out a mortgage, to buying a home, to getting a student loan. They get information on every monthly payment you make, and they know where you live and how long you have lived there and what your phone number is. Every day, the credit reporting agencies package up that information about you into files that they then sell to other people. Sometimes it is people you know about, like when you apply for a mortgage or a car loan, but a lot of times, Equifax is selling data to people who want to sell you something--credit cards or student loan refinance or even a cruise.  The bottom line is that companies like Equifax are making billions of dollars a year collecting, sharing, and selling highly personal information about you, all without your explicit permission or without paying you a penny.  The FREE Act tries to level the playing field. First, it allows every consumer to freeze and unfreeze their credit file for free. If you freeze your credit file, no one can access it, and the credit reporting agency can't use it either. A freeze is like a ``do not call'' list for your credit information. It is about security. It means that even after the Equifax hack, thieves can't open credit cards or take out loans in your name even if they have your personal information. But it is also an easy way to give you the power to decide who gets your information for any other reason. The basic idea is simple: Equifax doesn't pay you when they sell your data, and you shouldn't have to pay Equifax to keep them from selling it.  Our bill says that the same rules apply to all three credit reporting companies, and all three companies must refund your money if they charged you for a credit freeze in the aftermath of the Equifax breach. No one in this industry should profit from this hack.  This bill doesn't fix all the problems in the credit reporting industry. It is only a first step.  Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has been looking into the credit reporting industry for years, and she has introduced comprehensive legislation to reform the industry and empower consumers.

275,topic-id,1830,"Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support my bipartisan amendment with Senator Lee calling for a ``think first'' assessment of recent Russian violations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the response of the United  The INF Treaty has been the bedrock of European security for nearly three decades, and Congress must ask a few reasonable questions before we fund a missile research and development program that our military leaders have not asked for, that our allies do not want, that would undermine the spirit and intent of our longstanding treaty commitment, and that would make the world a more dangerous place.  No one is more concerned about Russia's recent aggression than I am. From their annexation of Crimea to their meddling in our election and the elections of our allies, Russia's behavior must be met with a firm and unequivocal response.  Last month, I traveled to the Baltics to see firsthand the threat Russia poses to NATO allies and to meet with senior U.Army officials and local political leaders. On that trip, one thing was abundantly clear: We need to be tough in the face of Russian provocation, but we also need to be smart. That is what our amendment is about today. It isn't about playing politics; it is about smart, strategic, informed toughness that advances the interests of the United States of  The INF treaty, negotiated and signed by President Reagan nearly 30 years ago, erased an entire class of nuclear weapons from the European continent. It eliminated ground-launched missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers--roughly up to twice the distance between Moscow and This is also the same class of missile that Russia deployed earlier this year, in violation of the treaty.  Russia's treaty violations have been widely reported. There is no question that bringing Russia back into compliance with the treaty must be a top priority. Russian compliance is in the best interest of the United States, it is in the best interest of our European and Asia Pacific allies, and it is ultimately in the best interest of the Russian But this is a tough job. Our military leaders have told us they see no indication that Russia plans to resume honoring its treaty obligations anytime soon.  In the short term, we must ensure that Russia does not gain a military advantage from its violation and that Russia--Russia--takes the blame on the world stage for breaking this treaty. We cannot accomplish these goals by signaling to the world that we have lost faith in the very treaty we seek to preserve. But that is exactly what section 1635 of the NDAA would do. This section calls for the ``establishment of a research and development program for a dual-capable, road-mobile, ground-launched missile system with a maximum range of 5,500 kilometers''--or, in plain language, the development of a new nuclear missile that we have publicly sworn never to test or deploy.  The proposed R&D program is in itself not a violation of the INF treaty, which only bans testing and deployment, but there is no denying that such a missile program is a violation of the spirit and intent of our treaty commitment, and that is exactly how our allies and adversaries alike will see it.  The reality of this proposal is crystal clear: Either we are authorizing millions of taxpayer dollars to be wasted on research and development of a missile we never intend to build or test, or we are pushing the door wide open to an upcoming violation of the INF  In opening that door, we would be signaling not only to the Russians but also to our treaty partners around the world that the United States is preparing to walk away from a nuclear treaty commitment. In sending that signal, we are basically giving Russia the excuse it is looking for to shed remaining international constraints, to justify an acceleration of its intermediate-range nuclear program, and to spark a new contest of nuclear escalation. Such a move can quickly increase the number of nuclear weapons deployed throughout the world and send the globe into a second cold war reality--a reality where we live with the constant threat that one preemptive move, one miscalculation could wipe away everything we hold dear.  Supporters claim that a new missile is needed not only to compete with Russia but also to counter a more assertive China, which is not bound by the agreement. But I have seen no evidence to support these arguments. If anything, a tit-for-tat response is more likely to embolden Putin to up the ante by deploying some more missiles and perhaps withdrawing from the INF Treaty altogether.  The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Paul Selva, has already told us that a new intermediate-range missile is not necessary to hold targets in China at risk.  To ensure that our response to Russian treaty violations is based in international strategy rather than just in knee-jerk responses, Senator Lee and I are offering a commonsense amendment requiring that before we spend a dime of taxpayer money on the proposed missile program, the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State should work together to address a few critical questions.  First, what is the status, capability, and threat posed to our allies by Russia's new ground-launched cruise missile?  Secretary Mattis has stated that Russia's treaty violation would not provide Russia with a ``significant military advantage.'' Is this still the Secretary's assessment? General Selva has said: ``Given the location of the specific missile and the deployment, [the Russians] don't gain any advantage in Europe.'' Is this still the general's assessment? We should not blindly commit taxpayer money and undermine our treaty commitment without understanding the threat.  Second, does our military believe that a new ground-launched, intermediate-range missile that is not compliant with our treaty obligations is our most effective response to Russia?  The Pentagon did not request funding for a new intermediate-range missile. According to a report by the Pentagon just last year, there are multiple options on the table to pressure Russia back into treaty compliance, including enhancements to the European Reassurance Initiative and additional active defenses. That is in addition to the other available tools of national power that could strengthen, rather than weaken, the INF  The Pentagon advocated for just such a multipronged approach, writing that ``Russia's return to compliance with its obligations under the INF treaty remains the preferable outcome, which argues against unilateral U.withdrawal or abrogation of the INF treaty at this time.''  With the Pentagon reviewing options, Congress's proposed playground approach of ``if you build a ground-based missile, I will build one too'' is not the strategic response of generals and statesmen. In fact, the administration has said that this new program would ``unhelpfully'' tie them ``to a specific type of missile system . . . which would limit potential military response options'' at a time when DOD, State, and Treasury are ``developing an integrated diplomatic, military, and economic response strategy to maximize pressure on Russia.'' We must let our military leaders and our diplomats[[Page S5726]]do their jobs and inform Congress before we act.  Third question: Will our NATO allies stand with us in this response, and will any of our allies even be willing to host such a missile system if we decide to deploy it?  Given our geographic advantages, a missile of this range does no good on U.soil; it only works if it is installed on the ground of our NATO allies.  The last time the United States weighed a land-based escalation in Europe, millions of citizens took to the streets in protest, and in the 21st century, that call for nuclear disarmament of the European continent has only grown. As General Selva recently acknowledged, we don't even know whether any of our European allies would permit the deployment of a nuclear-capable ground-launched missile on their territory.  During the Cold War, Russian deployments of land-based cruise missiles targeting Europe were, in part, a ploy to cause division among the NATO countries, and the same could be said today. It is critical that we respond as one indivisible NATO coalition, unshaken by Russia's provocations.  So that is it--three must-ask questions deserving of must-have answers: What is the nature of the threat? What is the Pentagon's recommended military response? What action unites us with our NATO allies? Until we have those answers, heading down the path of destroying the INF Treaty is grossly irresponsible.  Support to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and prevent their spread to more nations has always been a nonpartisan issue.  When President Reagan signed this treaty into law, he said that ``patience, determination, and commitment made this impossible vision [of the INF Treaty] a reality.'' Ever since then, the treaty has served as the bedrock of our efforts to build a safe and peaceful world in a nuclear age; to build a world where schoolchildren spend their days learning to read and write, not practicing duck-and-cover drills; to build a world where families live in hope for what tomorrow may bring, not in fear that a flash of light may sweep away everything they love; to build a world that looks to the United States to steadily lead toward sustained peace and security. This amendment continues in that spirit.  I thank Senator Lee for his leadership on this bipartisan effort. When we announced this amendment, he said that the amendment ``would set the precedent that the [United States] should not immediately react to an adversary's treaty violation by violating the same treaty ourselves. That's not how working in good faith in the international community is done.'' He is right.  I want to acknowledge Senator Cardin, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Feinstein, a longtime arms control champion, and thank them for their leadership to prevent nuclear proliferation and ensure that America upholds its international obligations. I thank Senator Reed, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, for his strong support on this issue. We are all grateful for his efforts.  On the 30th anniversary of the treaty, we must give no cause to doubt that the United States stands by its word, that it is committed to this treaty, and that it is committed to working with allies to bring Russia back into compliance.  The INF Treaty removed thousands of nuclear weapons from the face of the globe, and we must be certain that we have exhausted all options before we walk away from it.  Rather than simply dusting off a nuclear escalation play from the early 1980s, I ask my colleagues to join us in allowing the Secretaries of Defense and State to do their jobs, to weigh the options, and to recommend a course of action. I ask them to join us in allowing information and strategy to guide our policy. I ask them to join us in supporting this amendment to the  Madam President, I yield the floor.

66,topic-id,2240,"Mr.President, each week that you see me standing here means another week in which the Senate of the United States has sat out doing anything to address climate change and another week of carbon pollution streaming into our atmosphere and oceans. Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is changing our atmosphere and our oceans. We see it everywhere. We see it in storm-damaged homes and flooded cities. We see it in drought-stricken farms and raging wildfires. We see it in fish disappearing from warming, acidifying waters. We see it in shifting habitats and migrating contagions.  All these harms we see carry costs--real economic costs--to homeowners, business owners, and taxpayers. That cost to homeowners, business owners, and taxpayers is known as the social cost of carbon pollution. It is the damage that people and communities and States suffer from carbon pollution and climate change. The Office of Management and Budget last calculated the social cost of carbon to be around $49 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. If you just do some simple math, you can multiply the total measured U.emissions coming from energy production alone in 2016--that is emissions of over 5.7 billion tons of CO2--by the $49 cost per ton. It is pretty simple math: $49 times 5.7 billion tons gives you about $280 billion. So $280 billion is the annual cost that the fossil fuel industry offloads onto the American public in harm from the carbon dioxide emissions. That is a big number and a big consequence--$280 billion per year.  There was a more complex analysis than my simple math that was done by the International Monetary The International Monetary Fund has a lot of smart people. They don't have any conflict of interest that I am aware of in dealing with this issue. Their calculation puts the annual subsidy just in the United States of America for the fossil fuel industry at $700 billion per year.  So is it my simple math where the social cost of carbon is $280 billion per year or is it what the International Monetary Fund calculated at $700 billion per year? Whichever it is, it is a big enough harm to the American public that you would think we might do something about it here in the But of course, we don't because that huge social cost of carbon, that huge subsidy gives the fossil fuel industry the biggest incentive in the world to--instead of fixing up its situation and cleaning up its mess--come over here and instead mess with our politics so that our ability to deal with this issue is silenced by their political muscle and manipulations.  One way in which they play this game is to populate the climate denial machinery with one-eyed accountants--accountants who can only see the pollutants' side of the ledger. Honestly, we hear their testimony. The only thing they see is the cost to polluters of reducing their pollution. They don't see the public harm side of the ledger. They pretend it is a liberal conspiracy cooked up by the Obama administration. Or say you are the Republican chairman of the House Science Committee and you say: The social cost of carbon is a ``flawed value . . . to justify the [EPA's] alarmist reasoning for support of the Clean Power Plan and other climate regulations.''  Actually, if you take away the bad words ``flawed'' and ``alarmist'' and all of that stuff, the statement is actually true. There is a value to avoiding carbon pollution, and defending that public value from the polluters does justify the Clean Power This is the social cost of carbon. Let's go back for a minute to 2006, when the Bush administration's National Highway Transportation Safety Administration put out a rule for vehicle fuel economy standards. There was some dissatisfaction with that rule. States and other stakeholders complained that this rule failed to take into account the social cost of carbon emissions from cars--something that should matter for a rule that is looking to reduce emissions from cars. Well, that went up on appeal to the U.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and in 2007, the Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. The court acknowledged that there is a cost of carbon pollution, and that cost is ``certainly not zero.'' So it told the agency to go back, redo the rule and to come up with a real social cost of carbon. Thus was born the legal requirement that agencies consider a social cost of carbon in decisions.  Because of this decision, the Bush administration produced a wide range of numbers up to $159 per ton of carbon emissions. The Obama administration continued the effort to calculate a social cost of carbon. An interagency working group, including scientists and economists from across the Federal Government, relied on existing scientific literature and on well vetted scientific models to produce a first standard in 2010, with additional updates in 2013, 2015, and 2016.  When Federal agencies didn't apply any social cost of carbon, courts corrected them. In 2014, a Federal judge in Colorado faulted the Bureau of Land Management for failing to account for greenhouse gas emissions when it approved an Arch Coal mine expansion in the Gunnison National The court suspended the approval until the Bureau of Land Management either used the social cost of carbon or gave a valid explanation as to why not. When agencies did use the social cost of carbon, their decisions were upheld. In 2016 the U.Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the Department of Energy's use of the social cost of carbon in the agency's standards for commercial refrigeration equipment. The industry objected, and on appeal, the Seventh Circuit said: No, they did the right thing putting that in there.  Just last month, a three-judge panel from another U.circuit court of appeals--in this case, the U.Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit--ruled that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has to consider the effects of carbon emissions that would result from building three pipelines in the Specifically, the ruling directed FERC to either better calculate the project's carbon emissions, using the social cost of carbon, or explain why it didn't use it.  Also last month, another U.district court blocked another coal mine expansion in Montana, citing the agency's failure to assess the environmental effects of coal. Specifically, the judge referenced the agency's failure to include any social cost of carbon.  Just last week a Federal appeals court in Denver told the Bureau of Land Management that its lack of analysis on the climate effects of four coal leases in the Powder River Basin was ``irrational'' and told them to start over.  It is not just Federal courts. Agencies at the State level are also using the social cost of carbon pollution in their activities. The New York Public Service Commission affirmed the importance of the social cost of carbon in its zero-emissions credit program. The Illinois State legislature also incorporated a social cost of carbon into its zero-emissions credit program, and prevailed in a challenge in the courts. These State zero-emissions programs were the programs that were rolled out to help existing nuclear energy providers against competition by natural gas plants. The carbon price allowed carbon-free nuclear generation to better compete in the wholesale markets.  Up in Minnesota, since 1993, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has required utilities to consider the estimated cost of carbon emissions in planning for new infrastructure projects. This year, the commission voted to raise its social cost of carbon to $43 per ton.  The Colorado Public Utilities Commission recently ordered the local utility Xcel to use the social cost of carbon in its resource planning documents. Colorado told its utilities to use $43 per ton starting in 2022 and to ramp up to nearly $70 per ton by 2050.  It is not just Federal courts and State agencies. Private companies in the United States and around the globe are incorporating the social cost of carbon into their own operations and accounting. Investors are beginning to demand that corporations perform this kind of analysis in order to qualify for investment. Big investors like Black Rock have taken on big companies like Exxon in order to break through the denial.  Just last week, the Washington Post reported that 1,200 global businesses either have adopted or are adopting a carbon price in some form. The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions found that companies like Microsoft,[[Page S5850]]Disney, the insurance giant Swiss Re, Unilever, Shell, BP, the mining corporation Rio Tinto, and General Motors have all taken steps to put a price on their own use of carbon.  Courts have made it the law for agencies to use the social cost of carbon. States are deploying the social cost of carbon. The business community recognizes and is incorporating into its financial planning the social cost of carbon. Yet here in Congress and down at the Trump White House, the leaders of the Republican Party continue to ignore climate change, pretend it doesn't exist, and ignore the very real costs that society bears from carbon pollution.  It goes without saying that the storm that has just ravaged Florida was spun up by warmer ocean waters, carried more rain because of warmer air, dumped more rain, and pushed storm surge further into Florida because of risen seas and those other characteristics.  Are we seeing any action? The President in March issued a sweeping Executive order rolling back Federal energy and environmental standards. It disbanded the interagency working group, and it asserted that the social cost of carbon was ``no longer representative of governmental policy.'' Nice try with that, given where the courts are.  Of course, the House and the Senate Republicans followed suit by introducing a pair of bills by Congressman Evan Jenkins on the House side and our colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford, on our side that purport to prohibit the Federal Government from using the social cost of carbon in rulemaking and in regulatory processes. Of course, you can't do that, and those laws aren't going anywhere. Why? Because they violate a very basic principle both in courts and in administrative agencies. That very basic principle is at the heart of the rule of law, and it is that facts have to be factual and that conclusions have to be logical. Any decision that fails this standard--that is, to use the administrative law terms ``arbitrary and capricious'' or ``not based on substantial evidence''--fails as a matter of law. Although Congress, of course, is bound and gagged by the polluters and their front groups, it is going to be hard for those polluters to try to stop the social cost of carbon in courts and administrative agencies. Despite the efforts of ExxonMobil and the Koch brothers to make America their fossil fuel banana republic, we still are a rule-of-law country and those rule-of-law principles that facts must be factual and that conclusions must be logical are too basic for our courts and administrative agencies to ignore.  In our courts and administrative agencies, lying and misleading can be exposed on cross-examination, for instance, and lying and misleading gets you punished, unlike in Congress where lying and misleading have been fossil fuel tactics for decades and sickeningly successful ones backed up by huge political muscle.  The failure in Congress and the remedy in the courts is one reason the Founding Fathers designed our government that way so that even where political branches of government were captured by special interests, there would still be a path for the truth, and there would still be a means for justice to have its way.  If the courts and the States and so many major businesses are all behind recognizing the social cost of carbon, who is behind the President and our Republican colleagues in denying that it is real? In my experience, it is powerful trade associations like the American Petroleum Institute, the American Chemistry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.Chamber of Commerce, and others that have a distaste for any honest assessment of the social cost of carbon.  Right now, since the costs of those industries' pollution is offloaded onto the rest of us for free, why not? Why would they want to start paying for the harm they cause right now?  Think tanks and front groups funded by the Koch brothers and other polluters have vigorously fought against recognizing the fact of the social cost of carbon for years. These groups have neutral sounding names--maybe even friendly sounding names--like the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the American Energy Alliance, the Heritage Foundation, FreedomWorks--my personal favorite--the Heartland Institute, a group so good that it put up billboards comparing climate scientists to the It is really a classy contribution to the debate.  One thing this crowd of bad actors does know is how to throw its weight around, especially since the Citizens United decision threw open the floodgates of special interest money into our politics. That is what has put Congress in the thrall of the polluters. It is an indecent and wrong place for us to be, but with any luck, the adherence of courts and administrative agencies to the rule of law--the principles that facts must be factual and conclusions must be logical--will help us get out of the political trap that the fossil fuel industry has constructed.

Brunk, as we call him in Oregon, enlisted in December of 1981 and completed both airborne and ranger schools soon after his basic training. He demonstrated an early talent for leadership, and it wasn't long before he was being selected for command.  He deployed to Iraq with Oregon's 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team in 2003 as command sergeant major of the 162nd Infantry's 2nd Battalion and to Afghanistan in 2006, after being selected as command sergeant major of the 41st.  Between those overseas deployments, he served in New Orleans as part of the relief effort following Hurricane Katrina, helping to provide stability and support to Americans in desperate need of both.  Anybody who knows Brunk knows that he has been tireless in his pursuit of excellence and has served as an example to his colleagues in the Oregon Guard and elsewhere.  During his service in uniform, he earned a Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal, and Oregon Distinguished Service  Now I have always believed in the principle that friends don't filibuster friends, so I will not read the long list of Brunk's awards and commendations here, but let me tell you how pleased I was to learn in 2012 that Brunk had been promoted from command sergeant major of the Oregon National Guard to command sergeant major of the entire Army National  As the most senior enlisted member of the Army National Guard, Brunk made sure Army National Guard leaders took the needs of enlisted guardsmen into account and worked with his Active Duty counterparts to ensure policies made sense from a total Army perspective.[[Page S5857]]  It was a pleasure and a privilege of mine to work with him here in Washington over these past few years, particularly on issues like tuition benefits, which he rightly championed.

Before I finish, I want to point out that Brunk sprung his retirement on everybody, announcing it on his Facebook account. In true Brunk fashion, he noted that nobody celebrated when he joined the Guard, and so he didn't see a need to celebrate anything now.  This is the only time I can remember disagreeing with Brunk's assessment, and so it is my distinct honor to add my name to the long list of those who want to celebrate his career.

370,topic-id,2056,"Mr.President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I just want to draw attention to the central point the Senator from Illinois has been making tonight. He has been focused on what our duties to the American people are all about, which is to make their lives better and particularly to improve the quality of their healthcare, which is a lifeline for millions of families.  Now, instead of looking at bipartisan approaches to make the lives of our people better--Chairman Hatch and I introduced the children's health bill today. Nine million youngsters with that program get better health. Instead of focusing on that, as my colleague from Illinois has said, we are going to be looking at a bill that will hurt our people, will give them worse healthcare, will go backward with respect to the march in our country to make sure we recognize that all our people--all our people--deserve quality and affordable healthcare.  I particularly appreciate my colleague pointing out the contrast between where we ought to go with a bipartisan proposal like the children's health plan and where we shouldn't go--which is the Graham-Cassidy-Heller proposal which is going to go backward with respect to the healthcare needs of our people.  The fact is, Graham-Cassidy-Heller has been exposed to sunlight for just a few days, but it is already clear this legislation is a bad deal for the American people.  Now, Senator Cassidy has introduced healthcare bills before. Earlier this year, he introduced a bill with our colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, as an alternative to what the Senate Republican leadership put on offer. Now, I had my concerns with that proposal, but the first thing I want the Senate to understand is this Cassidy bill, which we will soon be considering, is much worse. The reason I say that is, this bill lowers the bar for legislation which has been hastily written and ill-considered. I want to be clear. This Cassidy bill will flunk the Jimmy Kimmel test of not hurting kids in America with preexisting conditions.  To make matters worse, just this evening, I have been informed that the Senate Finance Committee will shortly announce a hearing for next Monday on the Graham-Cassidy-Heller proposal. Contrary to the norms of the Senate Finance Committee, I was not consulted in this matter as the ranking I am all for debating major legislation, but talking about a piece of legislation which will not have the Congressional Budget Office--our independent arbiter of these matters--give us their thoughts on coverage or premium matters less than 48 hours before a vote is scheduled to happen is a sham process, which makes a mockery of the very eloquent words of our colleague from Arizona Senator McCain, who appealed for the regular way in which the Senate handles legislation.  This means Senators will not know how many millions of Americans are going to wake up not knowing if they have healthcare, how many seniors would get kicked out of a nursing home or see their core healthcare needs not met. How much will Americans' premiums go up? Senate Republicans have no answers on any of these matters.  What Graham-Cassidy-Heller does do is give a super block grant blank check to the They can do whatever they want--whatever they want--in terms of Americans' healthcare, and it guts the funding for those block grants over a very short period of time. This will mean a whale of a lot of pain for vulnerable people and an open door to some of the worst abuses of insurance companies, the abuses we thought we had gotten rid of. Democrats and Republicans thought we had gotten rid of them back when I introduced a bill with seven Democrats and seven Now we are talking about bringing them back. This bill amounts to the largest healthcare devolution, moving power without any accountability at all to the  Now, if I might get into some of the specifics. This bill does especially serious damage to In fact, it really hollows out the Medicaid  This year's debate over healthcare made one thing quite clear: Medicaid matters. It pays for the healthcare of our most vulnerable. It serves as a safety net for those who might not think they are ever going to need it. It covers nursing home care for older people who spend down hard-earned savings. It pays for critically needed addiction treatment services for those who struggle with opioids. We know that is what millions of Americans are facing now. It helps Americans with disabilities and kids with special needs[[Page S5799]]live a healthier, more productive life in their communities rather than in institutions.  That is just a little bit of the good Medicaid does for folks from Portland, OR, to Portland, Under the Graham-Cassidy-Heller proposal, that is gone--simply gone. The plan ends expanded Medicaid coverage which 11 million Americans count on right now. It caps Medicaid and guts hundreds of billions of dollars in support from the Federal In effect, it is like telling States, good luck, and telling them you can make the hard decisions about which Americans are going to get adequate healthcare and who are going to be those unfortunate souls who go without.  My view is, this is going to lead to destitution for older Americans who count on Medicaid for nursing home care. It also represents a massive transfer of dollars from States which expanded Medicaid to States which chose not to.  History tells us that the most vulnerable Americans without a voice or a powerful lobby are the ones who are going to be the worst off. Now, I have heard my colleagues--Senator Cassidy, in particular--claim that this bill is modeled on the Children's Health Insurance Program--which is a block-granted program--and that means all supporters of CHIP should support Graham-Cassidy- Nothing could be further from the truth. The Children's Health Insurance Program has been an extraordinarily successful program for more than 20 years, now covering 9 million youngsters. Part of that success is due to its reliance on a strong Medicaid If Medicaid and the rest of the healthcare system is block-granted and slashed by hundreds of billions of dollars, the pillars that support a successful Children's Health Insurance Program will crumble. They will lose their structural support. A vote in favor of Graham-Cassidy is a vote to demolish successful healthcare programs like the Children's Health Insurance Program and its promise of affordable healthcare for millions of kids and their families.  There is one more step that the Graham-Cassidy-Heller bill takes that is different from previous versions. Rather than reducing the tax credits that help Americans get help--similar to earlier Republican approaches--again, this bill just chucks them out, gets rid of them, gone. That means asking States to use their Federal health block grant for a whole host of competing healthcare priorities, in effect, pitting vulnerable Americans against each other and not having enough at the table to meet the critical needs of some of our most vulnerable people--people who, day in and day out, are walking on an economic tightrope, trying to balance their food costs against their medical costs and their medical costs against housing.  Graham-Cassidy-Heller is a recipe for disaster. This proposal, again, opens loopholes for insurance companies that, as I described, we thought we had closed, thought we had finally closed the book on the days when healthcare wasn't just for the healthy and wealthy. That is what happened when we had discrimination against those with preexisting conditions. If you had a preexisting condition and you were wealthy--just pay the bill. If you didn't have any preexisting conditions, there was nothing to worry about.  For the millions of people who finally got some peace of mind at night when we eliminated discrimination against those with preexisting conditions, this brings back that ugly prospect that a key consumer protection, the protection that bars discrimination against those who have preexisting conditions, is just tossed aside--just as what looks to be the setting aside of essential health benefits that all Americans are entitled to receive.  It was pretty obvious during the TrumpCare debate that unraveling the consumer protections that our people count on today leads to the entire system falling apart, and the vulnerable bear the brunt of the pain.  Many of our friends and neighbors have spent the year raising their voices and showing up to stop bad healthcare legislation. Thanks to their grassroots efforts, the partisan approach that I have described as being used here again has been stopped multiple times.  I wanted to come on the floor tonight to say to people in every community across our great country that, once again, we need people power. Once again, we need them to stand up and say that we don't want to turn back the clock on the healthcare needs of the most vulnerable, like seniors and the disabled and our kids. Once again, we hope they will speak out all across the country.  I am going to be having townhall meetings this upcoming weekend after the Jewish holiday. You can be sure that I am going to hear a lot from the people of Oregon about this. I am very hopeful that, once again, people power around America is going to come forward and say to those who are talking about supporting Graham-Cassidy-Heller that this is a mistake, that they don't want to turn back the clock with respect to healthcare; they want to move forward. Instead of turning back the clock, what they are looking for is leadership, for example, that will hold down their prescription drug costs.  I have introduced legislation to require these companies to publicly justify raising their prices. We have had Senators introduce a host of bills. That is what we ought to be doing--talking about how we are going to improve American healthcare.  My colleague from Illinois mentioned the Children's Health Insurance Program, which Chairman Hatch and I worked with our Finance colleagues to get introduced, and there is the Community Health Center I could go on and on about opportunities for bipartisanship to take the country in the right direction rather than in the wrong direction. Instead, it doesn't look as though that is going to be on offer any time soon. What is going to be on offer is a proposal that turns back the clock, guts Medicaid, harms seniors, harms the vulnerable, and I think would be a major mistake.  My bottom line has long been that for changes to the healthcare system to be sustainable and lasting, they have to be bipartisan. That is why I mentioned an effort that I was involved in. Several of my colleagues who cosponsored the bill I am talking about have been supportive of that for quite some time.  We know Republicans and Democrats know how to write bipartisan legislation. But what the Graham-Cassidy-Heller bill seeks to do is just the opposite--to use the most deeply partisan process the Senate knows, called reconciliation. It basically says: Our way or the highway--not interested in trying to find common ground.  I will point out that didn't end too well earlier when we talked about healthcare. I came to the floor tonight to make the case that we cannot let partisan reconciliation tactics win on this key issue. We ought to be working together to improve healthcare on a bipartisan basis, in a way that helps people all across the country.  I have mentioned--this is particularly important to me--a number of bills that colleagues on both sides of the aisle have worked on that would help improve the lives of the American people. Graham-Cassidy-Heller does not meet that test. I hope my colleagues will reject it, and I hope that all across the country, from one corner of America to every other, people will step up and they will say, as I have said on this floor: The political change doesn't start in Washington, DC, and then trickle down; it is bottom up. It is bottom up, as people come forward and say ``That is not the way to go'' and say ``Here is the way that really would make sense and make our lives better.''  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

89,topic-id,1572,"Madam President, I rise today to discuss the National Defense Authorization I want to begin by thanking Senators McCain and Reed, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services I commend their continued bipartisan leadership and collaboration on behalf of our servicemembers and our national security.  As someone who served in the U.Marine Corps and also served on the House Armed Services Committee, I understand the importance of Congress's fulfilling its constitutional duties to our men and women in uniform.  This legislation is important for our country. It is also important to my neighbors. That includes Hoosiers serving on Active Duty, in the Reserves, and in the Indiana National Guard, as well as their families. It also helps Hoosiers working at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, Crane Army Ammunition Activity, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service in Indianapolis to perform their important work, which is essential to our servicemembers.  Now, for the last 55 years, Congress has passed the Given the threats our country confronts, it is important that we once again pass this legislation and provide our troops with the training, weapons, and support they need to accomplish their missions and return home safely. But that is not enough.  Congress must pass Defense authorization and appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year, stop the habitual use of continuing resolutions for the Department of Defense, and end defense sequestration once and for all. I stand ready to work with Senators of both parties to achieve these objectives.  I am committed to doing my part, and that is why I voted to end debate on this legislation last week and why I will support further advancing the bill today, despite the fact that we weren't able to debate and vote on amendments here on the floor.  Today, I will only note that I have introduced a couple of bipartisan amendments related to Saudi Arabia's actions in These are amendment 585 and 1081. I believe this issue deserves consideration by the full Senate, and I look forward to speaking at length on this issue again in coming days.  I share the frustration of Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed regarding the lack of floor debate and substantive votes, and I hope the Senate can do better next year. I think each Senator, the Americans we represent, and the troops who protect us are right to expect better. Now, with that said, I applaud Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed for working to include over 100 noncontroversial amendments in this bill.  I am proud of the fact that the Defense bill we are going to vote on--and, hopefully, pass--this evening includes three amendments important to Hoosiers that I introduced and for which I worked with the committee to include. I would like to quickly mention two of them and then spend a little more time on the third.  The first provision is amendment 793. This provision would press the Department of Defense to implement Government Accountability Office recommendations or explain why they aren't doing so.  Now, let me explain why this is so important. Our Nation confronts challenges and threats of extraordinary scope. Yet the resources we have are limited. That means we need to ensure that the Department of Defense is operating as efficiently and as effectively as possible with the money the taxpayers provide. That is what our national security demands and what U.taxpayers are right to expect.  So when a respected organization such as the GAO, our Federal Government's auditor, conducts independent and rigorous analysis and identifies key areas for improvement within DOD, Congress and the Pentagon should take it seriously.  Here is the problem. As of this morning, there were 1,008 open GAO recommendations, including 75 priority recommendations that DOD alone has failed to address fully. Now, some of these priority recommendations relate to missile defense, ship maintenance, military readiness, servicemember healthcare, and financial management, and some of these open recommendations go back to 2009 and even earlier.  There may be a few of these recommendations in which DOD has a persuasive justification for not implementing GAO's recommendation, but I believe the burden of proof should be on DOD to either implement GAO's recommendations without delay or justify to Congress why they believe the recommendation should not be adopted. That is essentially what my provision would do.  I look forward to working with the leaders and staff of the Armed Services Committees to ensure that this important provision is included in the final legislation.  I would also like to highlight a second amendment, amendment 882, that I introduced and worked to include in the bill that we will soon vote to adopt. This provisions would require the Navy to conduct and provide to Congress a comprehensive review of U.maritime intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting capability, also known as  In light of growing Chinese and Russian maritime capabilities, this report would require the Navy, among other things, to identify specific capability gaps and specific areas of risk when it comes to ISRT, as well as offer solutions and resources that are needed to address those capability gaps and areas of risk. The review will help to ensure that the United States retains the naval supremacy necessary to keep vital shipping lanes open, deter aggression, and defend our national security interests.  Now, lastly, I would like to highlight amendment 821. I introduced it and worked with the committee to include this in the bill, and I want to thank Senator Donnelly for cosponsoring my amendment.  On January 27, the President issued a memorandum that emphasized the need for a ``modern, robust, flexible, resilient, ready, and appropriately tailored nuclear deterrent.'' This memorandum reiterated the longstanding and bipartisan consensus that deterring a nuclear attack on our country and on our allies depends on our ability to maintain a strong, nuclear deterrent.  Our nuclear deterrent includes three legs, also referred to as the nuclear triad, consisting of submarine-launched ballistic missiles, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, and long-range bomber aircraft. Now, each of these legs offers an important and complementary capability making clear to any potential aggressor that a nuclear attack on the United States would be suicidal and, thereby, deterring such an attack in the first place. Perhaps that is why Secretary of Defense Mattis, referring to the deterrence of potential aggressors, said just last week: ``If I wanted to send the most compelling message, I have been persuaded that the triad . . . is the right way to go.''  Now, the challenge is that, in just the next two decades, essentially all of our Nation's nuclear delivery systems and all of our nuclear weapons will need to be refurbished or replaced.  According to a February 17 study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, that could cost a total of $400 billion over the next decade. That is an enormous cost during a period when our Department of Defense has many other modernization bills coming due. Consequently, we must identify opportunities to minimize costs while not sacrificing capability.  So consistent with that fact, on January 31, Secretary Mattis issued a memorandum calling for an ``ambitious reform agenda, which will include a horizontal integration across DOD components to improve efficiency and take advantage of economies of scale.''  Consistent with that memorandum and the memorandum of the President, my amendment would require the Office of the Secretary of Defense, working with our Navy and Air Force, to[[Page S5782]]submit a report to Congress on the potential to achieve more value; that is, enhanced nuclear deterrence at a lower cost by integrating elements of acquisition programs related to modernization and sustainment of the nuclear triad.  If we can improve efficiency and program management, cost, and schedule by increasing integration, colocation, and commonality between the strategic deterrent programs of the Navy and the Air Force and their associated systems, technologies, and engineering processes, then we should do so.  Back home in Indiana, the skilled workers at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane have supported the Navy Strategic Systems Program for more than 60 years. Crane is the largest DOD supplier to the Strategic Systems Crane provides the Navy's only organic high-reliability, radiation-hardening capability. Crane also serves as a leader in trusted microelectronics. What is less well known is that Crane provides important support to the Air Force's ICBM Ground Based Strategic Deterrent More importantly, there is good reason to believe that Crane can dramatically increase its level of support to the Air Force's strategic programs.  That is the kind of joint collaboration between the Air Force and the Navy my amendment envisions. By breaking down stovepipe barriers between our military services, by eliminating unnecessary duplication, and by looking for commonsense opportunities for joint cooperation, we can keep our country safe and save money in the process. That is not only a win for Crane, it is a win for the Navy, it is a win for the Air Force, it is a win for taxpayers, and it is a win for the safety and security of every  That is why I look forward to working with the leadership and staff of the Armed Services Committee to include this amendment in the final bill.  I thank Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed for their work and tireless leadership on the Senate Armed Services Committee and for your work to bring the National Defense Authorization Act to this point.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-09-18-pt1-PgS5776-4.txt,1256,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,18.0,September
