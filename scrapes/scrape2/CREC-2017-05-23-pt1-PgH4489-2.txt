                   PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUDGET PROPOSAL

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, budgets are about values. And President 
Trump's budget breaks his promises to the American people. His 2018 
budget is a disgrace.
  The plan cuts people's access to basic necessities and retards decent 
standards of living. The American people want to create jobs, raise 
wages, invest in education, protect their pensions, and give people a 
chance at a better future.
  What does the Trump budget do for the heartland that voted for him? 
Great Lakes clean up? Zeroed out. Social Security Disability insurance? 
Slashed. Medicaid? Slashed. Public education? Slashed.
  We have seen this supply side economic shell game before. It ends 
with a massive tax cut for millionaires and billionaires, while leaving 
Americans living on the brink paycheck to paycheck, leaving them 
behind.
  Let's recap. The Trump budget hurts working families, it weakens 
Social Security and Medicaid, it hurts students seeking to better 
themselves, it hurts seniors trying to pay for their medicine and 
insurance and who depend on programs like Meals on Wheels.
  I would encourage every heartland family with an elderly parent, an 
indebted graduate, or a trusting toddler to look at this budget and 
match it against the promises they heard versus what is being 
delivered. What a shame for our country.
