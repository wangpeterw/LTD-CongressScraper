                      ALZHEIMER'S AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer's Awareness Month. 
Alzheimer's is a progressive disease that leads to memory loss and 
other challenges in brain and physical function. Ultimately, it is 
fatal.
  More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, including 
over 220,000 residents of Illinois. Every 66 seconds, another American 
is diagnosed with this disease, and the rate of new cases are 
increasing. It has become our Nation's sixth leading cause of death.
  Last year, Congress and the White House worked in a bipartisan manner 
to enact the 21st Century Cures Act. The legislation transforms our 
health research system to speed up the fight against Alzheimer's and 
other diseases, but that is just the start. Let's keep working together 
to end this devastating disease.
