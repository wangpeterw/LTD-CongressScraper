                         CELEBRATING GOD'S WORD

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support 76 years of celebrating 
God's Word during National Bible Week. No other book has sold more 
copies or changed more lives than the Bible.
  Abraham Lincoln said: ``In regard for this great book, I have this to 
say, `It is the best gift God has given to man. All that the good 
Savior gave to the world was communicated through this book.' ''
  May we always remember the impact the Bible has had on this country 
and on our democracy. May we govern according to its timeless precepts 
and principles, and may God bless these United States of America.
