                        REMEMBERING DON DUNWELL

 Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life 
of Don Dunwell--journalist, husband, father, and community leader.
  Don was known for his thoughtful interview style, creative 
storytelling, and ability to connect with the thousands of viewers who 
entrusted him to deliver the news.
  It was common to find Don teaching and mentoring young reporters 
about the ins and outs of journalism.
  He believed fiercely in the free press and the strong ethics that 
were required to be a trusted source of information.
  He never took his platform for granted and used it to make Montana 
and this Nation a better place.

  Outside the newsroom, he was a proud father to John, working hard 
each day to ensure that his son had every opportunity possible.
  Don was immensely proud of his wife, Mary Ann, who charted her own 
path as a public servant.
  Today we remember the life and legacy of Mr. Dunwell and aim to 
follow in his ever fervent footsteps.
