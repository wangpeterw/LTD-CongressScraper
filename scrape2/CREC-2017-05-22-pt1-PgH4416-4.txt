    CONGRATULATIONS TO COREY BULMAN AS MINNESOTA TEACHER OF THE YEAR

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate Corey Bulman, an 
English and literature teacher at Mound Westonka High School, on being 
named Minnesota's Teacher of the Year. This is an extraordinary 
achievement and a tribute to his enthusiasm both inside and outside of 
the classroom.
  Mr. Bulman began teaching at Mound Westonka 17 years ago, where he 
devoted his entire tenure as an educator to enriching students in the 
classroom through his creative, imaginative, and insightful 
curriculums. What sets him apart is the meaningful and empowering 
connections he develops with his students.
  As one of his former students said: ``Corey was an adult, who showed 
me he believed I was smart, and cared about my ideas. He was honest, 
funny, and made me believe in myself.''
  Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that Mr. Bulman has touched so many 
of his students' lives. He understands how forming these bonds can 
inspire students for future success.
  Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate Corey and thank him for 
dedicating himself on educating, inspiring, and empowering our young 
students.
