                           GORSUCH NOMINATION

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, Judge Neil Gorsuch's lifelong 
appointment to the Supreme Court would have serious consequences for 
all Americans, but especially the health and well-being of African-
American women.
  In 2013, by ruling that corporations have the right to deny access to 
contraceptives on employer-sponsored health insurance plans, Judge 
Gorsuch proved that he believes the reproductive decisions of women 
nationwide can and should impact their livelihood. This is problematic 
and troubling.
  For Black women and so many women across the world, birth control is 
a matter of health and life. We rely on contraception to treat 
endometriosis, manage uterine fibroids, unplanned pregnancies, and 
quell PMS symptoms.
  In 2013, Judge Neil Gorsuch made the decision that his overarching 
commitment to religious freedom as a constitutional and statutory right 
is more important than lifesaving reproductive care.
  In 2013, he proved he should not be confirmed to the United States 
Supreme Court. For this reason and a host of others, I implore my 
colleagues in the Senate to take all available steps to oppose Judge 
Gorsuch's nomination.
