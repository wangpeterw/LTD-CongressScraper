                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving and gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  We ask today that You bless the Members of this assembly to be the 
best and most faithful servants of the people they serve.Purify their 
intentions, that they will say what they believe and act consistent 
with their words.
  Help them to be honest with themselves so that they will be concerned 
not only with how their words and deeds are weighed byothers, but also 
with how their words and deeds affect the lives of those in need and 
those who look to them for support, help,strength, and leadership.
  May all that is done this day in the people's House be for Your 
greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
