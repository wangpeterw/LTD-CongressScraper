13824,topic-id,2730,"Mr.Speaker, I am here to talk for a few minutes about the FAA reauthorization act, better known as the AIRR  Now, this particular bill has two components: modernization and privatization. President Trump, being a great businessman, the very astute businessman that he is, has told us that we need to modernize our airspace, our air traffic control facilities, everything that allows us to continue to have the safest and busiest airspace, literally, in the world, and I agree wholeheartedly with our great President that we do need to modernize. The issue that I have is with the privatization part.  As mentioned, our airspace is the busiest it has ever been. On a daily basis, somewhere between 87,000 and 88,000 flights take place in the airspace of the United States of  We have been asked to compare our air traffic control system with that of our great neighbor to the north, Canada, but the issue with that, Mr.Speaker, is that Canada only has a small, small fraction of the air traffic that we have here in the great United  The U.airspace is unique because it is a public resource that is accessible to all users, and it is protected by the fact that the air traffic organization, under the FAA, is directly accountable to Congress, but more importantly, to the American people.  Handing over that control of air traffic services to a private corporation, as this AIRR Act wants to do, will put the interests that right now are under the tutelage of air traffic control to a board of directors that may not have the interests of the American taxpayer and the consumer as its foremost priority.  Under the plan that is in the AIRR Act, this corporation will not be answerable to The only thing they will have to do is to provide reports on its operations every now and then. Under this plan, Congress has ceded its oversight over a major component of interstate commerce and, might I add--very important--national defense.  There is also very little oversight from our executive branch, the Decisions by the corporation to change safety standards or to reduce air traffic services will be subject to minimal scrutiny from the Department of Also, as stated, the President will have limited authority to take command of the airspace unless there is a declaration of war.  On the cost and the funding uncertainties, I have an issue with this AIRR The CBO predicts that this plan will cost the Federal Government--which, by the way, is us, taxpayers--$21 billion over the 10-year budget window, but this doesn't take into account any other factors that will probably exceed that cost by many, many billions, and that is with a The administration's fiscal 2018 budget paints a fuller picture of the costs, and it estimates a $46 billion cost over the same 10-year period.  Mr.Speaker, we have got enough budget problems without adding more gasoline to the fire.  The problem is that this revenue is critical for filling the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which pays for popular programs like the Airport Improvement Program that communities all across the country rely on for their airport improvements, to pay for infrastructure upgrades, runway overlays, lighting, taxiways, those types of things that are essential for an airport to work.  The FAA bill before us authorizes more funding for the Airport Improvement Fund program, which is great, but it is still uncertain where these funds will come from. What makes up for the shortfall? I don't see it in this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I represent a great swath of the great State of Louisiana, good, good people, a lot of them in a rural community that are far away from any major metropolitan areas. My concern with this AIRR Act is that a private corporation concerned with raising money from user fees will be heavily incentivized to go to where the users are: the East Coast and the West  My question and my very much concern is: What happens to all of us in between that East Coast and West Coast? I worry that we will be left out of the mix and be left out of the equation because we will not be as able to contribute to user fees because of the population.  Decisions to change air traffic services can too easily be justified by this corporation, this private corporation that is talked about in this AIRR Act, and will face minimal scrutiny from the Department of  A reduction in air traffic control services means a reduction in enplanements and a reduction in revenue at small, regional airports, just as I alluded to, and this makes it even harder to access the funding from the Airport Improvement  All of these factors taken together will exacerbate the problem with access to air travel for 95-plus percent of the people in America, and this is hard for rural areas. They have a hard enough time making ends meet. They don't need the extra costs and the extra burden of traveling to a large city, maybe spending the night at a hotel to catch an early flight, the cost of transportation just so they can catch a flight to some other part of the United  The taxpayer seems to be on the hook here, too, under this AIRR Under the plan, the Federal Government would simply hand over all the air traffic control assets to the private corporation free of charge, and this will negate decades and hundreds of billions--again, that is with a B--of dollars in taxpayer investments that the corporation will be able to dispose of and sell as it sees fit.  The plan will also create a potential multibillion-dollar unfunded liability for the Departmen of Defense to upgrade its systems to be interoperable with the new ATC corporation. What if the private corporation has one set of systems, our Department of Defense doesn't have that, but they have got to be talking to each other? This is a national security issue.  And again, who pays for that? Well, again, the taxpayers would certainly be on the hook to bring the Department of Defense up to speed. Again, this is something that we need to look very, very closely at in this bill.  The board of the corporation is not restricted in how much debt it can take on, and this sets up a very dangerous potential for a taxpayer bailout that, although this bill says it won't happen, I again question because these are the same types of promises that we got with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,[[Page H5918]]and we know what happened then and how much the taxpayer had to dole out to bail them out.  I have alluded to the safety and national security issue, and I want to hit that a little bit harder.  Under the plan, the oversight from the air traffic safety organization--it is called ATSOS, Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service--sunsets after 2 years. My question with this AIRR Act is: What happens after the 2-year window? Who watches the gate?  And I do worry about that.  What happens if there are major safety breaches? And certainly we don't want any accidents, but what happens if there is a major accident after 2 years?  When it comes to the operation of our skies--safety, safety, safety. It trumps everything because we have lives at risk every day.  I go back to my opening remarks. We have the safest system, airspace in the world, and I am concerned that this safety could be jeopardized if our airspace is controlled by a private entity that is primarily motivated by raising revenue.  Control of our airspace is a critical function of national security. As Federal agencies, the FAA and the Department of Defense currently share airspace, training systems, assets, equipment, and information. Divorcing ATC, air traffic control, functions from the Federal Government and inserting an unaccountable third-party private contractor into the coordination of our airspace will make us more vulnerable to attack.  The private ATC corporation that the AIRR Act is touting will have access to highly sensitive information regarding strategic operations in our airspace without the same standards of protection that are required of Federal agencies, so I worry about leaks, those types of issues.  There is also a labor issue that, really, nobody is looking at, I am afraid, in this AIRR I know many air traffic controllers personally. I fly in the United States airspace personally a lot. These are good, dedicated people, and I admire the work that they do every day to safely operate our skies; however, the major labor unions successfully negotiated to get every carve-out they wanted under this plan.  Mr.Speaker, I am a small government guy. I am the guy that stands up on the curb and says we need less government. There are limited areas where I personally believe government, our Federal Government, should be involved, but those are national defense, national security, major infrastructure projects like interstates, maintenance of large river systems, and aerospace and airspace. Everything else, let's let the States and the local governments handle it. I think they can do a better job.  But in this case, in our national airspace where we have both civilian and military operating, again, tens of thousands of times a day, then we need to take a step back and look at our safety record. It has been impeccable for the last several years, and these air traffic controllers are doing a phenomenal job.  My concern, again, is that this private corporation that is in this AIRR Act that we will be asked to vote on will be required to hire all Federal air traffic organization employees, but they will continue to contribute to their Federal benefits and healthcare and continue to collectively bargain with their union representatives.  So, for me, trying to argue that this model of ``privatization''--and I will use that in quotation marks--will increase efficiency and keep operational costs down, these labor provisions that we are giving them in this bill are not a very good ringing endorsement. So if we are going to talk privatization, let's not have a hybrid here. We need to keep it the way it is.  The airspace in America, no one can compare the size, the traffic, the complexity. It is just a phenomenal work of art that happens every day and, again, in a very safe manner. Try to compare us in America with any other system, whether it be the United Kingdom, whether it be It is like comparing apples to oranges. Again, our volume is so massive compared to any other country that you really can't compare them at all.  I want to give you an example. I wrote this down so I would get it right.  It says, in 2016, the FAA handled over 16 million flights in the U.S.--16 million, think about that--while NAV CANADA, which is the private corporation that handles Canada's airspace, only handled 5 million, 5.5 million, in the same year.                              {time}  2115  It is impossible to say whether a system similar to Canada's could be adopted in the United Mr.Speaker, I have flown in Canadian airspace. I have lost radar contact; I have lost communications; and that is, again, not any shun on They are a vast, large country with large swaths that are uncovered with radar, I am sure. But again, when I am up there talking to them, the times I have been up there, there may be only one other aircraft in the system or in that area with me.  Back in the United States, I have been in many situations in large areas like Dallas, Houston, or Chicago where it is so busy that you have to wait to get a word in edgewise. But when you do, you get very succinct instruction. You get vectored properly the right way, and you get separation of the small guys like myself from the large guys like the big airline carriers. Again, this routine happens thousands and thousands of times a day, and it happens without incident or accident.  So again, we have got a system that is working. Again, I am all for modernization. We need new equipment. We need better equipment for our airports and for our air traffic controllers. Again, if it makes the system work more efficiently, I am all for that. But again, why take the air traffic controllers that have done such a great job for so many years out of the loop.  Modernization should be a goal of any system, and it doesn't just mean our airspace. Anything we can do in government to make it better and more efficient, I am all for it. Again, I am your less government guy. But in this instance, privatization of air traffic controllers is not the answer, especially when it means handing over the control of our airspace, the taxpayers' airspace, to a private board unaccountable to the Federal  And I don't know, Mr.Speaker, but history tells me that they may come running back to Congress for a bailout when times get tough. I hope that doesn't happen if this bill should pass. Again, I am opposed to the bill. But we know it has happened so many times in the past when we have allowed situations like this to develop.  Can the Federal Government do a better job in implementing NextGen technology? NextGen technology is the next generation. Again, we live in a phenomenal world of technology. I am living proof of a pilot that used to fly with what we called steam gauges, where we had to look at things much differently. Now I fly in a cockpit that is completely digital. I am in awe of what I am flying in my little airplane as compared to what I was flying in just a few years ago. But we want that technology to be handled in the proper way. The FAA management issue can be fixed by this  Again, I go back. We have invested billions of dollars in this next generation technology. I simply don't want to take that pile of money and that technology and hand it to this private corporation and say: ``Here, guys, it is yours now.''  This is not what we are paid to do up here in We are paid to watch the taxpayers' money. Hopefully, part of our job is to watch where this money goes and to make sure it is spent wisely.  The uncertainty and the lost time of transferring this air traffic control to a private board will only cause delays. Again, I go back to what we have done in the past with other entities where we have tried to move from a Federal or a government agency to a private agency or vice versa. The transition time is usually lengthy. It is usually inefficient, and mistakes are made.  Here, Mr.Speaker, we are not talking just about civilian travel. We are talking about our Department of Defense, so it becomes a safety issue and a national security issue.  Modernization and privatization are not synonymous. They are actually two diverse courses that really have no business in the same bill. We should continue to take steps to provide adequate funding for the FAA and remove[[Page H5919]]barriers for modernization while maintaining U.airspace as the safest and most accessible in the world.  Again, Mr.Speaker, I want to commend everyone who has worked on this bill. There have been, I am sure, countless hours. There are some good things in this bill that we need to do. I have addressed the modernization issue. But again, it is the privatization of our air traffic control that gives me pause and that gives me great concern on some of the issues that I have mentioned here in this short period of time.  So I want to take a step back from this AIRR I want to work with my colleagues, see what we can do to get it right and keep our skies safe. Once again I will say: I am the guy that wants less government. This is one of the few areas where government has done a good job, will continue to do a good job, and of those 87,000 flights a day, keep them safe.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-17-pt1-PgH5917.txt,2244,"REMEMBERING DAVID COLEMAN, JR.",2017.0,17.0,July

13880,topic-id,1071,"Mr.President, the House of Representatives has just passed a bill that would make major changes in the Affordable Care Act by a vote of 217 to 213. I congratulate the The Senate will carefully review the House bill, and we will go to work on a Senate bill.  Here are my goals for a Senate bill. I don't pretend to speak for every Member of the Senate or even every Republican, but these are my goals for a bill we will fashion here.  1, rescue the thousands of Tennesseans and millions of Americans who, under the Affordable Care Act, will be trapped in ObamaCare exchanges with few or zero options for health insurance in the year 2018 unless Congress acts.  My second goal is to lower premium costs. Premium costs have increased and, in some States, are going through the roof under the Affordable Care  3, gradually transfer to the states more flexibility in administering the Medicaid program and do that in such a way as to not pull the rug out from under those who rely on the Medicaid program.  4, make sure those who have preexisting health conditions have access to health insurance. This is one thing in the Affordable Care Act that has strong support from just about everybody, including the President, that if you have a preexisting condition, you must have access to healthcare. We need to make sure that is still true in any bill we create in the  There is some urgency here because of what is happening in the individual market. When we say ``individual market,'' here is what we are talking about. Most Americans get their insurance either from the government or on the job. About 18 percent of Americans get their insurance through We are not talking about Medicare today. The bill in the House or the bill we will create in the Senate does not affect  About 60 percent of Americans get their insurance on the job and about 20 percent or so through Medicaid, and that leaves about 6 percent who go into an Obamacare market to buy it. Many of these Americans buy their insurance on marketplaces or exchanges created by the Affordable Care We call those the ObamaCare exchanges. About 85 percent of those who buy their insurance on the exchanges have a government subsidy to help them buy the insurance.  As every day goes by, we hear and we are going to continue to hear about insurance companies pulling out of counties and Yesterday we heard that the only insurer left in Iowa is now likely to leave. That means more than 70,000 people on the exchanges will have no insurance to buy. Most of them will have subsidies from the government. So it is like thousands of people in Iowa have bus tickets in a town where no buses run.  That is what is happening right now because of the 2010 law that we call the Affordable Care I know this all too well because 34,000 people in Knoxville, TN, my home area, are going to have subsidies in 2018 but no insurance to buy with their subsidies unless Congress acts. That is because of the 2010 law that we seek to change. In 2016, last year, 7 percent of counties in the United States had just one insurer offering plans on their Affordable Care Act exchanges. This year, 2017, that number jumped to 32 percent. In one in three counties in the United States, if you have a subsidy to buy insurance on the ObamaCare exchange, you had only one insurance company offering you insurance. Five entire States have only one insurer offering ACA plans in their entire State this year: Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and That is because of the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010.  Unfortunately, every day we are going to be hearing not just about insurers leaving counties and States, but about the ones that remain because they are going to be charging sky-high premiums.  Premiums went up by as much as 62 percent this year in Tennessee and by 116 percent in As the new rate increases are proposed to the States over the next few weeks and months, our constituents are going to be saying: What are you going to do about that? So there is an urgency, but we want to get it right.  So, again, here are my goals for the Senate bill we will write in the next few weeks:  1, rescue--and ``rescue'' is not too strong a word--the millions of Americans across this country who are going to have few or zero insurance options in the year 2018 because of collapsing ObamaCare exchanges, unless Congress acts.  2, lower premium rates because, in many States, premiums are going through the roof under the Affordable Care  3, gradually transfer to States more flexibility in managing their Medicaid programs. About 18 percent of Americans get their insurance on We will do so in a way that does not pull the rug out from under those who are currently served by  Finally, preexisting conditions--make sure Americans who have insurance for preexisting conditions continue to have access to it. If you are on Medicaid or if you are on Medicare or, in almost every case, if you get insurance on the job, you have insurance for preexisting conditions. Under the Affordable Care Act in 2010, there had to be insurance for people with preexisting conditions. We want to make sure that those Americans continue to have access if they have a preexisting condition.  We will move ahead with deliberate speed. We are doing that because the exchanges are collapsing, people could be without insurance, and premiums will go up if we don't act, but we want to get it right. There will be no artificial deadlines. We will carefully consider the legislation passed by the We will work together carefully to write our own bill. We will make sure we know what our bill costs when we vote on it. In fact, by law, we have to do that. We will get it right, and then we will vote. And hopefully, Mr.President, the end result will be significant improvements for most Americans, giving them more choices of health insurance at a lower cost, and do that by gradually transferring more decisions from Washington, DC, to the states and to individuals.

13786,topic-id,1938,"Madam President, it has been nearly 7 months since President Trump took office. He was sworn in on the steps of the Capitol on January 20.  Our colleagues across the aisle have had, frankly, more than enough time to come to terms with the election results. Unfortunately, they seem to be channeling their disappointment through the confirmation process by engaging in an unprecedented level of obstruction.  We spent all this week when the Senate could do no other business on the executive calendar than to confirm three nominees--three nominees of about 500 that need to be appointed by the They are there only because the President would want them there. They come and go as Presidents come and go. Many of them have gone. The problem is that their replacements haven't been there.  If there is any doubt as to just how unprecedented this drawn-out confirmation process has been, let's look at how it stacks up against the previous administration. We are only a couple of weeks away from August, and Senate Democrats have only allowed us to confirm 52 of President Trump's 216 nominees. That is 24 percent. By the August recess of President Obama's first term, the Senate had confirmed 313 of his 454 nominations, or 69 percent.  So we start out with an incredibly slow start, where previous administrations--both the Bush administration and the Obama administration--by the end of the first week, or often by the end of the first day, had most of their Cabinet confirmed.  Getting a Cabinet confirmed is a process that took every minute of time that the Senate rules could possibly be stretched to allow.  Then, we look at nominations. The President, as I said, has nominated 216 people. Less than one out of four of them have been confirmed. In President Obama's term, even though he had more nominees by this time, he had a lot more confirmations. The Senate confirmed 69 percent of the Obama nominees.  There are currently more than 150 nominations waiting for confirmation, many of them are already out of committee. They are ready to come to the floor, but Senate Democrats have caused this backlog by using every procedural tactic to needlessly delay nominees. But, when they delay the nominees, they also delay our ability to get to the other work.  So there are two questions here. Are you going to let the President take over the government, which the Constitution and the Senate have been an active part of? Are you going to get the other work done? If you don't let the President take over the government, how do you effectively get the other work done? It is really a plan that works really well if what you want to do is slow down any changes of where the government was on January 20.  A Wall Street Journal editorial earlier this week said:       Democratic obstruction against nominees is nearly total,      most notably including a demand for cloture filings for every      nominee--no matter how minor the position. This[[Page S3983]]     means a two-day waiting period, and then another 30 hours of      debate. The 30-hour rule means Mr.Trump might not be able to      fill all of those 400 positions in four years.  In fact, at the rate we are going, it will take more than 11 years to fill all the jobs that the President is supposed to be able to fill. I guess that would put us in the third term of the Trump Presidency before he ever got every job filled the first time, which the President is expected to fill under the laws that have been there, most of them for a long time.  The Wall Street Journal editorial talks about these difficult terms, like cloture. What does that mean? That means that you have to get a vote to move forward with the nomination--normally, not done where nominations are concerned.  There is a rule that allows you to have vigorous debate on any nominee who really is a problem, but that rule has clearly been abused. Now the cloture vote only takes 51 votes. This is no odd Senate majority or anything like that. A majority of the Senators can vote to move forward with the nominee. But then, if you will not consent to waive any of the other rules, you have to wait 2 days before you can get to that. You can't do anything else during those 2 days. Then you have to have 30 hours of debate.  That has happened over and over. As a matter of fact, this happened 30 times. That sounded like about 5 days to me, certainly 3\1/2\ days. That whole process has happened 30 times, only to have many of these nominees get 90 or more votes, to have no debate on the floor about the nominee for whom you are supposed to be insisting on 30 hours of debate and to come to the floor and talk about whatever else you want to talk about. But if you go back and view the tape on whatever has happened during these confirmations, you will find very little discussion of the 30 times that 30 hours of debate was supposedly required before we could get to a final vote. Then, often, in the final vote, in a bipartisan effort to find nominees who are willing to serve, they get more than 90 votes. That just has never happened before.  By the first August recess in his administration, President Obama only had eight cloture votes. So what has happened here 30 times under President Trump happened 8 times under President Three percent of the nominees confirmed under President Obama had a cloture vote between swearing in and August, but 60 percent of the nominees from President Trump have had a cloture vote, but about the same amount of real debate. If we look back at what happened in 2009, the hours of actual debate on nominees were about the same, but the use of the maximum abuse of the rules is different.  Let me say this. The rules of the Senate were designed to protect the minority, and that is a good thing. This is a unique body in a democratic country, where the minority has been traditionally protected, and that protection lasts until the minority begins to abuse it. There will be a point here pretty quickly where I think Senators are going to have to wonder if this rule is any longer a rule that should be sustained.  We cannot continue to do what we are doing. We don't have 11 years and 4 months to confirm the Trump nominees. Nobody would want the President to have--well, maybe not anybody--an 11-year and 4-month term. But our friends on the other side are acting like that is how long he has to get just this rudimentary part of this job done that largely should have been done in the first 6 months.  Only 10 percent of the President's nominees' confirmations have been done by a voice vote. That is another alternative--just bring the nominee, nobody objects to waiving the rules, and you have a voice vote.  Ten percent of President Trump's confirmations have been done by voice vote while more than 90 percent of President Obama's confirmations were done by a voice vote. So we have the same percentages there, just totally turned around--10 percent for Trump and 90 percent for President The contrast is striking. It is not just simply math. It is, again, about the key positions of government that aren't filled.  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I hear all the time that our country faces more threats from more directions than at any time in our history. But we have only been allowed by this strung-out process, insisted on by Senate Democrats, to confirm 6 of the President's 22 nominees for the Department of The Department of Defense has 22 nominees already made, and only 6 of them are over there doing the jobs, of which the President says: Here are the 22 people I would like to have, and there will be more names to follow.  The positions that haven't been confirmed are the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the next job in the Defense Department and the principal deputy under the Secretary of Defense; and the Assistant Secretary of  I don't know about everybody else. I was a little confused by how long these titles are. But if you look at what each of these people do, these are critical to the mission of defending the country and they haven't been filled. These are positions that need to be filled.  The President continues to work to improve the safety of our communities and enforce our Nation's laws. We have seen obstruction when it comes to the Justice Department and the 19 people who have been willing to serve--all of whom I think are out of committee or about to be out of committee.  If one of them is out of committee, that would be enough. But the President has nominated 19 people to fill these vacancies, and only 3 nominees have been confirmed. Two of the nominees who have been reported out of the committee received votes of 20 to 0 and 19 to 1. We would think that is somebody who could come to the floor with a likely voice vote.  My bet is that when they do get voted on, 98 Senators will vote for them. But if we continue to do what we are doing now, only 2 days after a cloture vote, 2 days after the vote, and then almost a day and a half of debate after that, it is a disservice to the people that elected us to do these jobs and even a greater disservice to the people who elected the President to do his job.  Once again, these are key positions in Justice--the Solicitor General of the United States, the principal person who argues in court for the United States of America--and it is the middle of  My colleagues from across the aisle have clearly decided that it is in their best political interests to stand in the way of the President's nominees, but, maybe, more importantly, to stand in the way of the Senate's ability to get its job done.  When I talked to Missourians, they want to know what we are doing and why we can't get the work done that they sent us here to do. They also want to know why we can't let the President do the job he was sent here to do.  We need to be working on the failures of the current healthcare system, how we make college more affordable, and what we can do to improve our infrastructure. Those are things we need to get to, and we need to allow the President to put his government in place for that to happen.  He was sworn in 7 months ago. He has every right to put the government in place. It is time for our friends across the aisle to stop grandstanding, to stop standing in the way. It is time to stop debating the Presidential election, and it is time to start debating the issues of how to run the government and to let the President put his people in those jobs so that process can begin.  Mr.President, I see my friend from Wisconsin is here. I will conclude my remarks.

For 27 years, Claire's column chronicled the happenings of Seaside with cogent prose and an observant eye.  First known as ``Overheard: Notes from Seaside,'' and later ``Scene and Heard,'' her column was the first thing readers went to when they eagerly opened their newspapers. Indeed, some readers bought the newspaper just for her column.  Claire was a Seaside resident for almost all of her 96 years, and no one was better qualified to document the city's life. Whether she was sharing her observations on politics, popular culture, growing older, or the birth of her first great-grandchild, Claire enriched each topic with her signature verve and keen love of the written word.  In a recent column, Claire wrote: Whether one is 5-years old or 95, as the case may be, life's small pleasures are very important.[[Page H2946]]  For decades, one of Seaside's small pleasures was reading her column. It is my honor to recognize Claire Lovell's many contributions to our community and to offer my condolences to her family and the Seaside community on the loss of this remarkable woman.

13986,topic-id,2666,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Eagle Scout Chairman Pete Sessions for his great introduction. It is an absolute honor to be here.  About a week ago, I said I would like to get the Eagle Scouts together on the floor of the House of Representatives and talk about what it means to us to be Eagle Scouts, reflect on our history and our tradition and how great this institution has been for the United States of America for all of these years and how we must make sure that this institution stays strong for the years to come. When I brought that to the gentleman's attention, he said, absolutely, we will do it. I didn't talk to him again, and today we are doing it. I didn't have to ask twice.  As chairman of the Scouting Caucus here in the House of Representatives, the gentleman has led in a tremendous way. We have seen so many Eagle Scouts come to the Capitol, and he always gets all of us together and always has us talk face-to-face with the Scouts--not just Eagle Scouts--and encourage them from the earliest days of their Scouting careers.  I want to thank him for his leadership, because a lot of people could chair this committee, but he hasn't just chaired it; he has led it, and that reflects greatly on him.  When I think about my days as a Scout, I go all the way back to my Cub Scout days. In fact, it was even before I was a My brother was a year older than me, so he got to be a Cub Scout before I was a Cub  He got to participate in this new thing that was going on in the lives of the Bridenstines called the pinewood derby. He had this little car--a block of wood with some nails and some wheels--and we watched that car streak from the very top of the track and come to a screeching halt where the track leveled out. In fact, this little blue car didn't even make it to the end of the track.  Of course, all of these other Scouts had all their fancy cars that had their rounded wheels and graphite on the nails and all of the weights put in the car. We didn't know to do any of that.  So my brother, John Bridenstine, who was a Cub Scout before I was a Cub Scout, had to endure the pain of being a Scout and wanting to have the fastest car, and his didn't even make it to the end of the track.  Well, I will tell you this. There was a Life Scout named Wayne Bridenstine, who was our dad. He was not going to allow any of our cars to ever again not make it to the end of the track. So we went to work trying to learn everything we could about this pinewood derby.  We engineered a couple of what I think are the greatest cars in American Scouting history. The next year, the Bridenstine boys won first place and second place going forward. We won first place and second place in--I don't remember which--but we reversed it going backwards. So we went from having a car that didn't even reach the end of the track to winning the pinewood derby.  Many years later, now I have my own son. He is in Cub Scouts and he does the pinewood derby. I committed to him the same thing my dad committed to us back in those days: We are going to win the pinewood derby.  The first year we did it, we had great success. The second year, Dad got a little, maybe, overaggressive in his engineering. Maybe we put the weights a little too far back. As that car came down, it got really unstable and it wobbled. There were a couple of times it barely made it to the end of the track.  But I will tell you this. The relationship that I had with my dad and that my brother had with our dad and that was necessary to pull us from not even finishing the race to winning the race and now the relationship with my son, Walker Bridenstine, are things that are important in our family and will be for many years to come.  So those are some of my first ideas.  Of course, Cub Scouts led to the Arrow of The very next progression is to become a Boy So we searched a number of different troops across Arlington, Texas, and Fort Worth, We were in the Longhorn Council at the time. We eventually settled on Troop 83.  I remember some of the leaders of the troop. Coach Wasden was a football coach at Hutcheson Junior That was somebody who was intense. He was serious about Boy, if you were going to move up in rank, you were going to prove to him that you have done what was required.  Of course, earning merit badges was important to all of us who were trying to move up the ranks. I will never forget the first summer camp that we went on. My brother and I were not able to go to the summer camp that our troop went on. So we went to this thing called the Maverick Camp, where we went with a bunch of Scouts we didn't even know, but we had a great time.  I am not going to lie to you; it was a challenge. I was in fifth grade. My brother was in sixth grade. It was the middle of August in We will just say the middle of August in It was just as hot at midnight as it was at the noon hour.[[Page H4494]]  We sweat a lot. We worked hard. We got seven merit badges that summer. That was intense. We didn't know you weren't supposed to get that many. We showed up back at our troop for the court of honor and people were shocked that we got seven. No wonder it was so hard. Nobody told us not to get seven merit badges in one summer camp.  These are some of the memories I had. My brother and I were really challenged and we got that done. The next summer, we did three or four merit badges and had a lot more fun. These are some of the memories.  I was the chaplain's aid. As the chaplain's aid, one of the things that I prayed for most was that the chaplain would show up on the campout so I wouldn't have to do the public speaking in front of everybody. And here I am now as a Member of Congress who publicly speaks as a living. That is one of the things the Boy Scouts of America gave me: the ability to stand before an audience and tell people what was on my mind.  My leadership experience was as the chaplain's aid. My brother was the senior patrol leader for Troop 83. I was in the Arrow of Light patrol. He was in the Bison He was the senior patrol leader.  Summer camp after summer camp and all the things we heard, here is, I think, one of the important things that people need to remember: The Boy Scouts of America is an institution that trains leaders. You might not recognize it when you are in it because you believe you are just having fun, but then there come those moments in life when you really need to lean on the things that you learned as a Boy Scout, and it doesn't even dawn on you until later that you actually learned these things as a Boy  After I graduated from college, I joined the United States I became a pilot. Of course, one of the things we have to do is survival, evasion, resistance, and escape. In this process, we have to live in the woods for a period of time. We have to figure out how we are going to survive and evade for a week. During this time, you have to live based on the things that you see around you. You have to be able to start a fire.  Some of these basic things I was able to do that all the peers around me had no ability to do because they did not have the life experiences in the Boy Scouts of  We had to be able to cook a rabbit, something that I had done before and something that my peers, also Navy pilots, had not done. We had to able to land navigate with a map and a compass, which, to me, was second nature because I had done it for years trying to get to my rank of But for so many people, it was a foreign concept to use a map and a compass to land navigate from point A to point  I remember one group navigated point to point. Our group said: We don't want to go point to point because if we miss the point, we won't know we missed the point. So we are going to intentionally offset, hit the river, and then we are going to know exactly where we are. Of course, we didn't miss the point. We knew where we were going.  But some of my peers who did not have the experiences I had went well beyond the point and didn't know they had gone down the point, then they had to come back. I could have told you that was going to happen because it had happened to me previously as somebody who was in the Boy Scouts of  These are very real-life experiences that you look back on and say: Why was I able to do this? I was able to do it because I was in the Boy Scouts of  You also look back and say there are things that are intangible, things that are not specific. I heard Eagle Scout Jeb Hensarling today--chairman, Congressman, Eagle Scout--talk about tying a bowline in one hand and how he doesn't anticipate finding himself at the bottom of a cliff with a broken arm, but if he did, he would be able to tie a one-handed bowline and somebody would be able to pull him out. Certainly, that is exactly the same kind of thing that I learned when I was going through the same program.  Just a couple of weeks ago, Walker Bridenstine, my son, had to learn how to tie a bowline. I was trying to teach him how to tie a bowline the old-fashioned way. I simply couldn't do it. When I tried to tie it as a one-handed bowline, I was able to do it. It just stuck with me all of these years.  So, again, these are specific skills. But the leadership, the ability to lead people are things that the Boy Scouts teach you. You apply these things every day in your life, and you don't even know you are doing it.  I will also say that, as employers, we look for leaders when we are trying to find whom we are going to hire. We see over and over again employers looking to hire Eagle Scouts from the Boy Scouts of  So there might be somebody today who is watching this maybe on C-SPAN, maybe on the internet; and maybe you are a Boy Scout, maybe you are a Cub Scout, maybe you are not sure if you are going to stick it out. I will tell you this. Every interview I have ever gone on, I had a resume. On that resume was included the fact that I was an Eagle Even when I was applying for college, I put on my resume and in all of my extracurricular classes that I was an Eagle I would highly encourage anybody that is maybe at a lower rank but working hard to attain that Eagle, finish your Eagle  My dad was a Life He moved when he was a Life He never finished his His brother, Jim Bridenstine, my uncle, did finish his Eagle Of course, my brother and I both finished our Eagle Scout, and now our kids are in Scouts, and we are going to do everything we can to help them finish their Eagle  Not only did I put it on every resume, not only on all of my college applications, I will tell you, I also ran for Federal office. The first thing I did in my campaign commercials is tell people: My name is Jim Bridenstine, and I am an Eagle Before I told them that I went to college or before I told them that I was a Navy pilot, I told them that I was an Eagle  I think it is important for people to understand that some folks have a desire from an early age to achieve. When employers look at a resume, when voters look at somebody running for office, they want to see that.  I will tell you, there was somebody who came into my office not too long ago wanting a job. I had a number of great candidates. It was nearly impossible for me to pick which one. We all know this: When you get to be a Member of Congress, you get hundreds of resumes the next day.  I was getting down to the end, and I was trying to figure out which one. I got down to three. When they left my office, one of the three said this: One other thing I need to let you know; I am an Eagle  That did it for me. I knew at that point that this young man had committed himself to something much bigger than himself from an early age. That person now works in my office.  I look for that. I know employers across this country look for that. It speaks volumes to the character and the training of the individual. That will continue.  I will tell you, when you think about all of the astronauts in the United States of America, the 316 or so of them in the history of the United States of America, 40 of them were Eagle That is not by accident. I will tell you that is a much higher percentage than the number of Eagle Scouts who are produced in the Boy Scouts of America, and it is certainly a much higher percentage than the number of Eagle Scouts that exist in the population of the United States of So this is something that employers look for.  I took my 11-year-old son to the Air Force Academy just about a month ago. I took some brochures about what it takes to get into the Air Force There is all kinds of stuff in there about being an athlete and being a great student, but one of the six criteria that they look for is: Are you an Eagle Scout at the Air Force Academy of the United States of America?  I would also argue they probably look for the same thing at West Point and the Naval These are things that employers look for, that schools look for, that the military looks for. These are the character issues that are important.  So if you are in Scouting today, my encouragement to you is to finish, get your Eagle If you are below the[[Page H4495]]age of 18 and you have still got time, I would encourage you to join and get your Eagle It has been important for me. It has been important for my brother. It has been important for my family.                              {time}  1845  My uncle Jim's son, Shane, my cousin, is also an Eagle This is a tradition of the Bridenstine family, and I would encourage you to make it a tradition in yours.  Mr.Chairman, I just want to say thank you for your leadership and thank you for leading this effort.  ",CREC-2017-05-23-pt1-PgH4490.txt,2155,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,23.0,May

13845,topic-id,3294,"Mr.President, what is happening today on the Senate floor is outrageous. I still cannot quite believe my colleagues as their staff members stood behind them in the Senate Chamber to my right. All of them have health insurance that is paid for by taxpayers. All of us--all of them, all of the staff, all of the Senators, all of the House Members--have insurance paid for by taxpayers. Yet they would come to the Senate floor with their votes entrusted to them and given to them by[[Page S4174]]the voting public in their districts and their All of them have health insurance that is paid for by the taxpayers, and they would vote to take insurance away from hundreds of thousands of people in my State and in Washington and in Wyoming and in Alabama and in  Millions of people around the country, most of whom have jobs--people who are working $8-, $10-, $12-, $15-an-hour jobs--are not as well paid as the staff who stand behind us as these floor sessions go on, and they would take insurance away from people like them. I am still just incredulous that that would have happened. This bill affects all of our constituents. It would upend one-fifth of the American economy. Yet the people whom we serve have no idea what is in this bill. We really do not know what is in it.  Over the weekend, people said Senator McConnell was going to bring us all to the floor on Tuesday to vote on the healthcare law. This is the law to repeal the Affordable Care I was part of writing the Affordable Care Act as a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions That bill took months and months and months, dozens of hearings, and hundreds of amendments. The committee adopted, and I supported, 150 Republican amendments. It was the way we should do things here. Instead, Senator McConnell met just down this hall--I know the camera does not quite show this. Down this hall in his office, he met with lobbyists from Wall Street, with lobbyists from the drug companies, and with lobbyists from the insurance companies. I do not think the Presiding Officer was part of this--he is, perhaps, too junior--but four or five Republican Senators were in there, and they wrote a bill that, alas, was good for drug companies, was good for insurance companies, and was good for Wall It just left out the public.  Now, we do not really know what is in the bill this time. One of the things we do know is, all of the options are bad for my State of Ohio and that all of the options are bad for the people who elected us to serve here. Let me talk about those options.  First, behind door 1, we have the repeal of the Affordable Care Act with no replacement. Again, behind door 1, I do not know if that is what this bill is. I do know it is one of the options. So behind door 1 is repeal with no replacement. That means repealing the entire Affordable Care Act with no plan to replace it. It creates dangerous uncertainty that of course will drive prices up for everyone. When insurance companies, when the people who have insurance now have no idea what is going to happen, of course it drives prices up. Of course, it means insurance companies will pull out of Wyoming and Alabama and Washington State and Hawaii and  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, 18 million Americans will lose their health insurance next year, and premiums will go up 20 percent. Professionals hold these jobs. They are people who are not Republicans, who are not Democrats, who are just like the Parliamentarian, who is not aligned with either party. The Congressional Budget Office is just like that.  Again, think about that. Think of the Members of the Think of the Senate's staff who line up along this wall during floor sessions. All of us have insurance. Yet we are going to take it away. According to this plan behind door 1, we are going to take it away from 18 million There would be less coverage, and premiums would go up 20 percent--higher costs. By the end of this decade, 32 million Americans--that is like 1 out of 10 Americans--who currently have insurance would be without health coverage and premiums would double. So 32 million people lose their insurance within the decade and premiums double.  Let's talk about Barbara, whom I met in Toledo just recently, is 63. She is not old enough for Medicare; she relies on the healthcare exchanges. Repeal with no replacement would create massive uncertainty for  The people in this body who voted yes today--does the Senate staff who stands behind here who have insurance from--taxpayers like Barbara--do they think about Barbara? Do they think about somebody who reads in the paper that the Senate took the first--still reversible but barely--step toward taking their insurance away? Do they ever think about people like Barbara? Do they, as President Lincoln said, ever get out and get their public opinion pass and listen to people like Barbara? She is 63 years old, and she doesn't know if she will have insurance next month. Imagine that. Do the staff back here, do the Senators who get insurance from taxpayers--do they think: Oh, maybe my insurance won't exist a few months from now. Do they think about that? I am guessing they don't.  Repeal with no replacement creates massive uncertainty for Ohioans like her. We have already seen this year what that uncertainty does to Ohio families, with insurance companies that have been forced to pull out of the market as Congress and the White House create more and more uncertainty. When Aetna pulled out of Dayton and other communities in Ohio--in that part of Ohio--they and others left nearly 20 counties in Ohio without any insurer next year. When they did that, they announced it was because of the uncertainty in this Congress, that nobody really quite knows what is happening.  So that is door 1--repeal with no replacement, higher cost, less coverage.  Let's look at door 2. Behind door 2 is the plan that Mitch McConnell negotiated in secret. As I said, straight down this hall, go to the right, that is Mitch McConnell's office. That is where the drug company lobbyists hung out; that is where the insurance company lobbyists hung out; that is where the Wall Street lobbyists hung out and a small number of Senators, and then they slammed the door shut. That is how they wrote this bill. The Presiding Officer knows this from his constituents in The drug companies wrote the bill. The insurance companies wrote the bill. Wall Street wrote the bill. And, alas, the bill: tax cuts for insurance companies and tax cuts for the drug companies. The 400 richest families in America--many of them contribute huge numbers of dollars, with lots of zeroes on them, to my Republican colleagues who voted for this bill. The 400 richest families in America will get--under this McConnell door 2, there are not just higher costs with less coverage for the public, but 400 families will average a $7 million tax cut for each of the next 10 years. Four hundred families will get a $7 million tax cut for each of the next 10 years.  The McConnell plan would increase healthcare costs for working families. We know that. They would slap on higher costs. They would slap an age tax on Ohioans over 50 when they buy insurance. And when it comes to healthcare costs, Senator Heller from Nevada said it best: There is nothing in this bill that would lower premiums.  So they give tax cuts to rich people. They give tax breaks to the insurance and the drug companies. They cut But there is nothing in this bill, according to Senator Heller, a Republican from Nevada, that would lower premiums. There are, however, those massive tax breaks for drug companies that have been jacking up prices on lifesaving medicines like insulin and those drug companies that played a role in creating the opioid epidemic that devastates my More people in my State--as the Presiding Officer, who also represents a large State, knows--more people in my State died of opioid overdose than any other State in the United  What does this plan do for the opioid epidemic? I have had dozens--maybe not dozens--I have done at least 15 or 20 roundtables around Ohio to talk about the opioid epidemic with doctors and counselors, psychologists and therapists and nurses, people who are recovering from addiction and their families, and others. One thing they all agree on is that the single best tool to help with opioid addiction is, alas, The single best tool to combat the opioid epidemic is This bill would take away the 1 tool we have to fight that.  So 220,000 Ohioans right now struggling with opioid addiction, getting treatment for opioid addiction--220,000--they are getting their addiction treatment because they have the Affordable Care Act and insurance provided by the Affordable Care We are going to take that away from them.  At one of my roundtables in Cincinnati--the Talbot House--a father[[Page S4175]]sitting next to his daughter, who I believe was in her early thirties, looked at me and said: My daughter would be dead from an opioid overdose had it not been for Medicaid expansion. I thank Governor Kasich for having the courage to stand up against his President and stand up against the Republican leadership in this town and do the right thing in expanding  This plan, door 2, has higher costs, less coverage, and would kick many of those 220,000 people off their insurance. It would disrupt treatment for hundreds of thousands of Ohioans as they fight for their lives. It would pull the rug out from under local police and communities in the midst of an epidemic.  A number of police officers told me that when they go to a home--a police officer or a firefighter or another first responder--when they go to a home where somebody is unconscious because of an opioid epidemic, first they give them Narcan to revive them, and the second thing they do is sign them up for They sign them up for Medicaid so they can get treatment. Otherwise, there is a very good chance that person will die.  The most important tool for fighting opioid addiction is Yet this body voted today--2 Republicans stood up and voted against this--today, 50 Republicans and the Vice President of the United States, who honored us with his presence today with the tie-breaking vote, voted essentially to kick those people off their treatment.  So door 2, the insurance company lobbyist plan: higher costs, less coverage. The same plan written by lobbyists.  Let's talk about door 3. Behind door 3 are higher costs and less coverage. It is the same plan written by lobbyists, just with taxpayer dollars thrown in to buy off votes. Same result--higher costs and less coverage.  They can't just throw money at this bill and make it better.  Take opioids. They want to take away Medicaid, which is the 1 tool we have to get people treated, and then they throw in a $45 billion Federal grant program instead.  Governor Kasich said that those dollars--taking away Medicaid, taking away treatment, taking away insurance from the 700,000 Ohioans in Medicaid expansion and hundreds of thousands of Ohioans later--Governor Kasich is a Republican, and he and I see this pretty much the same way. Governor Kasich said that putting that money in after taking away Medicaid is like spitting in the ocean.  The director of Ohio's Medicaid Program said the Republican Senate plan would be devastating for For instance, if someone had cancer, I don't think the best treatment for cancer is to cut off their insurance and then give them a Federal grant to pay their oncologist--not even a Federal grant to pay their oncologist. You don't treat people by a Federal grant, you treat people by insurance and all of the wraparound part of insurance that matters.  It is not just those fighting addiction--I talked a lot about opioids--it is kids with special healthcare needs. It is Ohio schools. There is a program called Medicaid in Schools that helps young people struggling with various kinds of physical and mental illnesses in the schools. That is helpful.  It is rural hospitals. I have been on the phone with literally four dozen hospital CEOs in this State--at least four dozen, a number of them a number of times--and small hospitals in rural communities know that they may close if this bill, the one behind door 3, is adopted.  It is seniors in nursing homes, and it is their families who help care for them. Few people realize that three in five nursing home residents in my State rely on Medicaid to cover the cost of their care. That is 60 percent. They are our parents and our grandparents. These are middle-class families and working-class families who end up in nursing homes. They run out of money at the end of their lives. That is Medicaid dollars. Two-thirds of Medicaid dollars don't go to children or opioid addiction, they go to nursing homes to take care of our parents and grandparents.  I met with families again in Toledo last week who rely on Medicaid to help afford nursing home care.  Bob's mother Blanche lives at a home in Perrysburg, a suburb of       My mother and father worked all their lives. My mother is      95 and receives a pension of only $1,500 a month. Medicaid      keeps her alive so she is able to spend time with her kids      and her grandkids.  I remember Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, who said that wisdom and knowledge are passed from grandparent to grandchild. A child can spend time with her grandparents, as my daughters got to spend time with their grandparents, especially my grandmother in her last years. It didn't just bring great joy to the grandparents, it imparts wisdom and understanding and education to the grandchildren. Medicaid does that, too, when people have insurance, when people are taken care of in nursing homes and assisted living.  We talk about people like Blanche who worked hard to build a good life for their families. They paid their taxes. They paid their insurance premiums. They paid into Medicare and Social So we are going to cut their Medicaid in the last years of their lives. They shouldn't have to lose everything because they need more intensive care in the later years of their lives, and neither should their families, who are already squeezed--people in their forties and fifties and early sixties--who worry about their children's education on the one hand and then worry about paying for nursing home care for their parents on the other.  Another huge portion of the people Medicaid helps are Ohioans who are workers, who pay taxes, who have children with a disability or with serious special needs. Nearly 500,000 kids in Ohio--20 percent of Ohio kids, 2 in 10--have special healthcare needs. Boaz, whom I met in Cleveland, was born with several heart defects. He wouldn't be alive today without treatment covered by Benjamin Dworning from Akron, born with Down syndrome, visited my office recently with his parents.  It is not just kids with special needs who will lose out. Ohio schools could lose $12 million a year. Twenty-two percent of rural hospitals would be at risk of closing. It goes on and on.  These are all problems created by this bill behind door 3, written by lobbyists, written down the hall in Senator McConnell's office by drug company and insurance company and Wall Street lobbyists. That is the bill--undisclosed, unknown until he regurgitated it on the Senate floor and gave us this bill.  Cleveland.com wrote: ``As for the proposed $200 billion to ease the path for ACA funding losses, this too would pale compared with the losses themselves.''  Again, Governor Kasich--he, a Republican; I, a Democrat--said this is spitting in the ocean.  So that is what is behind door 3--higher costs, less coverage.  That brings us to door 4. What is behind the last door? We have no idea. It is the ultimate mystery plan.  Remember what Washington uncertainty has already done to Ohio families? There are 20 counties with no insurer next year.  As an editor at the Columbus Dispatch--Ohio's most conservative newspaper--said to me about a month and a half ago, uncertainty is like carbon monoxide for business, a silent killer.  Now, the Republican Party, which fashions itself as the party of business, seems to have specialized over the last 10 years in injecting uncertainty into the economy--uncertainties such as, are we going to pass the Export-Import Bank, which Senator Murray worked so hard on, so our companies can export American-manufactured, well-made products? Are we going to pay our debts or are we not going to meet our obligations and shut down the government? Are we going to leave hanging out there the Affordable Care Act repeal? All of these things create uncertainty, and as a result, business investment freezes. We know what happens. So who knows what kind of damage this latest vote will do in the insurance market.  What we know for certain is that this mystery plan behind door 4 will mean higher costs and it will mean less coverage, because nothing so far--nothing that has been put on the table--could result in anything else. The math doesn't work. How can anyone stand here--again, staff standing by the wall here and Members of the Senate, all getting insurance provided by taxpayers--how can you stand here and[[Page S4176]]threaten to take away the insurance of others and at the same time drive up costs?  The Affordable Care Act is not perfect. Of course, it is not. We have work to do. Senator Schumer talked today about it. Sit down with us. We would love to work through many of the items and get more young, healthy people into the insurance pool, to stabilize the insurance market, to go after the high cost of prescription drugs and maybe, even to consider Medicare at 55. We were one vote away from opening up Medicare in a revenue-neutral way for people between 55 and 64 who might have lost their insurance as they get sick or as they get older. There are all of those options, but don't start with repeal, throwing millions of Americans off of their insurance.  I agree with Governor Kasich one more time. Yesterday, Governor Kasich said: Until Congress can step back from political gamesmanship--which we saw in spades today, as Senator Johnson and Majority Leader McConnell were negotiating the last parts of the bill, and as, more or less, 98 of us sat here and watched and wondered what was going on and saw that political gamesmanship--and come together with a workable bipartisan plan, it is a mistake for the Senate to proceed with the vote we just took on He said that yesterday.  Instead of down the hall Senator McConnell working with insurance company and drug company lobbyists, instead of listening to the drug companies so that he puts the tax break for drug companies in the bill, let's listen to the people of Kentucky, Wyoming, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, North Carolina, Ohio, Hawaii, and Let's listen to the people of the States of my colleagues in this body.  Let's work on a bipartisan plan to fix what is not working in the Affordable Care Let's keep what is working and make healthcare work better for the people whom we serve.

These officers were killed as they protected Dallas citizens exercising their constitutional right to protest. They put their own lives on the line for the safety of others.  Reflecting on the events of last July 7, what stands out to me is the heroism of those who answered when duty called and a community that banded together during this tragic event. We are in the midst of an environment that can be deeply divided. We should all seek to follow the example of the Dallas community.  I want to acknowledge former Dallas Chief of Police David Brown and offer my sincere gratitude for his leadership; as well as the Dallas Police Department; first responders; the Parkland hospital; Baylor University hospital, where this iconic photograph was taken, for providing excellent emergency care; and others who helped the victims of this attack.

13793,topic-id,2370,"Thank you, Mr. I know my Republican colleagues are working on versions of the healthcare bill they have been talking about today, and I know my colleagues are going to try to say they are protecting the sickest of Americans, and they are saying they do want to ensure that people with preexisting conditions don't have to pay through the nose when they need care. I think the President called the House version of this attempt a mean bill, and I think the original Senate bill was just as mean, if not meaner, with the number of people who would be cut off of Medicaid over a period of time and left without access to care.  Today's bill also includes an amendment or a package of ideas by my colleagues from Texas and Utah--a provision that allows insurers to sell junk insurance on the individual health insurance market. As long as they offer at least one plan that is real insurance, insurers could offer a bunch of plans that, as CBO has said, are not really insurance; that is, they just cover one or two things. Yes, they would be cheaper, but if CBO doesn't consider these types of plans insurance, how are they insurance?  I think the whole notion of junk insurance being invested into this bill is very problematic. Under junk insurance plans, they can limit or deny coverage of essential benefits, including hospitalization, maternity care, preventive care, prescription drugs, laboratory care, and substance abuse treatment. That is what they can limit. We wouldn't want those limited. This is why CBO says that if you can't go to the hospital and get care, then it is not really insurance. I have to agree with them on that.  These plans could charge people more or simply deny them based on preexisting conditions, and these plans could pay out less than 60 percent of the healthcare expenses, leaving the beneficiary with unbelievable, insurmountable deductibles that would be hard to pay. These plans could also impose an annual or lifetime cap on insurance.  I had a young woman come to my office today who was treated at Seattle Children's Hospital in our This family actually lives in a neighboring State, but Seattle Children's Hospital is such a regional entity in the State of Washington, in Seattle, and we are so proud of that. They told me about the debilitating disease this young child was born with and how many surgeries she has had. Literally, with the brain treatments she has had to receive, she and her mother told me that if there had ever been any lifetime caps, they would have exhausted them in the first few years. I am so proud that she came to see us today and is continuing to talk about why capping healthcare plans would be so devastating to somebody like her.  We don't want to create two markets of insurance. We don't want the one that is the real plan, real insurance, and the one where everybody goes and buys insurance that even CBO says is not real insurance.  I know that probably in the last few days of discussion, people have said: Ok, we will put a bunch of money in to help the real, or regulated market. I talked to my insurance commissioner in the State of Washington, and he said: Listen, when you don't spread out risk, you are not going to have a market and you are going to create problems.  So the notion that you think that catastrophic out-of-pocket costs won't be borne by these individual patients, I think, is wrong or that these higher premiums and deductibles could be paid by these individuals. It turns out that these junk plans, as I said, do not even count as insurance, and everybody who is in the real insurance market would then end up having to pay more.  The bill explicitly states that non-compliant plans will not count as creditable coverage for the purpose of individuals demonstrating that they have insurance.  I am checking with my staff.  Is that right? Is that what is in the proposal?  The bill explicitly states that noncompliance plans will not count as credible coverage for the purpose of individuals demonstrating that they have insurance.  Under this bill, if someone gets one of those junk plans--if somehow you see that marketed and you buy into it because you think it is cheap and you think it is the greatest thing ever--and then you try to enroll in a comprehensive plan, there is a good chance that you will get a lockout period of 6 months before you can get coverage.  Why am I here talking about this? Because the State of Washington tried this. We tried this approach in the 1990s. After our State had passed a major healthcare reform bill in the 1990s, a group of State legislators allowed these junk plans to be sold along with compliant plans. Guess what happened? Nearly all of the insurers in our State pulled out of the individual insurance market, and a death spiral ensued. Why? Because the cost then of that individual market was so high and so great that they could not service it.  They said: Oh my gosh, if I have to offer a compliant plan along with this junk insurance, I cannot make the compliant plan work because it costs so much. We are not staying.  This very important experience taught us that that is not the way for us to spread risk.  I am concerned--and I have heard from a number of patient advocacy groups, not just the young woman from Seattle Children's Hospital who came to see me today but consumer groups and health insurers themselves, like America's Health Insurance Plans, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, AARP, American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network, American Diabetes Association, American Heart and Lung Association, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, March of Dimes, National MS Society, National Health Council, and the National Coalition for Women[[Page S3986]]with Heart All of these organizations do not like this idea of junk insurance, of saying you can have a compliant plan that is real insurance and a marketplace in which there are things that are not really insurance, because then people are going to go buy a bunch of things that are not really insurance and then not have the ability to get cost and care and run up uncompensated care. Then you are going to make the real market unsustainable and unsupportive, and the rates are going to go so high that people are just going to pull out.  A group of 10 of those leading patient advocacy groups wrote:       Under the amendment, insurance companies would be allowed      to charge higher premiums to people based on their health      status--in addition to opting out of other patient      protections in current law, such as the guarantee of      essential health benefits--  Those are the things I was going over a few minutes ago--     and the prohibition on annual and lifetime coverage caps.  They go on to write:       Separating healthy enrollees from those with preexisting      conditions will also lead to severe instability of the      insurance market. This is unacceptable for our patients.  Yesterday, America's Health Insurance Plans wrote:       Allowing health insurance products governed by different      rules and standards would further destabilize the individual      market and increase costs for those with preexisting      conditions.  That is the largest health insurance group in the country, and they are writing this.  If they are telling us in advance that this is going to really destabilize the market and cause problems, we should listen because right now what we have had is an expansion of Medicaid and covering more people, raising the GDP and helping areas of our States and country and creating more stability.  We have had some challenges in the individual market. We should fix that. We should definitely drive down the cost of the delivery system by continuing to improve it. But the notion that this is the fix for the individual market when the providers are telling us it is going to destabilize the market and drive us out--we should understand what the result of that is going to be.  Yesterday, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association wrote:       The result (of Cruz/Lee) would be higher premiums,      increased Federal tax credit costs for coverage available on      the exchanges, and insurers exiting the market or pricing      coverage out of reach of consumers.  I believe our goals should be trying to drive down the cost of insurance. We have lots of ideas about that, and I want to work with our colleagues on that, but I am very concerned that this approach to try to get people supporting a Senate proposal is the wrong approach and will drive people out of the market.  I think the bill is still a war on The bill still permanently cuts and caps the Medicaid I have said numerous times that we saved $2 billion in the State of Washington by rebalancing people off of nursing home care and on to community-based care. It is a great concept. Look, we have a lot of people who are going to live longer. We have baby boomers who are reaching retirement. The number of people who are going to demand services, whether from Medicaid or Medicare, is going to be increased just because of the population bubble. We should be doing things to drive down the costs of care.  There are great ideas, and I was able to get some of those in the bill. We ended up passing those things, and some States are actually working on that. More than 15 States are actually working on that concept of rebalancing to community-based care and making long-term care more affordable under this provision. I guarantee you that we have to do that, but if you permanently cap or cut Medicaid, you are going to have veterans who use access to Medicaid for care who are not going to get care. You are going to get people who need opioid treatment.  I find it interesting that we would have this program over here. I see that my colleague from Michigan is on the floor. We call it the Saginaw Health  One would say: OK, Saginaw Health Clinic, there is a bunch of money in this bill. Apply for opioid help.  They would say: We are going to get $10 million.  When you walk in the door of the opioid Saginaw Health Clinic, the first thing they will ask is if you are on If you are not on Medicaid, you are not going to get any opioid help.  So the notion that we would cut people off of Medicaid but put more money in the opioid problem is not what we need to do to solve our challenge. What we need to do is make sure we are delivering the most cost-effective care as possible and make sure people are getting access to care.  That is why I have been all over the State of I have met so many people. I have met people at healthcare facilities who have told me that some of their highest costs were from a patient who continually came to see them in the emergency room, maybe 30 times a year, because he did not have coverage, so he drove up the cost for everybody. They said they finally got this person on the Medicaid expansion. Guess what. They do not have those costs anymore in their hospitals and facilities. It has driven down the costs.  I do not want to see people kicked off of I do not want to see it cut in a declining budget. I want us to improve Medicaid and make it more cost-effective and more utilized and supported.  Estimates by the CBO of the original Senate bill are that the Medicaid cut would be $772 billion over the next decade and that the Federal investment would be cut by 35 percent within the next two decades, relative to current law projections. That is a lot of consequence for the Medicaid population. I think that is why we have so many groups and organizations here that are anxious about this proposal and where we go. We definitely want to talk to our colleagues.  One former CBO Director said, the junk insurance idea is ``a recipe for a meltdown.'' This is someone who served in past Republican administrations, and I take his word seriously.  I think what we need to do is work together to make sure we get a program that addresses our most fundamental issues--the challenges in the individual market, keep addressing how we keep and stabilize a population on the most affordable rates there are, and keep the things we know have worked very well, like the Medicaid expansion. It has worked. It has supported people, and it has helped us stabilize the market.  I will remind my colleagues, too, that the State of New York took one provision of the Affordable Care Act and has 650,000 people in New York on a very, very affordable insurance plan. We think that if you are an individual in the individual market, you should be able to get the same clout as somebody who works for a large employer. You should be able to go in and buy in bulk as a class, as a group of people, and when you buy in bulk, you should get a discount. That is what we think will help us in the individual market to drive down these costs for what is about 7 percent of the marketplace.  I urge my colleagues to reject this latest proposal. Let's get serious about fixing the things that we know we can fix and improve upon, but for the over 22 million Americans who are very nervous about this proposal because they know they are going to get cut off of care, let's not do that to them. Let's improve where we need to go in affordability in the healthcare arena and not think that a junk insurance program or cutting people off is the solution for the future.

13778,topic-id,805,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from North She has been a champion of building this bipartisan coalition. When we announced this yesterday, we had a very large board that showed quite a broad array of groups from around the country that are very much in support of this concept. So, I thank Senator Heitkamp for her great leadership.  It is terrific to be on the floor with Senator We both serve on the EPW Committee together, and many times we are totally opposite. Sometimes we feel as if we are on opposite planets, I think, but definitely on different sides of this issue. It is great to be on the same side of an issue such as this, which really helps fortify not just our country but our regions and our beliefs as well.  As Senator Heitkamp said, we have 25 cosponsors. Some of them are utilities, environmental groups, oil and gas companies, Governors, labor unions, so it is a great array of the country interested in carbon capture utilization and storage. We have done a lot of research in this area, but we haven't been able to scale it up to a point where it is economically viable, and that is where I think the tax credits will be not just welcomed and used, but it will be very important to see that scalability--which we have seen coming in small bits and pieces--maybe come in much greater amounts.  We obviously have a very robust coal industry in the State of West We have lost thousands of jobs. Senator Whitehouse and I have talked about his stay in West He has great empathy for the coal miner and for those families that have lost jobs, but he is very concerned, as I think we all are, about what it is doing to our environment and how can we improve this.  That is what this legislation, I think, will help do. It will spur domestic investment in the technologies. It will also help us, I think, bring energy security because it goes to the baseload fuels, whether it is coal or natural gas, that we have to have.  I mean, in Washington, DC, today, it is hot out there, and I can guarantee you there are a lot of air-conditioners that are running at maximum speed. If we do not have this baseload power, which is coal and natural gas in areas--and I see my fellow Senator from West We know, in coal country, how important that is and also what smiles on people's faces these air-conditioners can bring, as these hot days go, because we are running at full capacity.  We want to make sure that by capturing the carbon stream, we prevent any waste emissions and we provide a possible valuable resource for industry. I remarked yesterday for industry to extract oil, which is very important, obviously, to the Senator from North Dakota and also in our Marcellus shale region.  I believe that with this research and with the spurring of this technology, CO2 is going to have another use out there. There are all kinds of utilization possibilities, but if we just turn our backs on it or try to shut it down and make it unviable financially to invest in these technologies, we are never going to find that next best use of  So we tweaked the bill a little bit. The Senators have had this bill out for at least a couple of years. There is a companion bill in the House with a lot of cosponsors as well. I think it has, with 25 cosponsors on the Senate floor, bipartisan but very different philosophical beliefs, maybe. Maybe that is not the best way to put it. There are very different regional approaches to this, I guess would be a better way to state that.  We have our universities, such as West Virginia University and Marshall University, that are working on this. We have the National Energy Technology Lab in Morgantown, where Secretary Perry joined both Senator Manchin and me to talk about the technologies that are in front of us and the challenge for researchers.  I feel like financing and the economic model is where we are trying to go, in order to spur investment, to provide the regulatory certainty but also the investment certainty in that this is a keeper; that this is something that is here to stay, that it is doable, that it is economically feasible, that it is scalable, and it provides us with a lot of energy security at the same time. I think its greatest benefit of all is to keep our air clean and get it cleaner and meet the challenges of the next several decades.

13886,topic-id,1424,"Mr.President, earlier today, the Senate voted to pass the Omnibus appropriations bill for 2017.  This bill is a product of bipartisan negotiations and hard work on the part of our Appropriations Committee, of which I am proud to be a member, and the leadership of both of our parties.  I am encouraged by the overwhelming support for this important legislation that reflects our Nation's priorities and funds the government in a responsible way. I am very pleased--and I can't emphasize this enough; very pleased--that the bill includes a bipartisan provision that keeps the promise of lifetime healthcare benefits for 22,000 coal miners and their families, including 8,500 West Virginians--my home  Bankruptcies in the coal industry meant that these miners would have lost their critical health insurance coverage at the end of last year. We passed that little, short-term extension for 4 months, and it was set to expire this coming week.  This appropriations bill provides certainty to these coal mining families. Because of this bill, they will keep the healthcare they earned through their years of hard work.  I worked closely with my West Virginia colleague, Senator Joe Manchin, as well as our Representatives--Representatives David McKinley, Evan Jenkins, and Alex Mooney--to get this permanent miners' healthcare fix included in the bill.  I also want to particularly thank our majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, for his leadership on behalf of the miners in West Virginia and in his home State of Kentucky, and the rest of I would also like to thank my fellow Republican from the State of Ohio, Senator Rob Portman, who was a champion for those miners as well.  But, most importantly, I would like to thank the miners from across coal country who came to Washington to advocate for their healthcare benefits. I met with dozens--probably hundreds, over the course of the years--of West Virginia miners in my office over the last several years.  Last September, miners came by the thousands to the west front of the Capitol and stood for hours in just excruciatingly hot conditions. These miners and their families put a human face on the issue. They are the reason--they are the reason--that we have a successful result today.  Many of these miners have shared their stories with me through letters and emails and personal stories and visits, and I want to share just a few of their thoughts.  Brenda, a coal miner's widow from West Virginia, wrote that continued healthcare coverage presented a life or death situation for her. She wrote:       I have medical problems, which require monthly doctor      visits and prescriptions and I will no longer be able to see      my doctors--nor afford the prescriptions should our health      insurance be taken away.  Alfred, a retired West Virginia coal miner wrote:       We were not given our health benefits as a gift. We worked      hard in the mines every day for a long time, and it was      backbreaking, year-to-year.  Howard, another retiree, wrote that he worked in the West Virginia coal mines for 41 years to earn this promise of healthcare benefits.  William, also a retired West Virginia miner, wrote that he has had several surgeries, including one on New Year's Day, 2017. The possible expiration of health benefits and the thought of temporary benefit extensions left him worried about whether he would be able to access necessary followup medical care for his surgery.  After learning that permanent healthcare would be included in this bill, Gisele wrote:       Tonight I will rest soundly knowing that we will be able to      afford our medicines.[[Page S2766]]  For Brenda, Alfred, William, Howard, Gisele, and thousands of other miners and widows across West Virginia, this bill keeps the promise of lifetime healthcare.  There is more work to be done to protect the pension benefits of our retired miners and to bring jobs back to coal country, to areas that have been hit hard by the previous administration's policies. But the permanent healthcare in this bill is a critical victory for our coal mining families and the communities where they live.  I would also like to quote a young man who sent me an email. I met him at a Chick-fil-A on a Saturday--not a Sunday, of course, on a We struck up a little friendship, and the day he learned that this was in the bill, he texted me and said:       Senator, I met you in the Chick-fil-Thank you, you have      now secured the benefits for my Paw  I thought it was such a heartfelt message that he sent to me--a new friend of mine who had been struggling along trying to figure out a way to help his grandfather.  There are a number of other important priorities in this bill as well. Mining communities will also be helped by tens of millions of dollars across different agencies to help us retrain our miners who have lost their jobs.  This bill also includes a significant investment in new fossil energy research, including carbon capture and sequestration. These funds will help spur the development of new markets for coal to keep coal mining jobs for years to come.  The appropriations bill also includes funding increases for rural broadband deployment, something I have been very concerned about, as well as continued funding for the Appalachian Regional Access to broadband is absolutely critical for economic development and improved access to health and education opportunities in our rural communities, and we are sadly underserved. There is much work to be done to bring access to high-speed internet to many communities, but this bill is a positive step.  As chairman of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, I am glad that we included increased funding for the Drug-Free Communities Support Program and the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, or the HITDA Unfortunately, cascading across this country is the devastating problem of prescription drug abuse, opioid abuse, and heroin addiction. The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education portion of the bill includes an $800 million increase to combat opioid addiction. This includes the $500 million authorized for the 21st Century Cures Act to help States with their response to the crisis. It also includes an increase for medication-assisted treatment programs and for other programs outlined by the CARA bill that we passed last summer.  In addition to these important treatment resources, we have also funded important enforcement and prevention aspects of the problem as well, including $50 million for the Department of Veterans Affairs for opioid and substance abuse for the treatment of our veterans. This is a real problem for our returning veterans who have addiction issues. There are funds to implement the Jason Simcakoski act that Senator Baldwin and I introduced.  Unfortunately, West Virginia is the epicenter of the opioid crisis that has struck communities across the country. Passage of this appropriations bill will make a difference--a big difference--for people who are struggling to overcome addiction and to help our States that are financially strapped and our local communities combat this terrible problem.  Another area of significance to a lot of people in my State and across the country is the increase in the funding for the National Institutes of There is a $400 million increase for Alzheimer's research--something important to me, as I lost both of my parents who suffered from Alzheimer's, this terrible disease. We need to find not just treatments, but we need to find a cure, and I think NIH is where we are going to find it.  There are many other reasons to support this bill. It has additional flood relief for our devastated flood areas. I know the Presiding Officer has major floods in Louisiana, and we had them in West Virginia, and we have had them across the country.  Just to mention a few other things, this bill includes a pay increase for our troops, which is so important. They are on the frontlines.  The bill also works on scientific research for our educational institutions, something important to our universities in West  But, most of all, I just want to voice my appreciation for the bipartisan work by the members of the appropriations committees, who worked hard to get this bill where we are. It is a responsible bill. It is a commonsense bill. It sets our priorities.

13791,topic-id,949,"Mr.President, I rise to speak to the repeal and replace effort that is before us, and the challenge has been how to do so. Senator McConnell has recently introduced a bill, and as we pore over it, there is much to like, but quite likely, there will be some Senators who will still express reservations as to whether this amendment adequately fulfills President Trump's campaign pledges--those pledges specifically to continue coverage, care for those with preexisting conditions, eliminate mandates, and lower premiums.  If more is required, Senator Lindsey Graham and I have actually come up with an amendment that we will add to the bill being offered. It doesn't replace it but, rather, it adds to it. In it, we return to conservative solutions that devolve power back to States and rely upon the States to, in turn, devolve power to the patient.  So what does this bill do? What we do basically is take the dollars that the Federal Government would give to a State under ObamaCare and we give those same dollars in the form of a block grant. We allow the State to then administer the money in its best way to, one, give patients the power, and two, fulfill President Trump's pledges.  We think this works. It is a 10th Amendment solution in which that which is not specifically given to the Federal Government is, in turn, given to the Let the States decide what they want to do. Some object. They say: Oh my gosh. A conservative State may do something that we don't think--whoever is speaking--it should be allowed to do. Another might say: Well, I don't think a liberal State should be allowed to do that. Under our bill, we devolve to the State, so a blue State can do a blue thing and a red State can do a red thing. Let's let our States be the laboratories of democracy that teach each other the best way in which to insure others. But we say it will be the State that has the power and not the Federal  If you oppose this approach, it means you would trust a Washington bureaucrat more to address the needs of your State than you would trust the people of your own  We would still have those protections which would allow folks to get the adequate coverage they need. There would still be--for example, preexisting conditions will be covered, fulfilling President Trump's pledge to that end. We would fulfill what I call the Jimmy Kimmel test--that everybody who is ill or has a loved one who is ill would have adequate resources to have that person's illness addressed.  We have a precedent as to how this is done. Congress, I am told, when it addressed the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, gave the dollars necessary, with flexibility to the Although at the time the solution was criticized as giving too much money to the States, since, the Federal Government has not had to put in more money. Because of the flexibility, the States have been able to use the dollars allocated in such a way as to meet the needs of the population.  So what could a State do with these dollars?  It could help those patients who are at higher risk or higher cost purchase[[Page S3985]]the coverage they need, perhaps in a reinsurance or in an invisible high-risk pool that would allow premiums to be lowered for those individuals and for all.  It could maintain status quo. Those folks getting tax credits instead could have these dollars fund their purchase of insurance. It could be used together with Senator Cruz's amendment, which would allow a health savings account to be used to purchase health insurance. The individual could set up such an account, the State could fund it, and then these dollars could then be used to purchase insurance. I like that, personally. That particular provision was in the Cassidy-Collins bill, the Patient Freedom Act, and it dovetails very nicely with block-granting these dollars back to the States to care for someone.  It could directly contract with providers to provide assistance to a specific population. So imagine you have an Indian reservation--or if not an Indian reservation, which might be covered under another source of funding, another fairly isolated population that does not have access to healthcare, the State could say: OK, we are going to come in and provide providers specifically for that population.  Alaska may adopt this because they have 700,000 people stretched over a land mass almost as big as the lower 48, and that might be a solution Alaska comes up with, but the point being, the solution would be specific for that Unlike ObamaCare, in which, out of Washington, DC, Washington bureaucrats dictate that the same approach be taken across the Nation no matter how different the States are, in this, the money is given to the State, and the State is asked to provide for their citizens in a way specific for the needs of that  We think the Graham-Cassidy amendment returning power to States and to patients is a conservative solution which ultimately gives the patient more power. I will repeat. This does not replace that bill which is being offered by Senator It would be an amendment to that. And if it turns out that some Senators feel as if that particular bill is not adequate to fulfill President Trump's campaign promises, we think this amendment could take the bill the rest of the way.

13881,topic-id,1582,"Mr.President, I followed the remarks of the Senator from We speak to the American people in light of the House just voting 217 to 213 to repeal and replace If there is somebody watching right now, quite likely she is concerned about her healthcare premiums.  On the campaign trail--I remember this so vividly--on the campaign trail when I was running for the Senate, I was in Jefferson Parish, on Veterans Boulevard, and a woman named Tina came up. I am going to paraphrase what she said a little bit because this is a G-rated program. She said: My name is Tina, and I am angry. I am paying $500 more a month, $6,000 more a year. My husband and I have no children and I have had a hysterectomy, and I am paying for pediatric dentistry and obstetrical benefits. I am angry.  If there is something right now that the average middle-class voter is saying about his or her insurance premiums, it is that they are angry. They feel they are being forced by Washington to buy things they do not need and sacrifice other parts of their budget because if they do not, they know the Federal Government will come after them with the force of law, penalizing their family, and they do not want that.  So what can we do? First, we acknowledge, as the House has, that ObamaCare is not working. Premiums are going up 20 to 40 percent per year. In Eleven States, so I am told, individual markets are in a death spiral.  I could go through that, which we already know. President Trump knew it. As Candidate Trump, President Trump pledged four major things:  1, he pledged to eliminate mandates. The Senate is committed to working with the House and the President to eliminate those mandates. Washington, DC, should not tell you what to do.  2, he pledged to care for those with preexisting reasons. As Senator Alexander said, it is something that[[Page S2763]]touches every family. The President was particularly concerned about those whose preexisting condition was opioid addiction. We have to recognize that they will not get better unless they receive treatment. It is better to treat than it is to incarcerate or to bury. So we must honor the President's pledge there.  He also pledged to cover all and to lower premiums. It is this last I wish to focus on now.  How do we lower premiums? How do we say to Tina, who 2 years ago was paying $500 more a month, that her premium will be lower? Well, there are several ways. Let me focus first on lowering the cost of care.  Right now, healthcare is way too expensive. If you go in for an urgent care visit, you may pay $1,500 in one urgent care center and $50 in another. As a patient, you do not know. You would never buy a car that way. Can you imagine walking into a car dealership, picking your car, and then saying: Bill me 6 months from now, and I will pay whatever you ask. No one would do that. We shouldn't ask the average patient to do it because when we hide those costs from the patient, we do not allow her to be a informed consumer. Lacking information, she inevitably pays more.  So one thing I have proposed, along with Senator Collins and four other Senators--Senators from South Carolina, South Dakota, Georgia, and West Virginia--is price transparency, which is to say that when someone goes in to get their daughter's ear ache addressed, they know what it would cost at this urgent care center versus another.  A good example of exactly what I am talking about--there was an article in the Los Angeles Times a few years ago about the cash price of a CT scan in the Los Angeles It would vary from $250 to $2,500, and the person purchasing the service with cash would never know.  I envision a time when someone takes their smart phone and they scan a barcode, and the barcode says: You can go at midnight on Thursday and get a CT scan of your daughter for $250 or you can go right now and pay $2,500. You look at a quality code, and both have equal quality. I can see the mother turning to her daughter and saying ``Baby, we are staying up Thursday night'' because that mother knows she can take care of her family's financial health, as well as her daughter's health, just by being an informed consumer.  So one way we lower premiums is by lowering the cost of healthcare, and the way we lower the cost of healthcare is by empowering patients with the knowledge of price.  The second way we can manage to lower the cost of premiums is to take care of those who are sick. The Senator from Tennessee ended by speaking about our commitment to care for those with preexisting conditions. Of course it is in the interest of the patient that he or she who has cancer is able to get care for their cancer. Jimmy Kimmel just spoke about his son being born with a congential heart condition. He would have quickly died. Mr.Kimmel choked up as he spoke about it. Well, shouldn't every family have the reassurance that their child born in such a way would also have their needs addressed? I was struck that Nick Mulvaney, President Trump's OMB Director, agreed with Mr.This is not a Republican issue, not a Democratic issue; it is an American issue. But it is also in society's interest.  I am a physician. I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured for 30 years. I tell folks, as long as that emergency room door was open, no matter what time, day or night, in through that door came folks who had all kinds of healthcare conditions. Some of them would come every week. Some of them would come twice a week. We called them frequent fliers. They may have been addicted or mentally ill. They may have had terrible diabetes which was fully controlled or bad asthma, and they would come in with an exacerbation and could not breathe. Every time they came in, there was a $2,000 to $20,000 charge--every time. But if you manage that patient through a primary care office or an attached urgent care center, what you are charging $2,000 for here, you can manage for $150 there. Not only that, when you manage it for $150 there, if that person actually works, she is more likely to hold a job, more likely to support her family, less likely to go on dependence, more likely to pay taxes. Society wins as she wins. That should be our goal. So another way to lower premiums is to actively manage the cost of disease.  People always say: We want government to run like a business. Let me describe what happens in a large corporation. Take You will find that ExxonMobil has an insurance company, a third-party administrator. They look at someone who is a high-cost employee, and they actively engage in managing that patient's illness so that, one, they are better, but, two, they lower cost. We as a government should do that, which a responsible employer does as well.  The last thing I want to mention is that the way to lower premiums is by expanding coverage. When Candidate Trump said he wanted to lower premiums and preserve coverage, he understood that the two are linked. If you have a big risk pool--and a risk pool is just the folks who are insured. Everybody who has insurance--that is called the risk pool. If it is big, with lots of young folks who are in their twenties, others in their thirties and forties, and then a few folks like me in their fifties, if someone gets sick, you spread the expense of that one over the many. Particularly if the many include the younger and healthier, there is a subsidy for the older and sicker.  Go back to Let's imagine they have 50,000 employees. If they have 50,000 employees and 10 of them get cancer, have liver transplants, terrible car wrecks, or accidents, their premiums don't even blip. Because you spread the cost of these expensive illnesses over the many, all benefit, and cost is held down.  So when President Trump pledged to preserve coverage, he was recognizing that nexus between having a big risk pool and lowering that premium.  Let me finish by saying this: My commitment to Tina and my commitment to the voters of Louisiana and the people of the United States is to try to lower premiums. They cannot afford the un-Affordable Care The way we can do that, which I have outlined today, includes empowering patients with the knowledge of price to lower the cost of healthcare; encouraging coverage that manages those who are sick so that those who are sick stay well and are less likely to consume expensive emergency room care, as an example, but are also more likely to live full, vibrant lives; and lastly, restoring what is called actuarial soundness, the law of big numbers, a risk poll in which if one of us gets cancer, that cost is spread over many.  Mr.President, if we manage to lower premiums, we will fulfill our promise to the American people, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to fulfill that promise.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-05-04-pt1-PgS2761-2.txt,1925,"DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY MORALE, RECOGNITION, LEARNING AND",2017.0,4.0,July

13854,topic-id,1840,"Mr.President, today is an important step in a very long journey. Some 7 years ago, ObamaCare passed into law, and in the 7 years that ObamaCare has been on the books, we have seen the results of this catastrophic law. We have seen the devastation that has resulted. ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in this country.  You and I and the Senators who have listened to their constituents across the country have heard over and over again from small businesses that have been hammered by As I have listened to small businesses in the State of Texas over and over again, they have described ObamaCare as the single biggest challenge they face.  Indeed, thanks to ObamaCare, we have discovered two new categories of people who have been hurt by the Federal Government--the so-called 49ers and the so-called 29ers. The 49ers are the millions of small businesses that have 47, 48, 49 employees and yet do not grow to 50 because at 50, they would be subject to ObamaCare, and in being subject to ObamaCare, they would go out of business. There are literally millions of new jobs that are waiting to happen, waiting to grow, small businesses ready to expand that ObamaCare penalizes so punitively that they do not expand.  By the way, those jobs that would be the 50th and 51st and 52nd are typically low-income jobs. They are jobs for people who are just starting out in their careers. They are jobs for people who are minorities, who are African Americans, who are They are jobs for people like my father in 1957--washing dishes, making 50 cents an hour, but he was glad to have freedom in this new country.  Then there are the 29ers, the people all across this country who are forcibly put into part-time work at 28, 29 hours a week because ObamaCare defines a ``full-time employee'' as 30 hours a week. People all over the country are being hurt. Single moms who are trying to feed their kids are being hurt because they have been forced into part-time work so that they end up working two or three part-time jobs at 28, 29 hours a piece, and none of them provide healthcare. The burden on them has been enormous.  It hasn't just been jobs, although that is a big part of it; it has also been the millions of Americans who have had their health insurance canceled because of We all know President Obama looked at the TV cameras and said: If you like your health insurance plan, you can keep your health insurance plan, and if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  PolitiFact--that left-leaning news site--labeled Obama's promise as 2013's Lie of the Year, and it was. It was a deliberate lie, as Jonathan Gruber, the architect of ObamaCare, said that they were banking on what they called the stupidity of the American people--selling it based on a lie.  Then there is the impact on premiums. President Obama promised the American people that under ObamaCare the average family's premiums would drop $2,500 a year. That wasn't just a little bit wrong; it was wildly and dramatically wrong. In fact, the average family's premiums have risen over $5,000 a year.  People are hurting because health insurance is unaffordable. I hear from Texans over and over and over again: I cannot afford health insurance anymore.  I will say that the harms from ObamaCare--the people suffering under this failed law--have been mounting and mounting and mounting, and for 7 years, the Democrats have been content to do nothing. Barack Obama as President and Democrats having majorities in the Senate did nothing for the 49ers who could not get new jobs; nothing for the 29ers, the single moms forced to work part time; nothing for the millions of people who had the insurance plans that they liked canceled; nothing for the millions of people who could not go see their own doctors anymore; nothing for the millions of people whose premiums had skyrocketed.  After 7 years of stonewalling and blockading and saying ``We do not hear you'' to the American people, now our friends on the Democratic aisle are suddenly insisting that they want to do something. Today, we had a vote to take the first step in doing something--in honoring the promise every Republican made to repeal this disaster.  The bill before the Senate is not perfect. No one would expect it to be perfect. Bismarck's comments about sausage-making are certainly true in this process here today. Yet I will say that in the bill before the Senate, which is not likely to pass tonight--but I believe, at the end of the process, the contours within it are likely to be what we enact, at least the general outlines--there are at least four positive elements that are significant.  1, it repeals the individual mandate.  The IRS fines about 6.5 million people a year because they do not have enough money to buy insurance. Think about that for a second. You are struggling to make ends meet, and you do not have the money to buy health insurance. Not only do you not have insurance, but the IRS slaps you with a fine--millions of dollars of fines. In the State of Texas, there are roughly a million people who are getting fined by the IRS, roughly half of whom make $25,000 a year or less and nearly 80 percent of whom make $50,000 a year or less. The Democratic solution is, if you do not have the money for healthcare, the IRS is going to fine you on top of it, and you still do not get healthcare. That is a terrible outcome.  This bill will repeal the individual mandate, repeal the IRS fines on 6.5 million Americans and the job-killing fines of the individual mandate.  It also repeals the employer mandate, which is the driver of the 29ers and 49ers. For 7 years, the Democrats had no answer to the single mom forced to work part time. Repealing the employer mandate provides relief to everyone who finds himself in those camps.  3, this bill has a major reform that allows people to use health savings accounts--pretax money--to pay for insurance premiums. That means, for millions of Americans, their effective premium rates instantly drop 20 to 30 percent by using pretax money. That is a major reform for empowering you, the consumer, to choose the healthcare for your family.  4, the bill before the Senate includes the consumer freedom amendment--an amendment that I have introduced like the health savings account amendment. It is an amendment that says you, the consumer, should have the freedom to choose the healthcare that is best for your family. You should have the freedom. You shouldn't have to buy what the Federal Government mandates that you must buy; you should choose what meets the needs for you and your family.  The consumer freedom amendment was designed to bring together and serve as a compromise for those who support the mandates in title The consumer freedom amendment says that insurance companies, if they offer plans that meet those title I mandates--all the protections for preexisting conditions--they can also sell any other plan that consumers desire. So it takes away nothing. If you like your ObamaCare plans, those are still there. It just adds new options and lets you decide: Do you want the ObamaCare option or do you want something else that is affordable? So rather than getting fined by the IRS, you can actually purchase something you and your family can afford.  Now, our friends on the Democratic aisle have been unwilling to look at any option expanding consumer freedom; they just say it won't work. What we know won't work is We know premiums have risen over $5,000 a year. What happens with the consumer freedom amendment? And this is critical. Over the past 2 weeks, the Department of Health and Human Services conducted a study on the impact of the consumer freedom amendment. They concluded, 1, it would expand insurance coverage by 2.2 million people. Our friends on the Democratic aisle are constantly alleging that repealing ObamaCare will reduce coverage. Well, HHS found the consumer freedom amendment expands it by 2.2 million people.[[Page S4181]]  But what does it do to premiums? This is powerful. HHS found that it will reduce premiums by over $7,000 a year. If you are a single mom, if you are a school teacher, if you are a truckdriver, $7,000 a year is a lot of money. It is the difference between making ends meet and not, perhaps. HHS found specifically that for those choosing freedom plans--the less expensive options--premiums would drop $7,260 a year.  But what about those on the exchanges? What about those purchasing plans subject to all of the mandates? HHS found those plans would also drop, they projected by $5,580 a year. So consumers benefit across the board with lower premiums.  This has been a process. At the end of this process, it is not clear what the Senate is going to pass, what is going to bring together and unite the Republican conference because, sadly, the Democrats are not willing to help us provide more consumer freedom, to help us lower premiums, to help us provide relief to the 49ers and 29ers who have been hammered by this bill. But I believe the key to getting this done--and I believe we can and will get to yes. We are not likely to get to yes tonight, but we can and will get to yes. I think the key to it is the consumer freedom amendment, if we are lowering premiums. If Texans, if Montanans, if people across this country are going home and seeing premiums $5,000 a year cheaper with protections for preexisting conditions or $7,000 cheaper if you want a catastrophic plan on a freedom plan, that is a win for everyone. It is a win for conservatives. It is a win for moderates. It should be a win for If Democrats were not engaged in this partisan fight, Democrats ought to be saying that lowering premiums $5,000 or $7,000 is a win for our citizens. That, I believe, will be the key to getting this done.  Let me finally say that there is rhetoric about insurance companies. Do you know who loves ObamaCare? It is insurance companies. Under ObamaCare, the profits of the top 10 insurance companies have doubled. When you have the IRS fining people to force them to purchase their product and driving up premiums so they are unaffordable, ObamaCare effectively sets up a cartel for the large insurance companies.  Consumer freedom puts you, the consumer, in charge of your choices. Instead of the giant insurance companies, instead of the Federal Government, it puts you in charge. Freedom is the key to unifying our conference, and lowering premiums is the key, and I believe we can and will get this done.  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.

13856,topic-id,937,"Mr.President, unfortunately, there is far too much scaremongering that occurs in the political world. But as John Adams famously said: ``Facts are stubborn things.''  My friend from Oregon just described the consumer freedom amendment as ``a bomb going off in healthcare.'' That is interesting rhetoric, but it is disconnected from the actual facts.  Let's talk about what my friend from Oregon neglected to mention or respond to in any way, shape, or form. He said not a single word about HHS finding that the consumer freedom amendment would expand insurance coverage by 2.2 million people. He had not a word to say in response to that. What he did say is that those who might choose freedom plans would be choosing what he called junk insurance.  Well, it is very nice that ObamaCare mandates that every person must buy a full-fledged Cadillac plan with all the coverage in the world. The problem is, there are millions of people who can't afford it. Not only can they not afford it, they get fined by the IRS because they can't afford it. My friend from Oregon said not a word about the 6.5 million people being fined by the IRS, roughly 50 percent of whom make $25,000 a year or less.  It is interesting that Democrats are advocating fining people who make $25,000 a year or less because they can't afford insurance. And what they say is: Look, we are going to fine you until you can afford to buy the full Cadillac plan. Well, you know what, if you are a young woman, you are 28 years old, you are just starting your career, you are making $30,000 a year, you may not be able to afford the full Cadillac plan, but you might like some coverage. You might like catastrophic coverage. So if you get a cold, you break your arm, you cover that out of your health savings account perhaps. But if, God forbid, you get some terrible disease or hit by a truck, you would like to have an insurance policy.  Sadly, our friends the Democrats say that you are out of luck. If you can't pay for the full-fledged Cadillac, you get nothing. They think your choices are junk insurance.  Remember when Barack Obama said that if you like your insurance plan, you can keep it? Well, listen to how the Democrats have moved today. If they don't like your insurance plan, you can't keep it. If they think your plan is junk, you can't keep it, and they are going to fine you through the I think you know better what your family wants.  The consumer freedom amendment doesn't take away a single choice. If you like the ObamaCare plans, they are still on the market with all of those mandates. But the Democrats are terrified of freedom. They are terrified that if people actually had the choice, they might not choose the full Cadillac; they might make a different choice.  But then in the world of scaremongering, my friend from Oregon also said: Well, those on the ObamaCare exchanges would go into a death spiral, would see their premiums spike.  Remember that John Adams quote about facts being stubborn things? Here is something else my friend from Oregon ignored, said nothing about. HHS found that for those on the exchanges, with all the title I mandates, including preexisting conditions, their premiums would drop by over $5,500 a year.  So the question is, Who is more trustworthy, the experts at HHS analyzing what would occur with competition and choices in the marketplace or the rhetoric and scaremongering that sadly is being offered from the other side?  It would be one thing if they were confronting facts, if they were actually addressing real facts; instead, it is nothing but angry rhetoric.  My friend from Oregon described repealing ObamaCare and empowering consumers and lowering premiums as ``wealth care.'' Well, there is an irony in that; in that, 1, roughly half of the people paying the IRS fines are making less than $25,000 a year. It is the Democrats who are fining low-income people.  2, do you know who agrees with the Democrats on this? The insurance companies. Indeed, my friend from Oregon was reading from the insurance companies. Why have the top 10 insurance companies had their profits double? Because of the Democrats' mandate you have to buy their products. Do you know where the Democrats and the insurance companies agree? None of them want premiums to lower.  Of course, the insurance companies don't want more competition, more options, and your premiums going down. They want to stick it to you as much as they can. Sadly, I don't understand why, but the Democrats are standing arm in arm with the insurance companies, saying their profits need to increase even more. I don't know, maybe they cynically believe eventually it will push it to single-payer socialized medicine. I don't know why they do it, but what is wealth care is ObamaCare fattening the insurance companies at the expense of working men and women.  Facts matter, and if our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle want to raise accusations, they need to stay in the realm of reality and deal with actual facts: You want lower premiums, you want more choices, more options, more competition. You want higher premiums, you want fewer choices, less options, less competition. That is what ObamaCare does, and it is why millions of people are hurting and frustrated. It is why today is an important day.  I yield back the remainder of my time.

Hanna was a 21-year-old member of the Cheyenne She lived in Lame Deer, MT, with her 10-month-old son. The last time she was seen alive was the Fourth of July of 2013. After that, she went missing, and 5 days later, her body was found. Hanna was found to have been raped and murdered.  For too long, the stories of missing and murdered American Indian and Alaska Native women have gone unheard. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide was the third leading cause of death among American Indian and Alaska Native women between the ages of 10 and 24 years and the fifth leading cause of death for American Indian and Alaska Native women between 25 and 34 years of age.  According to a study commissioned by the Department of Justice, American Indian women face murder rates that are more than 10 times the national average. Let me repeat that. American Indian women face murder rates 10 times the national average. If this were the case in any other community outside of Native communities, there would be public outcry, but there hasn't been until now. In fact, yesterday the Senate approved my resolution to designate May 5, Hanna Harris's birthday, as a day of remembrance. It will be a day to join together to commemorate the lives of those we lost tragically, like It is a day to validate the pain Tribal communities have felt and feel every day. It will mark a national day of awareness for Native women and girls who have gone missing or have been murdered.  I was joined by 12 of my colleagues in passing this resolution to declare that the tragic loss of Native women and girls is not just an issue, it is an epidemic, and I thank them for their support.  Tomorrow, on Hanna's birthday, I will walk with Melinda Limberhand Harris, Hanna's mother, and with Tribal leadership, as well as members in Lame Deer, MT, who have also lost a mother, a daughter, a sister, or a friend.

13842,topic-id,1333,"Thank you, Mr. History was made on the floor of the Senate Chamber today. I don't think it[[Page S4172]]has ever happened before. Think about this: 50 out of 100 Senators came to the floor with the Vice President of the United States and voted to begin debate on a bill they have never seen--a bill they have never seen--because we don't know what the Republicans are going to offer as the alternative to the Affordable Care  There have been a lot of different versions. Technically, the one that is before us now is the version that passed the House of Representatives, but I think the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, has known from the beginning that has no chance whatsoever. So many Republicans have taken a look at what the House passed and said: We can't vote for that. You have to give us something different. The problem the Senate Republicans ran into is that they couldn't come up with anything better.  They tried. They wrote several different versions, and every time they would write a version of the new Affordable Care Act, it got worse for the American people, and here is what I mean. Under one proposal for the Republicans--not the one before us, but the Senate Republicans--1 million people in my home State of Illinois would have lost their health insurance. There are 12.5 million people in Illinois, and 1 million would have lost their health insurance because of dramatic cutbacks in Medicaid and cutbacks in the premium support that is given to a lot of working families to buy regular health insurance in the health insurance market.  It was so terrible that every time Republicans came up with a Senate proposal, two or two of them would announce: Can't buy it, won't vote for it--and ran away from it.  So Senator McConnell came to the floor today and said: I am begging you, just vote to open debate on a bill that I haven't written yet, and 50 Republican Senators did, and the Vice President broke the tie, the 50-to-50 tie to move forward, and here we are.  Let me start by tossing flowers--and this will probably get them in trouble--to two Republican Senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of They were the only two Republican Senators who had the courage to stand up and say: This is wrong. We shouldn't do this to the American people. They are the only two who are willing to say that we should have done this differently.  There is an interesting thing that happened at the end of this. At the very last moment, the very last vote that was cast was cast by Senator John Everybody knows John has been diagnosed with a serious form of cancer. He made it back from Arizona here to cast his vote, and he asked for 15 minutes after the rollcall to make a speech. I don't think many, if any, Senators left the Democrats and Republicans stuck around to hear his speech after the vote. Can I tell you that is unusual in the Senate? Most of us race for the doors and go up to our offices and watch on television and may catch a piece of this speech and a piece of the other speech, but we sat and listened because of our respect for John  He is my friend. We came from the House of Representatives together many years ago. I served with him in the Senate when we put together a bipartisan group to rewrite the immigration laws for America--four Democrats, four I sat across the table with John for months. We went back and forth through all the provisions on immigration. John even conceded today that he has an interesting temper. There were days when John McCain was Mount Vesuvius, just exploding in every direction, and you had to step back. And there were days when he smothered you with kindness. That is the way he is. We love him for it.  He came today to give a speech that every American should read if you want to understand how a Democratic Senator can stand on the floor and give compliments and praise to a Republican Senator, which I am about to do. Senator McCain said that we have to do something about this country of ours--the political divisions. I will not get the words perfectly, but he said to us: Will you please start ignoring these radio and TV and internet talking heads who want us to fail and make a living by laughing at us? Will you ignore those people? Instead, look to what this institution, the U.Senate, is all about and what we should be doing to solve the problems for the people we represent.  John McCain went on to say: Why don't we have debates on the floor of the Senate anymore?  Do you know what? He is right. We are 7 months into this year's Senate session. We have not had one bill on the floor of the Senate that we have debated and amended--not one. This is a first, and it is in this kind of convoluted reconciliation process where you speed up the amendments.  Think about this. We are amending your healthcare policy that affects you and your family. We are amending how you will buy health insurance as an individual and how your company will buy health insurance for you. We are amending, basically, whether your insurance policy is going to protect your family or not. Listen to how it works.  People propose an amendment, and then we debate it. Do you know how long we debate it? We debate it for 1 minute on both sides. John McCain called us on it today and asked: Why have we reached this point when an issue this important is going through a process that is totally partisan?  You see, the Republicans decided early on that they were not going to invite us to the party; that they were going to write this healthcare bill by themselves, in secret. Senator McConnell picked 13 Republican Senators, and they sat for I don't know how long--months, weeks--and wrote a bill. One of them I mentioned earlier was ultimately rejected by the Republicans themselves. John McCain challenged us and said: For goodness' sake. He has been in the Senate--and I have too--during a time when it was much different. He really begged us, pleaded, and urged us to get back to that time when we worked together on a bipartisan basis to solve problems. John McCain was right. I did not agree with his vote to put us in this position we are in at this moment, but I was encouraged by the way he closed. He turned to Senator McConnell, who was sitting right there, and said to him: Do not count on my vote on final passage. I want to see what we do in this bill. I want to see how we debate this bill.  One Republican Senator like John McCain can make the difference as to whether this process stops and a real bipartisan process starts. Isn't that what the American people expect of us?

Can you believe there was a time in the Senate when we would bring an important measure to the floor on many different issues, and Members would come to the floor--I am not making this up--and actually hand an amendment to the clerk and say: I would like to offer an amendment to the bill. Then we would debate it, and then we would vote on it. Sometimes you won, sometimes you lost, and you moved on to the next amendment. That actually happened on the Senate floor.

The amendments went back and forth, and we ended up seeing bills passed that made a difference in  What we are doing now is a disgrace to this institution, and it does not honor the Senate, its Members, or our Constitution when what is at stake is[[Page S4173]]so important. In looking at some of the provisions that have been brought before us in the Senate's Republican repeal bills to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I do not know how they can do it. I do not know how Senators could go home and say in their home States: A million of you are going to lose your health insurance because of something I just voted for.  Health insurance means a lot to me personally. I have said it on the floor. There was a time in my life when I was a brandnew law student and was married. God sent me and my wife this beautiful little baby. She had some health issues, and we had no health insurance, as I was a law student. We ended up sitting in the charity ward of a local hospital here in Washington, hoping our baby girl would have a good, talented, capable doctor walk through the door and see her. I was not sure because I did not have health insurance. I will never forget that as long as I live, and I thought to myself that it will never happen to me again. I am going to have health insurance no matter what it takes. It meant that much to me, and it means that much to everybody.  There is not a single one of us who does not want the peace of mind of knowing that if we get sick or if someone we love gets sick, he will have access to good hospitals and good doctors. That is what health insurance is all about. As the Republican proposals eliminate health insurance for 60 million, 20 million, 30 million Americans, you ask yourself: How can you do that to this country?  The cuts they make in Medicaid have really educated America about People know about Social They know what that is all about. We all pay into it and wait to receive our Social Security checks when we reach that age. They also know about You have to be 65 years of age. It is pretty good coverage, isn't it? The ones who receive it think it is a pretty good deal to have Medicare coverage when they reach the age of 65, but Medicaid was one of those mystery programs. People were not sure. What does it do? The Medicaid Program in America does the following:  In Illinois, that program takes care of half of the new mothers and their babies. Half of them are paid for by Medicaid--prenatal care to make sure the baby is healthy, the delivery of the baby. Afterward, the mom and baby are taken care of, paid for by This is one out of every two births in  Medicaid also sends provisions--money--to your local school districts. I will bet you did not know that. If your local school district has a special education program--and virtually all of them do--they receive Medicaid to pay for some basics. It pays for counselors for special ed students. Sometimes transportation in a local school district in downstate Illinois or feeding tubes for some severely disabled students are paid for by You may not know that for disabled people, Medicaid is their health insurance. Many of them have no place else to turn.  I mentioned on the floor before that a mother in Champaign, IL, with an autistic child, said: Senator, if it were not for Medicaid, my son would have to go into an institution. I couldn't afford it.  Medicaid is his health insurance.  I have not touched the most expensive part of Medicaid of which you may not know, which is that two out of three people in nursing homes depend on Medicaid to get basic medical care. Medicare is not enough. They need the help of So if it is Mom or Dad or Grandma or Grandpa who is in a nursing home, two out of three of them depend on  The Republican bill to replace the Affordable Care Act says we are going to cut the spending on Medicaid, that 25 to 35 percent will be cut. That is why Governors of both political parties have screamed bloody murder: You cannot do that. You are cutting the Federal contribution to Medicaid in our Who is going to pay for that baby? Who is going to pay for the mom? Who is going to pay the school district? Who is going to pay for the disabled? Who will take care of the folks in nursing homes?  Why did they make that deep of a cut in Medicaid--a program that is so important to so many people? There is the tough part. That deep of a cut was made in Medicaid so Republicans, in their healthcare proposal, could include a tax break for the wealthiest people in America, for health insurance companies, and--get this--for pharmaceutical companies. To give them tax breaks, they had to cut Medicaid coverage for all of the people whom I just described.  Is it any wonder that many Republicans backed away from this? Senator Heller, of Nevada, talked to Governor Sandoval--both Republicans--and said he could not support an early version of the bill because of the deep cuts in  If this is supposed to be an improvement over the Affordable Care Act, which part of it is an improvement? Is it in cutting Medicaid coverage for all of those people, saying that your health insurance policy does not have to cover people with preexisting conditions, raising the cost of healthcare premiums, particularly for people between the ages of 50 and 64, eliminating health insurance for millions? Is that an improvement over the current system? It is not. It is a disaster.  The question is, By the end of this debate, after we have gone through this crazy process of voting up and down quickly and with very little debate, will one more Republican Senator stand up and say unacceptable? Two of them have. If one more will join them, then we can get down to the real business we should face. The real business is being the Senate again with regular order, which means taking the measure to the HELP Senator Murray, of Washington, is the ranking Senator Lamar Alexander is the chairman from I respect him and like him a lot. The two of them ought to have hearings on a bill to change the affordable care system and make it work better, bring down the cost of premiums, and expand health insurance coverage. I think that is what we should be all about.  Now, there is a basic difference in philosophy here. I will close with this, but this is what drives us. Answer the following question, and I can tell you how you are going to vote on this bill:  Do you believe healthcare is a right for every American or do you believe it is a privilege; that if you have enough money and you are lucky enough, you can get it, and if you don't, you go without.  If you answer the question that it is a right, that it should be a right in America, then you have to reject this approach. You cannot take helpless people, some of whom are working hard in two and three jobs at a time and who have no healthcare benefits, and say to them: Our system will not take care of you.  One last point. The irony of that is that if you do not give people health insurance, if you do not give them protection, they still get sick, they still go to the hospital, and they still get care. What happens to the bills they cannot pay? Everybody else pays them. Before the Affordable Care Act, each of us paid $1,000 a year in premiums just to cover for the people who could not afford health insurance.  We think there is a better way. We think Americans should have access to affordable health insurance across the board, and we think we can achieve that if we work together on a bipartisan basis. So I hope one more Republican Senator will join Senators Collins and Murkowski and bring us back to what John McCain described on the floor today to the Senate--of having a real debate about real issues and really caring about the American people.

Mr.Speaker, I also thank the gentleman from Arizona for his words and for his service. It is my honor to call him my fellow marine. As an officer, I did my best just not to get in the way of my enlisted marines, who were doing the real work. Maybe we can bring some of that same ethos here to  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill that honors our post-9/11 veterans and secures their rightful place in our Nation's  Earlier this summer, I had the honor of welcoming a group of American heroes who journeyed from northeast Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., aboard the Old Glory Honor That is one of the truly incredible things we get to do as Members of  Just to watch generation after generation of veterans representing every major conflict since World War II visiting the very memorials that honor their sacrifice, their service, their commitment, their courage in those conflicts was one of the most remarkable experiences of my life.  Just as these veterans visited their respective memorials, so, too, should the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve in the ongoing war on terrorism have a memorial one day to honor their courage, their sacrifice, their commitment. But as the chairman laid out, current law does not allow for the creation for a memorial for the war on terror.  The 1986 Commemorative Works Act requires that monuments in honor of a ``. . . limited military engagement or a unit of an armed force may not be authorized . . . until at least 10 years after the officially designated end of such war or conflict.''  But as we know, this is a conflict unlike many others that have preceded it. This war will have no clear end date, no V Day or V-J Threats continue to rise, so the longest ongoing conflict in our Nation's history continues. After 15 years, after over 6,800 American lives lost, there is still no end in sight.  So this memorial is for the men and women who have died fighting, those who continue to fight, those who are still joining the fight against terrorism.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to take a second to recognize the dedicated members of the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation, many of whom are with us here today, especially Andrew Brennan, George Chewning, Chad Longell, and Matt They have been tireless in their commitment to getting this done. Today we are taking an important step forward, but we still need to get it across the finish line, so I want to recognize their efforts.  I just want to say, Mr.Speaker, like most, I struggle with how to truly honor the men and women whose sacrifices far exceed my own. I was lucky. I had great marines that kept me safe, and we all came home safe. But my hope is that this memorial will serve as not only a way to honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifices, but also as a call to action for us, the living.  I believe that those we will pay tribute to through this memorial didn't risk everything just so we would sit back and praise them for keeping us safe. I would submit to you that the fallen don't want our praise. They want our participation in this incredible experiment in self-government.

And even today, though many of us cannot see each other, we still live with each other in our spirits and in our souls.[[Page H6547]]  These types of memorials matter. For many of us, this generation is not the generation that served together on a base. Many of us actually served from different parts of the world. We dropped our jobs and what we were doing, our school sometimes, to join in, leave our families, leave the comfort and safety of the United States to go and defend what we believed was important to this country and to honor our commitment.  Sometimes it is these types of memorials that are the only thing that actually bring us together. I recently was lucky enough to have my 10-year reunion with the guys from Lima Company, and that is the first time I had seen many men that I had lived with for so long. It was a very inspiring as well as moving, and really consoling thing for me.  I believe that having a memorial of this nature would be extremely important for many men and women to be able to see, to be able to come and maybe not necessarily physically meet with their partners, with their comrades, but to at least be able to spiritually have a place to meet with their comrades, with the people that they served with in arms.

But even more importantly, we begin work on a tangible promise for future generations, a promise animated by the heroic deeds of these veterans, the promise of a coming age of liberty and justice, of peace and tolerance that will surely come.

13884,topic-id,2393,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about the recent impact of prairie fires in northeastern A lot of times when you turn on the national news in the spring, summer, or fall, you might see fires in Colorado, but most of the time those fires are located in western Colorado in the mountains.  We have had some horrible fires in recent years. The past decade has been littered with far too many fires of great consequence to our environment, to families, and to homes--and the damage they have caused. Oftentimes we don't see as much in the news about fires in other parts of the State, including the Eastern Plains of Colorado, the Great Plains and prairies.  At the end of March, Logan and Phillips Counties saw a blaze that burned 32,000 acres, destroying homes, harming cattle and farm operations, and shutting down a key interstate corridor. To put 32,000 acres into perspective, in 2016, the largest fire in Colorado was the Beaver Creek fire near[[Page S2764]]Walden, burning tens of thousands of acres over the course of 3 months. The fire burned about 38,000 acres. The fire burning 32,000 acres in northeastern Colorado took only about 24 hours of time. So we had 38,000 acres burn in 3 months, and 32,000 acres in northeastern Colorado burned in 24 hours. In both cases, these were incredibly dangerous situations to land, people, and those around them.  These images from the Denver Post paint a frightening picture of the devastation the area faced. We can look at these pictures here. You can see what happened with the dirt, debris, smoke, and weather that was created by the fire, and you can see the damage and what happened. You can see the damage to property here.  I want to go back to the earlier picture and talk about some of the other impacts we saw. You can see the firemen from eastern Colorado working to protect property, trying to stop the fire before it reached the homestead.  You can see someone with a tractor, and they are trying to disc up the ground, trying to create a firebreak. People from around eastern Colorado, northeastern Colorado were getting into their tractors, getting their tillage equipment, their chisels, discs, and sweeps to try to break up the ground to create a firebreak so that maybe they could stop the fire. I commend the first responders for containing this fire and preventing any loss of life while also preventing other fire hotspots from breaking out into larger, devastating blazes because of the work they did.  In the middle of these fires, I remember talking to a county commissioner from Logan County, and he described the situation where they had tried to create a firebreak with their road graders and the farmers in the field trying to disc up the ground to stop the fire from moving.  I remember vividly when the county commissioner told me that at a certain time of the day he had to make a phone call that he would never forget in his life. He called the county commissioners from the neighboring county and said that the fire was moving that way. He said: Hey, I want you to know, Logan County is unable to stop the fire. It is coming your way. I am sorry; it is in your hands now.  Imagine that phone call. This horrible thing that has happened in your county is also spreading to the next county, and you can't do anything about it, despite the incredible efforts and acts of heroism to try to stop it.  Fire departments from across Colorado came to northeastern Colorado in that part of the State to stand alongside local firefighters to get this fire under control. Dozens of agencies and departments responded.  Being from Yuma County, south of where this fire took place, I know how alarming and unforgiving these fast-moving prairie fires can be on the farmers, ranchers, and communities in their path. I fought prairie fires as well in northeastern Colorado and know how fast they move and how indiscriminate they are in their destruction.  I also know the challenges people now face in Phillips and Logan Counties as they try to recover in the spring, but I can confidently say that the community is recovering. According to local agronomist, Dave Gibson:       Within six days of the fire, 85 percent of the cropland was      planted with oats to prevent soil erosion with neighbors      volunteering to help and donate. It was an amazing effort.  My office has been in communication with State and Federal officials, along with those impacted, to ensure we are doing everything possible to assist in this process.  Those from northeastern Colorado are dependent upon agriculture for their way of life. Two-thirds of Colorado's agricultural production comes from the South Platte River valley, those areas considered to be in northeastern I have spoken on the Senate floor about the difficult times these farmers are facing outside of the context of national disasters. When times are already tough, seeing your land and cattle operation burned up in a prairie fire makes things even worse. It is during these challenging times in agriculture, whether it is the impact of fire or low commodity prices, that we are reminded of the need for effective leadership.  I was pleased this last week when the Chamber came together in a bipartisan fashion to confirm Governor Sonny Perdue of Georgia as our Secretary of Senators on both sides of the aisle recognized that supporting our Nation's farmers and ranchers is not a partisan issue.  It is my hope that we can support Secretary Perdue to expeditiously confirm the rest of his team at USDA because we need it in agriculture. Whether it is the FSA or a crop insurance issue as a result of a fire or a situation relating to trade and how we are going to address low commodity prices, the Secretary of Agriculture needs a team around him. Congress must work with Secretary Perdue to address this crisis in agriculture.  In Colorado, we have seen net farm incomes drop 80 percent since the record highs of 2011. If you look at this headline, this was in the Wall Street Journal some weeks ago. The headline says: ``The Next American Farm Bust Is Upon Us.'' That is because if you look at just the State of Colorado alone, there has been a drop of 80 percent in farm income from the record highs of 2011. That is net farm income down 80 percent.  I believe this Congress needs to act with a four-pronged approach.  First, we need a long-term farm policy in place. With the farm bill expiring in September of 2018, Congress must begin negotiating about how we are going to move forward in a responsible fashion. I commend the Senate and House Agriculture Committees for holding hearings on the next farm bill, and I look forward to conducting our own roundtables and listening sessions to talk about and to learn about and to listen to how we can make a difference. Federal policy certainty with a long-term farm policy is essential for farmers and ranchers.  The second thing we must do is to provide regulatory relief. We have already repealed about $85 billion worth of regulations over the last 3 months. That is an incredible feat to relieve the American economy from the harm and pressure of $85 billion worth of regulatory overreach. By relieving the American business community of that $85 billion worth of regulations and relieving the American family of that pressure as well, it also means we have been able to reduce paperwork by 54 million hours.  Imagine that: $85 billion worth of regulatory reductions means there is 54 million hours of paperwork that no longer has to be completed. Instead, that money, time, and effort can be invested in growing opportunities and following up on sales leads and making that money work for the business and family instead of just for the government.  When it comes to agriculture, the regulatory relief to address this next American farm crisis--some of that regulatory relief, the $85 billion, includes measures such as repealing the Bureau of Land Management 2.0 rule or finally getting the waters of the United States regulation out of the way. That is the kind of regulatory relief we have to continue to pursue.  To those who may not know what waters of the United States regulation did, let's take an example in Under the EPA's own study, two-thirds of Colorado waterways are described or defined as intermittent flow. Intermittent flow means they don't have water in them year-round. But according to the government, they would be considered navigable waterways. I don't know how you get anything to float down a dry river, but apparently the EPA can. That $85 billion of regulatory relief includes stopping the waters of the United States rule. We have to continue to peel back the burdensome regulations on American agriculture.  The third thing we have to address is access to finance. Finance is critical to any farmer. There is an old joke, an old saying that if you go out to a farmer--and they may know this already--and ask: How do you make a small fortune in agriculture? The answer is that you start with a large one. I think it is time we fixed that.  Wouldn't it be nice if people weren't just relying on the bank, but they could actually produce enough money to help them into the future, to help them thrive, prosper, grow, and bring in new generations of family? During difficult economic times, when we are facing incredible challenges and low commodity prices, we do need to have[[Page S2765]]access to financing. Whether it is through the community bank or banks on Wall Street or the Farm Credit Union or farm credit system, farmers, ranchers, and those in agriculture need access to financing to get through this difficult time.  That production loan, that operating loan is how they make it from season to season, harvest to harvest, and planting to planting to make sure they have the ability to stay on the farm. Right now we have a system that I am worried about--a financial regulatory system in place that perhaps a farmer walks into a bank one day, a bank they have been doing business with for 100 years, and they have never missed a payment, but all of a sudden, based on some Washington, DC, formulary, they can no longer get the loan they need to keep them into the next year, even though that bank in their hometown on Main Street knows they will be able to make that payment.  What we have created is a system and financial regulations that are going to make it impossible for some of these farmers to work out the crisis that is upon them. I sent a letter 2 weeks ago to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, requesting a review of all regulations potentially inhibiting rural access to finance.  The fourth thing we have to get right is trade opportunity for American agriculture. With corn and wheat prices near 10-year lows, the most obvious solution is to open up more international markets for agriculture to continue to look for new opportunities to export American agricultural products overseas. The price of commodities for a bushel of corn is about the same price today as it was back when I was born in 1974. Opening up trade opportunities, opening new markets will give us the value-added opportunity to help get more for that bushel of corn.  Some of the greatest opportunities lie in Asia--50 percent of global population, 50 percent of GDP in the near future. Those are markets we have to open up in U.agriculture. Those are markets that already have access in many cases to U.markets, but if we want to sell products there, sometimes we are hit with tariffs. That is not fair. We have to make sure we are reducing the tariffs we face when we go into their markets because they seem to have unfettered access into ours much of the time.  Those are all measures we can address. The four things are long-term farm policies, regulatory relief, access to financing, trade opportunities that work for the American farmers and ranchers.  Those recent fires in northeast Colorado, as well as fires in past years in Colorado and across the West, are another reminder of the need to address wildfire borrowing. Wildfire borrowing is a process where the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service spends money that it has budgeted for the fires. It runs out of money because it didn't budget enough money to fight the fires, and it turns around and starts cannibalizing other areas of spending that could actually have been used to help reduce the next forest fire. We have to end the practice of fire borrowing, and we have to work with Secretary Perdue as head of the U.Forest Service within the Department of Agriculture to end wildfire borrowing and to improve forest and land management to prevent these uncontrollable fires that we have seen.  Supporting those impacted by fires, whether it is in the forest or around the prairie, is something we should all be able to get behind. In Logan and Phillips Counties, neighbors banded together. They worked to recover and rebuild from the devastation shown on these images. It has happened for generations in eastern Colorado and across this country. When there is a crisis, when there is a tragedy, neighbors help their neighbors. You can see it in these pictures. But we can also help our neighbors here in Washington, DC, and across our country's vast farmlands by doing what is right in addressing these challenges. Just as Logan County and Phillips County banded together, we should band together with American agriculture.  It is my hope that Congress can learn from the lessons taught in the aftermath of these difficult situations to come together, support rural communities, support agriculture, and make sure we support our fire response efforts, importantly, to prevent that next catastrophic fire.

Denver architect William Bowman designed the classical revival-style courthouse, and its original courtrooms remain intact. This anniversary recognizes the rich history in northern Colorado and is a reminder of Colorado's unique past.  Greeley, CO is named after Horace Greeley, one of the first journalists to document his experience in the Wild Horace came to Colorado during the Pikes Peak Gold Rush of 1859 and encouraged his fellow Americans to ``Go West, young man, and grow up in this country.'' Horace's words helped put Greeley on the map and ultimately established the city as an important part of American history. Soon after Horace explored northern Colorado, the Colorado Legislature recognized Weld County as one of the first 17 counties in the Colorado territory.  The Weld County Courthouse was one of the first buildings constructed in The first courthouse, built in 1861, served as a meeting place for court proceedings and business matters. During this period, the courthouse was only a one-room log cabin located near Platteville, The courthouse moved locations four times before the final courthouse opened for business in 1917.

13940,topic-id,586,"Mr.President, May is National Foster Care I thank my colleagues for unanimously supporting the resolution recognizing May as National Foster Care  National Foster Care Month has been recognized for over 20 years as a time we all celebrate the voices of foster youth and bring awareness to the challenges these young people face. During this month, organizations in Iowa--and, for that matter, all across the country--have been working to support and to recognize the young people who are in foster care.  Nationally, there are over 425,000 children in foster care. In Iowa alone, almost 4,000 kids entered foster care in 2015, the last year for statistics. I salute all of those who work tirelessly to support these children. This includes a lot of different groups but particularly foster parents, who open their hearts and homes to children who need this vital support. The group also includes social workers, advocates, and alumni of the foster care system who, as young people, have gone through a lot. They are there to inform lawmakers and the public, and they are there to fight to secure better outcomes for kids in care.  As stated in our resolution, Congress must continue to work toward real solutions for these children, who often face trauma, abuse, and neglect, both before and after they are removed from their parents' care. We must work to ensure that all children, no matter their circumstances, have a permanent, loving home and consistent, caring adults in their lives.  With legislation such as the Fostering Connections Act, passed in 2008, and the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act, passed in 2011, we have made some progress. These laws provided new investments and new services to improve the outcomes for children in the foster care system.  Even after all that, our work is not done. Over 20,000 young people aged out of the foster care system in 2015, with no legal permanent connection to any family. This impacts their ability to pursue higher education, to find employment and stable housing, and, most importantly, to prepare for the future.  While in care, children experience an average of three different placements; 65 percent of the kids in foster care change schools seven or more times. We see a great amount of instability and resulting insecurity when this is what happens in the life of somebody in foster care. This constant uncertainty compounds the trauma of neglect and of abuse and makes it hard for these kids to make connections to their communities.  Through my work in the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, I have had the opportunity to hear firsthand what these young people in foster care need. They need love, they need support, they need safety and permanency, and they need a family. Those last two are the first words I ever heard from kids in foster care when I first took time 25 years ago to listen to some of them. They had been shunted from one home to another home over a period of time. They said: We would like to have a mom and dad; we would like to have a home. That is what this movement is all about.  Moving forward, Congress must continue to work to find better solutions and secure better outcomes for our young people in foster care.  Once again, I thank all of my colleagues for supporting this resolution. It is important that this month--and, for that matter, all year long--we continue to support the goals of National Foster Care                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3179-2.txt,457,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,July
13763,topic-id,1674,"Mr.President, today I wish to make some remarks paying tribute to a former staff member of mine for whom I have the highest opinion. However, before I begin those remarks, I should take a moment to address the elephant in the room.  Mr.President, today the majority leader revealed a revised discussion draft for legislation to repeal and replace Let me say at the outset that this bill isn't perfect. There are some things in the bill that, given my preferences, I would do very differently. But one thing I have learned in my 40 years in this Senate is that people who demand purity and perfection when it comes to legislation usually end up disappointed and rarely accomplish anything productive. That is particularly true when we are talking about complex policy matters.  The next vote on this legislation will presumably be whether to let the Senate proceed to the bill. Regardless of any of the positions of my colleagues on this particular draft, if they support the larger effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare, they should at the very least want to have a debate on this bill. Under the rules, we will have an open amendment process. Members will get a chance to make their preferences known and to have the Senate vote on them. Taking that opportunity is the very least we can do.  Keep in mind, virtually every Republican in this body has supported the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare more or less since the day it was signed into law. We have all made promises to our constituents along those lines. This legislation, while far from perfect, would fulfill the vast majority of those promises.  If we pass up this opportunity, we are looking at further collapse of our health insurance markets, which means dramatically higher premiums and even fewer healthcare options for our constituents. Make no mistake, while some are talking about a bipartisan solution to prop up markets in the event this bill fails, there is no magic elixir or silver bullet that will make that an easy proposition.  I have to think that at the end of the day, if we fail to take action to fulfill the promises we have all made, we will have to answer to the American people for the missed opportunity and the chaos that will almost certainly follow. I hope all of my colleagues will keep that in mind.                     Tribute to Everett Eissenstat  Mr.President, I wish to take this time to pay tribute to a very dear and noble colleague of mine, Everett For the past 6 years, Everett has served as my chief international trade counsel on the Senate Finance Committee--a very important position. He has had a long and distinguished career in public service, obtaining and utilizing what is really an unparalleled level of knowledge and expertise about our Nation's trade policy. In fact, I think it is safe to say that very few, if any, individuals have had as great an impact on the current state of U.trade law as Everett His public service will continue, as he has recently gone on to serve as the Deputy Director of the National Economic  Everett received his juris doctorate at the University of Oklahoma, where he graduated cum laude and served as research editor of the Oklahoma Law He also holds a master's degree in Latin American studies from the University of Texas at Austin and a bachelor's degree in political science and Spanish from Oklahoma State With diverse alma maters like that, some might wonder how Everett decides what colors to wear on college football But those of my colleagues who know Everett will correctly guess that he has, since his undergraduate days, remained a devoted fan of his beloved  After obtaining his law degree, Everett went to work for Dixon and Dixon in Dallas, Later, he worked as Congressman Jim Kolbe's legislative director and, shortly thereafter, he became the international trade counsel for the Senate Finance Committee for Senator Grassley, who was then the lead Republican on the committee.  Everett was a key staffer in the effort to draft and pass the Trade Act of 2002, which renewed trade promotion authority for the first time in 8 years. This was a major update to our Nation's trade laws and made possible the completion and passage of trade agreements with Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, Colombia, South Korea, Panama, as well as the countries of the CAFTA-DR agreement; namely, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican  Everett then helped implement a number of these agreements when he served as Assistant U.Trade Representative for the Western Hemisphere, a position he held from 2006 through 2010.  After recognizing his fine work, I asked Everett to return to the Finance Committee in January of 2011 to once again serve as chief international trade counsel, and he continued to distinguish himself as one of the most knowledgeable and dedicated trade lawyers in the country.  Very early in his second tenure at the Finance Committee, he helped shepherd our free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea through the In 2015, he was the key staffer in the effort to draft, introduce, and pass the bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act, which, among other things, once again renewed trade promotion authority after another 8-year gap, and updated our Nation's trade negotiating objectives for the 21st century.  At about the same time, Congress also passed legislation to update our customs enforcement and facilitation laws, as well as a bill to reauthorize some important trade preferences.  All of these successes were the culmination of years of hard work and represent the most ambitious legislative agenda on trade in recent history, and Everett was an indispensable part of it all.  With his work on passage of those laws in 2015, his work on the prior TPA statute in 2002, and his efforts at USTR, Everett has been a key player in the development and facilitation of a generation of U.trade law. That is no small feat. More than anyone I have known, Everett is committed both to improving opportunities for Americans abroad and to ensuring an increasingly free-trade economy around the world. He is a true believer in free trade and the benefits free trade brings to our economy.  I am not the only Senator who will miss Everett's knowledge and expertise. Indeed, during his time here, he was an asset to the entire But, more than that, I will miss him personally: his tireless work ethic, his calm and thoughtful demeanor, and his cheerful disposition, even when he is breaking bad news or telling Senators things they may not want to hear.  While I am sad to see him go, it is comforting to know that Everett is continuing to serve our country and will keep advancing pro-growth economic policies at the National Economic His expertise and wisdom are more important now than ever before, with numerous trade possibilities on the immediate horizon.  As I have said before, and I imagine I will say many times again, Everett is very, very good at what he does. The administration and the country are lucky to have such an important asset. I look forward to seeing his successes in this new chapter of his career, though it goes without saying that he leaves behind some very big shoes to fill. I count myself lucky to have been the beneficiary of Everett's knowledge and advice for several years.[[Page S3973]]  I want to wish Everett, his wonderful wife Janet, and their sons Jacob and Alex the very best in this and any other future endeavors. Everett has a dedicated family, and I understand that they are here today; that Everett's wife and his one son were outside here just a short time ago. I am quite certain they are just as proud of Everett as I am.  I have worked with a lot of people in the U.I have had a lot of staff people, and all of them have been, almost to a person, very, very good. I have appreciated all of them, and I know that we wouldn't be nearly as good without our staffs whispering in our ears, preparing the documents that we put into the Record, working with us to help us improve our abilities to put forth our agendas.  I want my colleagues to know that Everett Eissenstat has been one of the all-time great staff people on Capitol I hesitate to even call him a staff person because he has the kind of reputation that goes far beyond being a staffer on Capitol He is one of the great leaders in this country, and I just want him to know how much I personally appreciate him. I want his wife to know how much I appreciate her and him; and his children--I want them to know what a great father they have.  Everett is a great, great man, and I am really happy to have said a few nice words about him on the floor. No matter what I say, it is not enough to explain what a truly great individual Everett Eissenstat really is.  I hope we can get other good staff people like Everett to help us on both sides. We are willing to work with both sides, willing to bring us together to do the things we know are important for this country and its future. Everett is one of those. I am going to miss him terribly. On the other hand, I know that where he is now is very important, and he will do the job as well as anybody alive.  I just want to pay tribute to him and his wife and his son who is here today, and tell him how much we all love and appreciate him.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

13841,topic-id,1024,"Mr.President, I rise today to once again remind my Senate colleagues what is at stake with the procedural vote that took place today.  The Senate voted on the motion to proceed to the House-passed budget reconciliation bill. The Senate will now start working in earnest to consider and, hopefully, pass legislation that would repeal and replace ObamaCare with a 2-year transition period, or other, specific replacement policies.  That is a complicated undertaking to say the least. However, the first vote on the motion to proceed was relatively simple. While pundits and talking heads have already analyzed this particular vote to death, all of the talk boils down to a single question: Do Republicans want to repeal and replace ObamaCare?  I don't want to belittle or discredit the concerns some of my colleagues have raised about the various legislative proposals that are out there. However, we won't be voting on any particular policy or proposal.  On the contrary, the vote was simply to determine whether the Senate is actually going to consider the budget reconciliation bill. Members were not voting for or against any particular healthcare proposal; they were simply voting on whether the Senate will actually debate any such measure.  That being the case, the vote was a simple one. Anyone who supports the larger effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare should be willing to at least debate the various proposals that have been put forward.  That is the very definition of a no-brainer.  The final pieces of ObamaCare were signed into law in March 2010, more than 7 years ago. Since then, the law has been one of the key focal points of legislative and political debate and discourse nationwide. Very few topics in our Nation's history have been the subject of more public debate and fierce disagreement.  After all this time, one thing is very clear: ObamaCare has failed the American people.  The vast majority of Americans are dissatisfied with the healthcare status quo. These people want answers from Congress that will bring down their healthcare costs, reduce their tax burdens, and put them back in charge of their own healthcare. For more than 7 years now, virtually every Republican in Congress has been promising to provide those solutions.  We have never been closer to making good on those promises than we are right now with a Republican President ready to take action to support congressional efforts to repeal and replace this unworkable law.  Make no mistake, none of the major proposals that have been put forward are perfect. In fact, in my personal view, they are all far from perfect. But, at the end of the day, any bill--particularly a bill as wide and sweeping as one that addresses a large portion of our healthcare system--that is ``perfect'' in the eyes of one Senator is likely fatally flawed in the eyes of 99 others.  Translation: When it comes to legislating successfully, the word ``perfect'' shouldn't be in anyone's vocabulary.  Like any aspect of governing, drafting and passing important legislation is about compromise and prioritization. It is about recognizing which fights need to be fought now and which ones can wait for another day.  I have been here a while. In that time, I have noticed a few things.  Some who are elected to this Chamber would rather fight the good ideological fight for legislative purity than get the majority of what they want--but not everything--through compromise. These people tend to claim that even the most embarrassing legislative losses are victories, so long as they can say that they went down swinging.  Now, don't get me wrong; speaking in terms of advocating good policy I have never been one to back down from a fight. In fact, I have battled some of the most revered and admired Senators in our Nation's history right here on the Senate floor.  One reason I think I have developed a reputation as an effective legislator is I don't believe that fighting for a cause is an end unto itself. Fights are only meaningful if there is an objective in mind. While I am no mathematician, I believe getting 60, 70, or 80 percent of what you want out of a bill is better than getting nothing, even if, on the way to getting nothing, you have fought a valiant fight for that perfect--yet ultimately unattainable--outcome.  The fight to repeal ObamaCare, at least from where I have been standing, has always had an objective in mind. That objective, of course, has been to actually repeal  We have fought for that objective for more than 7 years. Now, we find ourselves on the cusp of being able to take major steps toward that larger goal.  No, we don't have a perfect bill to vote on. However, the fact remains that we are close to being able to pass legislation that would accomplish the majority of our goals and keep most of the promises we have all made to repeal and replace  Before we can do any of that, we need to at least get a chance to consider and debate the matter on the floor. That is what this afternoon's vote was to determine: whether we are committed enough to this effort to at least take that step.  I remind my Republican colleagues that, when the ObamaCare reconciliation bill was brought up for debate in 2010, all of our friends on the other side, who were present at the time, except for one Member, voted in favor of the motion to proceed. They supported their leader. Leader McConnell is owed the same loyalty.  Any Senator who has fought with us to undo the damage caused by ObamaCare should be willing, at the very, very least, to take that step and allow the floor debate to actually happen.  I hope we all will. Toward that end, I urged my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to proceed to the House-passed reconciliation bill to allow the Senate to begin debate on repealing and replacing  The PRESIDING Who yields time?

13766,topic-id,1905,"That is I am from the better I just have to tell you.  Mr.President, I am always perplexed when the opposition party, the Republican Party, says: We are the party of business. We are the party that believes that government should function more like a business. We are the party that believes that we have to make the tough decisions, we have to do the work that needs to get done, and we have to do it in a timely fashion.  OK, I get that. There is not a corporate board in America confronted with the challenge that we have in healthcare that would not shore up the[[Page S3974]]cost-saving payments. When you look at those of us who have served on corporate boards, those of us who have spent some time in the private sector, and, certainly, those of us who have been county officials or State officials, where we have actually had to make decisions, we look at how you make those decisions. The first thing you do is to try to make sure that while you are deliberating and while you are making decisions, you don't create market disruption. You don't do the things that create more uncertainty. You stabilize what you can, triage what you can, and then take a look at what the advantages are and what the experience you can bring to bear is to resolve bigger, broader, and more systemic issues.  If we look today at where we are right now with our constituents or our customers, if we can put it in a business sense, our customers are Americans and American families. Guess what. As for those of us who have been in our States and who have spent time looking at healthcare, talking to people about healthcare, talking to providers about healthcare, I will tell you that there are two emotions they have. They are mad, and they are scared. They are probably more scared than mad because under the bills that are being deliberated here, the Republican healthcare bills, they don't know if they can continue to keep their disabled children at home with them. They don't know if they can continue to provide for their parents in a nursing home. They don't know if their rural hospital is going to be able to survive the kinds of reductions in payments that are anticipated under this bill.  Today in North Dakota, $250 million is the value of Medicaid expansion. I have institutions in North Dakota, providers in North Dakota that are operating on razor-thin margins. They can't make ends meet without making sure that they keep that amount of uncompensated care greatly reduced. They need the cash flow.  If we raise uncompensated care, two things will happen. The first thing that will happen under this bill is that they will have a hit to their bottom line. The second and obvious consequence of that is that, when they negotiate with the private insurance market on what those next payments are going to be, they are going to ask for more money to put back on the private insurance market the cost of uncompensated care.  Let's also take a look at the growing issue in this country of opioids. I have a facility in southwestern North Their new hospital anticipates that Medicaid is going to be about 14 to 17 percent of the billings they have. As they are trying to respond--as responsible healthcare providers would--to the opioid crisis, they are looking at converting the old hospital into a long-term facility, a facility where people can go and get healthcare when they are addicted.  They anticipate that the facility will have to rely on about 60 to 70 percent Medicaid reimbursement. When people tell you that these issues aren't intertwined, that the population that is going to need assistance in recovery from addiction is not our Medicaid population, they are wrong. Every person who has looked at this has come to the same conclusion.  The other thing I am going to tell you about the people whom I talked to is that most of them have never been involved in politics. They are not partisans. They don't really even care about politics, but they wonder why they are caught up in this tidal wave of political rhetoric when people are scaring them about whether they are going to have health insurance. They are wondering: What kind of responsible leaders would ever do that? What kind of responsible leaders would not do what they could today to provide some assurances in the near term that the health insurance is going to be available, that their Medicaid is going to be available, and that they are going to be able to take care of their kids?  I am telling you that, instead of continuing to release bad bill after bad bill, I hope the Republicans will come and honestly take us at our word. We stand ready to work with Republicans on a truly bipartisan bill that is going to deliver quality healthcare to North Dakotans and quality healthcare to the people of this country.  People think bipartisanship can't happen. That is not true. Yesterday I held a press conference on a completely separate issue that involves clean coal. Standing side by side when we announced that bill, we had Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, one of the most vocal advocates for aggressive action on climate, and Senators Barrasso, Capito, and me, the most vocal advocates in support of coal. We all stood together introducing this bill because we wanted to offer a real solution on 45We wanted to find out where that lane is where we can all coexist and solve the problems of the American people.  It is not impossible to do this. It is not impossible if we park the partisanship, if we park the ideology, and if we start examining what the true problems and the true issues with our healthcare system are.  The answer is usually in the middle. Has Medicaid worked to get more people with chronic conditions, to manage care, and to lower costs? The answer is yes. Are there too many people on Medicaid? The answer is yes.  We need to grow our economy. We need to help people move them into a workplace where they have workplace insurance. Instead of talking about how we are going to grow the economy, instead of talking about how we are going to raise wages, instead of talking about how we are going to help people get set, we are talking about shifting the responsibility of the sickest among us, shifting that responsibility to the States and back to the patients.  Just 2 weeks ago, I joined 15 of my colleagues trying to bring some commonsense bills forward. I thought we made a great case. We have been challenged: You really don't want to work with us.  That is all facade. That is not true. We are back here again, saying: Please, please, work with us. Let's just for a moment do what Senator McConnell suggested we do. Let's take care of what is happening with the 2018 plan year. Let's remove the uncertainty as we are looking at premiums going up and skyrocketing because of that uncertainty. Let's remove that uncertainty and solve this problem.  That is why I am supporting my colleague Senator Shaheen's legislation that makes cost-sharing payments permanent and increases the eligibility and generosity for that benefit.  I also cosponsored Senator Carper and Senator Kaine's bill to make the reinsurance program for the individual marketplace permanent and to devote resources to outreach and enrollment efforts. As a result, it would encourage insurance companies to offer more plans in a greater number of markets, improving competition, and driving down costs.  Isn't that what we all want? Everyone can agree that is the consequence of this legislation.  Also, earlier this week I introduced another commonsense bill--the Addressing Affordability for More Americans That helps make healthcare more affordable for middle-class families. What does that mean? We know that right now on the exchanges--when we look at subsidization of families on the exchange--we have what we call a cliff event. You are either in or you are out, and there is no stepdown. Many of our middle-class families could experience a joyous event called a pay raise, only to find out that the pay raise evaporates because they lose some of the tax advantages that they received because they bought health insurance on a private exchange.  Why don't we glide that out? The same is true, actually, for Is there an opportunity to take that slide out, or that glide out, and moving more people into the workplace who are on Medicaid?  I share concerns that people have that the subsidization on both Medicaid and on the individual marketplace may result in people not taking economic opportunities that are available to them because, in the long run, it doesn't pencil out, given where they will be with healthcare. Let's take that incentive out. Let's work together. Let's solve that problem.  I think our bill is the starting point. If people have a better idea on how to address that concern, I stand willing and ready to make that work. I want to say that we are here saying: Let's work together. We are here saying: We do not believe that, on this side of the aisle, we have all the answers.  Guess what. I don't believe that, on that side of the aisle, they have all the[[Page S3975]]answers. I believe we could learn an incredible amount from a hearing with a bipartisan group of Governors who are going to be responsible. They are going to get this heaped into their lap if this passes. That is why you see a bipartisan group of Governors saying: You know what, keep it, because that is not a path forward.  If you want to hear some good ideas, I think we could hear some great ideas from the corporate America that has become self-insured--as they look at wellness programs, as they look at using big data metrics to help keep their population healthier and drive down costs, and as they negotiate for better deals with providers.  There are hundreds of ideas out there. There are hundreds of opportunities to learn more before we take this step, but what is the process we are in? The process we are in is this: Don't confuse me with the facts. Don't confuse me with a new idea. Don't confuse me because, politically, we have to do this.  Do you know what? No one, politically, has to do this. What we have been sent here to do is not to fulfill political promises. We have been sent here to legislate in the best interest of the American people and the people of our That is our job--not to represent a partisan political idea. Let's do it.  Let's bring in a whole lot of ideas, and let's park the ideology at the door. Everybody, park the ideology at the door. As so many people on the other side of the aisle would say, let's start acting in a business, yeoman-like manner and start working through these problems.  We have to do what Senator Shaheen has suggested, and that is to buy some time by making sure that we don't disrupt the marketplace today.  With that, I yield the floor.

13774,topic-id,900,"Mr.President, I would like to associate myself with the comments from the former Governor and now Senator from the great State of New  It is not enough to say the system is failing. It is not enough to come here and say: We can fix it if you just agree to vote the way we are voting. If you just agree, you can present any amendments you want. You can do whatever you want.  We don't even have a CBO score on this legislation. We don't know what is in this legislation. There have been no hearings so that people on both sides of the aisle can ask questions and say: What does this mean for a family on traditional Medicaid who has to rely on this to keep custody of their kids? And by the way, what does it mean if, as a result of losing their Medicaid coverage, those children are no longer able to stay at home and they become foster children because it is the only way they can get healthcare? What does it mean for those families about whom we all think we ought to have a real discussion, young people, young families who have excellent health, how they might have been disadvantaged on the exchange? What do we need to do for them? Maybe they were doing better economically than a lot of folks until they hit the cliff.  That is why I want to see my bill debated, because it can, in fact, offer opportunity. Every time we talk about this, what we hear about is how much it would cost. Well, the bottom line is that if all you do is shift the burden of these costs without any discussions with Governors, with private payers, with corporate America that is self-insured--if all we are doing is shifting costs and saying ``It is now your problem,'' we are not doing our job.  If you look at the Rand Corporation study, 12 percent of the population of this country has five or more chronic diseases. As a result of those unmanaged--typically unmanaged chronic diseases, what you will see is they incur 40 percent of the cost. Is that a problem? The answer is yes, that is a problem. We need to figure out how we can better manage chronic disease.  A great friend of mine, a guy named Richie Carmona, who once was the Surgeon General of this country, used to say--and I think it is true--70 percent of all healthcare costs are related to chronic disease, most of which is preventible. Where in any of these bills are we talking about prevention? Where are we talking about wellness? Where are we talking about bending the healthcare curve? We are only dumping and running with these bills. We are not doing our job, and as a result, we are frightening people in this country. We are frightening the elderly. We are frightening people who say: Right now, I can afford my health insurance; I am on an exchange. But when we change the ratio from 1-to-3 to 1-to-5 and reduce the amount of subsidies, then 30, 40, 50 percent of their disposable income will be used to pay for health insurance. That is the thing you are not hearing here.  So we have to come together. We have to come together with the fundamental questions of what is wrong with not just the Affordable Care Act but what is wrong with healthcare and how we fix it and how we change outcomes. We can't do that if we don't work together. This is a body that is divided 48 to 52. How do you come together if you don't come to the middle, if you don't come to the middle to compromise? You don't.  At the end of the day, we have not met our deepest obligation, which is to speak for those who are the least fortunate among us. We have not met our obligation to govern this country in a way that would make our Founding Fathers proud, to make our citizens proud, and that can advance this idea that the U.Congress can get something done in the United States of America--instead of partisan rancor.  We hold out the hope that we will at one point be able to debate these ideas that we presented. We hold out the hope that we will, in fact, meet somewhere to arrive at a better plan for the delivery of healthcare in this country.  I just want to close with one thought. There is not one organized healthcare group or advocacy group in my State that supports the Republican healthcare plan, so as we are looking at judgment on that plan, don't take my word for it. Take the medical associations' word for it, take the hospital associations' word for it, take AARP's word for it, take the consortium of large hospitals in my State, which urged a ``no'' vote on this legislation, take the disabled children's advocacy groups' word for it. This is not a path forward, but we are big enough people and good enough leaders that we can forge a path forward if we just find the will to do it.  I yield the floor.

I think there is an opportunity to use that information to advance the investigation and to continue to expose the participation of backpage, not just as a billboard or as a want ad but as a knowing participant in the trafficking of children--not just in our country but globally.  I thank the chairman.                               FUTURE Act  Mr.President, today I am joined by my colleagues from West Virginia and Rhode We are kind of a motley group. We are talking about something that has brought us together with a level of excitement and bipartisanship. I would like to say that it is not just bipartisanship but really coming across the ideological barriers we frequently experience here to try and talk about an issue that is near and dear to our hearts, which is maintaining an opportunity for our coal miners and our coal industry to continue to do what they have done for generations--and that is to produce electricity that fuels this economy in the United States of America--but also recognizing that regulatory certainty is one of the key values we need to establish. In order to provide that certainty, we need to address concerns of other Members of our caucus who have in no small measure a lot of concern about what is happening with CO2 emissions and what those emissions are doing environmentally.  I want to just kind of introduce this concept. Back in 2008, we passed something called 45Q, which was a provision that would allow for tax credits similar to what we have for wind and solar. Wind credits are production tax credits, and solar credits are investment tax credits. To provide for tax credits, $10 and $20--$10 if you are injecting into a formation or you are enhancing oil recovery, $20 if you are injecting into a geographic formation to store the carbons as CO2--those credits have proved to be, albeit used, but somewhat anemic to jump-start the technology, to jump-start the opportunity to see wholesale carbon sequestration.  We also know that since 2008, we have seen new technologies coming. I know my colleague from Rhode Island will talk about carbon utilization. We are expanding beyond just carbon sequestration--carbon capture and sequestration--to carbon utilization. It is a hugely important part of this puzzle. We believe that if we provide these tax incentives to our industries, if we provide these tax incentives to our innovators, it will drive technology that will have the benefit of guaranteeing that we will see a diverse fuel source in America that includes coal and includes natural gas. We always want to point that out, wherever we represent coal I know West Virginia is in proximity to huge natural gas fields. We know that we may be faced with a carbon challenge in natural gas, and the ability to capture CO2 behind natural gas-fired power may be an essential ingredient for regulatory certainty into the future.  We are excited about this bill. We have 25 cosponsors who will advance and continue to talk about it and continue to grow colleague support. We hope this show of bipartisanship, this ability to work across the aisle, this[[Page S3979]]ability to come together--maybe not with the same motivations but certainly with the same goal--will prove that on one of the most contentious issues here, which is climate and coal, we can come together and actually get something done that we can all agree on.

13784,topic-id,391,"Madam President, one thing I want to talk about, as we are talking about carbon utilization--and Joe did a great job of talking about new technologies. Frequently when I talk about this topic people say: There is no such thing as clean coal. Coal cannot be a clean energy source. And I say: That is not true. I tell them about my personal experience with the largest carbon sequestration storage program in the country, up until some of the new developments, and that was Dakota I served on the board of directors of Dakota Gas, and, ironically, the carbon capture and transmission into an oil field was not done to respond to concerns globally about carbon; it was done to produce a salable and lucrative byproduct--CO2--which can be used in the oil fields.  The one point I want to make is that a lot of the new development in exploration and in production of oil is done in tight formations, shale formations. This is not a technology, CO2 flooding isn't a technology that has been widely used in tight formations because we haven't figured out how to do it.  I want to acknowledge one of those great American corporations, Occidental Petroleum, for doing something they call huff and puff, where they inject the They basically let that sit in the well and then eventually recharge the well. They are seeing excellent results in using this as an enhanced oil recovery method.  We are very excited about the bipartisan group.

13982,topic-id,1260,"Mr.Speaker, I certainly thank the gentleman for yielding.  I have had many opportunities in my career to come to this House floor and speak about topics of great importance, but few are as near and dear to my heart as is  So, one, I want to thank the gentleman from New York for his leadership and the gentleman from Texas for his leadership and keeping Scouting alive not only in their hearts, but in the heart of the House and in the hearts of so many young men in America today.  Mr.Speaker, as I think about my own life, I think how terribly blessed I have been. I think about the molders of my character, and, certainly, I thank the Lord for the blessing of being able to worship Him in the land of the free. And I think about the impact my church has had upon my life.  I think how blessed I am to have parents like Charles and Ann Hensarling, who raised me in College Station, Texas, and how proud I am to be my mother's son and how proud I was to be my late father's son. But I also think about what Scouting meant as a molder of my character.  Mr.Speaker, that is not what originally drew me to I was originally drawn to the fun of it, to the high adventure, to the camping trips, to those Capture the Flag games that went on to the wee hours of the morning. Little did I know how long one could actually hunt for a snipe back in the early days of my Scouting career. And so I was drawn to Indian lore and canoeing and camping, and that was so exciting to me.  So when I think about my Scouting career, Mr.Speaker, I think about, you know, the fun I had. I think about the friendships. There are people I haven't seen for decades, but, you know, I think about a friend by the name of Dennis Gary, whom I haven't seen in decades. But if I saw him tomorrow, I would know him because I would know him through his heart, because we experienced Scouting together, and so many others.  I think about the many practical things I learned in my Scouting career. I hope I never fall into a hole and break an arm, but if I did, even today at my ripe old age, I could still tie a one-handed bowline. I still know how to do that.  I hope I am never lost in the forest for days on end, but, you know, Mr.Speaker, I know that, as distasteful as it would be, I could survive off of cattail root and dandelion leaves because that is what Scouting taught me.  So Scouting is about fun; it is about friendship; but it was about practical things that I learned. Mr.Speaker, there is even a far more important aspect to Scouting, and that is values, the values that we learned.  So even today, as a Member of Congress, I know how important it is to be prepared, to be prepared before I come to this House floor and try to convince fellow Members of this august body on actions that we should take in the life of a great nation.  As we deal with so many issues about the lives of a great nation, I also remember, for example, somebody who wasn't in the Boy Scouts--my wife. I know back in Dallas, Texas, almost every week of her life she is driving some indigent cancer patient to their treatments.  I reflected that, although as Members of Congress we deal with matters of great importance that impact millions and millions of people, I have got to tell you, my wife, back in Dallas, Texas, does a good turn daily. It reminds me that I learned in Scouting how important it is to help one human life at a time and to do a good turn daily.  When I look upon my colleagues here in Congress today, I think about a certain colleague, and I am not going to mention his name, but a colleague who at one time wasn't quite keeping up with his diet. He wasn't quite keeping up with his exercise. Although he had young children, he had a heart attack, and we almost lost this colleague, but he came back. It is a reminder how important it is to keep ourselves physically strong for our children, for our parents, for our colleagues, and for our friends. That is something I learned in Scouting, Mr. I think about another friend whose wife almost was lost when she was diagnosed with a very serious form of cancer, stage But there was an oncologist here in this area, in the Washington area, who was on the cutting edge of cancer research that saved her life, and she was--the percentages against her, there was a 99 percent chance she wouldn't make it, but she did because somebody decided to be mentally awake. That is something else I learned in Scouting, Mr.Speaker, how important it is to be mentally awake.  And one day, when I leave this institution, some of the finest people I have ever met in life I know will have served in the United States of House of Representatives, but, unfortunately, a couple of them represent the worst. A couple of them have turned in their pin stripes for prison stripes because somehow they lost their way.  In Scouting, we are taught to orient a map with a physical compass, but we are also taught to orient the map of life with a moral compass. So I learned in Scouting how important it was to be morally straight, to have that internal compass to guide us at all times.  So I will admit, I am not proud of the fact, Mr.Speaker, but you know what? The words, over the years, occasionally they are a little rusty to me. I don't quite recite them as I once did. I don't always recite the words: ``On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to my God and my country, to obey the Scout Law, to help others at all times, to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.''  So, yes, Mr.Speaker, occasionally the words are a little rusty, but the principles are as alive to me today as they were almost half a century ago when I first entered Scouting and followed that career all the way up to Eagle Scout, something I am so, so very proud of today.  So, Mr.Speaker, I hope anybody who is watching the proceedings at this time will, again, understand how valuable Scouting is to all of us. It is not just important to my own personal life. It is important to the life of a great nation.  Our first President, the Father of our Country, said that you cannot have a free society which is not a moral society. Scouting helps make certain we have a moral society.                              {time}  1815  So I think of the fun, I think of the friendship, I think of the lessons, but, most importantly, I think about that moral compass for the map of life that has guided me and, with Scouting to come in the future, will guide the life of this great  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Dallas for his leadership, I thank him for his friendship, I thank him for all he means for Scouting, and I thank him for yielding to me.

Role models is the first thing that comes to mind with  I think about my dad--who was not an Eagle He was a Sea Scout--and he ended up being basically a Life Scout for life, as people say in But nobody was more influential to me in my youth than my dad--currently 91 years old--a Scout still at heart, and all the experiences we had together, how we bonded as father and son, and how, when I went off to college, Mr.Speaker, he continued to be a role model and adult leader for young men for years to come.  That is the kind of person that is in every one of our communities all over this country, helping mold our young people through the Scouting program.  Mr.Speaker, Scouting was my first paid job. I worked at a Scout camp. I earned, I believe, something like $10 a week, plus room and board, of course. It is when I first learned who FICA was because, at $10 a week, I wanted to know who took this $2 out of my $10 check. So I learned my first lesson about Federal economic policy and who FICA was as a Boy Scout working at the end of a very dusty parking lot for 7 weeks in the hot summer of Arkansas, teaching, pioneering, cooking, and camping merit badges.  But I think of other adults besides my dad. I think about Angelo Coppola and Fred Bean, both constituents of mine now that I serve in the people's House who were camp directors at that camp where I was a very happy employee and Scout for those summers in the early 1970s.  So Scouting is about role models. Scouting is about character building, and that starts that relationship, I think, between our moms and our dads that are involved in the Scouting program, and what we give to kids today. And, boy, do we need that character development.  The Boy Scouts of America was formed in 1910 and was inspired by British war hero Robert S.Baden-Powell of the Scouting program started back in the U.A lot of people today who are involved in Scouting, even at this moment, Mr.Speaker, don't know that the U.Congress presented a law to Woodrow Wilson, who signed it in 1916, chartering the Boy Scouts of  We are chartered by the United States Congress, and what a special feeling it is for all of us who are Scouts in Congress today to recognize that something that was so important to our youth was, in fact, chartered by the body that we serve in today.  In the early 20th century, Baden-Powell was thinking about how to expand army youth training with a place for all boys to dedicate their efforts to peace, not war, and he wanted Scouting to improve boys' lives by building their character, physical fitness, and outdoor skills.  He put a premium on bringing boys together from all walks of life, mixing boys from the elite prep schools and boarding schools with those in working class homes. And we do that today, Mr.We bring boys from all backgrounds into the character-building exercises of  Mr.Collins, a few minutes ago, talked about the importance of outdoor recreation, and that was certainly what brought me in. My interest in Scouting was outdoor recreation. When you think about it, in 1910, people were moving off the farm. People were urbanizing. We were passing laws on child labor. We were trying to make sure our boys coming off the farm away from home would have a good set of role models. So Scouting was so important to that urban youth that they get character and that outdoor experience.  And while that was a big deal back in 1910, I would argue, as Chris Collins did today, that it is a big deal now. He talked about a nature deficit. There is no doubt that we have that today, just as we did in some people's views back in 1910.  In 2005, Leonard Sax wrote a seminal book that I urge not only all of our Members to read, but people watching these proceedings to read, ``Boys Adrift,'' where he argued that the lack of experiential learning and free playtime--particularly outdoors--in our childhood is diminishing our effectiveness in learning as managers and our interpersonal relationships.  In 2008, Richard Louv wrote a book called ``Last Child in the Woods,'' where he argued that unstructured outdoor playtime is critical to childhood development.  Well, that is exactly what Scouting does. It provides outdoor recreation, something I think is essential to childhood development; something that we have lost because of not only urbanization, but our changing behavior.  One recent nature conservancy poll found that only 10 percent of American teens spend time outside every day. I can't imagine on a day where the sun was shinning when I was a teenager that I ever spent any time indoors. My parents were always on the hunt: Where is he? He is outside somewhere.  According to research by the Harvard School of Public Health, American adults spend less time outdoors than they do inside vehicles; less than 5 percent of their day.  So I think the scientific research says our boys and our girls need outdoor recreation. They need experiential learning. This is what is the core of the Scouting program. Like air and water, our wild places, our National Parks are essential to the education of our children and have greatly benefited the Boy Scouts and the Scouting experience. I can't imagine what my life would be like without that Scouting experience in terms of my love of the outdoors.  The second thing that attracted me to Scouting was the leadership opportunities. Baden-Powell said he wanted to be boy-driven. And here, 101 years after President Wilson signed the Boy Scouts of America into law, Scouting prides itself, Mr.Speaker, on being boy-driven, kid-driven. That is how we teach responsibility, character, and leadership.  I like this famous list, Mr.Sessions, that we use at so many Eagle Scout ceremonies called ``100 Scouts.''  Mr.Speaker, of 100 Scouts, people who participate in Scouting:  Thirty will drop out their first year, but they will remember the program fondly.  Twelve will be from a family that has no religious organization or religious membership, and many will begin their first contact with the need to be morally straight and have, at their heart, a belief in God; 12 will be touched by the Scouting program.  Five will go on to earn their religious award from whatever faith tradition they have.  One will use their Scouting skills to save a life.  One will credit Scouting skills for saving their own life.  Eighteen will develop a lifelong hobby.  Eight will find their vocation through the exploration of the merit badge work they did as a  Seventeen will later become Scout leaders, like all of our Members here on this floor tonight.[[Page H4493]]  Four will become an Eagle  Four out of that 100, Mr.Speaker, will earn the rank of Eagle Scout, and at least one will say they value earning that Eagle award more than their college degree.  When it comes to the role that Scouting plays, it is something that I am so proud of because I have a Scout in Troop 30 in Paul's Methodist Church in Little Rock, and I am so proud of the work that he has done on that trail toward He is in the middle of planning his project now to combine his love of golf and It is a service project at The First Tee of Central Arkansas in Little Rock, and I reflect it on the value of these Eagle projects across our communities in all 50 of our States and around the world.  Just in America, using 2014 data, about 150--140 people earn their Eagle rank a day in the United And in 2014, they spent 8.1 million hours, Mr.Speaker, on their Eagle Scout project, benefiting our towns, our communities, all over this country.  In the nonprofit world, if you applied a typical pay rate to that, a project rate that the independent sector uses of about $23 an hour, that is $188 million in public service value our Eagle Scouts have contributed across this country.  Mr.Speaker, I want to tell Mr.Sessions how much I appreciate his taking time to highlight Scouting, and the value of Scouting to our town and our communities, but, more importantly, to our families at creating that sense of character that we have talked about tonight.  I am one of those people that values my Eagle Scout award, dating back to 1972, from Troop 27, at Our Lady of the Holy Souls Catholic Church in Little And I am so proud that this many years later I still have the ability to support my son who is on that Eagle trail, and have the support of my dad that many long years after 1972 and my Eagle award because, in our family, we believe in a good turn daily. We believe in the Scout law. We believe in the Scout oath. And if there is one thing you need to do to survive in Congress, you have got to be prepared.

13913,topic-id,354,"Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring of the schedule for the week to come.  (Mr.McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business.  On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Mr.Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today.  One suspension worth highlighting is H.1644, the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act, sponsored by Chairman Ed Mr.Speaker, last year, North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests and 26 ballistic missile flight tests.  Congress has long led the charge to impose strict sanctions against the Kim Jong-un regime. This bill would continue that effort by specifically sanctioning North Korea's shipping industry, as well as targeting those who employ North Korean slave labor abroad. It is critical we send a clear and bipartisan message that North Korea's reckless provocations cannot continue.  In addition, Mr.Speaker, the House will consider H.1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act, sponsored by Representative Martha This bill would give employees the option to convert the overtime hours worked into paid time off. Mr.Speaker, hardworking Americans in the private sector deserve the same flexibility that public sector workers have enjoyed for decades. By passing this bill, we will give American families greater choice in how they spend their most important resource, their time.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, the House will consider legislation providing further appropriations for the 2017 fiscal year. I am encouraged by the reports I have received from our Appropriations Committee regarding these negotiations, and I look forward to a strong vote on this agreement next week.

13916,topic-id,474,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that, and I would urge the Speaker and the majority leader to engage with others because I think that would be useful in facilitating the reaching of an agreement. I know that Leader Pelosi and I will also be available to the extent that we could facilitate that.  I know there are some thorny, tough issues still outstanding, but I know the majority leader agrees with me that the funding of government on a sporadic basis on a continuing resolution is very bad for morale of the Federal service, very bad for anybody who wants to plan on how to execute their obligations and responsibilities, and frankly very disconcerting not only to the American people but to people around the world who contemplate the shutdown of the Government of the United States of America on which so much of the world relies for some degree of stability. It is simply not a thing that we ought to be doing. So I would urge the leader and myself to be as engaged as we need to be to get us to that objective next week.  Secondly, Mr.Majority Leader, I know we had some discussion about a healthcare bill. The Affordable Care Act, as you know, we think is working. We think, working together, we can make it better. I know the majority leader and his party disagree with that and want to see it repealed and that there is legislation to do that.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I know we have had many discussions in regards to this, and we have a very strong difference of opinion.  I would believe those individuals that have lost their doctors and that have lost their health care entirely, that they do not have someone providing it. If you look within Tennessee and one-third of the entire country, they only have one provider. There are challenges. We cannot continue to sit back and just watch ObamaCare fail. We have to do something about it.  We had committees work through a bill. We have made great progress over the Easter break. Members have been talking to one another. Members have seen a new amendment to add to the bill. They have been looking at it this week, and I anticipate as soon as Members have looked through that that we will bring that bill to the floor.  I don't have anything scheduled for next week. But as soon as a bill is scheduled, we will notify you. I anticipate the Members reading through it this weekend, and, as soon as possible, we will bring that bill to the floor.

13917,topic-id,438,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that comment. The gentleman is certainly correct, we have very substantial disagreements. We believe the Affordable Care Act is working.  I was pleased to see the administration, at least in the short-term, indicate that they will not take actions to undermine it or sabotage it without passing a replacement, without having the ability to give to the American people an option. I think the administration did the right thing. I hope they will continue to do the right thing in making payments consistent with the law.  We will have a very significant debate on that bill. Therefore, I would urge the majority leader if, in fact, the majority leader is going to bring that bill to the floor at some point in time, that significant notice be given so that not only Members of Congress, but that the American people can have the opportunity to assess the ramifications--in our perspective, the very serious adverse ramifications--that the passage of the American Health Care Act would have on the health care and the cost to every American of health insurance.  The President, as you know, has indicated that he wants to make sure--and he said he would support a program where every American has insurance, not access to insurance. He has made comments numerous times during the course of the campaign and since he has been President of the United States that his program would provide for every American to have health insurance at a lower cost with better quality.  I have told the people that, if he sends such a bill down, I would be inclined to support such a bill. He has not, of course, sent such a bill down.  So, Mr.Leader, the bottom line is I am simply saying that this will be a very controversial item and deserving of very significant debate, discussion. Hopefully, we will get significant notice as to when the majority leader expects to bring it to the floor so that we could be prepared for that debate.  I yield to the gentleman.                              {time}  1145  Mr.I thank the gentleman for yielding.  And yes, we have had a lot, ample debate already, through committee and part of the floor, but it is our anticipation that we will give you plenty of notification.  We have already posted the amendment to make sure everybody has the ability to read it, and it has already been there 3 days. It is just 8 pages long, and we have provided the 3 days already.

We have worked on a number of bipartisan issues over the years.  As I was sitting here, I was remembering when Senator Collins stood during the government shutdown and asked for people who would be interested in working with her on a bipartisan plan to get ourselves out of that mess. And all three of us were involved in that effort, which was, I note, half women in the group. I think it is time to do that again when it comes to healthcare.  I appreciated it when last week Senator McConnell said it may be time to work to strengthen the exchanges and to work across the aisle.

In fact, for a period of time in the early 1800s, four churches a Sunday used at that time the House of Representatives Chamber--what is now known as Statuary Hall--as their place for worship.  Thomas Jefferson worshipped there. In fact, every President from Thomas Jefferson all the way to Abraham Lincoln attended church on Sundays in Statuary Hall, what was at that time the House of Representatives  That is an interesting fact. I have had folks talk about Thomas Jefferson's statement about the wall of separation between church and state. That was actually in a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to the Danbury Baptist Association, saying they would not allow the State to take over churches--that there would be this wall of separation between church and state. Two days after President Jefferson wrote that statement, he attended church in the House of Representatives Chamber on a  Even earlier, at our Constitutional Convention in 1787, Benjamin Franklin stated: ``In the beginning of the Contest with Great Britain, when we were sensible of danger, we had daily prayer in this room for Divine protection.''  Many U.Presidents have signed proclamations for national prayer since 1799, from George Washington all the way to the present.  The National Day of Prayer is a good day for us to be able to reflect as a Nation and to be able to remember well that there are many people of faith in our country that do believe there is a Creator God and that he has made a difference in our own personal lives and he has made a difference in our  We go back to President Truman's statement. He said in 1952: ``The President shall set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of Prayer, on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation in churches, in groups, and as individuals.''  As I mentioned, in 1988, President Reagan even affirmed that.[[Page S2767]]  I don't think I could find very many Americans who would say we are running out of things to pray for: debt; anger in the Nation; conversation about hard, difficult issues that we face; terrorism and threats of violence from around the world. We are not out of things to pray for. Far from it. But people of faith believe that, regardless of the obstacles we face, there is a God that we can call out to who hears us and who cares about our daily lives. He is not a God who just created and walked away. He is a God whom we can know, and we feel confident that God knows and loves us.  Philippians 4:6 says: ``Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.''  I am always encouraged when I travel around Oklahoma and around the I even ran into some people this week who stopped me in the hallway and just said: ``I want you to know I'll pray for you.''  I encourage Americans to pray for the President, for the Vice President, for their Cabinet, for the Supreme Court, for Members of the Senate and of the House, for the staff who serve around us and with us and serve people around this country, for our military, and for first responders. The list could go on and on of people who set aside their time and their life to be able to serve. It is not an unreasonable request to be able to say: Pray for them; ask God to continue to protect them.  It is amazing to me how many Christians I bump into of my own faith who find it easier to complain about government than it is to pray for those in government. I think that is an issue we need to fix, and today is a good day to begin that, on this National Day of  I remember well, personally, that I grew up around the church. My mom dragged me to church. I mean it. She made me go. But I remember extremely well sitting in the balcony of the church one Sunday and actually paying attention to our pastor as he would read through Probably for the first time in my life, I started actually thinking about this one simple truth: There is a God, and I don't know  I couldn't shake that reality. Laying in bed late that Sunday night by myself, I remember praying--probably for me, for the first time in my life, actually praying. And I prayed a very simple 8-year-old prayer. My prayer was this: God, I don't know You, but I know I have done things wrong in my life and I need Your forgiveness. Would You come into my life and take control?  It was the beginning point for me--just the most simple of ways for me to begin a relationship with God, trusting in His forgiveness and His ability to forgive.  I have in my office two paintings that hang. One painting is the hands of a potter at a wheel, shaping the clay as they choose to. It reminds me of the sovereignty of Below it is a painting of those same hands sitting at that same bowl holding it, but this time the bowl is done. It is full of water. There is a towel in it, and there are feet around the bowl. It reminds me of the call to serve that we all have--to be able to serve people in the most humble of ways. It reminds me that there is a God, and that He has called us to a task. Part of that task is to pray.  The National Day of Prayer is not a mandate from the Federal Government that all people should pray--far from it. It is just a reminder. It is a reminder for people of faith who choose to pray that this is a good day when we can reset to be able to pray for our Nation and for our leaders. It is an acknowledgement, quite frankly, that millions of people of faith believe in God and that those individuals believe that God hears our prayers and responds. So thus we should pray.  Culturally, it is fascinating to me to be able to talk to people about prayer. I ran into some people that find it perfectly permissible in times of great struggle and anguish to pray, but in times of thanksgiving, it seems odd. Let me give a for instance.  A couple of years ago, a football coach in our country was fired from his job because at the end of a football game he would kneel down after the game was over and thank God for the safety of his players. For that, he was released from his job because, for some reason, Americans don't accept prayers of thanksgiving. But at those same football games, if a player was injured and the coaches and players were to kneel down, the crowd would see that as a good sign of respect--that we respect someone who is injured, and it is entirely reasonable to pray when there is an injury on the field but maybe not if it is just a prayer of thanksgiving.  It is an odd season for us as a nation, trying to figure out who we are and what we believe and if Americans of faith can live their faith. I would challenge us as a country, for those of us who have faith, to be able to live our faith with integrity and with consistency, and on a National Day of Prayer like this, to remind our Nation that there are millions of people of faith but that there are also millions of people that have no faith at all. They are also Americans, and they are also to be respected because many people are on a journey with  There are many people who don't practice faith at all today that consider simple things in their life. Their financial house may be in order. Their family life may be in order. But their spiritual life remains a vacuum, and they are, quite frankly, trying to figure that out.  I am always interested in the stories of Abraham Abraham Lincoln in his earliest political campaigns was chastised that he was anti-faith or that he was secretly an atheist because he never attended church everywhere. He said he had respect for the Bible and read the Bible and had respect for faith, but he just personally didn't practice it. In his earliest campaigns, he was really challenged by that and only narrowly won at times. In fact, he lost some of his campaigns, and he had attributed losing those campaigns to people having challenged him that he was anti-faith.  But then we read his words when he was President of the United States, and we find a person who was on a journey with It wasn't anti-faith. He just didn't practice faith.  But listen to these words in 1863 from President He proclaimed a National Day of Prayer, as every President before him has, and he wrote this:       We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of      We have been preserved, these many years, in peace      and in prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth, and      power, as no other nation has ever grown. But we have      forgotten We have forgotten the gracious hand which      preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and      strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the      deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were      produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own.      Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-     sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving      grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us! It behooves      us then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to      confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and      forgiveness.  That is a man who was on a journey with God, who came to the Presidency as a person of no faith, who understood the responsibilities, and his heart dramatically changed.  It is a good day for us to reflect on this National Day of I would encourage the Nation, if they choose, to be able to watch and join in or to just quietly be able to pray on their own, to remember again that those of us who pray for others should probably spend some time praying for ourselves as well. At times, as we criticize others, we should probably self-evaluate and ask the simple question: Do we live the values that we demand of others?  It is a good day to pray. Later tonight, I will stand in that historic Statuary Hall where Presidents and Members of Congress and individuals have prayed for a long time, and I will read Daniel, Chapter 9 to the group, which reads:       Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your      servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your      desolate sanctuary. Give ear, our God, and hear us.  It is a similar prayer that many of us pray in gatherings all over this Capitol every week. Members of the House and the Senate and staff quietly find places in this building to pray. It is not a bad idea for the Nation to join us.  Hear, O God, our prayer. We need Your help.

13783,topic-id,1284,"I am so encouraged that you remember the history of your great State in not forgetting those coal mines.  We have to face the facts and the realization that there are 8 billion tons of coal being burned in the world on an annual basis. We burn less than 1 billion in the United States of America, and we are the country that has done more to clean up the environment than any other country. They all talk about doing different things, but we have taken the SOx and the NOX and the mercury out and the particulates. We have done more in the last two decades than has ever been done, and there is more that can be done.  I have to be very honest with you. The last 8 years was very challenging and difficult for us. No one wanted to make the effort. They talked a good game, but no one would put the investment into the technology that was needed. Now we have this bill--it is bipartisan that everybody is working hard on--that has a chance to really put us in the forefront of how we utilize this carbon capture and sequestration.  West Virginia has one of the first powerplants, the Mountaineer Power Plant, that shows it can be done commercially. We did a commercial test there. We know it can be done. We know it is expensive. At the time, President Obama said to go ahead and build a coal plant, and we will break you. He knew it was not financially feasible, and that is where that statement came from.  First of all, coal was a baseload fuel. There are only two baseload fuels in the world today. Baseload is 24/7 uninterrupted power. That is coal and nuclear. Gas has now replaced coal in the United States of America in its being more plentiful for the production of energy, which we depend on, but it still can be interruptible because the gas pipelines could be sabotaged. They could break, and weather conditions could change that.  So you have to make sure everything is working for the people of the United States of America who have always been used to and been dependent upon turning the switch on or their heat and their power or opening their fridge, and everything is working. It comes because you have baseload that is dependable, reliable, and affordable. You are going to have that.  I think, maybe in my grandchildren's lifetimes, they are going to see, maybe, commercial hydrogen, which will be water vapor. I think that is coming. It is just not here yet. So we are going to use what we have and what we need and make sure we do it in the cleanest fashion. The United States should be and will be the leader of this. This is what helps us do it, and it gives us incentive to move forward on it.  When we were doing scrubbers back in the eighties, the Clean Air Act, I will never forget, at the time, to do scrubbers that take sulfur out, you have to inject, basically, limestone. This crushed limestone, basically, clings to the sulfur, and the sulfur drops out in the form of the ash. What are you going to do with all of this byproduct of this ash? Can it be detrimental? Is it hazardous? Guess what. A lot of the drywall you are using today is made out of the ash that came out of the new scrubbers from which we did not know we were going to have a byproduct.  So there is value. I still believe in my heart, with this piece of legislation, that we are going to find a valuable use of this waste. Can it be solidified? We know we can take clear stream CO2 off. Can we solidify this CO2? It would not just be sequestering it. We are doing it in liquid form now and pressuring it into the ground. If you have oil or some other energy that is valuable to return back, then you can offset the cost, but in a lot of parts of the country, we do not have that oil so we are not able to have a value returned. It is pure cost, and the cost is about one-third of the production. A perfect example: If you have a 900-megawatt powerplant and you have carbon capture sequestration, but you have no value in return, you lose 300 megawatts by pushing it into the ground. It makes it nonfeasible financially, and that is when the statement came, ``You build it, and we will break it.'' That is how they break it. You cannot do it. So if we don't have to sequester it and pressure it in the ground when we solidify this clear stream carbon from liquids to solids, can we use the spent fuel of a solid carbon, CO2?  This is what we should be working on. These are the things we should be doing. We missed 8 years. We had a hiatus for 8 years. Let's catch up. This piece of legislation puts us on the path to make something happen, to truly make us unique in the world of what we do and how we do it. The rest of the world counts on us. All the other countries are talking about all the things they are doing in climate; trust me,[[Page S3981]]they are not. They are talking about it; they are not doing it. Even our NATO allies aren't using what we have already developed and perfected. They are not using scrubbers, and they are not using baghouses for mercury.  It is not CO2 killing people in Beijing; it is basically particulates. It is particulates that we have taken out of the air. We can do this, but we need to work together. We can't be fighting each other. There is not a West Virginian I know who wants to breathe dirty air or drink dirty water--or an American--and they are not going to. We have improved and will continue to improve. But we can't be pitting one environmental group against another manufacturing or production group, and that is what we have done. We are just tearing each other apart because we are picking sides: Are you for the environment or are you for the economy? I am for both. I am for the environment, and I am for the economy, and I think there is a balance between the two.  If we do the technology and the manufacturers or the producers of electricity refuse to use the technology that is proven, then they should be shut down. They get a certain period of time to retrofit. If they will not do it, then shut them down.  We haven't gotten there yet on this, and that is why this piece of legislation is so important. All of the working groups and environmental groups--everybody should be behind this. We have an array of Senators who have come together, unlike most bills. We don't often have this happen. I am proud of what the Presiding Officer has done. I am proud of my good friend from North I am proud of my friend from Rhode I am proud of my friend from I am proud of everyone coming together and saying: If we are going to use it, let's do it better.

13853,topic-id,1599,"Thank you, Mr. Mr.President, earlier today the Senate voted on a bill to dismantle this country's healthcare--a cruel bill that would affect every single American and one-sixth of our economy; a heartless bill that was crafted in secret, without public debate and without input from the families who will be impacted; an inhumane bill that would make health insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans and leave millions more with no access at all.  Despite this legislative malpractice, despite numerous independent analyses and nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office findings that millions of Americans will lose coverage and face increased costs, despite Americans from across the country pleading with Republicans not to rip away their coverage or take a machete to Medicaid, despite all that, President Trump and Republican leadership put politics ahead of people and voted to repeal the Affordable Care That is a travesty.  I have often said that the proudest vote of my career was the one I cast in favor of the Affordable Care The second proudest vote is today, voting no on this cruel, heartless, inhumane bill.[[Page S4179]]  To all of my constituents in Massachusetts, please know that I vote no with you in mind.  Massachusetts is the home of universal healthcare. We have a model for the Affordable Care Because of our belief that healthcare is a right and not just a privilege, 98 percent of Massachusetts residents have healthcare coverage. That was a dream of the great Teddy Kennedy, the lion of this Chamber, and it is a reality in  We cast this historic vote today to proceed to debate on healthcare legislation, but rest assured, the fight to protect the Affordable Care Act is far from over.  It is a testament to how divided the Republican Party is over how to replace the healthcare law that we still don't know which version of TrumpCare we will proceed to vote on for final passage. It is not because Republicans haven't had time--they have had 7 years to craft a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Rather, the chaos we have seen so far from Senate Republicans is because millions of Americans are finally benefiting from insurance coverage, many for the first time, and they don't want these protections taken away.  In many ways, it doesn't matter which bill they bring up for a vote because all versions of the Republican healthcare bill are terrible. Republicans still have no idea how they will go about protecting those with preexisting conditions and ensure that millions aren't kicked off their current insurance plan.  Senate Republicans have so far proposed three bills that would each devastate the healthcare sector, take a machete to Medicaid, and make the poorest in our country pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest. These bills are the bad, the worse, and the ugly.  First, the bad.  Senate Republicans proposed legislation at the end of June--just a month ago--that would rip away health insurance from 22 million Americans and give the top 400 wealthiest people in our country a tax break worth $33 billion.  Then the worse.  They introduced yet another bill that would also kick 22 million Americans off of their health insurance and cut Medicaid by $750 billion. They tried to buy Republican votes with a separate opioid fund, but that craven, political Hail Mary was not fooling anyone.  Then the ugly.  When Republican leadership realized that they did not have the votes for either of these cruel replacement bills, they decided to just repeal the healthcare law without any kind of replacement. This proposal would take coverage away from 32 million Americans and double premiums over the next decade.  That is the slate of Republican healthcare bills--the bad, the worse, and the ugly. All of these healthcare proposals have one thing in common: heartlessness. They all reduce coverage. They all increase costs for They all eviscerate Medicaid, causing irreparable damage to a program that provides coverage for 70 million Americans, and they all hand over billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest in our country, who do not need them or deserve them. Even in Massachusetts, the Republican proposals would mean more than 260,000 people would lose coverage, often the lowest income residents in the It would cost the State more than $8 billion by the year 2025.  There are no changes, no so-called fixes, no modifications to make any of these bills less cruel. Each of the Republican proposals will just exacerbate the most devastating public health crisis facing the country--the battle against opioid overdose deaths.  Leader McConnell said today that he would be thinking about the families who are hurting in Kentucky when he casts his vote to kick at least 20 million Americans off of their health insurance coverage. Yet do you know who will really be hurting? It will be the families of the nearly 1,000 people who died of an opioid overdose in Kentucky last year.  In a blatantly craven attempt to make TrumpCare more palatable, moderate Republicans from States that have been ravaged by the opioid crisis included a paltry opioid fund in the most recent version of the GOP replacement fund. Those are crumbs compared to the amount that the Affordable Care Act would likely spend on covering opioid use disorder treatments if we would just leave the law alone to work as intended. This opioid fund is not a fix; it is a falsehood. It is a false promise to the people who are suffering from opioid addiction. It is a false future that will not include critical Medicaid funding for treatment and recovery services, and it is a false bargain that Republicans will make at the expense of families who are desperate for opioid addiction treatment.  The American people will not be fooled. They realize that opioid funding in this proposal is nothing more than a public health pittance--a wholly inadequate response to our Nation's preeminent public health crisis. No amount of money in an opioid fund can replicate the access to treatment that is provided through the comprehensive health insurance program that the Affordable Care Act represents. Families of those who suffer from substance abuse disorders have been shouting from the rooftops that cutting Medicaid and hamstringing access to health insurance coverage will only make a difficult situation worse.  We should be making health coverage and treatment access more robust, not weaker. Today, only 1 in 10 people with substance addiction receives treatment, and it has been estimated that 2 million people who live with opioid use disorders are not receiving any treatment for their disorders. It should not be a surprise to anyone that the epidemic of opioid abuse will only worsen as long as we have a system that makes it easier to abuse drugs than to get help.  These Republican proposals will be a death sentence for millions of people with substance use disorders. A vision without funding is a hallucination. They are cutting the funding for substance abuse. Republicans are turning their backs on their vow to combat the opioid epidemic, and President Trump is beginning to break his own promise from the campaign trail to ``expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.'' Instead, they are moving forward with a proposal that threatens insurance coverage for 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder--all to give hundreds of billions in tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations--and slashing funding for our Nation's preeminent public health crisis is just part of it.  Creating a separate fund for opioid use disorders just further stigmatizes the disease and pushes it back into the shadows. This is not how we treat chronic health conditions in this country, and it is insulting to those 33,000 Americans who lost their lives just last year from opioid overdoses.  This latest political maneuver proves yet again that TrumpCare has never been about creating health. It has always been and still is about concentrating wealth--tax breaks for the rich coming from the cuts in healthcare coverage for those who need it the most in our country. They are abandoning hard-working families so that they must fend for themselves while they bestow those gifts of billions in tax breaks to the wealthy. That is shameful.  The GOP replacement plan also imposes an age tax on older Americans, allowing insurance companies to charge older Americans five times more than younger Americans for the same coverage. That is unconscionable.  The GOP plan reduces access to care for those with preexisting conditions--Americans with cancer, diabetes, women who have had children. They want to force them to pay for a Cadillac, but they then hand over to them a tricycle. That is just plain wrong.  On this floor, it is going to be a battle to the very end on this bill, and I am going to keep speaking and keep fighting until my Republican colleagues understand how important these issues are to every single family in our country.  The American people who believe in quality, affordable healthcare will not be silenced by today's vote. Instead, we will be invigorated to call out the callousness in any of these bills that would threaten the economic security for low-income and working families in order to fill the already overflowing bank accounts of the 1 percent. Oh, no. This fight is just beginning out here on the Senate floor because the lives of all[[Page S4180]]Americans who would be hurt by the Senate's vote today to begin debate on repealing the Affordable Care Act are simply too important for us to stop fighting.

13855,topic-id,1011,"Mr.President, we are now considering the Cruz amendment, which he titles consumer freedom, but there could not be a more misnamed amendment to come to the floor.  Americans know this as the fake insurance amendment. This is the amendment that says: Hey, insurance companies, we are going to do you a big favor and let you sell these policies that aren't worth the paper they are written on. And, Hey, isn't this wonderful, says my colleague from Texas, because, you know what, people will only have to pay a few dollars per month for those worthless policies, and that is freedom.  Well, I will tell you that if my colleague had been out talking to people in rural America, as I have been, if he had been out there talking to people in red America, as I have been, he would be hearing that people are terrified about this effort to annihilate health insurance.  One out of three people in Oregon have been able to be on the Oregon Health Plan because of It has had an incredible impact on our rural healthcare centers. Many of them have doubled their number of employees. About 20,000 employees across the State have been added. Oh, we just heard a speech about it being a job killer, but, in fact, it has employed thousands and thousands more people in the healthcare industry across Little communities that didn't have folks being able to take on mental health can now take on mental health issues. Rural communities that didn't have a drug treatment program now have a drug treatment program. Rural hospitals that were going out of business now have a strong financial foundation. And that is just the beginning.  Entrepreneurs across this Nation were tied up in their companies, afraid to leave and pursue their vision because they couldn't get healthcare by themselves. Now, they can, so they are starting one business after another after another after another, and what we have seen is month after month after month of growth in employment in this  Oh, we can tell you about the amendment that my colleague from Texas is putting forward and what it does in terms of offering these fake policies, but that is only the beginning of it because what it is designed to do is carve off those who are young, carve off those who are healthy, and put them into one pool, and then those with preexisting conditions, those who are sick, those who are older, have to go to another pool in which the rates go way up and create a death spiral. So whether we call this fake insurance for the young and healthy or a death spiral insurance for the old and those with health problems or preexisting conditions, it is really blowing up the insurance market at both ends.  Don't take my word for it; take the experts' word for it. We have a Republican Senator who said that there is a real feeling that there is subterfuge to get around the preexisting conditions, referring to this amendment. And then we have a staffer for a Republican who says: ``And outside health policy folks have said this would set up a death spiral for the markets.''  OK, but let's turn to the American Enterprise Institute, an extremely conservative organization. What does their scholar say? He says, ``This means that people with those kinds of illnesses will end up paying more.'' And then he goes on to say, ``The people who don't know something will happen and come down with something, those are the ones at issue.''  Or let's turn to the American Action Forum Deputy Director Tara O'Neill Hayes, who says: ``I think that really would be the definition of a death spiral.''  Or we can turn to the former CBO Director, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who says ``What that will do is allow insurers to offer cheap policies to young invincibles. And on the exchange you're going to get all the sick people.''  He continues and says: ``That's a recipe for meltdown. You've split the risk pool into two exchanges.''  And he says: ``I think it would end up being bad politics.''  I am not concerned about bad politics, but I am concerned about those folks whom I have been meeting out in rural America, out in red America, because they are coming to my townhalls and they are saying: Stop this diabolical plan. The Cruz amendment only makes it a lot worse by creating the fake policies for the young and healthy--the young invincibles--and the death spiral insurance for everyone else.  So someone can stand up here and speak glibly about how this is going to fix job creation in America, but what it really says is healthcare for the wealthy--not healthcare, but wealth care.  It is so interesting to see this whole coalition of individuals who want to pass a bill that not only demolishes healthcare for 22 million, but gives hundreds of billions of dollars to the very richest in My colleague mentioned a moment ago that the richest 400 families would get $33 billion. No, not $33,000 apiece or $33 million--$33 billion. They feel it is so important to rip healthcare from ordinary working families to deliver benefits to the wealthiest That is the opposite--opposite--of what we should be doing in  Franklin Roosevelt said that the test of our progress is not whether we add more abundance to those who have much; it is whether we do enough for those who have too little. What that translates to is whether we provide a foundation of affordable healthcare so that every family in America has a foundation to thrive. That is what we are fighting for.  This amendment is absolutely a bomb going off in healthcare on both ends of the spectrum, with the young and with the old, with the healthy and[[Page S4182]]with the sick, and with those with preexisting conditions.

When I pointed out it has created jobs all over our country in healthcare, no response. When I pointed out it has created the opportunity for entrepreneurs to create jobs and healthcare jobs, no response. When I pointed out it creates fake insurance that doesn't cover anything when you get sick, no response. All he has to say is that it makes insurance a little cheaper.  Yes, it is worth the paper it is printed on. Well, not even that, actually, because you pay $40 or $50 a month, you go to the hospital, not covered. If you get in an accident and you need an MRI, not covered. You and your spouse have the opportunity and have a child, not covered. Not covered, not covered, not covered. Fake insurance.  It is the experts who say it throws it into a death spiral. It is the experts who say it in conservative think tanks and in liberal think tanks. So what does he have to say?

It is a milestone in a journey that we started over a year ago. We are taking a major legislative step in the direction of creating a memorial honoring those who have served on Active Duty during the global war on terrorism.  For many, like my colleagues, this bill is personal. None of us will forget where we were on September 11, 2001, and we all continue to live with the aftermath of that tragic day in American history.  It is important to note that the tragic events of 9/11 and the war on terror to follow did not leave us isolated and afraid as a nation. Rather, in true American fashion, they inspired an entire generation to come together and serve.  So many young men and women selflessly answered the call to serve their country in the wake of that tragedy, and I would like to share just one story with you about someone from my district who would be on this memorial.  Captain Jennifer Harris lived in the town of She was a graduate of the United States Naval Academy, and, sadly, became the first Massachusetts woman killed in the Iraq war.  Jennifer was the epitome of leadership and sacrifice. On flying missions, she had the call sign ``The Dove.'' She would often be called to evacuate our wounded soldiers and marines from the battlefield.  Captain Harris' final mission was to transport blood supplies. She willingly volunteered for it even though she was only just days away from returning home. In fact, she was initially told:       You are too close to leaving. Don't go.  But she said:       I want to fly one more time.  Her superiors reluctantly agreed. Captain Harris died on February 7, along with six other crew members after insurgents shot down her helicopter.  In her twenties, with a bright future ahead of her, Captain Harris was on her third tour of duty in  I can't help but think today of my grandfather, a World War II veteran. He never got to see the WWII Memorial in his lifetime. He was never afforded the opportunity to have some place to take his family to reflect on his time in the service or remember his colleagues who did not have the opportunity to come home.  Let's not let that history repeat itself. The men and women who have given their all in the war on terror should be afforded a place on the National Mall where their loved ones can pay respects and honor their sacrifice.  Passage of this bill is an important first step in seeing this memorial built in our lifetime.  Let's get this done for Captain Jennifer Harris and the thousands of others like her who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.

Then, to have all of us seated here because of the vote that was occurring--and not a Senator left after the vote was concluded because we wanted to hear from John and did so willingly. His eloquent words about how we all need to come together and stop being driven apart by partisan reasons were timely, and they were well received.  Mr.President, this Senator never thought we would see a vote to advance a bill which, to so many, feels as though it is going to harm so many of our fellow Obviously, we can disagree on specifics, but we have seen that particular expression of opinion of harm over and over. We have seen it in the coverage of the townhall meetings, where people stand up and say: If I didn't have this healthcare, I would be dead.  This Senator has seen it in Florida over and over, as I have had people come up to me wherever I am--in a meeting, on the street corner, in the airport, wherever--and say: Senator, please don't let them take my healthcare away from me.  Indeed, when people explained their particular circumstances, four different families--one family, if they did not have the waiver on Medicaid, indeed, that fellow would not only not be alive, but even if he were alive, he would be in an institution instead of being able to be cared for or three other families who brought forth testimonies about how the Affordable Care Act has given them insurance they had never been able to get before. It was at a price they could afford and involved coverage they never could have had.  In other cases, people had preexisting conditions. This Senator, as a former elected insurance commissioner of Florida, has seen insurance companies refuse to insure people because they had a preexisting condition. If you had asthma, that was a preexisting condition; if you had a bad rash, that was a preexisting condition, and they were not going to insure you. Also, insurance policies never had the guarantee of lifetime coverage but instead the policy said you had lifetime caps. There was a dollar figure which, if you exceeded it, the insurance policy was not going to cover any more.  If we are really serious about wanting to fix the situation, if our brothers and sisters on the other side of the aisle are not successful in proceeding with what the majority leader is going to be coming forth with, if that is voted down, and if we are serious about it, take what is left, which is the existing law--the Affordable Care Act--and fix it.  Senator Collins, a former insurance commissioner, appointed in the State of Maine, and this Senator, a former elected insurance commissioner in the State of Florida, are already working on a reinsurance fund which would insure the insurance companies against catastrophe. I asked for this to be costed out in the State of This fix would lower premiums 13 percent in the State of  In the words of Senator McCain, if we really want to get together and fix the problems, we can. Yet, in the midst of hearing from constituents all around the country who have shared their personal stories about how the existing law has helped, we are in the parliamentary position we are in, where we will proceed on trying to repeal what is the existing law.  For some people, they don't care about the politics. As a matter of fact, for a lot of people, they don't care about the politics. They just want access to healthcare. They want what is genuinely described as health insurance--whether it is a Medicaid type of insurance or whether it is an actual policy through a private insurance company offered on the health exchanges in the States or whether it is the guarantees of the coverage in an individual policy that they might buy, they just want healthcare. That is the reason you have health insurance in the first place.  Now, I have heard some fixes say: Oh, let's cut back on Medicaid, which, remember, is spread over millions and millions of people, just like Medicare is spread over millions and millions of people. The difference there is age. If you are 65, you are eligible for  There are some people we overlook in the system who depend on How about veterans?

Then their healthcare is transferred to the Veterans' Administration, but there are a lot of veterans who are not getting their healthcare through the They get their healthcare through If you start cutting back on Medicaid, which are the versions of the so-called replace bills we have seen--if you start cutting back on Medicaid and make a capped program or a block grant program, we already know the figures. It has been costed out by the The figures tell us it is close to an $800 billion cut over a decade. When you start doing that, the people who rely on Medicaid at the edges, like some poor people or like seniors in nursing homes--by the way, in my[[Page S4171]]State, 65 to 70 percent of the seniors in nursing homes are on Medicaid, and some of those veterans I told you about are not on VA healthcare but How about some of the children's programs on Medicaid? If you start cutting that back to the tune of about $800 billion over a decade, you are going to knock out a lot of these people. That is not something we want to do. That is why, when explained, you have such low numbers who support what is being attempted as a replacement if you repeal the Affordable Care We should be focused on working together to improve the Affordable Care Act, not to make it worse.  I pretty much have said it all. The bills we have seen coming forth as replacements change the age ratio from the existing law, the Affordable Care Act, of 3 to 1 in the healthcare exchanges so you can charge an older person three times as much as a young, healthy individual--not in the replacement bills we see coming up. It is 5 to 1. What does that mean? That means for those older Americans, before they turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare, they are going to be paying more for their insurance premiums. Is that what we want to do? I don't think so.  You cannot ignore these facts. I ask those who come forth with these replacements, why in the world do you do this? Why do you support a bill that will hurt so many Americans, which has been demonstrated over and over? Why do you support a bill that will hurt so many of your constituents that your constituents cry out to you, please, don't do this? And they give personal testimonies.  I urge our colleagues, after the emotional appeal of Senator McCain, to do things in a bipartisan way. Take a moment, reflect on what your constituents have said--not just some of your constituents. Listen to all of your constituents and ask yourself, are you doing the right thing?  Let's improve our Nation's healthcare system. Let's not make it worse.

13930,topic-id,1223,"Mr.President, I want to talk about a heavy financial burden that too many of our fellow Americans are being forced to deal with. What I am talking about is student loans. You may be surprised to know that the second largest amount of debt in America, next to home mortgage debt, is student loan debt. Student loan debt is $1.3 trillion more than all the credit card debt combined in Graduates from the class of 2016 have more than $37,000 in student loan debt, on average, when they graduate.  To make matters worse, the Federal Government last week announced that[[Page S3887]]it was increasing interest rates on Federal student loans for this coming school year, which starts in For undergraduate students, rates are increased from last year at 3.76 percent to 4.45 percent, almost three-quarters of a percent. That started on July 1.  Well, our economy is built on the ingenuity and creativity of young entrepreneurs who have taken a risk on something new, but today, instead of sending our graduates off to be creative and conquer the world, we are sending them off with a tremendous amount of debt that they are struggling to afford.  While I was in Florida last week over the July 4th recess, I met with a group of recent graduates, and we wanted to discuss their student loans. They were not shy about telling me about it. Many of them had high interest rates. They wondered how they were going to pay off that debt, how they were going to be able to be unshackled from that financial burden so they could get on about the business of building their career and starting a family.  Let me give you some examples of the students I met with. One young lady graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2015 with $50,000 in student loan debt. The interest rate on her debt was 4.85 percent. She knows that her parents, who have helped her before--they are small business owners--are not going to be able to continue to help her financially. Even so, she was the first person in her family to graduate from college. That student is currently attending George Washington University for graduate school, after which she is estimating her total debt will be $90,000 in student loans. She told me about what every student longs to do: Purchase a home, start a family, and get on with their career. But that is increasingly becoming a pipe dream for millennials because of the burden of student loan debt.  I met another student from Deltona, FL, who works as a social worker for the homeless. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in social work and a master's degree in the same from Florida She has dedicated her life to public service and helping the most vulnerable among us, yet she is facing $75,000 in student loan debt while carrying interest rates that range from 5.4 percent to 6.8 percent.  In Florida alone, students graduating with a 4-year degree are leaving with an average of more than $23,000 in student loan debt. The thought of trying to start a career with that much debt is discouraging when some students, even after attending college in the first place, are still struggling. They want to go on to grad school or they are still in school wanting to finish their degree, but then they have that constant fear of having more and more debt when they graduate. That is not in anyone's interest--not the student's, not the family's, not the community's, and it is certainly not in the country's best interest. If we really want to build a strong middle class, we have to make higher education more affordable.  That is why today I am introducing legislation to lower the cap on student loan interest and the so-called lender origination fees and to allow those with existing loans to refinance at a lower rate; namely, 4 percent.  Remember I told you about that one student I met who had loans that went anywhere from 5.5 up to 6.8 percent? That was the interest rate in that particular year of their education. I think they ought to be able to refinance all of that at a maximum of 4 percent.  The bill that I am filing today, which we are calling the Student Loan Relief Act, would cap student loan interest rates for undergraduates at 4 percent, graduates at 5 percent, and parents at a cap of 6 percent. It would also help students borrow less by ending the loan origination fees the government charges students to process their loan. For example, if it is a $10,000 loan, they will take out a loan origination fee of $400, so the actual loan the student gets is $9,600. These fees are taken out before the student receives the loan. The bill we are filing would eliminate those fees all together.  One other thing the bill would allow for any borrower with an existing Federal student loan is to refinance their loans one time to a lower rate. Once the Federal Government sets the student loan interest rates for the year, they are fixed now under current law for the lifetime of that loan and they can't be refinanced, even if the rates go lower. That is certainly not in the interest of the student. For example, borrowers who took out loans between July of 2006 and July of 2013 likely have a fixed rate of 6.8 percent. Despite the significant drop in interest rates since 2013, currently those borrowers are barred from refinancing their existing loans. That is not common sense. Between 2006 and 2013, the interest rate on student loan debt got as high as 6.8 percent. Students who took out loans during that time are now stuck with those rates. They can't refinance that debt as you could with a home loan. This bill would fix that by letting those borrowers refinance their debt with the new loans that have the lower interest rates.  Capping interest rates, ending loan origination fees, and allowing borrowers to refinance existing loans would certainly help make education more affordable for our students. It would help to ease the financial stress that is weighing down our economy and keeping some graduates from making the types of investments that traditionally lead to stronger middle-class membership like, for example, home ownership.  Sometimes, in all of the partisan back-and-forth, some folks begin to forget why we are here: to serve the people. I urge our colleagues to take a serious look at this bill and join with me in helping those we represent.  We can't continue to leave our graduates saddled with so much student debt and no way out. We have to do something to ease the burden, and I believe this is a good way to start.  I would just conclude by recalling what I said at the outset: You may be surprised to learn that student loan debt is the second largest debt carried in America next to home mortgage debt.  You can take all the credit card debt in America and combine it all and it is not as much as the $1.3 trillion of student loan debt that is carried today. We need to help those students, and thereby we are helping our country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-10-pt1-PgS3886.txt,859,RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF EDWARD PLATH,2017.0,10.0,July

What they were pretending to sell was young girls.  In less than 2 days, over 100 individuals responded to that ad. Many of them were hoping to buy children for sex. Similar operations were conducted across the State in following months, and they had similar results. Many times, when folks think of human trafficking, they often picture a place far away overseas, but the fact is that it is happening right here--in our backyards many times.  Those being targeted are often children, 12 or 14 years old, sometimes even younger. They are forced to turn tricks up to 50 times a day while their pimps work hard to get them addicted to alcohol and drugs so that they can further control them and their lives. It also deepens their dependence on their trafficker.  Last Congress, we passed significant antitrafficking legislation, which I am incredibly proud of, but there is still more that needs to be done. Time and again, South Dakota advocates tell me that awareness remains a challenge, but a challenge that we can work together to overcome. That is ultimately the purpose of this legislation that we are considering today.  Through the enhanced Blue Campaign, we can offer Americans from all walks of life the information that they need to spot trafficking in their backyards. If more people are aware of distress signals and how to respond, we can move faster towards ending human trafficking together.  Mr.Speaker, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.1370.

On that hallowed ground, I made it a point to seek out someone I served with, a gentleman by the name of Brendan I served with Mr.Looney in He was an intelligence officer back then. Both of us made sure that we wanted to do more. I went forward, but Brendan Looney wanted to do more than just that: he wanted to become a SEAL, and he did. He served in Iraq and he served in It was in 2010 when the Blackhawk he was riding in went down and crashed, killing everybody onboard.  Now, Brendan is interred in area 60 at Arlington National Cemetery right along with his brethren, with his brother in arms, Travis I looked at Travis Manion's tombstone, and on that tombstone is a quote that I would like to share. On that tombstone, it says:       If not me, then who?  And right next to Mr.Manion's tombstone was another 19-year-old who was interred there, a veteran of the global war on terrorism. And on his tombstone was a quote that I would like to share. It said:       I just want to do my part.  Mr.Speaker, it is this attitude that was inscribed on those tombstones which is the attitude of this generation of veterans who served in the global war on terrorism, my generation, our generation, men and women who didn't step back; instead, they stepped forward. They didn't just step forward; they ran forward, they ran to the fight.  Now, also at Arlington National Cemetery was another quote that I would like to share, and it was from John The quote that they had up there by his tomb was from one of his speeches, in which he stated:       In the long history of the world, only a few generations      have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour      of maximum danger.

So, Mr.Speaker, I believe that it is important to have this memorial because the families, the friends, the men and women of this country should not just have to go to cemeteries to honor those who served and paid the ultimate sacrifice. That is why I stand here, Mr.Speaker, in full support of the memorial here on the National Mall to not just honor, but to celebrate the service and the sacrifice of the veterans of the global war on terrorism.

He promised to hold China accountable and label them a currency manipulator. He reversed that pledge.  He promised to drain the swamp, but he has done just the opposite. He stacked the Cabinet with wealthy insiders; and his White House is filled with friends, family, and a stunning display of nepotism and conflicts of interest.

The President was referring, of course, to the House-passed TrumpCare legislation, which pulls the rug from under millions of Americans, raising their costs, gutting their protections, and, for many, taking away their coverage.  And while we do not know the extent of the damage the Senate Republicans' secret health bill would cause, we do know its consequences would be disastrous. We do know, for instance, that the Senate Republicans plan to gut essential health benefits and destroy the Medicaid expansion.  TrumpCare is fundamentally flawed. Higher costs, less coverage, fewer protections, that is the gift from the Republican Party to the American people. The bill would also destroy millions of jobs--nearly 14,000 jobs in my State of New Jersey next year alone.  TrumpCare is an ugly bill being advanced through an ugly process.

I am ready to get to work on a simpler Tax Code that is fiscally responsible, makes our businesses more competitive, and gives relief to our working families. But President Trump's plan, if you can call it that, is not the answer.  According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump's tax plan will cost $5.5 trillion over the next 10 years. Instead of targeting relief to the deserving middle class, President Trump wants to give big breaks to the wealthiest It is time to stop pretending that tax cuts that favor the wealthy somehow pay for themselves. They don't.  Conservative economist Gregory Mankiw has said that only one-third of the cost of tax costs is recouped from growth. So Trump's tax plan would actually be paid for by blowing up the national debt. That will crowd out investment and hurt economic growth, which is the opposite of what we want.

13776,topic-id,2255,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about an issue that Members on both sides of this aisle have a deep concern about, and that is human sex trafficking and, specifically, the work we have done to try to stop one website called backpage.com from selling people online.  This morning, I--along with my colleagues Tom Carper and Claire McCaskill--announced that we have asked the Department of Justice to investigate backpage.com for criminal[[Page S3977]]violations of the law. This is a criminal referral, and it is a new development in this case. We believe there is sufficient evidence to warrant this criminal review by the Justice Department, based on the work that we have done in the Permanent Subcommittee on  With estimated revenues of more than $150 million a year, backpage.com is a market leader in commercial sex trafficking and has been linked to hundreds of reported cases of sex trafficking, including trafficking vulnerable women and children. Backpage has claimed that it ``leads the industry'' in its screening of advertisements for illegal activity, including sex ads for children. That is simply not true. In fact, we now know that this website has long facilitated sex trafficking on its site so that it can increase its profits--profits that come at the expense of those being trafficked, including children.  When victims or State authorities try to bring actions against this company, backpage has evaded responsibility by saying that it doesn't write the ads for sex; it just publishes. Frankly, as a rule, courts have sided with the company, citing the immunity granted by a Federal law that is called the Communications Decency The law, in essence, says that if a company like backpage publishes an ad someone else gives them, they are not liable, even though, again in this case, we know that this website has long facilitated sex trafficking and they know what they are doing.  We also now know that backpage has actively edited words and images, which makes them cocreators of these ads. We also know from a new report in the Washington Post just this week that, despite claims, backpage has aggressively solicited and created sex-related ads designed to lure customers. It further demonstrates that backpage is not merely a passive publisher of third-party content. They are involved. The article found that backpage workers were active cocreators of many of these sex advertisements, including those that seek to traffic women and young, underage girls.  I believe the legal consequences should be that they should lose their immunity under the Communications Decency Act, and that is why we have asked the Justice Department today to review this matter.  Let me be clear about the Communications Decency It has an important purpose. It is a well-intentioned law. It was enacted back in 1996 to protect online publishers, and I support the broader legislation, the Communications Decency But the law was not intended to protect those who knowingly violate the law and facilitate illegal conduct, and it was never intended to protect those who knowingly facilitate the sex trafficking of vulnerable women and girls.  We are actively exploring legislation to fix this issue once and for all. I have been working with a bipartisan group of Senators on potential legislation, and I am hopeful that will soon be introduced in the U.We must protect women and underage girls and hold accountable websites that knowingly facilitate these types of criminal exploitations.  A couple of weeks ago, I was at a place in Ohio called the Ranch of Opportunity in Washington Court The Ranch of Opportunity opened its doors in the latter part of 2013. It is on a 22-acre site, a tranquil setting, a peaceful, spacious, and healthy environment for girls between 13 and 18 to help find healing and recovery during a residential program.  The ranch is a place of hope. As it says in its name, it is a ranch of opportunity, and a lot of the girls who spend time at the ranch have been victims of human trafficking and child abuse. In fact, I am told that the majority--roughly 60 to 80 percent--of the young girls who come through this program have been trafficked.  As I have talked to some of the girls and the staff there, of course, backpage.com comes up again and again, as it always does when I talk to survivors and victims of human trafficking. These types of crimes--sexual abuse and trafficking--are horrific, but they are happening. They are happening all over the country, and they are happening more and more. So in your community, wherever you live, sadly I will tell you that this is a problem. Part of it is because of these online traffickers. In other words, as many of the survivors of human trafficking have told me: Rob, this has moved from the street corner to the smartphone, and the smartphone is where backpage.com dominates.  In touring the State, I have heard over and over again about this specific link between drugs and human trafficking. I have talked to trafficking survivors who have told me that their trafficker first got them hooked on heroin and other drugs. I saw this firsthand in May, when I toured the Salvation Army of Greater Cleveland Harbor Light They have been operating in Cleveland for 65 years, providing incredibly important services to some of the most vulnerable members of society, including women who have been trafficked. It is important to know that link is there.  Both of those issues are so important to address--trafficking and what is happening in terms of the increasing heroin and prescription drug and fentanyl crisis in this country, which is now at epidemic levels. That is why the STOP Act is so important--the Synthetic Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, which we are trying to get passed here, as well as the Prescription Drug Monitoring Act, which is so important. There is a connection.  Human trafficking requires urgent action, and so does the opioid epidemic. On human trafficking, including sex trafficking, we are now told it is a $150 billion a year industry. Think about that. It is the second biggest criminal enterprise in the world behind the drug trade. Unfortunately, again, it is happening in all of our  Just last month, a 26-year-old man was indicted on human trafficking charges. He used backpage.com to advertise the availability of two girls, ages 15 and 17. He advertised them for sex and trafficked them out to several hotels in the area. Thankfully, in this case, members of the Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force rescued both of the victims, one in Columbus and one in  Cases like this are alarming, but they are happening all over the place. At the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, experts on this issue report an 846-percent increase in reports of suspected child sex trafficking from 2010 to 2015. That is an increase of more than 800 percent in 5 years. The organization found this spike to be ``directly correlated to the increased use of the internet to sell children for sex.'' Again, it is the dark side of the internet, and trafficking has now moved from the street corner to the cell phone.  To confront this problem, as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, along with my colleague and ranking member, Senator Claire McCaskill, now Senator Tom Carper, I opened a bipartisan investigation into sex traffickers and their use of the internet. The investigation began over 2 years ago. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children now says that nearly three-fourths--73 percent--of all suspected child sex trafficking reports it receives from the general public are linked to one website, backpage.com.  According to leading anti-trafficking organizations, including Shared Hope International, service providers working with child sex trafficking victims have reported that between 80 percent and 100 percent of their clients have been bought and sold on backpage.com. Backpage now operates in 97 countries--934 cities worldwide--and is valued at well over one-half billion dollars. According to an industry analysis, in 2013, $8 of every $10 spent on online commercial sex trafficking advertising in the United States goes to this one website, backpage.com.  As I said earlier, they say that they lead the industry in screening; in fact, their top lawyer described their screening process as a key tool for disrupting and eventually ending human trafficking. That is not true. Despite these boasts, the website and its owners have consistently refused to cooperate with our investigations on the Permanent Subcommittee on With regard to our inquiries, despite subpoenas for company documents on how they screen advertisements, they have also refused to provide us documents after a subpoena. As a result, this body, the U.Senate, last year, for the first time in more than 20 years, voted to[[Page S3978]]pass a civil contempt citation--in other words, holding backpage.com in contempt and requiring them to supply these documents and come forward with this information or else face a lawsuit and potential criminal violations. Finally, last August, after going through the district court, the Circuit Court, all the way to the Supreme Court, we were able to get their request to appeal it rejected, and we were able to get the documents.  Over 1 million documents were eventually turned over, including emails and internal documents. We went through them all, and what we found was very troubling, to say the least. After reviewing the documents, the subcommittee published a staff report in January that conclusively showed that backpage is more deeply complicit in online, underage sex trafficking than anyone ever imagined. The report shows that backpage has knowingly covered up evidence by systematically deleting words and images suggestive of the illegal conduct, including child sex trafficking. The editing process sanitized the content of millions of advertisements in order to hide important evidence from law enforcement. I encourage people to take a look at this report. They can look at it on our website and other websites here from myself or Senator  Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer personally directed his employees to create an electronic filter to delete hundreds of words indicative of sex trafficking or prostitution from ads before they were published. In other words, they knew these ads were about selling girls, selling women online; yet they published them.  Again, this filter they used did not reject ads because of the obvious illegal activity. They edited the ads only to try to cover up the illegal activity. It didn't change what was advertised; it changed the way it was advertised. Backpage did nothing to stop this criminal activity. They facilitated it, knowingly.  What did they do? Well, afraid to erode their profits--they were afraid because, as Mr.Ferrer said, in his words, it would ``piss off a lot'' of customers. They began deleting words. Beginning in 2010, backpage automatically deleted words including ``lolita,'' referencing a 12-year-old girl in a book sold for sex, ``teenage,'' ``rape,'' ``young,'' ``little girl,'' ``teen,'' ``fresh,'' ``innocent,'' ``school girl,'' even ``amber alert''--and then they published the edited versions of those ads on their website. They also systematically deleted dozens of words related to prostitution. This filter made these deletions before anyone at backpage even looked at the ad.  When law enforcement officials asked for more information about the suspicious ads, backpage had destroyed the original ad posted by the trafficker, so the evidence was gone. This notion that they were trying to help law enforcement flies in the face of the fact that they actually destroyed the evidence that would have helped law enforcement.  We will never know for sure how many girls and women were victimized as a result of this activity. By backpage's own estimate, the company was editing 70 to 80 percent of the ads in their adult section by late 2010. Based on our best estimate, this means that backpage was editing more than one-half million ads a year--more than one-half million ads a year.  At a hearing on the report, the backpage CEO and other company officials pled the Fifth Amendment, invoking their right against self-incrimination rather than responding to questions we had about the report and its findings.  We also heard powerful testimony from parents whose children had been trafficked on backpage. One mother talked about seeing her missing daughter's photograph on backpage. She frantically called the company to tell them that it was her daughter--they finally found her--and to please take down the ad. Their response: Did you post the ad?  Her response: Of course I didn't post the ad. That's my daughter. Please take down the ad.  Their response: We can take it down only if you pay for the ad.  Talk about heartless.  Based on our report, it is clear that backpage actively facilitated sex trafficking taking place on its website in order to increase profits at the expense of vulnerable women and children. Then, after the fact, they covered up the evidence of these crimes.  What is happening to these kids is terrible. It is not just tragic. To me, it is evil.  No one is interested in shutting down legitimate commercial activity and speech. As I said earlier, the Communication Decency Act plays an important role, but we want to stop this criminal activity.  I see some of my colleagues are here to speak. I appreciate their allowing me to finish, but I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in reforming these laws to be able to protect these innocent victims, these children.  I yield back my time.  The PRESIDING The Senator from North  ",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgS3971-2.txt,924,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,13.0,July
13852,topic-id,1829,"Mr.President, I rise tonight to talk about the Portman amendment and about the broader substitute that repeals and replaces the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as  Is this replacement perfect? I don't think any replacement is. But it is a big improvement over the status quo. The status quo on healthcare is simply no longer sustainable.  It isn't working for We heard a lot about the middle-class squeeze in Ohio, and it is real. Wages are flat and expenses are up. For most folks, the biggest single expense is healthcare costs. It is the fastest growing expense because of higher premiums and higher deductibles.  It wasn't supposed to be this way. In fact, when the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--was enacted in 2010, we heard a lot of promises about lower costs. They promised that ObamaCare would bring down premium costs by 2,500 bucks for the average family, but we now know that families have seen their premiums skyrocket. According to the Ohio Department of Insurance, health insurance premiums on the individual market in Ohio have nearly doubled since the Affordable Care Act went into effect 7 years ago. Small business premiums have gone up 82 percent. Premiums for this year are up double-digits, and next year we all expect the same. No one can afford that.  To make matters worse, we have seen a sharp increase in deductibles. For a lot of people covered by insurance, they feel as though they really don't have health care insurance at all because their out-of-pocket expenses are so high and deductibles are so high, they really can't access it.  These higher premiums and deductibles have already made healthcare unaffordable for a lot of hard-working But it is not just about costs, it is also about choice. Some people are losing their coverage altogether because the policies established in the Affordable Care Act were set up for failure.  Fifteen of the 23 nonprofit insurers set up around the country as co-ops around the Affordable Care Act have now gone bankrupt. One was in Last year in my State, 22,000 hard-working Ohioans lost their coverage because our co-op declared bankruptcy. Many of them, by the way, had already paid their deductibles on that, and they lost that as well.  Worse than that even, right now there are 19 counties in Ohio without a single insurance company in the exchange market, the individual market--not one insurance company. Another 27 counties in Ohio have only 1 insurer. That is not competition. That is not choice. Far too many Ohioans--thousands of them--if they want health insurance, are told they have to move out of their county to another county.  Less competition has also meant less choices and higher costs for Ohio families and cost shifting on to employer-based plans. As these insurance companies have lost money, some of them haven't left Ohio, but they shifted their costs to other people. That is why so many people's costs have gone up.  Without competition and choice in the market, we are never going to be able to lower healthcare costs for families and small businesses. That is one more reason why the status quo on healthcare, the system we have now, is not sustainable.  The Affordable Care Act has failed to meet the promises that were made, but we can do better, and we have to do better. It is our job to do better, but we should do it in a way that protects low-income beneficiaries of Medicaid, that protects the most vulnerable in our We can do that too.  At the outset of this debate and consistently throughout the debate, I have[[Page S4178]]said my goal was to create a more workable healthcare system that lowers the cost of coverage and provides access to affordable care while protecting the most vulnerable. This most recent version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act--as my colleague just called it, BCRA.3--is an improvement over the House bill, but it is also an improvement over the previous Senate bill. This measure includes reforms that will help lower premiums on families and small businesses. The 1 priority out there should be to lower those costs. This bill will help lower those premiums.  Throughout the process, I have expressed my concerns about how we deal with Medicaid, which is a critically important Federal program that provides healthcare benefits to about 70 million Americans who live below the Federal poverty line. The Affordable Care Act allowed States, including Ohio, to expand Medicaid eligibility actually above the poverty line, to 138 percent of poverty, and to cover single adults.  With our growing debt and deficits, we know the current Medicaid Program is not financially sustainable over the long term, and we have to look for innovation and reform to protect and preserve it now so that Ohioans can count on this program in the future and so that those who need it will have it.  My point all along has been that these reforms can and should be done in a way that doesn't pull the rug out from under people and gives States time to adjust. So, in this Senate bill, I have worked to put Medicaid expansion on a glidepath for 6 years, with the current law for 3 years and then a transition for another 3 years. That transition would be to a new healthcare system. This is a big improvement over the House bill, which had a cliff in 2 years without a glidepath.  Just as important, in this substitute before us, Governors would have new flexibility in this legislation to design innovative Medicaid Programs that meet the needs of their States and their expansion populations.  One issue I have focused on a lot in this discussion has been the opioid epidemic. In my own State of Ohio, this epidemic has had a devastating effect. About 200,000 Ohioans now suffer from drug addiction, primarily from heroin and prescription drugs and the new synthetic heroins, such as fentanyl. Unbelievably, I will tell you that about half of the funds we spend in expanded Medicaid in Ohio go for one purpose, and that is mental health and substance abuse treatment, primarily driven by addiction to heroin and prescription drugs and fentanyl.  We have to deal with this issue in a smart way. In this latest version of the substitute, that is why I fought to provide not only that transition for those on expanded Medicaid but also an additional and unprecedented $45 billion in new resources for States to address the opioid epidemic. I am pleased to say that in the legislation we are going to vote on tonight, it is included. We want those receiving opioid treatment under Medicaid expansion to maintain access to treatment as they work to get back on their feet. This new funding is critical to help with regard to that treatment and longer term recovery.  An additional issue I have been working on is to ensure that those on expanded Medicaid are able to find affordable healthcare options under a new system, whether it is under the new Medicaid structure or affordable healthcare options in the private sector on the private market. Over the past few weeks, I have worked with the President, the Vice President, administration officials, and many of my colleagues on ways to improve this bill further in this regard, to help out low-income Ohioans and others who are trying to find affordable coverage. That is why this proposal before us, the Portman amendment, is so important.  By the way, it is called the Portman amendment, but it is the result of the work of a lot of different Senators, some of whom I saw on the floor earlier and one I see here tonight. Senator Capito, who has been a leader on this, and Senators Hoeven, Gardner, Sullivan, Cassidy, Young, Boozman, Heller, Murkowski, and others, have worked on this proposal.  I am pleased that we have received a commitment that the Senate will vote tonight on this approach to help those on Medicaid expansion and other low-income Americans get access to affordable healthcare in the private market.  This plan has two parts. First, it provides an additional $100 billion to the long-term stability fund in the Better Care Reconciliation Act to help people with out-of-pocket expenses, such as deductibles and copays, thus ensuring that those who transition from Medicaid expansion into private insurance under a new system not only have the tax credit to help them, which is part of the underlying bill, but also have this additional help for affordable coverage options.  Second, it is a Medicaid wraparound that allows States to provide cost-sharing assistance to low-income individuals who transition from Medicaid to private insurance and receive a tax credit on the exchange. The States could use this flexibility in combination with this long-term stability fund increase--the additional dollars I am talking about--to assist individuals with their deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, and copays.  It would also allow the States to capture Federal Medicaid matched dollars to supplement the tax credits under the Better Care Act without having to seek and renew existing waiver authority.  This Medicaid wraparound is already available through a waiver, but we think it is critically important to put it in a statute so that other administrators and the current ones--Seema Verma has said she supports this waiver being granted--but others will grant it, and you don't have to renew this waiver or beg for a waiver. It is a commonsense way to help get people who are going into private plans the help they need to be able to afford the premiums, deductibles, and copays.  This is a commonsense approach to help ensure that these low-income Americans have access to affordable care, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  We must do better than the Affordable Care I have heard from people across Ohio on both sides of this debate. Trust me, I have heard a lot. There is a lot of passion. I understand that. But it is interesting, the common denominator in many of these discussions is that doing nothing is not sustainable. Pretty much everybody acknowledges that the status quo is not working. Ohioans deserve action.  In my view, to throw in the towel and give up on finding a better alternative is to give up on Ohio's families, give up on Ohio's small businesses, and I am not willing to do that.  We all know the Affordable Care Act has not lived up to its promises to the American people. Today, after 7 years of consistently calling for repeal and replace, I am supporting a sensible plan to do just that. Is it perfect? I don't think any substitute is. Replacement is hard. But it is an improvement on the unsustainable status quo, and it does help keep our promise to the American people to do better.  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation before us.  I yield back my time.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgS4168-2.txt,924,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,25.0,July

Mr.Speaker, I rise in the strongest support possible for this bill to begin the process of establishing a memorial to honor the servicemembers of our longest war.  5,799 days ago, on a crystal blue September morning, we came face to face with an evil as old as time. Within days, our military was engaged, and within weeks, we sustained our first[[Page H6546]]casualties. Our latest loss happened this very month.  They came from every walk of American life, from the North, the South, the East, the West, every race, color, and creed, men and women.  The memorial authorized in this bill will allow the Nation to remember not only those who did not come home, but also those with life-changing injuries, visible and invisible, the incomprehensible and too often unnoticed stress on the spouses and children of those deployed, and the sacrifices of those who put their stateside lives on hold to serve.  Mr.Speaker, amidst the divisions in our country today, we need this memorial now more than ever, yes, to remember our fallen, but also to bind us together as we reflect upon their sacrifice for the transcendent ideals upon which this country was founded.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin, the gentleman from Arizona, and the gentleman from Massachusetts for their work on this legislation and for their service to our country.

13677,topic-id,516,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy of Andre Larson, who passed away on March 24, 2017, at the age of 74. Larson grew up in Brookings, SD, and graduated from the University of South Dakota, USD, in Vermillion with a BFA in music education and later, a MM degree in music literature.  A lifelong advocate for fine arts and music, Larson created the renowned National Music Museum in Vermillion, on USD's campus. Today it has the most complete collection of well-preserved and historically important musical instruments in the world.[[Page S2614]]  The National Music Museum houses and preserves over 15,000 rare musical instruments: Stradivarius violins, and one of the only two Stradivarius mandolins that exist, dombaks and didgeridoos, the oldest playing harpsicord, more than a dozen saxophones made by the instrument's inventor, Adolphe Sax, bouzoukis, hurdy-gurdies, and a bombardon, a 1772 bowlback mandolin, a Javanese gamelan, lutes, flutes, harmonicas, and zithers, the world's oldest cello, called the King cello and created around 1550 A.D., Johnny Cash's guitar, and everything in-between, including a substantial collection of historic instrument documents.  Andre Larson was inspired by his father, Arne Larson, who was a high school music teacher, bandleader, and later a college music professor. Arne began collecting musical artifacts and instruments while serving in World War II, and his passion for music was not lost on his son, Wanting to share his and his father's passion, Andre conceptualized, planned, and implemented the development of the National Music Museum in In 1972, he was hired as the first director of the museum, then named the Shrine to Music Museum, with his father's 2,500 instruments as the foundation. Andre served as director of the museum until his retirement in 2011.  Under Andre Larson's leadership, the museum expanded significantly from one room in the Carnegie Library to now occupying the entire building today. His intelligence and great knowledge of instruments and history enabled him to select the best instruments for the collection. He also had a very unique skill in matching instruments to generous donors who would allow the museum to showcase their purchases.  In addition to teaching at the University of South Dakota and running the museum, Larson also created, produced, and marketed many musical events every year that sometimes included internationally known musicians performing music with the museum instruments. He also created the Nation's only graduate degree program in the history of musical instruments.  Throughout his life, Larson also served three terms as the president of the American Musical Instrument He edited its newsletter for 18 years, and he was honored with the Curt Sachs Award, the highest honor given by the American Musical Instrument In 2016, he was elected to the South Dakota Hall of Fame for his contributions to the arts in South  Andre Larson's commitment to excellence and his dedication to music have inspired thousands of students and music lovers, not just across South Dakota, but throughout the entire His work in creating the National Music Museum will continue to inspire others for as long as there is music and there are people.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgS2613-3.txt,99999999999999,RECOGNIZING BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA,2017.0,27.0,July

Whereas, in the United States' system of checks and      balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the Executive      Branch of government to a fair and equal standard of      transparency ensuring the public interest is placed first;       Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every      President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return      information to the public;       Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline of      reasonable information including whether the President paid      taxes, ownership interests, charitable donations made, and      whether tax deductions have been exploited;       Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns could      help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016      election understand the President's financial ties to the      Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed      and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity      interests, joint ventures or licensing agreements with Russia      or Russians;       Whereas, the President recently fired Federal Bureau of      Investigation Director James Comey, under whose leadership      the FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded      with Russia to influence the 2016 election;       Whereas, President Trump reportedly stated to Russian      officials during a White House meeting that he fired Director      Comey to ease pressure on the ongoing investigation of      Russia's influence in the 2016 election;       Whereas, Senate Russia investigators have requested      information from the Treasury Department's criminal      investigation division, the Financial Crimes Enforcement      Network, or FinCEN, which handles cases of money laundering,      for information related to President Trump, his top officials      and campaign aides. FinCEN has been investigating allegations      of foreign money-laundering through purchases of U.real      estate;       Whereas, the President's tax returns would show us whether      he has foreign bank accounts and how much profit he receives      from his ownership in myriad partnerships;       Whereas, Donald Trump said the Trump Organization saw      money ``pouring in from Russia'' and that ``Russians make up      a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our      assets.''       Whereas, the White House will not confirm whether the      President has filed a 2016 tax return;       Whereas, Congress gave itself the authority to review an      individual's tax returns to investigate and reveal possible      conflicts of interest of executive branch officials involved      dating back to the Teapot Dome scandal.       Whereas, it has been reported that federal prosecutors have      issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National      Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records as      part of the ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the      2016 election;       Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the      Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial      positions in companies located in the United States and      around the world;       Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the      Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to      divest his ownership stake in his businesses; and can still      withdraw funds at any time from the trust of which he is the      sole beneficiary;       Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.     Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federa1      officials from accepting any ``present, Emolument, Office, or      Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state'';       Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee,      Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee      have the authority to request the President's tax returns      under Section 6103 of the tax code;       Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax      returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the      information public;       Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103      authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax      information of 51 taxpayers;       Whereas Director Comey has testified that tax returns are a      common tool in investigations because they can show income      and motives;       Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether      or not their President is operating under conflicts of      interest related to international affairs, tax reform,      government contracts, or otherwise: Now, therefore, be it:       Resolved,  That the House of Representatives shall--       1. Immediately request the tax return information of Donald      Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed      executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as      provided under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and      vote to report the information therein to the full House of            2.

13692,topic-id,305,"Mr.Speaker, under clause 1 of rule IX, questions of the privileges of the House are those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings. I believe that the dignity of this institution is at risk each day that passes without this body exercising its statutory authority and constitutional duty to operate as a coequal branch of government.  The legislative branch of government has the responsibility and authority to keep a proper check on the executive branch under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Specifically, three committees have jurisdiction to request tax returns: the Committee on Ways and Means, the Senate Finance Committee, and the Joint Committee on This provision has been part of our Federal Tax Code since 1924 to facilitate full and complete investigations into scandals that rise to the level of national importance.  Nothing could rise to the level of national importance like the possible financial entanglements our President may have with Russian entities and individuals. This situation is truly unprecedented. It is our sworn duty to uphold the integrity of this institution and examine all the relevant details related to this issue.  Each week we see yet another fact in the growing case of entanglements between our President, his campaign and closest advisers, and Russian officials. The most recent troubling report occurred just last week when we learned that the President himself reportedly made statements directly to Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting regarding the FBI investigation into his campaign ties with This is the same meeting where the President took it upon himself to reveal highly classified information to Russian officials.  How long can this body allow these types of actions to go unchecked?  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is reminded the remarks must be confined to the question of order.

13693,topic-id,268,"I understand, Mr.I promise that they relate to the question at issue.  Mr.Speaker, further, the American people deserve to know if President Trump has exploited the Federal Tax Code for improper personal gain.  The personal business endeavors of the leader of the free world should be exercised to the highest possible standard. Specifically, the President's business dealings around the world make him more prone to potential conflicts of interest than any President in history. However, the President did not take adequate steps to mitigate any potential issues. He was advised by the Office of Government Ethics to divest himself of his business entanglements. The President chose to ignore this sound advice.  It is now the duty of this body to restore integrity to the oversight process. Our democracy should be an example to the world. Today we have the opportunity to ensure that it is achieved through taking up this overdue investigation. It is only then we can restore the dignity and integrity of the House through exercise of our constitutional duty.

FinCEN has been investigating allegations of foreign money-laundering through purchases of U.real estate;  Whereas, the President's tax returns would show us whether he has foreign bank accounts and how much profit he receives from his ownership in myriad partnerships;  Whereas, Donald Trump, Jr., said The Trump Organization saw money ``pouring in from Russia'' and that ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets'';  Whereas, the White House will not confirm whether the President has filed a 2016 tax return;  Whereas, Congress gave itself the authority to review an individual's tax returns to investigate and reveal possible conflicts of interest of executive branch officials involved dating back to the Teapot Dome scandal;  Whereas, it has been reported that federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records as part of the ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 election;  Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world;  Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses and can still withdraw funds at any time from the trust of which he is the sole beneficiary;  Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federal officials from accepting any ``present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state'';  Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President's tax returns under section 6103 of the tax code;  Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public;  Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers;  Whereas, Director Comey has testified that tax returns are a common tool in investigations because they can show income and motives;  Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise:  Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives shall, one, immediately request the tax return information of Donald Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives;  Two, support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and candidates disclosing their tax returns.

13785,topic-id,1694,"Madam President, I wanted to say a few words about the new Republican healthcare plan that was just announced a few hours ago. While there are some modest changes in it, the truth of the matter is that this plan remains a disaster. It remains an embarrassment. I think the indication that it is an embarrassment is that with legislation that would impact about one-sixth of the American economy of over $3 trillion a year--legislation that, because it is healthcare, impacts virtually everybody--there has not been one public hearing on this legislation. It has all been done behind closed doors. Honestly, no matter what one's view may be on where we as a Nation should go with healthcare, whether you like this bill or you don't like this bill, I just don't know how someone can seriously say that we don't have to hear from physicians about the impact of this legislation on their ability to treat their patients. I just don't know how you do that--or that we don't have to hear from hospitals.  I come from a rural What will the impact of this legislation and the massive $800 billion cuts on Medicaid do to rural hospitals all over the United States? There is some belief that many rural hospitals in areas where they are desperately needed will be forced to shut down. Is that the truth? That is what I hear, but I can't tell you definitively because there hasn't been a hearing on that issue. So I don't know how we go forward with legislation without having administrators from rural hospitals coming before the committee--I am on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--or the Finance Committee to answer that question.  The Presiding Officer comes from a State and I come from a State where we have a major opioid crisis. It is devastating the entire country. What will this bill do to our ability to prevent and treat the opioid crisis, which is decimating this country from one end of America to the other? What happens if you cut $800 billion in Medicaid? How will people get the treatment they need today--which is inadequate? In my State, it is inadequate. I don't think there is a State in the country that today is providing the necessary treatment or prevention capabilities to deal with this opioid and heroin crisis, which is ravaging What impact will an $800 billion cut have on that? I understand there is some additional money going into opioid treatment, but how do you do that without the framework of allowing people the access to get healthcare? If you get thrown off of healthcare, what will the additional opioid money mean? I think not a whole lot.  In this bill, there are still hundreds of billions of dollars--several hundred billion dollars--in tax breaks to large health insurance companies, to drug companies, to medical device companies, and to tanning salons. As a nation, are we really interested in giving significant tax breaks to large insurance companies and then throwing children who have disabilities off of the Medicaid they currently receive? Is that what the American people want? I don't think they do.  I have to tell my colleagues that this Republican legislation, as the Presiding Officer knows, has been opposed by almost every major national healthcare organization in the country, including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the AARP, which is the largest senior group in America, the American Psychiatric Association, the American pediatrics association. Virtually all of the major healthcare groups are saying that this legislation would be a disaster for the people they serve.  Just last night we had a teleconference townhall in Vermont and we had some 15,000, 16,000 people on the phone. The calls that were coming in were very painful calls. I almost didn't want to be honest in answering the calls. A woman calls up and she says: My son has a very serious medical illness, and we spend a fortune on prescription drugs. What is going to happen if this bill passes? What was I going to tell her, that perhaps her son would die? It is just not something I feel comfortable even talking about.[[Page S3982]]  The truth is--and this is not Bernie Sanders talking, this is study after study after study that says that if you do as they did in the House, which is throw 23 million people off of health insurance, including people who are struggling with cancer, people who are struggling with heart disease, people who are struggling with diabetes, what does common sense tell us? If you are struggling with cancer and you lose your health insurance, what do you think is going to happen to you?  What study after study has shown is that thousands of people will die. It is not that any Republican here wants to see anyone die, but that is the consequence of what happens when you throw, as the House bill did, 23 million people off of health insurance. We should not be giving tax breaks to insurance companies and then throwing disabled children, or people with terrible illnesses who are fighting for their lives, off of health insurance.  The AARP is very strongly opposed to this legislation. The reason is pretty clear. What every person in America should understand, and I am not sure that many do, is that Medicaid now pays for over two-thirds of all nursing home care--two-thirds. What happens to the seniors and persons with disabilities who have their nursing home coverage paid for by Medicaid today? What is going to happen to those people?  What happens if your mom is in a nursing home? You don't have a lot of money, and your mom is in a nursing home paid for by What happens if Medicaid is slashed? What is going to happen to your mom? Is she going to be thrown out on the street or end up in the basement of your house? Are you going to have to make the choice about whether you take care of her or put away a few bucks to send your kid to college? If suddenly a daughter or a son is going to have to care for a mom or a dad thrown out of a nursing home, how do they go to work to earn the money their families need?  These are legitimate questions, and it would have been nice to have a hearing or two in order to answer those questions.  The bottom line is that we have legislation before us that is widely rejected by the American people. The last poll that I saw, which was done by USA Today, suggested that 12 percent of the American people supported this legislation--12 percent. Virtually every major healthcare organization in America opposes this legislation. There is nothing I have seen today--none of the tweaks that have been put into this make this legislation in any way, shape, or form acceptable.  It is no great secret that the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. I don't think you hear anybody here say: Hey, the ACA is great; it doesn't need any changes. It does need changes. Deductibles are far too high in Premiums are too high. Copayments are too high. And the cost of prescription drugs in Vermont and all over this country is off the charts.  I was in West Virginia, and I talked to a woman for a moment after I spoke, and she said that she is taking care of her older brother. Her brother has seizures. The medicine her brother was using went up by 900 percent over the last few years. Why? Because that is what the drug companies can get away with. Tomorrow it may be 1,000 percent. Does anybody in America think that makes sense? Is anybody happy in America? Are people in Missouri happy, are people in West Virginia and people in Vermont happy that we are paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? I don't think so. There are ideas out there about how we can significantly lower the costs of prescription drugs in this country, how we can lower deductibles, how we can lower copayments.  Now, as I have said many, many times, I happen to believe that while it is important that we improve the Affordable Care Act, at the end of the day, this country must do what every other major country on Earth does, and that is to understand that healthcare is a right, not a privilege.  Right now, we have 28 million people who have zero health insurance. If this bill in the House were to go through, there would be another 23 million on top of the 28--over 50 million people--without any health insurance. Does that make any sense to anybody?  Our job is to join the rest of the industrialized world and make sure that every man, woman, and child has healthcare as a right, no matter what your income is. When you get sick, you go to the doctor. When you have to go to the hospital, you don't go bankrupt. That is what a civilized democracy is about. That is what they do in That is what they do in the UK, France, Germany, Scandinavia, and Every major country on Earth guarantees healthcare to all people. That is where I want to see our country go, and I will be introducing legislation to make sure that happens.  More and more people all over this country want to move us in that direction. But right now, our job is to make sure that millions of people do not lose their health insurance in order to give tax breaks to insurance companies. Our job is to make sure that disabled children continue to get the care they need and older folks aren't thrown out of nursing homes. That is what we have to do.  So I urge in the strongest possible way the defeat of this legislation. Then, let's go forward to improve the Affordable Care Act, not destroy it.  I yield the floor.

13847,topic-id,861,"Mr.President, we just took one of the most reckless legislative actions in this body's history. We are blowing up the American healthcare system, and we don't even know what comes next.  I want to be clear. The Senate has never before voted on major legislation that would reorder about one-sixth or one-fifth of the American economy and impact millions of lives without actually knowing what the bill would even do.  There has been no bipartisanship. There has been talk of it, but there have been no real discussions. There have been no public hearings. Let me say something about hearings. This is not a technical point. This is the way a legislative body does its work. This is the way we figure out whether our bill is any good or not.  This is the way the Senate has always worked. We don't do major legislation without hearings. But that is what we are doing today, and that is because people don't want to disclose what is in this bill.  It is true that we don't know exactly what is in the bill, but we can be sure of a few things. First, whatever problems there are with the ACA, this bill doesn't even bother to take a swing at them. To the extent people are worried about high deductibles, it will increase the deductibles. To the degree people are worried about the choices on the exchanges, it doesn't even try to solve that problem.  We don't know exactly how much Medicaid will be cut, whether it is just rolling back the Medicaid expansion or making these radical structural reforms, but we know there will be deep cuts to This will hurt people. It will hurt people in nursing homes. It will hurt people with drug addiction. Medicaid is a program that works for tens of millions of Americans, and it will be slashed massively.  We don't know whether they are going to get rid of the capital gains tax or just other revenue, but we know they are going to reduce many of the taxes in the original Affordable Care Act, and they are going to pay for it by cutting  So under the guise of fixing the ACA, they are actually doing nothing about What they are doing is cutting taxes and cutting We don't know exactly what is in the bill, but we do know that.  People are going to be hurt--people with preexisting conditions, families with loved ones struggling with opioid abuse, people in nursing homes, people who rely on Planned Parenthood, and the tens of millions of people who will lose their insurance almost instantly. That is why every group--from the American Medical Association to the nurses, to the American Cancer Society, to the March of Dimes, to the National Physicians Alliance, and the AARP--opposes this bill. There are 14 different versions of this bill, but, actually, these organizations oppose them all.  There are some core elements of the vote we took that are going to be true no matter what. It will cut Medicaid and cut taxes. It will reduce patient protections. It will reduce the number of people who have insurance.  It was all done with no hearings, with no Democrats, with no experts on healthcare. This thing is going to be dropped on us without enough time to review it and without enough time to interact with our home State and figure out the impact.  Make no mistake, the reason they will not tell you what is going to be in the final bill is because the moment they do, this thing will come crashing down. What the American people have to do is to make sure that this thing comes crashing down anyway. We have to do it for the tens of millions of Americans who depend on Medicaid and the We have to do it for our rural hospitals. We have to do it for the people with preexisting conditions. We have to do it for the people without power, without money, without the ability to walk 200 yards from this gilded Chamber and get the best healthcare in the world.  I will be fine. All the Members of this Chamber will be fine. But our job is not to take care of ourselves. Our job is to represent our constituents, and this bill has earned the title of most unpopular major bill in American history, most unpopular major legislation in American history.

Well, I was encouraged to hear the majority leader say that because I don't think bipartisanship should be a last resort. I think it should be the starting point. It should be the beginning of the work we do in this Chamber because that is what the American people want and that is the best way to make lasting public policy.  This is especially true with healthcare legislation, which impacts families all across As we have been hearing--and I have had a chance to hear it directly from my constituents in New Hampshire--the American people have wanted all along for to take a bipartisan approach. It is unfortunate that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent months trying to pass a partisan, deeply unpopular bill.  Now, I think we would all agree that there are changes we need to make in the Affordable Care Act, something for which I have advocated since we passed the law. I have had the opportunity to work with our colleague Tim Scott from South In 2015, we worked together to make modest changes to the law to protect small businesses from excessive premium increases. I think that bipartisan approach is something with which, if we started today, we could make changes in the Affordable Care Act to improve it and to make sure that Americans could get better access to healthcare.  We all understand that there are problems currently in the market in terms of premium increases, and we know why these premium increases are happening. In their 2018 rate request filings, insurers justified the increases because of the uncertainty surrounding the repeal of the ACA and because this administration refuses to commit to making what are called cost-sharing reduction payments.  These payments were included as part of the Affordable Care Act to address premiums, deductibles, and copayments and to make them more affordable for working families, basically, to be able to help people afford insurance. The payments have been built into the rates that insurers are charging for 2017. But as we look ahead to 2018, there is a big problem because, if there is uncertainty around those payments, it means premiums will skyrockets, insurers will leave marketplaces, and people will lose their health coverage. Now, we could fix this today if we were willing to work together, because we know what we need to do.  I think New Hampshire offers a vivid example of what we are seeing across the country. Last year, insurance markets were stable, health insurance premiums increased an average of just 2 percent in New Hampshire--the lowest annual increase in the country and in our State's history. Unfortunately, today, because of the uncertainty in the market, it is a very different story.  Insurers in New Hampshire are raising premiums for 2018. The same thing is happening across the country. In some cases, insurers are filing two different sets of rates--one premised on the administration's continuing to make those cost-sharing payments that I talked about earlier, and the second set with higher premiums to account for continuing uncertainty and the possibility that the Trump administration, which is legally charged with implementing the Affordable Care Act, is going to renege on making the payments that have been promised to insurers and, ultimately, to families so that they can get healthcare.  This uncertainty is completely unnecessary. The instability in the ACA marketplaces is a manufactured crisis, and we could put a stop to it today. That is why I have introduced the Marketplace Certainty Act, a bill to permanently appropriate funds that would expand the cost-sharing reduction payments and ensure that we can count on those payments being made.  I am pleased to be joined by 25 other Senators who have already cosponsored this bill, and we can pass this right now if we had agreement with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  The Marketplace Certainty Act is also supported by a broad spectrum of provider and patient advocate groups--including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association, and the National Association of Community Health Centers, just to name a few.  We can end the artificial crisis. We could immediately restore certainty and stability to the health insurance markets. In turn, this would give us the space we need to come together on a bipartisan basis to improve the Affordable Care Act, to strengthen what is working, and to fix what is not working. That is what we were sent to Washington to do.  Bipartisanship should be our first choice, not a last resort. The American people want us to stop bickering over healthcare, to work together, and to make the commonsense improvements to the law that we should be making.  I yield the floor.

Now, a week earlier we had tax day, and millions of Americans across this country, including in Los Angeles, needed to demonstrate to try to get Donald Trump to reveal his tax returns. Every President since Richard Nixon has released their tax returns. Donald Trump told us in May of 2014: If I decide to run for office, I will produce my tax returns. And he said it again a year later. And then he said it during the Republican debate in 2016. He said: Oh, I will release my tax returns, but they are under audit.  Well, according to Donald Trump, his 2011 and 2012 returns aren't under audit. He ought to release those. But he ought to release all of his tax returns. And this idea that they are under audit is absolutely absurd.  The IRS has made it clear: Any taxpayer can release their tax return, whether they are under audit or not, and everyone in the tax world--I headed the second largest tax agency in this country for several years, I am a CPA--knows that you can release your tax returns whether you are under audit or not.  Now, I understand that you don't want to release information to your adversary, and if you are being audited, the IRS is your adversary. But Donald Trump knows that the IRS already has his tax returns, so who is the adversary from which Donald Trump is withholding information? The American people are the adversary that cannot see his tax return that the IRS already has.  But it is not enough to just see Donald Trump's Form 1040, because he tells us that he has 532 private businesses, secret businesses in the sense that they do not report their financial information to the SEC, over 532 of those business entity investments. We need to see the tax returns of every business entity that Trump controls. Over 100 of[[Page H2818]]those investments are in foreign countries.

Then, if something happens, he will find out it is just a bunch of junk and that it does not cover anything. That is going to be legal again. Right now, it is not legal to do that. With health reform, we stopped that. But that would be legal again under this proposal, and I am deeply concerned about that.  I am obviously rising to talk about the Republican healthcare bill. I do not believe it is a healthcare bill, but that is what we are debating, is healthcare or whether healthcare will be taken away. What I would rather be doing is working with my friend who is in the chair on lowering the cost of prescription drugs. We have worked on many things together--mental health and addiction services. I would rather be doing that than debating what we are debating. I would rather be focused on how we lower the cost of prescription drugs, which is the cost I hear about the most from my constituents, or about other out-of-pocket costs for people who are in the private insurance system, the individual insurance market.  We do have situations in which copays and deductibles are too high in the private insurance market. Gutting Medicaid will do nothing about that--nothing. It will just take away healthcare from tens of millions of people. It will not change the private insurance market at all, which is where I believe we need to focus, and I am anxious to do that and work across the aisle in order to do that.  I want to make sure we are talking about building on healthcare coverage, lowering costs, and tackling prescription drug costs. Instead, this bill would take away healthcare from millions of We know that from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget We don't know yet how many millions under the current version, but we know that at some point, we will get a score on that from the Budget We know it will be a lot of people who are going to lose their insurance, and they don't need to lose their insurance in order to tackle bringing down the cost of insurance.  So what do we know about this proposal? The versions keep changing, but it is the same old song over and over again--a little bit of change, a little bit of different refrain, but it is the same old song in the end. What we know is that doctors don't like it and nurses don't like it, hospitals don't like it, insurance companies don't like it.  People in Michigan don't like it. They have called and written and told me in person, people approaching me in Fourth of July parades. People are scared. They are concerned. A woman's mom is in a nursing home who has Alzheimer's disease, and she is panicked. Three out of five seniors in nursing homes in Michigan are there with the help of Medicaid health insurance. Others are deeply concerned about their family members, their children, themselves.  This is called the Better Care Act, but there is nothing better about it. Democrats have ideas to actually make our healthcare system better, by stabilizing our insurance markets and making premiums more affordable. My friend Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire introduced the Marketplace Certainty It would ensure cost-sharing payments that were part of healthcare reform, that they would actually remain in a stabilizing way so they could be counted on. This would offer peace of mind to families and stability to the market.  Senators Carper, Kaine, Nelson, and Shaheen introduced the Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act, which would create a permanent reinsurance program, which we had before--before it was changed 2 years ago--to stabilize the market and bring down premiums.  There have been things that would happen to destabilize the markets. Two years ago, there was an action, and now with a new administration we need to stop that and reverse it and stabilize the markets.  Senator Heitkamp has a proposal that helps more families afford health insurance by smoothing out the individual market tax credit cliff that is there--the tax credits that help low-income, moderate-income people be able to afford insurance--to fix that in a way that is more beneficial to families.  Senator McCaskill's Health Care Options for All Act would allow people who live in a county without an insurer on the exchange--they don't have anybody in the private individual marketplace exchange, no insurance company--to sign up for the same exchange plans we have. There are people being covered. We hear a lot about Iowa, for instance. Even though there may be no private insurance companies doing a private marketplace option, Senators, Representatives, our staffs who are required to be in, as they say, ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act, have an exchange. So to help people immediately, we could allow the people of Iowa to get the same option that their Members of Congress in Iowa have and that their staffs have. That would be possible, as a way to address this issue in the short run and to help people. I don't know why somebody who is in Iowa or Michigan or anyplace else shouldn't be able to get the exact same coverage a Member of Congress can get.  Here is what we do know in terms of the ideas in the bill. Our Republican colleagues know how unpopular the bill is. A new poll found that only 12 percent--12 percent--of Americans support this bill. It is so unpopular they have been trying to rewrite it and get enough votes to pass it. We keep hearing about changes, but unfortunately none of these amendments make it better. In some cases, like the junk insurance policies that will be allowed, they actually make it worse.  Now, the proposal that would provide $45 million to tackle the opioid epidemic, even Republican Ohio John Kasich said it would be like spitting in the ocean. It is not enough, he said. I appreciate the focus on that. It is a horrible epidemic. It is an epidemic in Michigan and across the country, but it is certainly not enough to make up for the huge cuts to Medicaid insurance--healthcare insurance, as the Senator from Washington State indicated.  The other proposal that we understand is in the new bill, as I mentioned before, would give insurers the freedom to once again refuse to cover basic health services like maternity care or addiction treatment, as long as one plan they offer, among many, would include essential health benefits. So everything else could be junk, and there would be one high-cost plan that would actually cover things families need.  Insurance companies themselves know this is a terrible idea. In a letter to Senator Cruz and Senator Lee, Scott Serota, president and CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, wrote that their plan ``is unworkable as it would undermine pre-existing condition protections, increase premiums and destabilize the market.'' That is what is viewed as this great new provision in the bill.  He added: ``The result would be higher premiums, increased federal tax credit costs for coverage available on exchanges, and insurers exiting the market or pricing coverage out of reach of consumers.''  In other words, premiums would skyrocket for older people, people who take prescription drug medications, people with chronic conditions. Everyone else would be left with the junk insurance policy that doesn't cover really anything, and they feel OK unless they get sick. We would all be stuck with a fragmented, destabilized insurance market.  Remember preexisting conditions? This would bring them right back.  This bill is wrong for many, many people, but let me mention In 2011, she was an AmeriCorps member serving in Lansing who didn't have health insurance. When she started feeling tired all the time and losing weight, she went to the Center for Family Health in  Felicia was diagnosed with stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma. The Center for Family Health helped her get coverage through Medicaid and care at the University of Michigan, including chemotherapy and later a stem cell transplant.  Felicia writes:       Now I am feeling awesome. I am cancer-free, and I am      working part time while I am[[Page S3988]]     finishing up college. I feel that I owe my life to the Center      for Family  Felicia knows the importance of comprehensive health coverage. It saved her life.  Nick and Chelsey know it too. They and their three young children are covered by Healthy Michigan, our State's Medicaid expansion. Nick and Chelsey are both employed full time. Chelsey also attends college full time.  During a routine visit, doctors discovered that her oldest son was born with an obstructed kidney, which had lost one-third of its function by the time he was 5 years old. Thanks to the Medicaid expansion, he was able to have surgery before his kidney lost all function. Without the Medicaid expansion, which ends under the Republican bill, these working parents and their three children couldn't afford healthcare coverage, let alone surgery.  Margo knows this because she sees it every day. She manages a clinic in Kent County on the west side of the She said the lives of patients are much different today than they were a few years ago. Margo wrote:       Seeing working people who have struggled all of their adult      lives to manage their chronic health conditions finally have      access to regular doctor visits, health education, and      prescription medications has been a tremendous relief. You      cannot imagine the sense of dignity our patients feel.  She added:       Please see it in your heart to care about the people of      Michigan who work but do not get insurance through their      employer.  So, finally, let me just say, doctors know this is a bad bill. Nurses know this is a bad bill. Hospitals know this is a bad bill. Insurance companies know this is a bad bill. I know that even many of my Republican friends know this is a bad bill. Their amendments haven't changed that. Costs go up and care goes down. Preexisting conditions come back. Millions lose their coverage.  What we should be doing is working together to stabilize the marketplace, reduce out-of-pocket costs, and lower the outrageous costs of prescription drugs--by the way, not giving a tax cut to prescription drug companies, as is in this bill, and other companies as well.  Felicia, Nick, Chelsey, and millions more like them in Michigan and across this country deserve that much.  I sincerely hope that when it comes time to vote on whether to proceed to this bill, that the majority of the Members in the Senate will say no.

Some of these people have been very well known throughout the State, and others, as I mentioned, are doing their jobs in different communities throughout the State, but they are all considered our Alaskans of the Unsung, well known--they all share a love for Alaska for good reason: There is so much to love about our great  I know most of the people in this room and watching on TV and in the Gallery think of Alaska as a majestic place, majestic landscape.

I am talking about Gene Zerkel, who was a member of the ``greatest generation'' and an aviation legend in the great State of  I don't have to remind you, but many others throughout our country don't know just how important aviation is to In my State, our skies are the highways and the roads. We have about 8,000 general aviation pilots in Alaska, which is more than any other State per capita by far, and with good reason: There are no roads and ferry services to over 100 communities in Alaska, including regional centers like Bethel, Nome, Barrow, and That means everything from mail services to baby diapers has to be flown in by plane, and if someone gets sick and needs to go to a hospital, the only way they get to see a doctor is by a plane.  Our pilots and our airline industry are essential to serving the people of Alaska, and Gene Zerkel has been a part of that service, a legendary part of Alaska aviation, for decades.  Let me tell you a little bit about He lived life on his own terms and defined it through love of God, family, country, and aviation. The latter--his passion for aviation--took hold when he was just 3 years old, then living in Indiana when he took his first airplane ride with a barnstormer. He was so taken with it, when he grew up, he continued to do some of those kinds of flights, traveling in airshows.  Like so many in the ``greatest generation'' in our Nation, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps during World War II and later joined the U.Air He continued his passion for aviation after he left the military. Some of his favorite adventures were flying during the construction of the DEWLine throughout Alaska and Canada in the 1950s.  In 1973, he fulfilled a lifelong dream so many people in America have, which was to come to Alaska and start a family. He started to fly in the great skies above We are a better State and a safer State for it.  In Alaska, he owned and operated Great Northern Airlines and became senior VP of operations and maintenance for the legendary He also started Alaska Aircraft Sales and Maintenance, which still operates to this day on Lake Hood in Anchorage,  He was an innovator. He transformed the de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver into what was known as the Alaska Magnum Beaver, and he was known for always putting safety first.  In 2007, Gene was awarded the Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award from the U.Department of Transportation and the FAA in recognition of his more than 50 years--half a century--of promoting aviation safety within the aviation industry, particularly in  Gene lived for 90 years. He saw so much and did so much for many of us. His name is written above the skies of But most importantly, he was a devoted husband of 48 years to his wife Joyce and the faithful father of nine children.  I had the good fortune of calling Gene a friend and was able to visit with him a few weeks ago. At 90 years old, he was still full of life and spark and energy and passion and optimism. I have also been in touch recently with one of his sons, a young Alaskan hero, Keenan, who has his father's passion for serving our country, with many deployments to Afghanistan as part of the 210th Rescue Squadron of the Alaska Air National He is literally a true hero in my Keenan carries on his father's passion for aviation, Alaska, and serving in the military.

13667,topic-id,417,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.1370, the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, human trafficking is a $32 billion-per-year global industry, making it one of the most profitable forms of transnational crime with more than 20 million victims worldwide. Each year an estimated 17,500 innocent people are trafficked into the United States; almost half of those individuals are children.  Trafficking victims can be of any age, race, gender, or nationality, and are largely found in workplaces within the manufacturing, agriculture, hospitality, and domestic service industries. Since 2010, the mission of the Department of Homeland Security's Blue Campaign has been to bring DHS components together with Federal, State,[[Page H4482]]and local law enforcement agencies, private industry, and other nongovernmental entities to combat human trafficking.  The Blue Campaign has provided the Department with the necessary structure to uniformly train personnel in its components to identify and investigate these criminal activities. The Blue Campaign has proven an effective mechanism through which DHS and its law enforcement partners collaborate to dismantle human trafficking networks across the country and bring perpetrators to justice.  The public awareness and outreach efforts launched through the Blue Campaign provide the general public, nongovernmental organizations, and private sector entities with tools to be active partners in the Federal Government's efforts to assist victims of human trafficking and prevent others from being exploited.  Earlier this year, DHS recognized its partners in the transportation and hospitality industries for training their employees and customers about how they can help combat human trafficking by identifying the signs and reporting suspected incidents.  Over the years, the program has proven to be an important, multifaceted tool that leverages both government and private sector resources with the goal of ending the exploitation of vulnerable people. H.1370 codifies the important program and emphasizes the importance of clear guidance and training for all Blue Campaign partners.  This bill also underscores the importance of timely and routine information sharing amongst DHS components to ensure unity of effort in preventing and disrupting human trafficking. As a cosponsor of H.1370, I believe that it is our responsibility as Members of Congress to do whatever it takes to stop the illegal and immoral smuggling of innocent people into the United States by transnational criminal organizations.

The partnerships that DHS has established through the Blue Campaign are critical to stopping criminal activity that comes with a tragically high human cost.  By leading the charge and identifying and closing all possible avenues through which human traffickers smuggle people into the United States, DHS plays a critical role in ensuring the safety of children and other innocent people. Joint, concerted efforts that bring together law enforcement, nongovernmental entities, and private industry, and raise public awareness of this criminal activity, are important to ending the practice altogether.

13779,topic-id,1081,"Mr.President, it is a great pleasure for me to be here with Senator We knew each other as attorneys general so I have admired the Senator from North Dakota for a long time. From my time in West Virginia, I remember Senator Capito's father who is a very formidable and renowned political personality in West To be here with the two of them is a personal pleasure. Senator Manchin is also joining us, so I am very happy to be here.  I thank Senator Heitkamp, Senator Capito, Chairman Barrasso, and my friend Senator Graham for leading this bipartisan effort, and I thank Senator Manchin for joining us on the floor.  We have more than 20 other cosponsors so this is a bill that has broad bipartisan support and has a great coalition behind it. It has everything from my great friends at the Natural Resources Defense Council, many of our friends in the AFL-CIO, to nonprofits like the Clean Air Task Force, to moderating groups like Third Way and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, which are trying to pick their way through the divide, industry groups like Wyoming's Cloud Peak Energy coal company and West Virginia's Peabody, a coal company, and the ethanol industry. So we have really good, broad support. It is an unusual coalition, and I am excited by it.  There are ways to remove carbon dioxide from the air and from emissions, and we are seeing a lot of it. I went with Lindsey Graham up to Saskatchewan to see the Boundary Dam facility, where they basically put the output of the coal-burning powerplant through a cloud of amino droplets that strip out the carbon dioxide and pump it to a nearby oilfield where they can use the carbon dioxide to pressurize the oilfield and facilitate the extraction of oil. That is made possible because they have an oilfield nearby that will pay for that carbon dioxide to use in order to extract the oil. If I remember correctly, they were getting close to $30 per ton. That is a pretty real revenue stream, but a lot of our American coal facilities do not have the luxury of being next to an oilfield that will pay for the carbon so you have to look elsewhere for revenues to make it worth your while. What we have in America is a market failure in which there is nobody who will pay you for removing carbon pollution. The way our market is structured it just does not work.  The simplest approach, of course, would be to put a proper price on carbon and let the whole economy go to work in solving the problem of carbon pollution. Short of that, this bill takes an important step by putting a value on reducing carbon emissions by paying facilities with a tax credit for every ton of carbon emissions they can keep out of the atmosphere. If we can get this passed and if we can get this into the Tax Code so it is lasting, then investors can look at it and say: Hey, we can finally put some money behind these technologies, and we can get them going, not just in the power sector.  This reaches into industrial carbon capture, into technologies like carbon utilization, and into really exciting new technologies like direct air capture. Now, most of these are happening elsewhere. To look for the models, you have to go to Saskatchewan, like I did and like Senator Heitkamp has done, or you have to go to Iceland, where they are pumping carbon dioxide down into geological structures where it reacts and becomes stone, or you have to go to Switzerland, where they are taking direct air carbon capture technologies, because, there, their market[[Page S3980]]is not broken so there actually is a return on this.  We are seeing good work at our National Labs, I will say, which is funded by Congress and people like Julio Friedmann, whom Senator Heitkamp and I know and work with. We are doing exciting stuff. Yet to take it to a marketable level, there has to be a business strategy. You have to be able to make a business case to investors if you are going to put money behind building what could be a multi-hundred-million-dollar carbon capture plant. This will begin to do that, and it makes me very excited.  In particular, I thank my cosponsors for making sure we are not talking about CCS any longer and that we are talking about It is not carbon capture and storage. It is carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration.  I have also been to Shenandoah, Shenandoah, IA, has a big ethanol plant, and there is a company, called bioprocessH2O, that is in the exhaust stream of that ethanol plant. They pipe out their waste heat, their waste energy, their waste CO2, their wastewater all into a plant that grows algae, and the algae eats up the They take about 15 percent of it out of the stream, and it turns it into a product. They use it for feed, for cattle, for fish. They use it for makeup and other products. They use it for a whole variety of purposes. It is a new form of agriculture that is going to be very valuable, and the fact that you can make it efficient to strip carbon dioxide out of a plant's exhaust is a great thing.  This is a good way we can work together. It may be the first time I can think of that Senator McConnell and I have ever been on a bill together. He is not on it now in this particular iteration because neither he nor the Speaker want to get onto a bill that is a tax bill while they are looking at tax reform. Yet, clearly, we know where their hearts are from the fact that they were on it the last time. So there is a lot of welcomed political news around this, and I think it has the chance of really revving up American industry so it is not the Canadians and the Icelanders and the Swiss who are cleaning our clocks because we have not bothered to get our economic structure in order to make this a profitable undertaking.

It features a special gut punch to consumer protection offered by Senator  My view is, the Cruz proposal is a prescription for misery for millions of Americans dealing with serious illness and bedlam in the private insurance market. Forget, colleagues, all the talk about bringing costs down. This bill is going to send health expenses like deductibles and copayments into the stratosphere.  TrumpCare 3.0, BCRA 3.0, tells insurance companies: Look, you are off the hook for basic consumer protection. You get to bring back annual and lifetime caps on coverage, and those caps would hit people who get their healthcare through their employer, as well as those who buy it for themselves in the individual market. You can forget about essential health benefits. You get to flood the market with bargain-basement insurance plans, as long as you offer one, single, comprehensive option, the kind of plan that actually works for people with preexisting conditions and, by the way, you get to price that through the roof.  Under the Cruz proposal, we will be looking at a tale of two healthcare systems in The young and healthy are going to opt for the bare-bones insurance plans that don't cover much of anything, but there are millions of people in this country who cannot get by with skimpy Cruz-plan insurance. They are people who have had a cancer scare or suffer from diabetes. They are people who get hurt on the ski slopes or in a car accident. The only coverage that works for them will come with an astronomical pricetag.  There was no hearing in the Finance Committee, no hearing in the HELP Senators are flying in the dark, and as far as I can tell, the proposal is going to be before us without having been scored by the  Let me close with this. It is not too late for Republican Senators to put a stop to this shadowy, unacceptable process. Nobody in this Chamber--not one Senator--has to choose between TrumpCare and straight repeal or any partisan plan. I hope my colleagues will reject TrumpCare 3.0, BCRA 3.0 and say it is time to stop this my-way-or-the-highway process and say, after rejecting this ill-advised amendment, that they would like to return to the regular order, where we look to bipartisan approaches.  I urge my colleagues to oppose and to oppose strongly this first amendment that we will vote on tonight, BCRA 3.0. It is a prescription for trouble for millions of consumers, and I think it is going to cause chaos for the reasons I described in the private insurance market.  I yield the floor.

13927,topic-id,489,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize the historic event of the Great American Eclipse that will cross the continental United States on August 21. That morning, the eclipse will first pass over my home State of Oregon, then sweep across the U.S., ending in South Millions of people across Oregon and the country are planning on watching those few moments when the moon will cover the sun and everything will go dark.  It has been 99 years since a total solar eclipse has occurred across the entire country, and whether someone is 5 or 95, this may be the only time they will ever see a total eclipse. It is truly a once-in-a-lifetime event.  This solar eclipse is a rare occurrence where the wonders of science will come right to the front doors of millions of people. That fact hasn't been lost on schools and science organizations throughout Educators from the coastal areas of the State to the mountains of eastern Oregon have been working hard to use this eclipse as an opportunity to engage students in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, commonly called  One of the best science museums in the country, the Oregon Museum of Science Industry, OMSI, has planned an amazing viewing party, with the hope of engaging folks of all ages in the science behind the eclipse. Oregon native Don Pettit, who is a NASA astronaut, will even be there to share his experience of viewing eclipses from the International Space Over the years, OMSI has been a leader in getting students excited about STEM fields. I am so glad the museum is using this eclipse as yet another opportunity to get communities involved in science.  Universities throughout the State are also doing their part to ensure students and community members get the most out of the event. In Corvallis, Oregon State University is hosting a 3-day eclipse event, with astronomy exhibits and a series of science lectures. I also understand that Portland State University, with the help of NASA, will launch video cameras attached to high-altitude balloons, giving anyone the ability to tune in and watch a live stream of the eclipse. Programs like these are so important because they make scientific events more accessible to the younger generations.  I also want to take a few moments today to recognize the local leaders,[[Page S4758]]first responders, and the National Guard who are working tirelessly to ensure that communities throughout the State enjoy the eclipse festivities safely. These public servants have been a shining light in making sure Oregonians and visitors alike have the best experience while viewing the solar eclipse.  As the eclipse arcs across the country and folks from the West Coast to the East Coast don their eclipse glasses to look up at the darkened sun, it is my sincere hope that it ignites a ray of passion in students throughout the country to explore STEM fields more deeply.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4757.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,2.0,July
13950,topic-id,643,"Mr.President, I would like to take a few minutes today and share with my colleagues an extraordinary piece of our country's World War II and civil rights history: the story of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion--or the Triple Nickles, as they would come to be called.  The 555th was officially activated in December 1943 at Fort Benning, GA, and began as a company of Black officers and enlisted men. Seventeen soldiers graduated Army jump school the following February, earning a coveted Parachutist Badge--their ``wings.'' The Army transferred the unit after several months to Camp Mackall, NC, and, in November 1944, redesignated it Company A of the newly activated 555th Parachute Infantry  Although the 555th did not serve overseas during World War II, it performed an important role in defending the American homeland. In 1944 and 1945, the Japanese launched roughly 9,000 ``balloon bombs,'' explosives attached to paper balloons that rode the jetstream current across the Pacific Ocean and over the contiguous United  One of these balloon bombs exploded in Oregon, killing a pregnant woman and five children in what historians regard as the only American World War II combat causalities to occur in the contiguous United  The members of the 555th boarded a train westward to Oregon on a secret mission to help defend Americans living in the Pacific Northwest and the natural timber resources deemed vital to the war effort.  The incident in Oregon was one of more than 275 documented balloon bomb related incidents as far east as Detroit, MI, south into Texas, and north into Canada and  Japanese balloon bombs, of course, had the potential not only to wound or kill but also to set forests ablaze in the western United Putting those fires out and dealing with their aftermath could divert the Nation's focus on the war effort and dampen American morale.  The Triple Nickles arrived in Oregon in 1945 and were sent out to Pendleton Air Field, then still an active military base. They were assigned to work with[[Page S3207]]the U.Forest Service and received specialized training as smokejumpers and on the handling of unexploded balloon bombs.  As part of Operation Firefly, the 555th made some 1,200 jumps and fought more than 35 fires in Oregon, Washington, and other western States between July and October 1945.  Smokejumping is no easy feat; it is dirty, sweaty, and dangerous work, but because of the 555th's dedication and professionalism, the unit only ever sustained one fatality: Malvin Brown tragically fell to his death in the Umpqua National Forest about 45 miles northwest of Crater His death is regarded as the first smokejumper death in U.history.  Make no mistake about it, Malvin Brown and the other soldiers of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion are heroes. They were the first Black paratroopers ever to serve in the U.Military, which they did with honor and distinction. They are also the only military unit in history to work as smokejumpers.  The soldiers of the 555th faced painful discrimination and blatant racism on a daily basis. They were barred from the store on base while at Fort Benning, GA, even though German and Italian prisoners were allow to enter. Even after the Triple Nickles arrived in Oregon, they found most restaurants and bars would not serve them.  The Army sent the 555th to Fort Bragg, NC, following the Japanese surrender and, in December 1947, integrated the unit into the famed 82nd Airborne Division--making the 82nd the Army's first racially integrated division.  On June 3, 2017, the State of Oregon will commemorate the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion's remarkable history and important contributions to the country with the installation of an Oregon State historic marker at the Smokejumper Museum in Cave  It is my true honor to share their story today with my colleagues and to express my profound gratitude to all the Triple Nickles for their service.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3206-4.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,25.0,May
