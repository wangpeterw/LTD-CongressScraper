                      HONORING OFFICER RYAN MORTON

  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and to 
applaud the heroism of Clinton Police Officer Ryan Morton, who gave his 
life last week protecting the citizens of Clinton, Missouri.
  Ryan was beloved by all. He was a veteran who fought in Afghanistan, 
an ardent Royals fan, and a dedicated law enforcement officer who 
stepped up to serve his community as a full-time police officer after 
the tragic death of another Clinton police officer named Gary Michael. 
Sadly, Officer Morton lost his life 7 months to the day after Officer 
Michael was killed.
  Officer Morton embodied what we all should emulate: dedication, 
patriotism, service, and a willingness to lay down one's life for 
others.
  We mourn the loss, but we celebrate Ryan's life.
  May the Lord comfort his family and the Clinton Police Department, 
and may his example inspire us all.
