                 THE ROLLOUT OF THE TAX REFORM PROPOSAL

  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, today is a big day. I want to congratulate 
my colleague and friend, Mr. Brady, the chairman of the Ways and Means 
Committee, and the committee for the rollout of our tax reform 
proposal, the first time in over 30 years.
  For the individual, what do we get?
  We get a fairer, flatter, simpler Tax Code. We are lowering the 
rates. We are doubling personal exemptions. And guess what. Most 
Americans will be able to file their tax returns on a postcard.
  For corporate America, we get a reduction from 35 percent to 20 
percent, which will make us competitive across the world. Most 
countries in the major industrialized nations tax their corporations at 
a 20 percent rate.
  We will eliminate most every loophole that will deprive special 
interests of being able to interrupt and intercede in that Tax Code.
  For what purpose?
  A simple purpose: more money in individuals' pockets, and a growing, 
thriving economy for all Americans.
  Again, I congratulate Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means 
Committee. I look forward to seeing quick passage on the floor.
