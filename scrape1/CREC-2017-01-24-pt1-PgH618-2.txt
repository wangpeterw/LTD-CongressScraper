                           SUPPORT FOR H.R. 7

  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 7, 
the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.
  H.R. 7 codifies policies that have been enacted for more than 30 
years, on a case-by-case basis, that prohibit the Federal funding of 
abortion, including the Hyde amendment, which prohibits funding for 
elective abortion coverage through any program funded through the 
annual Labor, Health, and Human Services Appropriations Act; the Smith 
FEHBP amendment, which prohibits funding for health plans that include 
elective abortion coverage for Federal employees; the Dornan amendment, 
which prohibits the use of congressionally appropriated funds for 
abortion in the District of Columbia; and the restrictions on elective 
abortion funding through the Peace Corps and Federal prisons.
