         CELEBRATING ISRAEL'S 69TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate our ally 
Israel on its 69th anniversary of independence.
  For nearly seven decades, Israel has become a beacon of promise and 
success amid continued challenges. Since the declaration of the State 
of Israel back in 1948, they have consistently shown the power of 
democracy and strength in a volatile part of the world. The people of 
Israel have also proven themselves to be loyal allies to the United 
States during tumultuous times, serving as a constant reaffirmation of 
our unbreakable bond.
  Their resolve cannot be understated, either. Israel consistently 
keeps its citizens safe, despite security threats on a daily basis. The 
fact that Israel continues to flourish amid constant efforts to 
terrorize and daunt them is a signal of the nation's strength.
  So today we join those in Israel, as well as others around the world, 
in celebration.
  Mr. Speaker, let us continue to protect and preserve the unending and 
unwavering friendship and relationship between America and Israel.
