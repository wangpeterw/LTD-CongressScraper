       WELCOMING SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN TO WASHINGTON

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to rise to welcome 
Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to the United States on the 
occasion of his first visit as President.
  The United States and the Republic of Korea share a longstanding 
pivotal defense alliance, and we are bound together as fellow 
democracies who share common values.

  The U.S.-Korea relationship has been a growing partnership, and now 
they are the United State's sixth largest trading partner. It is 
Florida's third largest export market, and we have over 1,700 Korean 
Americans in my district.
  Korea is one of only five U.S. mutual defense allies in Asia, one of 
only three nations in the region to have completed a bilateral trade 
agreement with the United States, and hosts a U.S. military presence of 
nearly 38,000 Americans.
  The Republic of Korea is our foundational partner in facing the 
gravest threats to the world's peace and security, and that is the 
rogue nuclear regime of Kim Jong-un. We will continue to stand together 
to address this grave threat and maintain our close bilateral 
relationship.
  I give my most sincere congratulations to President Moon Jae-in on 
his first electoral victory, and I welcome him warmly to Washington 
during such an important time.
