               PEACE CORPS ANGEL ABROAD--JENNIFER MAMOLA

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Jennifer Mamola represents the very 
best of America. She volunteered for the Peace Corps at 26 and served 
in Uganda.
  While there, tragically, she was hit from behind by a drunk driver, 
breaking both of her legs. Her life changed forever.
  When she returned home to America, she faced an uphill battle to get 
treatment and endless bureaucracy. After 3 months, the Peace Corps 
stopped covering her medical costs and sent her to face the bureaucracy 
of the Department of Labor.
  Instead of serving as a resource, the Peace Corps' postservice unit 
was no help at all. When she reached out asking for mental health 
services, they ignored her. She has undergone four surgeries and 
endless hours of agony.
  America's angels abroad deserve better. My legislation will ensure 
that Peace Corps volunteers have medical care in foreign countries and 
in America when they return home.
  I want to welcome Jennifer to the House Chamber today. Congress 
appreciates her service as a Peace Corps volunteer, and we must provide 
help for wonderful people like her.
  And that is just the way it is.
