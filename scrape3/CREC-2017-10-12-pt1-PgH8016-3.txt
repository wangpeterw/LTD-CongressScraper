                       ACA BIRTH CONTROL MANDATE

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of every 
woman's access to healthcare and right to make her own personal 
healthcare decisions in private consultation with her physician and her 
family.
  Last week, President Trump issued a shameful executive order that 
will allow employers to deny women insurance coverage for 
contraception. This rolls back progress under the Affordable Care Act 
that required insurance companies to cover birth control without a 
copay.
  This is outrageous. Employers have no role dictating what healthcare 
women can and cannot have. That is a decision between a woman and her 
doctor.
  Nearly 9 in 10 women will use birth control at some point in their 
lives. This order is a direct attack on their healthcare.
  President Trump tried to sneak this change through, announcing it on 
a Friday afternoon before a long weekend. Well, we noticed and so did 
millions of other women that this order will adversely impact.
  We are paying attention and we are not about to stop speaking out and 
working to protect women's access to healthcare.
