                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise during National Police Week to 
honor the men and women who every morning put on their badge and 
selflessly protect and serve our communities. Many heroically go above 
and beyond their duty.
  It was a privilege of mine to invite and sit next to Kendall County 
Sheriff's Deputy Tyler Johnson at last year's State of the Union 
Address. On New Year's night, he jumped into a freezing pond to rescue 
a motorist in a sinking car.
  These acts of heroism deserve our recognition. Yet, rarely do our 
officers receive recognition and thanks for their day-to-day work 
serving people.
  A police officer is the person that helps you when you are stranded 
on the side of the road. A police officer scours the neighborhood with 
your kids looking for a lost dog.
  They are the Illinois police departments that tomorrow are taking 
part in Cops on a Rooftop with Dunkin Donuts to help raise money for 
the Illinois Special Olympics.
  To police officers everywhere: Thank you.
