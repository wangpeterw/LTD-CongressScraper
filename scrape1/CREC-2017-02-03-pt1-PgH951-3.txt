                        SUPPORT SCIENCE FUNDING

  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I have spoken on the House floor on 
specific science topics ranging from twin primes to measuring 
atmospheric carbon. Modern society depends on science. Farmers are able 
to feed much of the world's current population because of science. 
Without science, we would further strip our forests and pollute even 
more of our precious water supplies; and our Nation has the strongest 
military in the world because of science. But science allows for far 
more than just furthering our survival as it provides leisure, 
communications, and all things Internet.
  Today we depend on the science of yesterday, and, tomorrow, society 
will depend on the science of today. If we care about the short- and 
long-term future, then we need to support scientific research. We need 
to encourage collaboration with the scientists of other nations; we 
need an open and competitive science environment; and we need to make 
sure that all Americans have a basic understanding of science.
  Science is a part of our Nation's critical infrastructure, and I ask 
my colleagues to continue to support science funding to keep America 
great.
