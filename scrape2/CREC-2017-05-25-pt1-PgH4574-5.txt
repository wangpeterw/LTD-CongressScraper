                         HONORING HENRI TERMEER

  (Mr. MOULTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to honor a 
constituent, a friend, and a beloved member of our community, Henri 
Termeer. Henri was a resident of my hometown in Massachusetts and the 
retired CEO of Genzyme, the biotech firm credited with launching the 
Boston biotech revolution that now leads the globe.
  Henri has been described as the epitome of a renaissance man, and he 
embodied the nexus of business, culture, and civic responsibility. He 
also left a lasting imprint on those he loved. His 16-year-old 
daughter, Adriana, referred to him as the giving tree because of the 
seemingly endless energy he devoted to the causes he believed in and 
the lives he touched.
  At dinner the night he passed away, Henri said to his guests: We are 
getting older and running out of runway here. We need new leaders now.
  Mr. Speaker, we would all do well to aspire to be the kind of 
thoughtful, passionate, and impactful leader Henri was. He saved 
countless lives, yet he was known for his modesty. Henri was one of the 
kindest men I have ever known, and we will miss him.
