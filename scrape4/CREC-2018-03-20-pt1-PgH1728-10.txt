     to the following:
       Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 of the Constitution.
       Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 of the Constitution confers 
     on Congress the authority to make all laws necessary and 
     proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the 
     Constitution in the government of the United States, or in 
     any department or officer thereof. This legislation makes 
     technical amendments to update statutory references to 
     certain provisions classified to title 25, United States 
     Code, as necessary to keep the title current and make

     the government of the United States.
