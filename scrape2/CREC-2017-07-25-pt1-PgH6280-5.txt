                         SECURE FIREARM STORAGE

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, communities throughout our country are 
suffering from an epidemic of gun violence.
  In far too many cases, stolen guns represent a growing source of the 
weapons used in these crimes. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, last year alone, nearly 18,000 
firearms were reported stolen or lost just from Federal firearm 
licensees, or FFLs. That is Federally licensed dealers, manufacturers, 
and importers.
  Today I introduced the SECURE Firearms Storage Act to help address 
the stolen-gun problem by requiring all FFLs to securely store their 
inventory when not open for business.
  Additionally, this bill would require the Attorney General to review 
and put forth further commonsense security measures to reduce the risk 
of theft, and require new applicants to detail their security plans 
before a new license is issued.
  There are simply too many innocent lives being destroyed by these 
stolen guns. I invite my colleagues to join me on this bill to make 
commonsense improvements for gun safety.
