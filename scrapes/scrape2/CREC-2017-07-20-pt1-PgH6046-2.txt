             ENCOURAGING GIRLS TO TAKE UP COMPUTER SCIENCE

  (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, in Nevada and across the country, we are 
continuing to see a huge demand for workers in the technical industry, 
including software developers; engineers; and computer programmers, 
like myself. Despite the progress we have made, fewer than one in five 
computer science graduates are women.
  I am proud to introduce my bill, H.R. 3316, the Code Like a Girl Act, 
because I believe in breaking down barriers and closing the gender gap 
once and for all.
  This bipartisan legislation invests in computer science education, 
opening doors for women to become part of a highly skilled workforce. 
Funding programs that encourage girls to take up computer science is 
one of the most important steps we can take to break down barriers and 
level the playing field for women everywhere. The Code Like a Girl Act 
will go one step further by teaching our girls that zero is false, one 
is true, and that we matter, too.
  I encourage my colleagues to invest in our girls by supporting my 
bill.
