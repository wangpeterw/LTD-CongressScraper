                   TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I proudly represent North Carolina's 12th 
Congressional District, leader in transportation and infrastructure.
  We have Norfolk Southern's state-of-the-art intermodal yard 
connecting trucking, rail, and air to East Coast seaports. We are home 
to the Charlotte Douglas International Airport, eleventh busiest in the 
Nation, nearly 700 American Airlines flights departing daily.
  I-85, I-77, Route 21, and Highway 115 move our 800,000 residents and 
products from businesses like International Paper and Coca-Cola 
Consolidated. Our LYNX and rapid bus transit lines are making our 
cities greener. And as we say in Charlotte, we've got a lot.
  I am committed to ensuring we remain a national leader. I am hosting 
a regional transportation summit to help promote Route 21 and Highway 
115 projects, continue developing our rapid transit systems, move our 
Red Line project forward, and to ensure that our airport can complete 
its new terminal and runway projects.
  We are ``One Meck.'' Transportation has made us an economic 
powerhouse and southern hub of cultural diversity. During National 
Infrastructure Week, I urge my colleagues to work to make greater 
investments in our Nation's infrastructure.
