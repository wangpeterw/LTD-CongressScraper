                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM

  (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise today again to call on my 
colleagues to quickly pass a 5-year extension of the Children's Health 
Insurance Program. Around 85,000 Iowa children rely on CHIP for their 
health. If we don't act, families and children will suffer.
  This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue, and we must pass 
a solution together. Families should not be worried about losing 
coverage for their children.
  And the fact that this Congress cannot muster the ability to pass a 
long-term extension of CHIP is confounding, to say the least.
  We must quickly set aside any political games, come to the table, and 
work together to pass a long-term CHIP funding bill.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to set aside any political games 
or partisan brinksmanship and come together and fully fund CHIP. The 
health of our children is at stake.
