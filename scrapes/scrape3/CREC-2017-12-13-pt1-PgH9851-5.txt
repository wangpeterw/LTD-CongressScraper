                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Almighty God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us 
another day.
  Lord, You are powerful and strong, yet You bend to Your people and 
show them mercy and sustaining grace.
  Help the leaders of our Nation make wise decisions in our day. May 
they look to You for guidance every step of the way until we stand in 
Your light forever. Set us all on a path that will lead to peace and 
security.
  Bless us this day and every day, and may all that is done within the 
people's House be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
