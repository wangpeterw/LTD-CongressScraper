                         HONORING GREG ALIA DAY

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize 
that this Thursday, December 14, is Greg Alia Day: a day to recognize 
law enforcement and their families for their dedication in promoting 
the protection of American families.
  I appreciate the hard work and devotion of Kassy Alia in recognizing 
her husband in such a positive way with Greg Alia Day, truly giving 
back to the community and recognizing his service to the American 
people.
  Greg was a fine young man and also a 7-year veteran of the Forest 
Acres Police Department. I was fortunate to have the privilege to 
travel with Greg and Boy Scout Troop 100 of St. Joseph Catholic Church 
in Columbia to Philmont Scout Ranch at Cimarron, New Mexico. I learned 
then what a dedicated person he was.
  His legacy and courage will live on through the great work of his 
wife, Kassy; his son, Sal; and his parents, Dr. Richard and Alexis 
Alia.
  To the many law enforcement and families across the country: We thank 
you for your service, dedication, and sacrifice, which I saw over the 
weekend with Sheriff Michael Hunt from Aiken, Sheriff Leon Lott from 
Richland, and Sheriff Jay and Kim Koon from Lexington.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. God bless the memory 
and service of Greg Alia.
