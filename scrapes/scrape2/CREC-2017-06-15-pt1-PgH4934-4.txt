         PRAYING FOR VICTIMS OF CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL TRAGEDY

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, 1 Corinthians 12:26 reads:

       If one member suffers, all the members suffer together.

  I stand today to show my support for my colleague, Congressman Steve 
Scalise, his wife, and his family. We pray for their strength, their 
courage, and their faith as they deal with the unthinkable.
  I pray for Steve's speedy recovery. We know he is a fighter, and we 
pray he will be back soon fighting for the people of Louisiana's First 
District.
  We offer prayers for Matt and his family, who was also injured during 
the shooting.
  I rise today to remember the courageous Capitol Police officers who 
were injured; our heroes. If not for their bravery, more people could 
have been wounded and possibly killed. They risk their lives to protect 
us. The U.S. Capitol Police do this every day for us, for our staff, 
and for the public.
  We stand together during this challenging time. When it happens to 
one of us, it happens to all of us.
