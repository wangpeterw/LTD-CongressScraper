                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, in this season of gladness and cheer when many celebrate 
Your breakthrough at Bethlehem, we pause to thank You for Your mercy 
and grace. While we were sinners, You initiated the process of our 
redemption and restoration. Great is Your faithfulness.
  Lord, make our lawmakers ambassadors of reconciliation for Your 
Kingdom, using them to demonstrate Your precepts and represent Your 
purposes. As they strive to bring the illumination of Your wisdom to a 
dark world, may people see their labors and glorify Your Holy Name. 
Because of our Senators' faithful service, may our Nation experience 
the unity of Your healing presence.
  Lord, let there be peace on Earth, and let it begin with us.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
