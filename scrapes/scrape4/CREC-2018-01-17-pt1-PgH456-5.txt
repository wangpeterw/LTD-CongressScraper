             HONORING THE LIFE OF STANLEY JOHN KACZOROWSKI

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life 
of Mr. Stanley John Kaczorowski, who passed away on December 23 at the 
age of 78.
  Mr. Kaczorowski dedicated much of his life to public service in our 
Nation's judicial system. Originally from New Jersey, Mr. Kaczorowski 
graduated from Seton Hall University Law School before being hired as 
the assistant prosecutor for Union County, New Jersey. As assistant 
prosecutor, he tried his first murder trial at the age of 25.
  After a number of years with the prosecutor's office in New Jersey, 
he moved with his family to Georgia's First Congressional District, 
specifically Skidaway Island. Here, he continued his dedication to 
public service by serving on the Chatham County Board of Elections.
  He is survived by his wife, Carole, of 30 years, along with a number 
of children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. Mr. Kaczorowski 
will be missed.
