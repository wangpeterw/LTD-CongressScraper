               MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING DONALD BURGETT

  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory 
of World War II veteran, noted author, and longtime Eighth 
Congressional District resident Donald Burgett, who recently passed 
away at the age of 81.
  Don was an Army paratrooper, and he participated in the opening 
operations of the Normandy invasion with A Company, 506th Parachute 
Infantry of the 101st Airborne Division.
  After his service, Mr. Burgett published four books, including 
``Currahee!'' published in 1967 and endorsed by President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. Mr. Burgett used his photographic memory to paint vivid 
scenes during the chaos of war.
  In addition to his writing, he also was an active member of several 
veterans organizations, including the VFW, American Legion, Disabled 
American Veterans, and the Military Order of the Cooties. He was a 
local builder and loved spending time outdoors.
  Don is survived by his wife, Twyla, his 5 children, 12 grandchildren, 
and 28 great-grandchildren. A memorial is being held for him this week 
in his honor in his hometown of Howell, Michigan.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence for this great American 
patriot.
  May God bless Don and his family.
