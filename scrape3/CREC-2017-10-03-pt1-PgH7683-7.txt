        CONGRATULATING LIGO ON RECEIVING NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS

  (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, when folks think of innovation 
and new technology, Louisiana often comes to mind.
  We have been able to pioneer cell phone technology and have been 
involved in genetics and DNA. We have incredible naval technologies, 
with offshore oil and gas at depths never before even contemplated. We 
have been able to power this Nation's economy.
  Once again, Mr. Speaker, with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-
Wave Observatory receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery 
of and measurement of gravitational waves, Louisiana is recognized once 
again.
  I want to give a shout-out to LIGO and Livingston Parish for their 
amazing discovery in 2015 and for being recognized with the Nobel Prize 
in Physics
