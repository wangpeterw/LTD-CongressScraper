                        CUBA: COMMUNIST FAILURE

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, The Epoch Times this 
month presented an extraordinary expose by economist Daniel Lacalle 
that Cuba ``still serves as the best example of why communism doesn't 
work and will never work.''
  Cuba was once one of Latin America's wealthiest countries when 
Communists seized power. But now the Castro regime--like any socialist 
government--is a machine of squandering subsidies.
  Between 1960 and 1990, Cuba received more than $65 billion from the 
Soviet Union, also hundreds of millions of dollars from international 
organizations. Despite this, the NationMaster ranking ranks Cuba last, 
176th in the world, with an average salary of $25.05 per month in 2014. 
The only way Cuba can catch up with other developing countries is by 
ridding itself of communism.
  Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been proven right 
again: ``The trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of 
other people's money.''
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Madam Speaker, our sympathy this week goes to the people of 
Afghanistan in the global war who have suffered mass murders in Kabul 
by the Taliban, reaffirming that we must defeat terrorism overseas.
