Karnig was a fierce advocate for our students, overseeing record numbers of enrollment, diversity, and faculty, as well as raising tens of millions of dollars for the university.  When Al wasn't working on improving access to higher education in our community, he was investing his personal time to make the inland empire a better place to live and raise a family.

9812,topic-id,250,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to speak today on behalf of H.2749, the Protecting Business Opportunities for Veterans Act of 2017. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their support for Ranking Member Kuster and myself.  Mr.Speaker, H.2749 aims to provide the VA with the tools it needs to correct the persistent problem in contracting. The problem is improper pass-throughs. An improper pass-through is when a small business obtains a contract under a set-aside, but gives all or substantially all of the work to a large company and, nonetheless, collects profit.  Sometimes multiple companies pass through the work while adding price markups. This has long been prohibited by law and wastes taxpayer dollars; but, in practice, agencies have little ability to stop it.  In the VA, veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses have special preference to receive contracts, but bad actors are taking contracts away from law-abiding veteran businessowners who truly want to perform their work. The committee gets complaints about this situation nearly every week.  This bill will make every bidder for a VA contract certify that it will perform the percentage of work the law already requires. The bill also directs the VA to work with the Office of Inspector General in a more effective way to find, stop, and, where appropriate, punish the improper pass-throughs.  H.2749 relies on existing law and fills in gaps in implementation, but does not create any new bureaucracy.  The solution is long overdue. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the bill.

9916,topic-id,1186,"Mr.President, I particularly appreciate the comments of my colleague from Maryland about the Affordable Care The fact is, they are taking insurance from 200,000 Ohioans right now who are getting opioid treatment because of the Affordable Care Act, and the vote in the House of Representatives would turn those 200,000 families upside down. They should be ashamed of themselves. Then to go to the White House and celebrate--that is just the ultimate despicable, political act. I just can't imagine that in the 21st century people would actually do that.  The FDA has incredible influence over Americans' lives, and the Commissioner of the Federal Food and Drug Administration will lead the agency dedicated to ensuring that our medicine and food supplies are safe.  It is the job of the FDA Commissioner, and has been for decades, to be an independent check on big pharmaceutical companies, to crack down on Big Tobacco, and to oversee the safety and efficacy of new prescription drugs, including, most essentially in the last few years, opioid painkillers. Unfortunately, Scott Gottlieb's record gives me serious concern, as Senator Markey has pointed out so well, that this Commissioner will fall short on all of these measures.  We know the havoc that opioid painkillers have wreaked on communities across the country. My State of Ohio has had more overdose deaths from heroin, OxyContin, oxycodone, Percocet, opioids, morphine-based opioids; we have had more deaths than any other State in the United States of In my State and across this country, people die because of the opioid epidemic; 91 Americans, including 12 Ohioans, will die today--91 Americans, 12 Ohioans will die today--from opioid overdoses.  The Commissioner will have a lot of tools to fight this epidemic that is ravaging our families and our communities. We need all hands on deck to fight this crisis. We need the  Unfortunately, Gottlieb's record indicates he would not take the epidemic and the FDA's authority to rein in prescription painkillers and other drugs seriously, which is why I cannot support his nomination.  I don't want to point fingers, but there are a whole host of reasons for this epidemic. One of them clearly is the proliferation of prescriptions and the manufacture of so many of these opioids. They are getting to market, and doctors are prescribing them, and pharmacists are filling them.  I don't point fingers at individual people and even individual industries; we are all at fault and not doing this right. But Gottlieb has had a cozy relationship with big drug companies for decades as an investor, as an adviser, and as a member of the board for a number of these companies. He supported allowing those same companies to rush their drugs, including potentially addictive opioid painkillers, onto the market before we were sure they were safe--more on that in a moment.  He has called into question the Drug Enforcement Administration's authority to police opioids, despite the fact that these drugs are often sold on the black market. He has defended industry's efforts to market new drugs and devices with minimal safety oversight. He has refused to answer questions about his previous work for pharmaceutical companies that make the opioid fentanyl. We know he participated in a meeting on their behalf at the time that the company was under FDA investigation for pushing off-label uses of fentanyl.  Anyone who thinks we need more fentanyl on the market in many of Ohio's 88 counties should visit the coroner's office. Imagine this: In some counties, the coroner's office has had to bring in refrigerated semitrailers to keep up with the growing body count from the lives lost to overdoses. Think of that; just think of that picture bringing in refrigerated semitrailers to keep up with the growing body count from opioid deaths.  Let Mr.Gottlieb explain himself to the parents, the children, and the friends who have lost loved ones to this deadly drug. A friend of my wife's, a woman she knew growing up, lost her son to fentanyl. He had a 2-year-old child. He was starting to come clean. My understanding is that he relapsed, and he passed away just a few days ago.  We need a leader at the FDA who will step up the agency's efforts to fight this addiction epidemic, which is tearing families upside down. It rips up communities. We need a Commissioner who will fight the addiction epidemic, not one who will roll over for his Big Pharma friends. We need a strong public health advocate to address probably the worst public health crisis of my lifetime, a public health advocate who will continue to stand up to Big Tobacco with strong rules for all tobacco products, including newer products like e-cigarettes, which are particularly appealing to kids.  The opioid crisis is certainly a bigger health crisis that we face right now, and tobacco is an ongoing public health crisis. We have made huge victories; we have made huge strides and have had huge victories in this country. Young people smoke in significantly lower numbers than they used to. Tobacco companies don't much like that, so they have introduced e-cigarettes. Tobacco companies are buying more and more of the manufacturing capabilities of these e-cigarettes. The FDA hasn't stepped up the way it should. I implore Gottlieb to do that, but there is no evidence so far that he cares enough to.  Once again, his extensive business dealings call into doubt whether he can seriously serve as the people's cop on the beat when it comes to policing Big Gottlieb himself invested in an e-cigarette company--the new FDA He probably will be confirmed today. I accept that because for every Trump nominee, no matter their ethics, no matter their background, no matter their inability to serve well, no matter their lack of qualifications for a whole host of their responsibilities, almost every Republican--it is sort of like when one bird flies off a telephone wire, they all do, and they have voted for almost every one of these nominees.  But think of this: Gottlieb's job is public health, his job is to police Big His job is to stand between these multimillion-dollar marketing executives and the 15-year-old who is attracted to these e-cigarettes with the flavors and the colors and the marketing, and he has invested in the past in e-cigarette companies. What does that tell you? Can we really trust him to impose tough rules on these potentially dangerous products? Can we trust him to protect our children?  Whoever is in charge of the FDA--whoever is in charge--must put the people's safety over drug company profits, whether it is addictive painkillers or e-cigarettes.  I don't think Gottlieb is the right person for this. I hope I am wrong. I plan to vote no. I hope he proves me wrong. If he does, I will come back to the floor and applaud him. But from his background, from his statements, from his qualifications, from his investments, from his business background, I don't think he fits the bill.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  Mr.President, I withdraw the suggestion.

9840,topic-id,690,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. This rule provides for debate on the final negotiated bill between the House and the This process began last Congress and resulted in the House passing H.1259 in March of this year.  The Senate introduced and passed the version of the bill we have before us today by voice vote. It mirrors the reforms contained in Chairman Roe's bill that the House has already passed by a bipartisan vote.  Mr.Speaker, we often talk about veterans in this country: We thank them for their sacrifice; we applaud them at sporting events; we tell ourselves that we must take care of them, must repay them for the service to our But in the past few years, we have discovered that America's care for our veterans has been wholly inadequate. The Department of Veterans Affairs has failed them.  Shameful misconduct at the VA has been rampant, and it has hurt our veterans:  In 2014, we learned that the Phoenix VA concealed extremely long wait lines for patients and that up to 40 vets may have died while waiting for care at the facility;  Just last year, we discovered that a VA Hospital in Colorado Springs also falsified wait time records. The majority of patients at that hospital faced wait times over 30 days, and 28 patients had an average wait time of 76 days. One veteran is even thought to have committed suicide because he wasn't referred for mental healthcare, even though he had been deemed at risk for suicide.  That is why Congress needs to act. 1094, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, allows the Secretary of the VA to hold all employees at the agency accountable for their conduct.  We desperately need this legislation, not because all the employees at the VA have problems. Quite the opposite. Most VA employees show up to work every day because they are passionate about serving our Nation's veterans. But there are bad apples, people who put our veterans in danger. These people must be held accountable, and, frankly, many of them must be fired.  This bill empowers the Secretary to reprimand, suspend, or remove VA employees who have engaged in misconduct. It also permits the Secretary to recoup bonuses if an employee performed poorly or conducted themselves inappropriately and to recoup relocation expenses for fraud, waste, or malfeasance.  The bill also bolsters protection for whistleblowers, creating an office within the VA devoted to protecting those who expose wrongdoing. Supervisors will be taught how to protect whistleblowers and will be held accountable for how well they do.  And the bill requires reporting to Congress on the performance of senior executives at the VA and on the outcomes of disciplinary actions at the agency.  You may be wondering why Congress has taken such an in-depth interest in an executive branch agency, and I will tell you why. It is our job.  The legislative branch was designed to oversee the executive branch. We appropriate the funds used to pay the salaries of everyone working at the These funds come from the taxpayer. For the sake of the taxpayer, we must ensure that the VA is serving its purpose.  But this bill also empowers the Secretary of the VA, allowing him or her to take immediate action to protect veterans. We can't wait for long appeals processes when a bad employee on the front lines of a VA hospital is harming our veterans.  This legislation should not be controversial. Both Democrats and Republicans want the best for our veterans. This legislation, the legislation we are discussing today, gives the VA Secretary and Congress more tools to hold employees accountable because if we are holding employees accountable, then we are protecting our veterans from abuse.  This bill is one small way to say thank you to those men and women who have served our country. We can never adequately repay them, but we can do our best to provide them with sufficient medical care.  I urge you to support this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

9846,topic-id,273,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In response to my friend from Florida's statement about the second piece of legislation that we are dealing with in this rule, I believe it is our responsibility to the American taxpayer, and we are fulfilling that responsibility. We are expected to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. This bill ensures that the government only disburses premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, or under the American Health Care Act, to those individuals who are eligible for those tax credits.  Under the ACA, an individual who is not lawfully present in the United States is ineligible from receiving a premium credit. Unfortunately, the ACA also allows the government to hand out the tax credit first and verify later.  This pay-and-chase scheme means taxpayer money is flowing out the door to people who don't meet the requirements for premium tax credits, and much of these funds may not be recouped. In fact, under the ACA, over half a million people who were ineligible for coverage and tax credits received credits.  H.2581, the Verify First Act, requires the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that any department disbursing payments have first verified the recipient's legal presence with information like Social Security numbers. By requiring this verification, we can confirm that, under both the ACA and AHCA, those who receive credits deserve credits.  With that confirmation, we will ensure that these laws are used as they were intended; that the wishes of the American taxpayer are followed. I urge Members to support this important legislation.

One of them fulfills the congressional duty to steward taxpayer dollars well. We shouldn't be handing out tax credits to people without first checking their eligibility for their tax credits.

It is only fair to the American people that we pass this legislation.  The other bill in this rule, 1094, protects our veterans from harm. We all have a commitment to repaying the men and women who have served this Nation in the military. These brave individuals have put much on the line and sacrificed so much time and opportunity. They deserve the best healthcare.  This legislation holds the VA accountable. We need to empower the VA Secretary to quickly fire employees who put our veterans in danger.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

9988,topic-id,521,"Mr.Speaker, I also want to take the opportunity to thank my colleague for all of his diligence and incredible effort to make sure that we are here today with the successful passage of this important legislation.  The bill we are considering today, the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017, is a bill that puts Congress back in the driver's seat of evidence-based reform of our Nation's juvenile justice system. For far too long, Congress has failed to reauthorize the landmark Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act passed in 1974. The most important Federal juvenile justice statute has been expired for almost a decade.  I came to Congress to effect change at a national level and to serve the people of my district and all of the people across this great country. Congress has fallen behind the leadership and the progress of Democratic and Republican States alike and cities, as well, across the Nation who have had to take the lead without us. Passing this bill is a step in the right direction and will demonstrate to States and cities across this great country that Congress is listening and acting.  This bill addresses many of the issues that I have been working on in my career as a State legislator, as a city councilman, and now as a Federal elected public servant. For instance, it helps cities and local organizations fund community-based gang prevention and intervention programs.  When I was on the Los Angeles City Council, I made sure that organizations receiving taxpayer dollars from our city were actually achieving the results that they had promised. I am pleased that this bill includes a strong emphasis on research and science and making sure that evidence-based programs are prioritized. It ensures that we are supporting programs and organizations that work, which will save the taxpayers billions of dollars in the short run, hundreds of billions of dollars in the long run, and also make our communities much, much safer.  This bill supports programs that ensure youth have access to appropriate legal representation and programs to expand access. This bill supports programs designed to educate kids and their families about how they can go about sealing and expunging their juvenile records and to help them do that along the way.  This bill supports programs focused on girls in the juvenile justice system. Equally important, this bill makes sure that all ethnicity is recorded so we can get a better understanding of who is in our juvenile justice system and address any disparities if we find them.  This bill will put us on a path to ensuring kids are not detained for an offense that would not be a crime if committed as an adult, such as skipping school or running away from home. It is high time we reauthorize the JJDPA, and I hope my colleagues in the House and Senate can come together to advance this critical update to our juvenile justice laws.  It is our responsibility to lead. I urge my colleagues to be leaders by voting for the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017. Once again, it is long, long overdue.

9794,topic-id,1427,"Mr.President, earlier, just before the leader came to give his closing remarks for the day, I was talking about that Michael Davis is going to be a freshman at Middletown High School about 20 miles south of Newark where 896 intersects with I-95.  I was mentioning that Michael has succeeded in life as an athlete in ways that a lot of people think could just never happen. He has a disease called cystic fibrosis, and it was diagnosed very early in his life, but it is a genetic disease.  I talked with him and his mom Jennifer about that disease and how it affects our bodies. It is a disease that causes persistent lung infection. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the condition is caused apparently by a defective gene that causes a thick buildup of mucus in our lungs and in other organs; and that mucus can clog our airways and trap bacteria that leads to infection, can lead to extensive lung damage and, in worst cases, to respiratory failure and then possibly maybe even likely death.  This is a disease that 14-year-old Michael Davis lives with. I have heard, for somebody who has cystic fibrosis to run any distance at all, they--I ran this morning, and I felt like I had some kind of disease. It was humid out there. I think it was probably higher levels of ozone than I like to run in.  For folks with cystic fibrosis like Michael, breathing is like they are breathing through a straw. Imagine that, trying to run 5 kilometers or a half marathon, which is 13.1 miles, and to be able to breathe through a straw effectively and still run distances like that is truly, truly remarkable, but that is what he does.  Earlier this year, he completed, as I said, the New York City half marathon, and one of the people who ran with him was my son Christopher, who is a triathlete in his own right. He is 28 years old and a great runner. He, also like Michael, can run me into the ground, and I am proud of them both.  Michael was diagnosed during a screening, I think, just 3 weeks after he was born. He was 3 weeks old, and he was diagnosed with this disease. His mom said she was shocked. To her knowledge, there weren't any members of her family on her side or the father's side who had cystic fibrosis, but this was a diagnosis made 3 weeks into Michael's life--imagine that, 3 weeks.  After the diagnosis, his mom Jennifer faced some scary unknowns as she learned more about his condition, including average life expectancy for those who have cystic fibrosis.  She immediately sought care for Michael at the Children's Hospital that is up the road from us--I live in Wilmington, DE--but it is up the road 25 miles north of For the last 14 years, Michael has been treated at that hospital. Obviously, the fact that he can run a half marathon with cystic fibrosis suggests that he is getting exceptional care there.  Michael sees the doctor about every 8 weeks when he is feeling well. He sees a doctor more often when he is not feeling well, when he is feeling really sick.  He wakes up every morning at 4:30. I get up around 5:30, and he has already been up for an hour when I get up in Wilmington, He does it to use a high-frequency chest wall oscillation device. They call it The What it does is, it helps break up the mucus in his lungs, and he continues to use The Vest several times throughout the day. He must also take over--are you ready for this--40 medications every day. So that is his regimen.  He gets up every day at 4:30, straps on The Vest, uses it several times throughout the day. The Vest shakes up his lungs and the mucus there so he can live, and he takes all his medications as well.  He told me, when we met with him and his mom a couple weeks ago, that cystic fibrosis is very frustrating, but he copes by trying to lead a healthy lifestyle. Just last week, Michael received national attention when he was named the Boomer Esiason Co-Athlete of the Boomer was a great football quarterback, if I am not mistaken--I am tempted to say with the Cincinnati I am looking for the pages to tell me whether I am right or wrong, but I think I am right. The Boomer Esiason Co-Athlete of the Year is Delaware's own Michael, and we are very proud of Michael, very proud of  The fact is, access to these treatments and medications are really a matter of life and death for people with cystic fibrosis. If something should happen and Michael and his family would lose healthcare, they would reach out and try to get coverage. Before we had the Affordable Care Act, there was a pretty good likelihood that finding that coverage would be very difficult, and it would be difficult because he has cystic fibrosis. He is not an inexpensive young man to take care of. To keep him alive and well and able to go to school and do the amazing regimen that he does takes money and resources, medicine and medical technology.  The way healthcare used to be provided in this country, when somebody had a preexisting condition like cystic fibrosis and they lost their healthcare--maybe a parent was working, had coverage, and lost the healthcare, lost the job--the person, in this case Michael, would have been out of luck because a lot of the health insurers used to say: Well, we don't want to cover this person because it is going to cost us a boatload of money.  I know there are problems with the Affordable Care There are things I would like to change. What I hope we will do at the end of the day is not get rid of it and not just repeal it, but I hope we will retain that which is good and fix the things that ought to be fixed.  One of the things that needs to be retained is the idea that there should be a prohibition against insurance companies simply saying that if somebody has a preexisting condition and they lose coverage, they can continue to be denied coverage. They can get the coverage they need, and that is one of the very, very good things about the Affordable Care  Our new pages here, you guys are about 2 years older than Michael Hopefully, you guys will live to be 100 or more. The only reason he is alive today is because he has access to the kind of healthcare we all want for our children and really for our parents.  I am a big believer--our pages hear me. I know they will only be here for 3 weeks, but they will probably hear me, when they come to the floor, talk about the Golden It is something that was impressed upon me at an early age, about the age of all of you. The Golden Rule goes something like this: Treat other people the way we want to be treated. It is pretty simple.[[Page S3562]]  I grew up in a Protestant Church, but I don't care whether you are Protestant, Catholic, Jew, I don't care if you are Muslim, I don't care if you are Buddhist, Hindu--you name it--all of those religions, every one of them, has something in their Sacred Scriptures something like the Golden Rule: Treat other people the way you want to be treated.  I think we try to do that in the Affordable Care Act, imperfect as it is. I think one of the best examples of the Golden Rule in the legislation, in the law, is the idea that if somebody loses coverage and they have a preexisting condition, we don't just cast them aside and say: Well, that is too bad. We give them another shot to get the coverage they need.  In the case of Michael Davis, the coverage, the access to healthcare, keeps him alive and not just alive to mope around and feel sorry for himself but to go out and run circles around the rest of us. He is an inspiration to me, and I think he is an inspiration to all who know him.  Mr.President, I think I may possibly be the last speaker. I am going to bid you good night and see you next week.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-15-pt1-PgS3561-3.txt,179,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2581, VERIFY FIRST ACT, AND",2017.0,15.0,July

9999,topic-id,614,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to mourn the death of my former constituent, Philando Castile, whose shocking and completely unnecessary death has now been seen by millions around the world via video.  I mourn not only his death but also the complete failure of local law enforcement and the criminal justice system to protect his most precious right, the right to life.  Philando, like so many other young African Americans before him,[[Page H5186]]interacted with local law enforcement, responded peacefully, did exactly what he was supposed to do, yet he wound up dead, shot six times at pointblank range by an officer who saw him as something less than human.  He is dead for no good reason except for the color of his skin and the fact that his ethnicity fed into an implicit, sick, and deadly bias held by some police officers that Black people present an imminent threat simply by virtue of who we are. That bias is pervasive, not just among some police officers, but also throughout our criminal justice system.  Anyone who views the video of Philando's police shooting can see that he should not be dead and that the officer who killed him should have been held accountable. But as in far too many other cases, the justice system failed Philando and his family in the most outrageous way. The sad truth is that, in 2017, we continue to suffer under a justice system that provides justice for some but not for all.  As I join with Philando's family and millions of other Americans who were outraged by the complete lack of accountability for his death, I cannot but help remember another tragic case, the death of my 18-year-old constituent, Mike Brown, almost 3 years ago in Ferguson, As I watched Philando's family screaming out for justice, they reminded me of something that Mike Brown's mother, Lezley McSpadden, told me. She said: Congressman, I want them to know that he mattered to me.  Well, he mattered to me, too, as well as So did Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, and so many others who have died at the hands of local police for no good reason and without any consequences.  Mr.Speaker, I have supported local law enforcement for over 30 years, and I continue to have no doubt that the vast majority of police officers perform a difficult, dangerous, and essential job with honor, bravery, and integrity. But I also know that too many other officers clearly lack the temperament and training to deescalate interactions before they become deadly, and that continues to cost many innocent lives.  That is why I have introduced, along with my good friends, Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee and Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, the Police Training and Independent Review Act of 2017. This legislation has already earned almost 100 cosponsors.  My bill would protect both police officers and the citizens they serve. It would require sensitivity training in the areas of race, ethnic bias, disabilities, and interactions with new immigrants. It would also establish incentives to encourage States to adopt new laws to require an independent prosecutor in all cases when police use deadly force. This legislation deserves a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote in this  I will close with this: a brief teaching from the late Martin Luther King, Jr., on the occasion of another needless tragedy, the police killing of civil rights worker Jimmie Lee Jackson by an Alabama State trooper in 1965.

He was murdered by the brutality of every sheriff who practices lawlessness in the name of the law.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgH5185-3.txt,1654,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,27.0,July

9909,topic-id,1688,"Mr.President, this weekend we saw a peaceful democratic election in France, one of our key Western allies in the bedrock of European stability after two terrible wars in the last century. What happened just before the Sunday election in France? There was a massive cyber attack on the leading candidate, the one who prevailed, Emmanuel Whom do experts suspect was behind this cyber attack trying to manipulate another Western election, trying to foster mistrust in that nation's democratic institutions? Not surprisingly,  Yet none of this should surprise anyone. Not only had Russia been subsidizing Mr.Macron's opponent, Marine Le Pen, who is seen as more sympathetic to Moscow, not to mention trying to interfere in Dutch and German elections as well, but we were warned about this by our own intelligence agencies 6 months ago.  In early October last year, the U.intelligence community detailed Russia's attack on America's election and warned us that other attacks would follow. During a recent trip to Eastern Europe, a Polish security expert warned me that if the United States didn't respond to an attack on its own Presidential election by the Russians, Putin would feel emboldened to keep up the attacks to undermine and manipulate elections all through the free world.  What has this administration and this Congress done to respond to the cyber act of war by the Russians against America's democracy? Has President Trump clearly acknowledged Russia's attack on the U.and forcefully condemned the actions? Has President Trump warned Russia to stop meddling in the United States and other democratic elections in France, Germany, and other countries? Has President Trump proposed a plan to help the United States thwart any future attack on the next election and to help our States protect the integrity of their voting systems? Has the Republican-led Congress passed sanctions on Russia in response to this attack on our democracy? Has it passed meaningful cyber security legislation?  Quite simply, the failure of this President and Congress to address the security threat is a stunning abdication of responsibility to protect the United States and our democratic values.  As if the conclusions of 17 U.intelligence agencies weren't enough to raise concerns, let's review what emerged just over the recent April recess. For example, Reuters reported that a Russian Government think tank, controlled by Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, developed a plan to swing our 2016 Presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters' faith in our electoral system.  The institute, run by a retired senior Russian foreign intelligence official, appointed by Putin, released two key reports, one in June and one in October of last year.  In the first, it argued that ``the Kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social media and Russian state-backed global news outlets to encourage US voters to elect a president who would take a softer line toward Russia than the administration of then-President Obama.''  The second warning said:       [P]residential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win      the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for      Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify      its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the US electoral      system's legitimacy and damage Clinton's reputation in an      effort to undermine her presidency.  It was also recently disclosed that the FBI obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant to monitor the communications of former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page on the suspicion that he was a Russian agent. Add this to the ever-growing list of suspicious relationships between those in the Trump circle and Russia, from Michael Flynn to Paul Manafort, to Roger Stone, to Felix  In fact, just last month, the Republican House Intelligence Committee chair, Jason Chaffetz, and the ranking Democratic member, Elijah Cummings, said General Flynn may have broken the law by failing to disclose on his security clearance forms payments of more than $65,000 from companies linked to Yet, incredibly, the White House continues to stonewall requests for documents related to General  White House ethics lawyer during the George Bush administration, Richard Painter, wrote of this stonewalling: ``US House must subpoena the docs. . . . Zero tolerance for WH [White House] covering up foreign payoffs.''  Is it any wonder why, in recent testimony to Congress, FBI Director Comey acknowledged an investigation of Russian interference in our election, which[[Page S2823]]he said included possible links between Russia and Trump associates.  Finally, over the recess--on tax day, to be precise--there were nationwide protests calling on President Trump to take the necessary step to dispel concerns by releasing his taxes once and for all. The concern over his taxes goes to the serious question as to how much Russian money is part of the Trump business empire. In 2008, Donald Trump, Jr., said Trump's businesses ``see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.'' This was despite his father incredibly saying this just a few months ago: ``I have nothing to do with Russia--no deals, no loans, no nothing!''  It appears that the Russians were some of the few willing to take on the financial risk required to invest in Trump's precarious business deals. Any such Russian money, combined with the President's refusal to formally separate himself from his business operations during his Presidency, demand the release of his tax returns. Trump's response to the mounting calls to release these returns--the usual--is to attack everyone asking questions and blindly dismiss the issue as being irrelevant.  Of course, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee had compelling testimony yesterday from former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Miss Yates discussed the urgent warning that she delivered to the White House Counsel on January 26 that the National Security Advisor to the President of the United States, General Flynn, had been compromised and was subject to blackmail by the It was a warning she repeated in two meetings and a phone call.  What did the White House do in response to the Acting Attorney General warning them that the highest adviser in the White House on national security could be blackmailed by the Russians? For 18 days, General Flynn continued to staff President Trump for a phone call with Vladimir Putin and other highly sensitive national security matters.  Think of that. After being warned by the Attorney General that the man sitting in the room with you, the highest level of National Security Advisor, could be compromised by the Russians, President Trump continued to invite General Flynn for 18 days in that capacity. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said:       When the President heard the information as presented by      White House Counsel, he instinctively thought that General      Flynn did not do anything wrong, and that the White House      Counsel's review corroborated that.  Let's be clear. It is bad enough to have a National Security Advisor who is subject to blackmail by the The fact that the Trump White House didn't see that as an urgent problem is deeply troubling.  I am glad the Senate Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee held this hearing yesterday, but the occasional subcommittee hearing is not enough. Let's make sure we know for the record that this subcommittee--chaired by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, and Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat of Rhode Island--did a yeoman's duty--not just yesterday but in a previous hearing, without being allocated any additional resources for this investigation, without being given additional staff. They have brought to the attention of the American people some important facts about what transpired in the Trump White House after it was clear that General Flynn had been compromised by the  But the occasional subcommittee hearing like this is not enough. We need an independent, bipartisan commission with investigative resources and the power necessary to dig into all of the unanswered questions. Until we do, the efforts of this committee or that committee are not enough. It has to be a conscious effort on a national basis by an independent commission.  For President Trump, these issues do not appear to be relevant, yet there is a simple way to resolve the many questions that are before us.  First, disclose your tax returns and clear up, among other questions, what your son said in 2008 about a lot of Russian money pouring into your family business.  2, answer all the questions about campaign contacts with the Russians, including your former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, and former policy advisor Carter  3, quite simply, explain the reports of repeated contacts between your campaign operatives and Russian intelligence.  4, answer all the questions about your close friend Roger Stone's comments that suggest he had knowledge of Wikileaks' having and using, in strategically timed releases when your campaign was struggling, information that had been hacked by the Russians from your opponent's campaign.  5, explain your ties to Russian foreign businessman Felix Sater, who worked at the Bayrock Group investment firm, which partnered with your business and had ties to Russian money.  6, provide all requested documents to Congress related to Michael Flynn, who concealed his payments from the Russian interests. If there is nothing to hide, this is your chance to clear up things once and for all.  To my Republican colleagues I say again that these Russian connections may constitute a national security crisis. We need to have the facts. How long will we wait for these desperately needed answers before we establish an independent commission investigation, as we have done when faced with previous attacks on America?  Finally, how long will we sit by before passing additional sanctions on Russia for their cyber attack on the United States of America? That attack makes November 8, 2016, a day that will live in cyber infamy in America's history. It is time for the Republicans and the Democrats to show the appropriate concern for this breach of our national security.  We have a bipartisan Russian sanctions bill ready to go to the Senate Foreign Relations What are we waiting for?  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

9963,topic-id,1122,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am very grateful that the House is considering my bill today, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection  I want to thank my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, for joining as the lead Republican cosponsor of this measure. I am proud that we are bringing it up to the floor with 108 cosponsors, Members from both sides of the aisle.  Mr.Speaker, every week, more and more bad news pours in about the civil war in I am grateful to Chairman Royce for making the comments he just made because my heart has been bleeding for Syria, or crying out for Syria, for 4 or 5 years now, ever since, as Mr.Royce said, there were peaceful demonstrations and they were mowed down by the Assad regime.  The United States didn't do much. We sort of watched and retreated and perhaps were afraid that we would be bogged down in another war. But we should have, at that point, in my estimation, helped the free Syria Army, which begged us for help, not people, not troops, but help, and we didn't do it. We didn't give it to them.  We thought that Assad would fall on his own, ultimately, but he didn't, and we are bearing the price today. We are paying the price today. The people of Syria, unfortunately, are the ones paying the price. Millions of people have died and have been misplaced and just the horrors of war and the horrors of civilians. So my heart really bleeds for the Syrian people.  This week, it was the revelation of a crematorium, a furnace where the criminals who do Assad's bidding can pile the bodies and try to burn away the evidence of their atrocities.  Also this week, Russia announced that they will work with Iran, Iraq, and Assad to open a secure road from Baghdad to What that really means, Mr.Speaker, is a road from Beirut to Tehran in Iran, a permanent Iranian foothold right in the Middle East, a permanent Iranian foothold right on Israel's border, a permanent Iranian foothold to do mischief and the usual nefarious things that the Iranian Government does.  This crisis has been burning out of control for six long years. I was an early vocal supporter, as I mentioned before, of arming the moderate Syrian opposition. I thought we should have done much more to help push Assad out of power and help the Syrian people chart the course for their country's future. When we didn't, I spoke out.  Since then, Assad has plowed ahead with his campaign of carnage. The few times he appeared to be taking on water, he was given a lifeline by his devoted enablers, Russia and Iran, through its terrorist proxy, Every time Assad seemed to be losing, he was given a lifeline and, as I just mentioned, by Hezbollah, also given a lifeline by the Russians who came in.  So while it was suspected in the highest annals of Washington that Assad wouldn't last more than a few months, no one would have imagined that 4 and 5 years later there would be Assad winning the war, again, with the help of Russia, Iran, and their terrorist proxy.  It is a disgrace, Mr.Speaker, and we need to act out. We need to help.  Today, we find ourselves no closer to a solution, and 4 months into the new administration, we have yet to hear a strategy for dealing with The Tomahawk missile strike last month was an appropriate response to the chemical weapons attack, although I believe the administration's policy shift, with respect to Assad, emboldened Assad to launch that attack, and a single missile strike is not a strategy.  We need a plan to stop the violence, push a political transition that sees the end of Assad's rule and helps the Syrian people recover and move forward. My bill, this bill, would be part of that strategy.                              {time}  1715  It is named, as Mr.Royce pointed out, for Caesar, a former Syrian Government photographer. Fed up with documenting the brutality of the Assad regime, he defected and escaped so he could show the world exactly what was happening to the regime's victims.  I will never forget the images he showed us when he came to the Foreign Affairs Those images are still seared in my brain and I will never forget them; the depth of brutality and indifference to human life.  We have named this bill after him because we want to send a message. If you are supporting this murder, if you are enabling the butcher in Damascus to continue waging that sort of violence against his own people, you are going to face consequences.  This bill would sanction anyone who provides material support for the Assad regime. We want to go after the actual hardware that keeps his war machine running, the planes and bombs that terrorize the Syrian people, and the spare parts and oil that keep everything running. If you do business with Assad, the blood of the Syrian people is on your hands and you are going to get caught up in these sanction. Yes, that means Iran and  If conditions on the ground change and negotiations were in sight, it might be useful to dial back these sanctions in order to help end the violence. So we have built in some degree of flexibility. The measures are tough, but we all want them to be a roadblock to peace.  This bill also seeks to provide some relief to the Syrian people who are now suffering terribly. It would improve oversight of assistance flowing into Syria and evaluate the feasibility of a no-fly zone.  We also need to think about what must happen after the violence has ended, about who must be held accountable. So this bill requires reporting on human rights violators, and would support efforts to gather evidence of crimes against humanity. This bill isn't a silver bullet. It isn't a strategy for resolving the crisis in  Congress can do a lot, though, when it comes to foreign policy. We can give an administration tools and resources, but it is up to the White House to lead on this issue. If the first step in a serious strategy is stopping the violence--and I think it is--this legislation can help dial up pressure on those driving the war.  So I continue to push ahead; Mr.Royce at my side, and I am grateful to my colleagues for their support. I am grateful to the Foreign Affairs Committee for moving this swiftly.

We need to face the reality of this crisis today and do all we can to forge a new strategy to deal with it.

Your past willingness to engage with all      stakeholders is admirable.       Unfortunately, I am disheartened to hear that a finalized      FFMP has yet to be established. Despite the recent breakdown      in the conversation, I believe that it is not too late to      continue collaborative negotiations toward a final agreement.      With the deadline fast approaching, it is vitally important      that all Decree Party Members return to the table to continue      the dialogue. Incredible reforms and relationships have been      established over the last decade; we cannot let these efforts      go to waste.       I understand that several proposals to improve basin      management and releases have been suggested up to this point,      and I urge all Decree Party Members to consider positive      reforms, including:       Thermal mitigation banks to provide support to cold-water      fisheries during times of thermal stress in the Pepacton,      Neversink, and Cannonsville ecosystems;[[Page H4321]]       Flood mitigation improvements that will decrease the risk      of disastrous flooding events both above and below the dams;       Continued evaluation of the impacts of fully utilizing the      F.Walter Dam and reservoir.       Regardless of the final changes to the FFMP, it is      imperative that we not sacrifice the progress which has been      made over the last number of years. All parties' specific      concerns and opinions have value, but we must accept that if      we are not willing to negotiate and compromise we jeopardize      the safety, well-being, and economic viability of all      communities within the Delaware River       I eagerly anticipate a finalized FFMP before the May 31      deadline. If a new FFMP cannot be negotiated within that      time, a one-year extension should be agreed upon. Reverting      back to the 1980s reservoir management approach is      unacceptable.       I am more than willing to provide support as needed.           Sincerely,                                                 John Faso,                                               Member of Congress,     19th Congressional District of New                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgH4320.txt,99999999999999,CAESAR SYRIA CIVILIAN PROTECTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,18.0,May

Lionfish are an invasive species, with no predators, huge appetites, and exploding populations. Just one female lionfish will release 10 million eggs during her lifetime. Each lionfish can eat 65 juvenile reef fish in one meal. NOAA ecologists call the lionfish one of the greatest threats of the century to reefs.  Reefs support tourism, recreational fishing, commercial fishing, and our way of life. Lionfish threaten a multi-billion-dollar reef economy. To date, all efforts to eradicate the lionfish have failed. Bounty programs are uneconomical, and rodeos, while helpful, are unscalable.  Today, I filed legislation to turn the tables on the lionfish. Our proposition is simple: Fishermen who slay 100 lionfish can earn one tag to fish red snapper, gag grouper, triggerfish, or amberjack whenever they want.

9921,topic-id,3136,"Mr.Speaker, it has been a most interesting day here in Washington, D.C., this last week in which we have seen the battle royal over the repeal of the Affordable Care I want to really speak about the Affordable Care Act, what it has managed to do for  Much of the conversation over these last several days has been on the other side of it: how it could be repealed and how, somehow, that would be good for  But the Congressional Budget Office has made it clear that the bill that passed the House of Representatives some time ago, about a month and a half ago, was bad news for Some 18 million people would lose their health insurance in very short order within a year or so, and some 24 million would lose their health insurance over the next 5 to 7 years. That is a terrible situation.  When you take a look at what has happened in the recent period since 2014 when the Affordable Care Act was actually in full force, we have found many millions of Americans with insurance.  In my own State of California, we now have over 5 million Californians with insurance that they previously did not have. About 1.5 million of those Californians are in the exchange--the California exchange, which we call Covered California--and another 3.5 million are covered in the expanded Medicaid program. That is good news.  It is also good news that people who previously were unable to take care of their medical issues found coverage.  I remember a woman, actually, my wife's beautician, who came to her as the Affordable Care Act was implemented in California and told her: At last I can get insurance. My husband and I are going to have a baby--or we want to have a baby. We couldn't afford it before. But now I have insurance. I am on the exchange. I have the subsidy, and I can afford it--family values.  In the last 6 months, as the new administration has taken hold and as the repeal of the Affordable Care Act has become the talk of the Nation, in a more recent visit, she said: We have delayed getting pregnant because we are not sure if I can have insurance. If they repeal, if they kill ObamaCare, I won't have insurance, and we won't have a baby.                              {time}  1800  Family values. I want to talk about values: family values and others.  I used this last week, and I am going to use it over and over again, because this is a statement of values. This is from Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the midst of the Great  President Roosevelt said this: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''  That is a statement of values. That is a statement of purpose. That is the reason why he and the Democrats, during the Great Depression, took the actions like, for example, Social For those who have little, Social  Then, again, in the sixties, for those who have little, this same statement of value came into place. During Lyndon Johnson's Presidency, the Democrats created Medicare for seniors--men and women over 65. All you needed to do to get health insurance was to live until you were 65 years of age. They also added Medicaid for the poor--principally, children and mothers.  It is a statement of values. It is a statement of purpose. It is a statement of where their heart lies and what they thought was important.  Today, we are working on the Affordable Care Act, sometimes, often derisively, called But many of us proudly call it ObamaCare, where 5 million Californians have health insurance. Across this Nation, there are 20 million in all States, although some States chose not to extend the method of buying insurance on the exchanges. And so the Federal exchange exists.  This House went the opposite direction. So what did it mean? The uninsured rate in America declined down to the lowest number ever in our history, as men, women, and families were able to get health insurance.  I think of a farmer, a single woman in my district, who never had insurance, never could get health insurance, couldn't afford it until the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, came along. She was able to get insurance. She was able to get cancer treatment. If she didn't have insurance, she surely would have died. We have countless examples.  When I was the insurance commissioner in California, we would always fight the insurance companies over their denial of insurance. They used to call it preexisting conditions. Since the Affordable Care Act went into place in 2011 and 2012, preexisting conditions were no longer legal as a mechanism for denying insurance in the United States of Insurance companies could not rate people on preexisting conditions.  I remember those lists. It was two pages. As insurance commissioner, people would come to me and say: Why do[[Page H5970]]I have to fill out this form of everything I have ever done in my life? A broken leg playing football in high school had to be listed--asthma, coughs, contagious diseases. Even mundane things like: Are you a pilot; are you into dirt bikes and dirt bike racing?  These were all reasons why insurance would be denied. But with the Affordable Care Act, no more. That history was gone.  So, today, the President of the United States, perhaps proudly, stood before the American people and said: I will let it die. I will let it die. I will let the Affordable Care Act fail.  What is the message to the American public? What is the message that the President of the United States, Mr.Speaker, has said to the American public?  Mr.Speaker, he has said: I will work to deny the American people health insurance.  Mr.Speaker, the President of the United States has, in so many words, said that he will take action to deny the American people health insurance--not all of them, just 20 million. You proactively take specific actions.  And what are those actions? To tell the IRS to not enforce the mandate so that people will be able to go without insurance until they have an accident or sickness and wind up in the emergency room so that everybody else can pay for their care.  He will not allow the payment of the cross-subsidies for those insurance companies that have enrolled an excessive amount of very sick people and other insurance companies that have enrolled a healthy population. That cross-subsidy is critical.  He will create more uncertainty so that the insurance companies do not know how to price their insurance. He has already removed the ability for the Federal and State exchanges to advertise. There is no insurance company, I can tell you from my own experience, that can survive without advertising. They have got to talk about what it is they are offering. They have to sign up people, and they have to have a cross subsidization of healthy, sick, and not so sick people in their pool of risk. But he set up a system so that those exchanges that are in existence in the States and the Federal exchanges will not have the money to advertise.  California is a big We can get along without President So we have set up our own mechanism of providing money for advertising Covered A couple of other States have been able to do the same, but not every  There has been discussion that the market is collapsing. I want to read to you an analysis done by the Kaiser Family Foundation that just came out a week ago that would counter the arguments that this is a collapsing market. I am going to read this. It is a little long, but I think it is worth understanding.  ``Early results from 2017 suggest the individual market is stabilizing and insurers in this market are regaining profitability. Insurer financial results show no sign of a market collapse.''  Perhaps I should read that again and perhaps the President might also want to read, although I understand he doesn't. Perhaps if he did, he would read the Kaiser Family Foundation report coming out July 2017.  ``Insurer financial results show no sign of a market collapse. First quarter premium and claims data from 2017 support the notion that 2017 premium increases were necessary as a one-time market correction to adjust for a sicker-than-expected risk pool.''  I am going to come back to that after finishing reading this.  ``Although individual market enrollees appear on average to be sicker than the market pre-ACA, data on hospitalizations in this market suggest that the risk pool is stable on average and not getting progressively sicker as of early 2017. Some insurers have exited the market in recent years, but others have been successful and expanded their footprints, as would be expected in a competitive marketplace.  ``While the market on average is stabilizing, there remain some areas of the country that are more fragile. In addition, policy uncertainty has the potential to destabilize the individual market generally. Mixed signals from the administration and Congress as to whether cost sharing subsidy payments will continue or whether the individual mandate will be enforced have led to some insurers to leave the market or request larger premium increases than they would otherwise. A few parts of the country may now be at risk of having no insurer on exchange, though new entrants or expanding insurers have moved in to cover most areas previously thought to be at risk of being bare.''  Not my words, but rather the words of the Kaiser Family  So, Mr.Speaker, the President apparently intends to destroy the Affordable Care Act by saying that it doesn't work. In fact, his actions may make it a situation in which it would not work.  I suppose if he has his way, we are going to see, in 2018, the number of uninsured rise back to where it was before the Affordable Care That is about 22 million Americans without insurance.  Well done, Mr.Well done. If that is what you want, I want to know what your values are. What are your values?  Mr.Speaker, I would ask the President: What are your values, Mr.President? You have been supporting the Republican legislation to repeal and replace. It happens to do much for those who have much.  The largest single tax break for the wealthy ever in this Nation's history was in the legislation that passed the House of Representatives with the repeal and replace legislation, so much so that Mr.Trump's Cabinet, made up of the wealthiest Cabinet perhaps ever in America's history, would receive huge tax breaks of well over $4 million a year, and quite possibly a much higher number.  Those are not the values of the Democratic Party, those are not the values of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and those are clearly not the values of Americans who care about each other, who are concerned about those who have little.  Ask the American public if they want to do away with Social Ask the American public if they want to do away with Do away with Medicaid? Yes, 60 percent of the Medicaid money supports seniors in nursing homes. You want to do away with that? I don't think so. But that is what it would do.  The Affordable Care Act does need to be improved, and the Democrats have been trying to do that for some time. How can we do it? Many ideas have been proposed.  When the legislation was heard in committees here, the Democrats proposed several amendments to improve the Affordable Care The first amendment was to do away with the repeal, but, of course, that didn't pass in committee and certainly wasn't on the floor.                              {time}  1815  So how do you deal with improving the Affordable Care Act?  Let's start with drugs. We know that for the Medicare system, that the Federal Government cannot negotiate the price of drugs. And for the exchanges--the Federal exchanges, we cannot negotiate the price of drugs. It was a law that was written with Medicare part D back in 2002 and 2003.  So why can't we negotiate the price of drugs?  We ought to be able to do that. You want to reduce one of the cost factors, let's negotiate the price of drugs.  How about another one? How about consumer services? Increasing the risk pool, increasing the number of men and women that are in the pool by advertising?  I talked earlier about the President removing the money for advertising on the Federal exchanges and State exchanges.  You want to improve it, improve the risk pool. A broad risk pool is a fundamental fact of any insurance program that is successful. But to take overt action, to diminish the risk pool, and to put into the risk pool less healthy people, and to keep people who are healthy out of the risk pool--please keep in mind that any of us at any particular day may find ourselves in need of very serious medical attention, perhaps a car accident, perhaps a contagious disease, Zika, who knows what it might be, or a pregnancy. So expand the risk pool by advertising, by enforcing the mandate, which is the third element that could be done.[[Page H5971]]  The President has already taken action to tell the IRS not to enforce the mandate. So the young healthy invincibles shirk the law knowing that they don't ever have to pay a penalty because the IRS is not looking.  Okay, if that is what you want to do. However, if you want to improve the healthcare of America, if you want to hold premiums stable and perhaps even declining, expand that risk pool.  How about a few other things?  When the Affordable Care Act passed the House of Representatives in 2009, there was a public option in it. Unfortunately, the Senate wouldn't stand for a public option. But bring the public option back so that there would be a national public option insurance company available to everybody. Bring that back. That is another idea that ought to be the improvement of it.  Another thing: States can and have successfully modified the Medicaid programs in their Expand the ability of States to experiment with different ways of providing services under the Medicaid program. Not by eliminating it, as the Republicans would do--that is, eliminating the expansion, as the Republicans would do in their repeal and in TrumpCare--but, rather, allow the States to experiment with different ways of providing the medical services in the Medicaid program. And there are some great ideas out there.  We know that many of the people in Medicaid have long illnesses, high blood pressure; perhaps they have other illnesses that require constant care. We know that there are examples of programs that provide ongoing services so that these illnesses are constantly being able to be monitored and dealt with.  You want to deal with blood pressure, take a couple of cheap pills and you keep the blood pressure down and you avoid stroke and diabetes and the like. Those programs should be existing in most States, in most Medicaid programs. So we ought to provide the opportunity for the States to experiment with different ways of keeping down the cost of medical services.  There are many other things that we can do with regard to the delivery systems. California has been a leader in creating various delivery systems that do keep down the cost of care--comprehensive delivery system, preexisting conditions being taken care of. So we can do this with a variety of ways.  All of these should be on the floor of the House of Representatives and the Senate and presented to the President as we have the Affordable Care Act in place and we have ideas on how it can be improved.  Programs such as mandatory care, all of those can be taken into consideration. But, no, we are not going to do that. We are just going to let the Affordable Care Act die, so says our  It is unbelievable that you sign on, presumably to provide more opportunity for Americans, to provide better medical care for But, no, that is not what is going to happen here. The President of the United States said he is going to let it die, let it collapse. How cruel, how harsh, and how unlike previous I pray future Presidents who say: My job as President of the United States is to carry out, yeah, the preamble to the Constitution, to form a better union.  But apparently that is not the case with this  So the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, and it is the responsibility of the President to carry out the laws of the land, and that includes things that he thinks may be discretionary, such as the IRS mandate, such as the advertising, the cross-subsidization for those insurance companies that have higher risk pools than other insurance companies.  We live in a very important moment where at risk are 22, 23, 24 million American lives. Thankfully, four senators stood strong and courageous and said, no, they were not going to support the repeal of the Affordable Care  It is not over. This fight is going to go on for some time, and as it goes on, I would hope the American people understand what is at risk. It is the well-being of their neighbors, it is the health of their communities, and, indeed, in some cases, it may be their own life. We will see.  But today, a good thing happened--actually it was yesterday a good thing happened. The Senate was unable to pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement that was in every way a terrible blow to So we are thankful, and we look to the future and we look to the fight ahead.  I can tell you this: My colleagues on the Democratic side are absolutely determined that the Affordable Care Act be improved and that it continue to be the law of the land. And the millions upon millions of Americans that have had the opportunity to purchase health insurance, to be covered in health exchanges, to be covered under the expansion of the Medicaid program, we are there for them and we are going to fight this. And we will succeed because Americans know what is at risk in the legislation that passed the House of Representatives with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the legislation that almost passed the This isn't over. Our determination to stay the line remains.

I rise today to oppose the nomination of Scott Gottlieb to serve as the Commissioner of the Food and Drug It is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, starting with its Commissioner, to protect consumers and stand up for public health.  I have serious concerns about Gottlieb's record. I also have additional concerns from his nomination hearing about his stances on critical priorities for people in New Hampshire and across the  As I mentioned, and as Senator Markey has detailed, as well, the most pressing public health and safety challenge facing New Hampshire is the heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis. I want to thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership and work in helping to identify the root causes of this terrible epidemic.  Yesterday, I was in New Hampshire, and I met with the Drug Enforcement Agency leaders and personnel there. I heard updates from those on the frontlines about the latest developments in the substance misuse crisis. We discussed the spread of the dangerous synthetic drug carfentanil, which is 100 times stronger than the already deadly drug fentanyl.  A report released this week by New Futures showed the economic impact of alcohol and substance misuse costs. It costs New Hampshire's economy now over $2 billion a year. It is clear that we need to take stronger action to combat this crisis.  We have to continue partnering together with those on the frontlines and at every level of government. We need to be developing new tools and leveraging the ones we have to combat this crisis.  What we cannot afford to do is to institute policies that would take us backward. Unfortunately, Gottlieb has been opposed to the creation of one of the key tools that the FDA has at its disposal--risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, otherwise known as The agency uses REMS--including, as a strategy, prescriber training--to try to stem the risks associated with certain medications.  The FDA should be making REMS stronger and making sure that all opioid medications have We don't need a Commissioner who opposed the very creation of the REMS program, as Gottlieb did. In the midst of a public health challenge as serious as this epidemic, we should be taking--and we have to take--an all-hands-on-deck approach. The fact that Gottlieb was opposed to the very creation of REMS raises questions about what strategies the FDA would support under his leadership.  There is another issue involved in this nomination of deep concern to the people of New I am concerned about Gottlieb's record of putting politics ahead of science when it comes to women's health. To compete economically on a level playing field, women must be able to make their own decisions about when and if to start a family. To fully participate not only in our economy but also in our democracy, women must be recognized for their capacity to make their own healthcare decisions, just as men are. They must also have the full independence to make their own healthcare decisions, just as men do.[[Page S2826]]  Unfortunately, this administration has made clear that it is focused on an agenda that restricts women's access to critical health services, including family planning.  Gottlieb's record has demonstrated that he supports this backward agenda. During his time in the Bush administration, Gottlieb was involved in a controversial and unscientifically based delay in approving the emergency contraceptive Plan B for over-the-counter use.  I am concerned that under his leadership, the FDA will play political games with women's health once again. I am afraid that he will disregard science-based decisions under pressure from this administration. Gottlieb's nomination raises too many questions about whether he will put political interests ahead of science and ahead of the safety of consumers.  I hope that he has learned about the priorities of Senators and the constituents they represent throughout the nomination process and that he proves to be a stronger Commissioner than his record suggests. But in voting today, I cannot overlook that record, so I will vote against his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Strange).

The Republican majority's path to take healthcare from 23 million Americans has been as convoluted as it has been chaotic.  Mr.Speaker, as I am sure you and my colleagues should remember, first, the Republican mantra was repeal. Then it was repeal and replace. Then it was repeal and delay, followed by access to coverage, and then, patient centered.  Finally, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle settled on a three-bucket strategy. The first bucket of this strategy was the Republicans'[[Page H4869]]American Health Care The majority brought their first iteration of this bill to the floor after working on it for 17 days, and, with no hearings, only to have it go down in flames in the most public and spectacular fashion.  So they went back to the drawing board--not to improve the bill, or improve healthcare for the American people, mind you, but to garner enough Republican votes for a bill that ultimately had 17 percent approval ratings. And they added a manager's amendment to get support, then they added another manager's amendment, then another, and another.  Then with a bill patched together with the wants and wishes of powerful healthcare lobbyists and tax breaks for the superwealthy, with no CBO score, and with no way for the American people, let alone their own Members, to actually know what was in the bill, the majority pushed the bill through the House of  What did my Republican friends do after passing this inexplicably bad bill? They got on a couple of buses from here at the Capitol and went to a rose garden ceremony hosted by President Donald John Trump to celebrate upending one-sixth of the American economy and taking away healthcare from 23 million people.  That was certainly the Republicans' most recent mission-accomplished moment, and it must have been some celebration because it will be another 2 weeks before the majority would actually get around to sending their healthcare bill to the Senate, due to the fact that they were not sure if it complied with the Senate rules or, more specifically, the Byrd rule in the U. Then there is the second bucket of this plan, which involves the Trump administration rolling back regulations. Should the work associated with the second bucket proceed as it has with the other two, then I am sure it, too, will be a disaster, benefitting the wealthy at the expense of hardworking  Mr.Speaker, this brings me to the Republicans' third bucket. According to Senator Ted Cruz, this bucket is ``a sucker's bucket.'' Indeed, some like Senator Tom Cotton have referred to all of this bucket talk as simply a bunch of political spin. Whatever it is, it is an empty bucket.  The most recent bill the Republican majority has decided to dump in this sucker's bucket is H.2581, the Verify First Under current law, premium assistance tax credits are available for eligible individuals and families to subsidize the cost of health insurance. Individuals are not eligible for these credits unless they are U.citizens or are living in the country legally.  Currently, applicants have 90 days to provide documentation or otherwise address any issues with citizenship and immigration status, and are presumed eligible to enroll in marketplace coverage. If an individual is unable to provide the necessary documentation, coverage and financial assistance are terminated.  This provision ensures that individuals are not left in a position of having to wait potentially months to be verified before they can afford coverage, and it provides the proper guardrails to terminate assistance if an individual is deemed ineligible. There is no evidence to support the majority's claim that this process is not working.  H.2581 would repeal this 90-day verification period, setting up an unnecessary barrier for eligible individuals to receive the credits they need to afford lifesaving healthcare. Republicans themselves acknowledge that the verification process could take months, but, nevertheless, they are bringing forth today's bill knowing full well that it will make it harder for vulnerable people to access healthcare when they need it most.  It would disproportionately hurt low-income Americans, especially naturalized Americans from immigrant families since they can have a harder time producing documentation needed to verify their citizenship. But don't just take my word for it.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by dozens and dozens of national, State, and local civil rights and advocacy groups strongly opposing this legislation, such groups as the NAACP, the Children's Defense Fund, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the American Friends Service Committee, the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Institute of the Sisters of Mercy, and I could go on, and on, and on, but in the interest of time, I thank the Speaker for allowing it to be made a part of the                                                    June 12, 2017.       Dear Member of Congress: As national, state, and local      organizations concerned about immigrant rights or access to      affordable health care, we are writing to strongly urge you      to VOTE NO on H.2581, the ``Verify First'' This bill      is an attack on people's ability to see a doctor and on      immigrants and people of color. It is not the ``common      sense'' taxpayer protection bill that its supporters would      have you believe.       H.2581 is a dangerous bill that puts up roadblocks for      both citizens and immigrants to obtain timely, affordable      health insurance. It would strip away provisions that provide      for a person to obtain subsidies for enrollment in an      Affordable Care Act (or the contemplated American Health Care      Act) plan while they work with Department of Health and Human      Services to verify their U.citizenship or immigration      status. The people most impacted are U.citizens who were      born abroad or naturalized. The bill also affects many      immigrants, especially those newly arrived or certain victims      of domestic violence and trafficking survivors.       The fact is that when individuals are not able to      immediately verify their citizenship or immigration status on      an Affordable Care Act Marketplace, it begins an often months      long, strenuous process of sending in documents that must be      physically inspected. Health care assisters routinely say      these clients are the hardest cases they work on because the      process for verifying citizenship and immigration status is a      time-consuming exercise in dealing with inefficient      government processes.       Rather than protect American taxpayers, H.2581 would      strip from American taxpayers important protections that are      needed to overcome deficiencies in federal government      databases. Immigrants who are not lawfully present are      categorically barred from enrollment in health insurance on      the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, and for the subsidies      that make that insurance affordable. Moreover, safeguards      protecting taxpayers are already built into the ACA;      individuals whose citizenship or immigration status cannot be      verified already are required to pay back all of their      subsidies when they file their taxes and ``reconcile'' their      premium tax credits.       Supporters of this bill cite a sloppy Senate Homeland      Security and Governmental Affairs Committee report that      arrived at a made-up number of supposed ``fraud.'' It's just      not true. The committee assumed that every person who lost      coverage for failure to verify their citizenship and      immigration status was undocumented. In the experience of our      organizations and organizations we work with, this is false.      These reports describe the first year of the marketplaces,      and it is well documented that system outages and      understaffing, among other technical problems, contributed to      the federal Marketplace's failure to verify consumers' status      promptly. The Department of Health and Human Services      Inspector General reported in 2014 that a cause of the delay      in verification was the agency's lack of prioritization of      this issue.       Despite huge gains since then, problems still persist. The      Social Security database holding many citizens' information      may not reflect common changes, such as when a person marries      and changes their last name, or when someone naturalizes and      gains U.citizenship. People lose their coverage because      they receive notices in languages they cannot read.      Immigrants are required to submit documents multiple times,      or wait while the Department of Homeland Security finds paper      files, a result of deficiencies in their databases affecting      groups like asylum applicants and some survivors of domestic      violence. These are among the many issues consumers face.       Congress has already deprived undocumented immigrants from      the ability to buy coverage, even at full price, so they can      see a doctor when they are sick, but this bill would go a      step further to delay or put out of reach affordable health      insurance for many citizens and lawfully present immigrants.      Our organizations firmly believe that this would be      detrimental to the people we represent and to all of our      communities as a whole. We have seen that when health      insurance is unaffordable, people are effectively prevented      from obtaining access to the care they need to be healthy.       This bill is not just an attack on our health care system,      it is also an attack on immigrants and people of color, which      our organizations stand firmly against. In his statements      when introducing this bill, Lou Barletta focused the      bill as part of his effort to ``stop illegal immigration.''      Barletta has a long history of anti-immigrant rhetoric,      from trying to prevent immigrants from leasing a residence to      stating that they should be denied life-saving services in      hospital emergency rooms. This bill is simply a vehicle for      scapegoating immigrants and people of color and will keep      eligible people from accessing health care.[[Page H4870]]       We the undersigned organizations urge you to vote NO on      H.2581 and the continued assault on immigrants and the      health of our communities.

If this is what we are in store for with the Republican's third bucket, then it is even worse than a sucker's bucket. It is callous, and it is cruel, and someone described the Vice Presidency once many years ago as a warm bucket of spit.

Mr.Speaker, earlier this year, Donald John Trump issued an executive order placing a hiring freeze on Federal civilian employees across the executive branch. This executive order, like many of the executive orders this President has issued, failed to take into account the effects it could have on our most vulnerable communities.  Veterans make up one-third of all Federal workers. I am very pleased that one is in my office. She is probably smiling because sometimes Charity probably doesn't think I even know that she is in the office. But she is there and does incredible work.  The Department of Veterans Affairs--a severely understaffed agency serving those veterans--cannot afford a hiring freeze.  This week, Republicans are bringing to the floor bills they claim would improve veterans' lives. If the President and my Republican colleagues are truly committed to our veterans, then they should ensure that reckless hiring freezes do not harm them in the future.

9848,topic-id,885,"Mr.Speaker, what we have here today is a rule with one bill that really was worked on in a bipartisan manner--sort of like regular order like we were promised by the Speaker at the outset of this session of Congress--and another bill, which is just more of the same from this majority: creating problems where none existed before.  The fact remains that the Republicans' healthcare bill and overall bucket strategy is a disaster for the American people, and no amount of Rose Garden backslapping is going to change that fact.  Under the Republican plan, 23 million Americans will be kicked off of their health insurance and $800 billion will be cut from Footnote right there, we hear that the Senate is taking up something. We don't know where and who is doing the taking up, but what I read today is that they are considering a glide path of some kind to cut  Mr.Speaker, cutting Medicaid hurts poor people. Whether you glide it or run it over them, either way you look at it, it hurts them, and we need to pay attention to that, particularly if we are doing it to provide for those of us that are better off in our society.  Seventy-five billion dollars will be cut from Medicare, insurance premiums would increase for people ages 60 to 64 by more than $3,000 a year, and protections for those with preexisting conditions will be eliminated.  I read about a 63-year-old lady who said that all of her conditions are preexisting and she can't afford insurance. H.2581 only adds to this pain by setting up an unnecessary barrier for eligible individuals to get access to healthcare.  But not to worry, under the Republican plan, the 400 highest income families would ultimately get tax cuts averaging around $7 million a year, and that information comes from the Ways and Means Committee's fact sheet.  Mr.Speaker, I and others here very frequently have pointed out that what the Republicans want to do is to cut benefits for poor people--the most vulnerable in our society--and to provide for the better-off tax cuts--those people in our society who least need them.  It occurs to me that if we were to have an opportunity to ask the 400 wealthiest families in this country whether or not they really need a tax cut, my belief, based on the four billionaires that I have known personally--two are deceased now--but in my conversations with all of them, their position was that they didn't need a cut. To the man, each one of them said that, if they were to receive tax cuts, they would prefer that they go to education, particularly education for kindergartners and prekindergartners.[[Page H4872]]  If my Republican colleagues can move past throwing red meat to their base--a group of people, mind you, who are most certainly disadvantaged--one day they are going to wake up and recognize that much of what we are doing here, even though they support it, many of the persons who are doing it, they, too, are caught up in this downward spiral that is involving healthcare in this country, the game that we are playing.  If we are willing to work in a serious manner to address the issues in our healthcare system, then I know that Democrats are ready to work with But whatever is going on in the other body, I assure you, no Democrats in the other body are involved in.  Last night I asked the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee whether or not he knew what this bill looked like, and his answer was that he did not.  I also said what I repeat here, that people are hurting in this country. Whether it is ObamaCare that the Republicans, I believe, are going to find that it is going to be hard to fix, or whether it is the Affordable Care Act that is in some phantom hole over in the other body, somehow or another, my friends on the other side are going to be held accountable for all of what is necessary to be done. The only way that is sensible--and I believe that every American is imploring us to undertake--is to sit down together.  I cannot believe that the 435 people plus 6 here in the House of Representatives and the 100 United States Senators do not have the ability to do all of the things that are necessary in order for Americans to receive adequate healthcare and to lead with protecting the most vulnerable in our society.  It is ridiculous to talk about cutting Medicaid when more than 60 percent of the people on Medicaid are seniors that are in nursing homes.  What are we going to say to those families? How are we going to address them when it comes to the reality that they are confronted with while we are up here jaw jacking back and forth about whether or not it is ObamaCare or whether or not it is the Affordable Care Act that we can't seem to find.  Somewhere along the lines, we need to sit down and work together. Failure to do so is to our own peril and to the peril of the citizens of this great country of ours.

9947,topic-id,367,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize Helen and Bobby Feldman for their strong leadership in the Jewish community. Bobby and Helen have been involved in a number of causes that celebrate their Jewish heritage as well as make a difference by putting the needs and well-being of others before themselves.  Bobby and Helen have worked with many organizations, including Stand With Us, an organization dedicated to educating individuals all over the world about Israel and ways to combat anti-Semitism, and HonestReporting, a media watchdog organization dedicated to providing facts, figures, and statistics to journalists across the world to ensure Israel's story is told fairly by the media.  Bobby Feldman's interest in Jewish culture and causes stemmed from his early interest in environmental issues. He worked with the Jewish National Fund in Las Vegas where he now serves as the president of the southern Nevada chapter. Their organization is working to revitalize areas in Israel by planting trees, creating parks, and working to build a better country for years to come.  Helen Feldman has a list of accomplishments herself. She helped organize the Women's Alliance of the Jewish National This organization encourages future generations of Las Vegas women to celebrate our solidarity with She also volunteered her time at local nursing homes; there she shows off her amazing singing talents and brightens the day of so many Nevada seniors.  On Sunday, April 30, the Jewish National Fund is hosting their annual Love of Israel brunch where both Helen and Bobby will be recognized for their involvement in the community. These two individuals should be proud of all that they have done together.  Earlier this week, Israel celebrated their Holocaust Remembrance Day, honoring and remembering the 6 million Jewish people who were the victims of Nazi hatred. It serves us all as a reminder for the need to turn away prejudice and racism and embrace others. That is why I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Helen and Bobby for their work here in the great State of I also want to congratulate them on 29 years of marriage, and I look forward to seeing more from them as they continue to make us all very proud.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgS3326.txt,1863,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2581, VERIFY FIRST ACT, AND",2017.0,7.0,June

There are reports that the Assad government is now cremating victims of mass murder in an attempt to hide the evidence of its numerous crimes. While this is taking place, Americans watched in disbelief; frankly, as President Trump met in the Oval Office with those who are protecting, aiding and abetting Bashar al-Assad and those committing atrocities by his command and in his name.

9934,topic-id,538,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding me this time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the VETERAN Act, the legislation before us today, and I do so for a very simple reason: This merely codifies what is already existing law under the Affordable Care Act, or so-called ObamaCare, something that was done through rulemaking that I presume has bipartisan support.                              {time}  1245  Yes, it is important to protect the veterans, but the reason we are on the floor today is another example of one of the greatest legislative malpractice acts ever committed in Congress: trying to pass a Republican healthcare bill with no oversight, with no hearing, no public input, and no experts testifying to run the traps for us as far as the intended and the unintended consequences.  The reason we are on the floor now 1 month after passage of that bill is to try to correct just one of the deficiencies that exist in it.  I say it is a so-called healthcare bill because what it really is is a $900 billion tax break to the most wealthy individuals in our country, including insurance companies and drug companies, under the guise of healthcare reform and asking 23 million Americans, including 2 million veterans, as my friend from Massachusetts just pointed out, in Medicaid to give up their healthcare coverage to pay for that massive tax cut.  It also will discriminate against older Americans in a rural congressional district, such as mine in western and north central Wisconsin, by allowing insurance companies to charge them higher premiums. It will also allow insurance companies to once again discriminate against individuals that have preexisting conditions.  It does absolutely nothing to control the costs of healthcare--which have been rising--especially prescription drug costs that are affecting all Americans, and it was done in a way to jam this Congress and jam the American people about the consequences of this so-called healthcare bill.  So, yes, let's fix and make sure that we are protecting veterans who are getting their healthcare outside the VA medical center so that they, too, qualify for premium tax credits, which this legislation allows.  But let's do healthcare the right way by studying the implications of what will affect one-fifth of the entire U.economy and almost one-half of all Federal spending. Let's regroup and do it the right way, through normal legislative process. That is having bipartisan discussions, committee hearings, and talking to the experts--consumers and patients alike--so we know what we are getting into when we are trying to take a run at the importance of healthcare in our country.  One area that I think we can reach bipartisan agreement on or should be focused on are further steps to reduce the cost of healthcare to make it more affordable for all Again, we are missing that opportunity because of the lack of hearings and because of how this legislation was rushed through this Chamber just a month ago.  We on this side didn't even get to see the language of it until late the night before it was on the House floor. That is no way to legislate healthcare policy.  Mr.Speaker, let's fix it today with this one small piece of legislation.  ",CREC-2017-06-15-pt1-PgH4925.txt,1498,TRIBUTE TO SAMUEL FRENCH,2017.0,15.0,June

Mr.Speaker, I was just recently in It was my first visit to Auschwitz and, obviously, seeing something like that is not something you are going to forget very quickly. Seeing something like that and an industrial machine put together to eliminate people is not something that people thought humanity was capable of[[Page H4289]]until they found out that it actually was possible.  So in preserving Auschwitz, the purpose was to say: Hey, this is possible. Never forget that this can happen again.  Mr.Speaker, it was just recently that we learned about the crematorium that was built in the Syrian prison.  Now, why was this built?  It was built to hide the massive amounts of bodies coming out, tortured to death; destroyed the lives cut short in this Syrian prison. It was used to disguise that. It was used to prevent mass graves from being dug.  I think that proves that Bashar al-Assad is actually a modern-day In fact, if you look at when, as was mentioned prior, Caesar came to our committee and showed us the images of brutality--the government cataloging the victims of the Syrian regime with markers written on the body, a numbering system, and a catalog to say, in essence, document these massive amounts of death--it became very clear to us in a very visual sense what was going on in  Mr.Speaker, oftentimes it is easy in the United States of America, where we have a lot of comforts and we have a lot of things granted to us that we take for granted, to look at a situation happening overseas and think it doesn't apply to us or doesn't affect us; and it is really tempting sometimes to get into that because it is easy sometimes to pretend something doesn't affect us. But it does.  We see the massive amounts of migration from Syria, the young 7-, 8-, and 9-year-olds who are not going to school now because they have been disrupted and their lives have been disrupted, and in 5 or 6 years, if they don't get an education and don't get hope and opportunity, they will provide now the next recruiting ground for ISIS, or ISIS two, or al-Qaida three, because people without hope and without opportunity are easy to bring into a terrorist ideology like those.  Mr.Speaker, the President rightly decided to enforce the red line in Syria when it came to the use of chemical weapons--something that the Western world has held very dear, that chemical weapons on the battlefield have no place--and he destroyed a Syrian airfield. It was the right move. It began to shift the balance of power in Syria, but way more needs to be done.  I have called for action in Syria, as many on this committee have for a very long time, and this, the Caesar bill, is a fantastic first step to doing it. It would increase sanctions on the Assad regime and its supporters for continued atrocities committed against the Syrian people. It requires this administration and any future administration to stand up and impose costs on the Russians, on the Iranians, and on the Syrian backers for the barrel bombing and gassing of innocent civilians.  Think about that, a barrel filled with explosives dropped indiscriminately on a population center intended to commit the largest amounts of casualties possible; a GPS-guided bomb, or a laser-guided bomb intentionally dropped into a hospital, and then a delay of 20 minutes so they can hit it again, or hit areas where first responders have responded to.  Mr.Speaker, this isn't a legitimate way of fighting war, if there is a legitimate way of fighting war. This is brutality to the top level, and this is a great step for this Congress to take. We unanimously passed this the last time. I sure hope we can do that again.  Again, I thank the leadership for leading on this. I thank Mr.Engel and Chairman Royce for their leadership.

9911,topic-id,925,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the nomination of Scott Gottlieb to lead the Food and Drug  The FDA Commissioner is our Nation's pharmaceutical gatekeeper, but for years the FDA has granted unfettered access to Big Pharma and its addictive opioid painkillers to the American public. The result is a prescription drug, heroin, and fentanyl epidemic of tragic proportions and the greatest public health crisis our Nation currently faces.  At a time when we need its leader to break the stronghold of big pharmaceutical companies on the FDA, Scott Gottlieb would be nothing more than an agent of Big Gottlieb's record shows that he doesn't support using the tools that the FDA has at its disposal to minimize the risks to public health from the misuse of prescription opioids.  The current opioid epidemic is a man-made problem. It was born out of the greed of big pharmaceutical companies and aided by the FDA, which willfully green-lighted supercharged painkillers like But, in order for us to understand this public health emergency and the critical role that leadership at the FDA has played and will continue to play in this crisis, we need a brief history lesson. We need to understand where these opioids come from.  In 1898, a German chemist introduced heroin to the world--a reproduction of an earlier form of morphine believed to be nonaddictive. The name ``heroin'' was derived from the German word ``heroisch,'' which means ``heroic.'' That is how men described the way they felt after taking the new drug.  In the first decade of the 20th century, doctors were led to believe that heroin was nonaddictive and prescribed it for many ailments. But heroin addiction soon became prevalent, so the government began to regulate its use, including arresting doctors who prescribed it to those who were already[[Page S2824]]addicted, and the medical community began to stop prescribing it. Inevitably, the addicted turned to illegal markets to feed their dependence.  Wariness toward prescribing opioid-based painkillers for anything other than terminal illnesses continued through the 20th century, all the way up until the late 1970s and the early 1980s. At that time, the international debate broke out on pain management. The question was asked: Was it inhumane to allow patients to suffer needlessly through pain when opioid-based medications were available?  Many advocates for increased use of painkillers pointed to a 1980 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, which concluded that only 1 percent of patients who were prescribed opiate-based painkillers became addicted to their medication. Known as the Porter and Jick letter because it was named after the two Boston researchers who conducted the research and authored the letter, it fueled a belief that opiate-based prescription drugs were not addictive. It was a belief that began to permeate the medical community.  But there was a problem with Porter and Jick's conclusions. They had only collected data on patients who were receiving inpatient care. As you can imagine, the percentage of patients who became addicted to opiates while in the hospital was only a tiny fraction of the patients who received opiate prescription drugs in an outpatient setting.  But the medical community was not the only group espousing theories that opiates were not addictive. With the FDA's 1995 approval of the original OxyContin, the original sin of the opiate crisis, we can literally point to the starting point of this epidemic. The FDA approved the original version of OxyContin, an extended-release opioid, and believed that it ``would result in less abuse potential since the drug would be absorbed slowly and there would not be an immediate `rush' or high that would promote abuse.''  In 1996, Purdue Pharma brought OxyContin to the market, earning the company $48 million in sales just that year alone. Purdue Pharma claimed OxyContin was nonaddictive and couldn't be abused, and the FDA agreed. Neither of those claims turned out to be true.  Purdue Pharma built a massive marketing and sales program for From 1996 to 2000, Purdue Pharma's sales force more than doubled, from 318 to 671 sales representatives. In 2001 alone, Purdue gave out $40 million in sales bonuses to its burgeoning sales force. These sales representatives then targeted healthcare providers who were more willing to prescribe opioid painkillers.  As a result of these sales and marketing efforts from 1997 to 2002, OxyContin prescriptions increased almost tenfold, from 670,000 in 1997 to 6.2 million prescriptions in 2002.  Then, in 2007, Purdue Pharma paid $600 million in fines and other payments after pleading guilty in Federal court to misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the risks of addiction to OxyContin and its potential for abuse. The company's president, top lawyer, and former chief medical officer also pled guilty to criminal misdemeanor charges and paid $34 million in fines.  In many cases, the FDA approved so-called ``abuse-deterrent'' opioids, despite warnings from the medical community about the potential for abuse. And when it wasn't turning a blind eye to the warnings of experts, the FDA simply didn't engage them at all in approval of opioids with abuse-deterrent properties. With numerous approvals of so-called abuse-deterrent opioids in 2010, the agency convened advisory committees of outside experts for less than half of them.

Her leadership is absolutely outstanding. I thank her for all of her leadership on this nomination as well.  As we look at this issue, we realize that a whole epidemic was being created, but that epidemic was being created because of approvals of ``abuse-deterrent'' opioids since 2010. I put ``abuse-deterrent'' in quotes because it was extremely deceptive because too many people felt ``abuse-deterrent'' meant they could not ultimately become addicted to the medicine. The damage has now been done. The prescription painkiller abuse became rampant across the country. We had become the United States of Oxy, and the opioid issue was well on its way to becoming an opioid epidemic because when those who were addicted to Oxy could no longer afford $60 for a 60-milligram pill, they opted for low-priced heroin, which is why we should not be surprised that of those individuals who began abusing heroin in the 2000s, 75 percent reported that their first opioid was a prescription drug.  Taking advantage of the new demand for heroin, an incredibly sophisticated network of drug traffickers from Mexico set up franchises in the United States, and now they are responsible for nearly half of this Nation's heroin supply and are branching out from large urban areas into our suburbs. These systems collided in a perfect storm that has caused the epidemic we are experiencing today: the overprescription of opioid painkillers that were approved by the FDA, the over-the-top sales and marketing programs by a deceptive and deep-pocketed pharmaceutical giant that went unimpeded for years, and an overabundance of heroin flowing into the United States from Mexico and South All of that has led us here.  We know that nationally opioid overdoses kill more people than gun violence or auto accidents. Every single day in America, we lose more than 91 people to an opioid-related overdose. Nationally, nearly half of all opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid that was approved by the FDA and often prescribed by a physician. In Massachusetts, in 2016, 2,000 people died from an opioid overdose.  Who is the typical victim of an opioid overdose? Who is the typical substance abuser? The answer is that there is none. This epidemic does not discriminate on the basis of age or gender or race or ethnicity or economic status. It does not care if you live in a city or in the suburbs. It does not care if you have a white-collar or a blue-collar job. The 50-year-old White male attorney is just as likely to become addicted to prescription drugs or heroin as the 22-year-old Latina waitress. Opioid addiction is an equal opportunity destroyer of lives.  Those addicted to opiates are too often stealing from their friends, their families and neighbors, or complete strangers to fuel their addiction. Cars are broken into, and valuable stereo systems are left intact, while a few dollars in change are stolen. Homes are broken into, and flat-screen television sets remain untouched, while children's piggy banks go missing.  The impacts of opioid addiction are also causing immeasurable harm to the families of those in the unbreakable grip of opioids. Too often, I hear the stories of parents who have drained their entire life savings to provide the treatment and recovery programs necessary to beat this addiction. Many times, it results in bankruptcy filings that were unimaginable only a few short years ago.  The opioid crisis is robbing people of their friends and their families. It is robbing them of their livelihood. It is robbing them of their freedom as they look out from behind prison bars. All too often, it is robbing them of their lives.  If we don't act now, we could lose an entire generation of people. As this opioid crisis explodes in my State of Massachusetts and in every State in the country, we need an FDA leader who will understand that universal healthcare does not mean that every American should have access to a bottle of prescription opioids.  Last year, more than 33,000 mothers, fathers, children, and loved ones were robbed of their potential when they died of an opioid overdose, but Scott Gottlieb has openly questioned the value of the Drug Enforcement Administration's enforcement against doctors and pharmacists to prevent prescription opioids from entering the illicit market. The DEA is our prescription drug cop on the beat, but Gottlieb wants to give that role to bureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency that has consistently failed at any kind of enforcement.  At the same time, Gottlieb has also publicly stated his opposition to the FDA's risk plans, so called REMS--meaning risk evaluation and mitigation strategies--for the use of these opioids. That is what is used to address the safety of opioid painkillers. These vital tools that the FDA has to manage the risk should be made stronger, but Gottlieb argues that they should not exist at all. Risk evaluation and mitigation strategies--he says they should not exist at all. With the overwhelming majority of heroin users reporting that their addiction began with prescription opioids, Gottlieb believes drug safety does not need strong oversight. That is simply irresponsible.  We are suffering this public health epidemic because Big Pharma pushed pills they knew were dangerous and addictive. The FDA approved them, often without expert counsel, and doctors, because they do not have mandatory education on these drugs, prescribed them to innocent families all across our country. It is a vicious and deadly cycle that has turned this Nation into the United States of Oxy, and it must stop.  Gottlieb's Big Pharma formula is simple: Take away the DEA oversight over prescription opioids and give that authority to the Then, at the same time, limit the FDA's ability to utilize its full oversight authority over these addictive products. That would leave a mostly unregulated marketplace for big pharmaceutical companies and their opioid painkillers to thrive, while American families pay the highest price they can: the life of someone in their family.  Perhaps most alarming is Gottlieb's connection to a specific pharmaceutical company called Last month, a Washington Post story was published that detailed Gottlieb's work on behalf of one company, Cephalon, to raise the amount of the addictive opioid fentanyl that the company could market at the same time the prescription painkiller epidemic was exploding. The Washington Post story detailed how Gottlieb advocated for the DEA--the Drug Enforcement Administration--to raise the quota of fentanyl that Cephalon could manufacture and put on the market, even while the company was under investigation for pushing doctors to prescribe the addictive painkiller for headaches and back pain when it was meant for late-stage cancer patients.[[Page S2827]]  These aggressive and off-label promotion tactics were out of the Perdue Pharma playbook that got us into this opioid crisis in the first place.  Cephalon ultimately pleaded guilty in 2008 to illegally promoting the fentanyl drug and paid a $425 million fine. This relationship is deeply disturbing.  Gottlieb seems to believe that pharmaceutical profits are more important than the public's health. When the prescription opioid epidemic was taking deadly hold, Gottlieb advocated to put even more addictive fentanyl onto the market when it was not appropriate or necessary.  Gottlieb said during his confirmation hearing that the FDA unwittingly fueled the opioid epidemic, but he is guilty of intentionally pushing an addictive prescription opioid onto the American public just to benefit one company instead of working to prevent this massive public health crisis. Gottlieb's actions could have made the opioid crisis worse.  Serious questions remain about Gottlieb's association with Cephalon, which was fined hundreds of millions of dollars for violating FDA rules.  After his tenure at the FDA, Scott Gottlieb was then hired by a law firm as an expert witness used to defend the actions of Cephalon in court.  In advance of this floor vote, I and a group of other Senators questioned Gottlieb on this work and the extent of his historical and financial relationship with Cephalon, but we received nothing that shed any light on his relationship with the company.  We cannot have a leader at the FDA who has worked on behalf of a company that aided and abetted the prescription drug and heroin epidemic.  Sadly, Gottlieb is yet another example of President Trump's lack of commitment to address the opioid crisis. President Trump believes that if we just build a border wall, well, we will end this opioid crisis.  We don't need a wall, President Trump, we need treatment.  President Trump's support for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the legislation the House passed just last week means coverage for opioid-use disorders for 2.8 million people could be ripped away. President Trump has proposed slashing the research budget of the National Institutes of Health by 18 percent, undercutting our ability to better understand addiction and come up with alternative, less addictive pain medication.  If President Trump and his Republican allies are committed to combating the opioid crisis, they should release their plan for addressing this crisis, including committing to quickly release the remaining $500 million authorized last year in the 21st Century Cures Act, and plan for investing more Federal dollars into understanding, preventing, and treating this debilitating disease of addiction. The crisis is wearing families down to the bone and we need to give them hope. That is what a comprehensive strategy to address this crisis is all about, and strong leadership at the FDA is a critical component of any plan.  We need the FDA to be a tough cop on the beat, not a rubberstamp approving the latest big pharma painkillers that are the cause of this deadly scourge of addiction in overdoses. We need to stop the overprescription of pain medication that is leading to heroin addiction and fueling this crisis. The United States has less than 5 percent of the world population, but we consume 80 percent of the global opioid painkillers and 99 percent of the global supply of hydrocodone and the active ingredients inside of  We also need to ensure that prescribers are subject to mandatory education responsible for prescribing practices. Anyone who prescribes opioid pain medication and other controlled substances must undergo mandatory medical education so we are sure these physicians know what they are doing. The FDA would be in a position to be the primary enforcer of this critical education.  We also shouldn't allow companies to continue to promote their opioids as abuse deterrents. It is misleading. Fifty percent of all physicians believe the ``abuse deterrent'' that is on the label means the drug is not addictive. Physicians don't even know this is addictive, and we know through Purdue Pharma that this is just not the case.  The FDA is in a prime position to ensure the terminology used for promoting a drug is not confusing or misleading. At this time of crisis, we need a leader at the FDA who recognizes the dangers of prescription painkillers, who will stand up to big pharma and reform the FDA to prevent addiction before it takes hold. Scott Gottlieb is not that individual.  Gottlieb's nomination signals a continuation of FDA policy that has cultivated and fueled the opioid epidemic.

The American promise means that, if you show up for work every morning and play by the rules, you will be able to take care of your family and, over time, your life will improve. Unfortunately, for many Americans, that promise no longer rings true today.  Before the election of Donald Trump, more than 50 percent of Americans saw our economic conditions worsening, and 50 percent of millennials think the American Dream is dead. When it comes to economic security for low- and middle-income workers, we flatlined: paychecks have frozen, and American families are having a harder and harder time making ends meet. As an uncle of mine used to say: When it came to the end of the month, it seems like you got more month than money to pay your bills.  We need a renewed focus on improving the lives of everyday working That is why the Republican Policy Committee, which I chair, launched a task force for the American worker, and our first hearing is today.  It is time to start delivering for the American worker and restoring the American promise.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-25-pt1-PgH2818.txt,2130,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,25.0,May

When designed effectively, juvenile justice programs can help reset a troubled youth's path to successful adulthood. That is why I support the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017. This legislation will help youth in the juvenile justice system get on the right path by focusing programs on approaches that work using evidence-based strategies and proven track records. It strengthens accountability and oversight to deliver positive outcomes.  It also provides communities with greater flexibility to deliver services that meet the specific needs of youth in their communities.  Mr.Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this legislation to help youth break from their troubled pasts and turn their lives around and become an asset in their communities.

9931,topic-id,898,"I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, before I begin, I want to send my deepest thoughts and prayers to our colleague Whip Scalise, the Capitol Police officers, and the staff members that were injured in yesterday's shooting.  Although my Republican colleagues and I have robust policy discussions, ultimately, we desire the same goals. Today is no different, and our institution is based on the respect and thoughtful debate that remain important pillars of our democracy.  Mr.Speaker, this discussion and debate that we are about to have here is an honest disagreement. There is no suggestion here that there is anybody on this side of the aisle that is any less enthusiastic or less sincere in their support of what it is that our veterans need and desire. This is an honest policy dispute.  And I must tell you, based on long service in this institution, this is an unusual manner in which to proceed. We are actually being asked today to amend a piece of legislation that a month ago left this institution. I have not been witness to this, I believe, in the past; and I hope that, as we go on for the next hour, we will have a chance to connect the dots for our colleagues about why this underlying bill is less than desirable.  Last month, the Republicans brought TrumpCare to the House floor and every Democrat in this institution opposed it. This was the Republican leadership's second attempt to pass the repeal, and it seems that their first attempt was not harmful enough to the American people.  The measure, as passed, takes health insurance from millions of Americans, raises premiums for working families, and places an age tax on older Middle class Americans would end up on the losing end, while millionaires would receive a handsome, nearly $1 trillion tax cut.  Perhaps most concerning is that Members voted in favor of this legislation without understanding its impact on the American people. There were no hearings on Amendments were rushed to the floor without committee consideration, and the CBO score was not available at the time the House considered it.  CBO, based on nonpartisan career professionals, provides important context and independent advice for Members of It provides an opportunity for us to look at the long-term results and ramifications of policies we are considering.  Clearly, our Republican friends don't care about the jarring consequences CBO foretold. The House has ignored certain procedures when considering these important measures.  First, since the Republican repeal bill passed, the CBO confirmed that the measure would leave 23 million Americans without health insurance. It would cut Medicaid by $800 billion, discriminate against individuals with preexisting conditions, and drastically raise premiums for older  Earlier this week, the CMS actuary confirmed that out-of-pocket costs will rise by 61 percent, and premiums will be 5 percent higher than under current law. Simply put, TrumpCare would force Americans to pay more for lower quality healthcare coverage.  Second, this bill is not appropriate to consider now because it amends the TrumpCare bill, as I noted a moment ago, that has not passed the And our Senate colleagues have stated they are rewriting a House bill that the President called ``mean.''  Now I would like to turn to my substantive concerns with this bill.  H.2372 would amend the AHCA to allow veterans not enrolled in military-related coverage to receive tax credits. It does nothing to fix the issues in the TrumpCare bill.  Whether or not you initially supported the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan--and I was one of the few in this institution that voted and spoke against the war in Iraq those years ago--these wars have created 1 million more veterans, and we need to do what we can to provide them with the support that we promised them.  Let me remind my colleagues that the TrumpCare bill would shift costs onto veterans through per capita caps, roll back Medicaid expansion for veterans, and erode essential health benefits and preexisting conditions protections.  The Republican health plan would dramatically cut Medicaid, a program that provides healthcare for nearly 2 million veterans. And the President's recently released budget takes it a step further by cutting veterans' programs, including disability benefits.  Even if this bill is incorporated into TrumpCare legislation, it would not undo the terrible cuts in the bill: enormous coverage losses, more than $800 billion worth of cuts to Medicaid, unravel important consumer protections or cuts to programs designed to help address the opioid addiction crisis in my State of Massachusetts and throughout the  I am quite sure everyone in this institution at this moment and those who are viewing know somebody close to them who is addicted to opioids.  In addition, Medicaid is now a program that many middle class Americans rely on for long-term care. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, your parents are not living in your attic.  This bill does nothing to fix the Republican healthcare plan and could create new problems. If Republicans are serious about addressing middle class American healthcare needs, they should go back to the drawing board and start over and work with us.  This exercise is a distraction from the real issue, which is the harm caused by the underlying TrumpCare bill. Instead, we should be considering issues that help hardworking Americans and their families.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

9942,topic-id,270,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.

The bill purports to make a fix to the Republicans' harmful healthcare bill, but the fix is inadequate for the harm the underlying legislation would cause.  We have independent verification from both the CMS actuary and the Congressional Budget Office to reinforce our position. The Republican healthcare bill would cause millions to lose health insurance, face higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and jeopardize the health security that Americans with preexisting conditions have today.  We should be working to improve our healthcare system, not making it more difficult and unaffordable for America's families. If this is such a great policy, let's not tie it to a bill that is doomed in the In fact, if anybody can find out where it is even being discussed or authored in the Senate, they should inform us.

I urge my colleagues to work over the next few months to educate the American people about the Republican health plan and how harmful it is to our Nation's health.

10011,topic-id,520,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, for engaging in this important discussion.  I am proud to stand before my colleagues in the U.Senate to discuss some of the bipartisan work that we have accomplished through regular order at the Agriculture Committee specifically with regard to H.1029, the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2017, or PRIA 4.  PRIA, while technical in nature, is critically important with assisting both EPA in carrying out administrative functions and industry that relies upon timely, science-based pesticide registration decisions to get products on the market and in the hands of farmers, ranchers, and other consumers.  PRIA, historically, has received widespread support from a diverse coalition of stakeholders, including members of the pesticide registrant community--both agricultural and nonagricultural uses, labor, and environmental advocates, which has contributed to Congress's ability to pass reauthorizations swiftly and by unanimous consent. With the Widespread support of the PRIA coalition, as illustrated by a coalition letter addressed to our committee on June 29, 2017, which expresses support of the amendment to H.1029 and urges swift action, this effort should be no different.  Our committee held a hearing earlier this year to review this issue in an open and transparent manner. As we have heard time and time again, farmers and ranchers want regulatory certainty. EPA and registrants who rely on PRIA to get new products on the market and in the hands of farmers, ranchers, and other consumers want certainty.  My colleague raises an issue that has historically been outside the scope of the technical, fee-based registration process of I certainly understand the concerns that have been raised by some groups with regard to certain actions EPA is considering with regard to the Worker Protection Standard and the Certification of Pesticide Applicators rules. My hope is that EPA and the relevant stakeholders can constructively discuss areas of concern related to these issues within the framework of our Federal regulatory process without jeopardizing  Current authority for PRIA expires at the end of this fiscal year. With that deadline in mind, our recent committee action is timely and necessary to get PRIA updated.  Should PRIA's authority lapse, pesticide registration will not be available for a wide range of crops that rely on innovative and new solutions for pest protection, and a lapse will have a negative impact on the products requiring registration that are used to protect public health and ensure public safety.  It is important that we get PRIA across the finish line not only to provide certainty to the industry but to also provide new products to growers for crop protection and to consumers to protect public health, and the timely reauthorization provides resources to ensure safety education components are maintained.  I thank my colleague Senator Stabenow and other members of the Agriculture Committee for working with me on this issue together and in a bipartisan manner.

9962,topic-id,2124,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to start by commending the gentleman from New York (Mr.Engel), the ranking member, for his leadership in authoring this critical legislation. Mr.Engel has long been the voice on Syria, and I must mention that the outline that he has given in terms of the initial problems when we saw those citizens on the streets of Damascus, walking, saying, ``Peaceful, peaceful,'' and then, as we saw on CNN, the automatic weapons open up and saw the Assad regime mow those civilians down--he was the first to begin to ring the alarm. I wish this body, and previous administrations as well, had done more to heed his calls.  For 6 years, we have watched the Syrian regime launch wave after wave of unrelenting destruction on the people of Airstrikes, chemical weapons attacks, forced starvation, industrial-scale torture, the deliberate targeting of hospitals, schools, marketplaces, and this done with precision bombs and with crude barrel bombs, and, as a consequence, Syrians suffering every day.  Now, just last month, we saw footage of entire families killed, suffocated by sarin gas, a chemical weapon that Assad supposedly gave up under a deal brokered by Russia and the previous administration. The number of dead is estimated now to be close to 500,000, and another 14 million have been driven from their homes.  And while ISIS plays a role in the violence in Syria, it is Bashar al-Assad and his backers--among them, Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah--who are the main drivers of this death and destruction. ISIS has no airplanes. It is Russian and Syrian fighter planes and helicopters that drop those bombs on those hospitals and schools.  It is Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps fighters who attack cities, who burn crops, who prevent food and water and medical supplies from reaching vulnerable civilians.  It is Assad's secret police and intelligence groups who kidnap and torture and murder civilians from every ethnic group and political party, Sunni, Shia, Christians, Alawite; none are safe.  One of the worst facilities is just 20 miles from Damascus, Sednaya, a prison, a place so terrible that it is called a human slaughterhouse. Thousands and thousands of people have been tortured and hung and shot and left to starve to death within the prison. And the numbers are so high that, in 2013, Assad began constructing a crematorium to dispose of the bodies.  Over the past 4 years, our committee heard agonizing testimony from Syrians caught up in this horror, including the brave Syrian defector known to the world as Caesar and for whom this bill is named. Caesar testified about the shocking scale of torture being carried out within the prisons of  We saw his photographs and the tens of thousands of photographs he took with those bodies numbered numerically. I don't know what it is about totalitarian regimes that leads them to want to number their dead and catalog it, but, because of his bravery, we have those photographs.  We have also heard from doctors who treat victims of chemical attacks, volunteers who dig through rubble with their bare hands to rescue those trapped within, and we have heard[[Page H4287]]from the survivors of torture in Assad's prisons.  As Syria drags on and on, vital U.national security interests are at stake. Assad's brutality is both a magnet for terrorist recruitment and a destabilizing force driving tens of millions of refugees out of that country. We have 14 million Syrians, as I said, who are displaced right now, many of them still in the country, and millions outside of the country, yet we have taken no steps to apply the economic tools that are available to us with respect to Assad and his backers.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation is designed to increase the cost to Assad and to those outside backers by targeting the sectors of the economy that allow Assad to murder with impunity. Under the bill, foreign companies and banks will have to choose between doing business with the regime or with the United It would also sanction anyone who flies weapons or sends fighters into Syria to support the Assad regime.  This bill is also about creating economic leverage to push the parties to negotiate, creating the conditions for a negotiated peace. It is about finding a way forward to be determined by the Syrian people that does not allow Assad to exterminate his own community; it does not allow him to do it with impunity; does not guarantee ISIS a safe space from which to operate; and does not drive another 10 million people from their homes.  For there to be peace in Syria, the parties must come together, and so long as Assad and his backers can slaughter the people of Syria with no consequences, there is no hope for peace.  As we speak, Russia and Iran have proclaimed themselves the guarantors of peace and have promised to create de-escalation zones where military operations can be curtailed and civilians can seek safety. But these zones would be policed by the Syrian Army, supported by Russian military police, by Hezbollah fighters, and IRGC, Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders, backed by those Shia militias--the very same people who have murdered thousands of Syrian civilians with impunity throughout this conflict and who are actively engaged in fomenting sectarian-based violence throughout the region. With this scenario, peace does not have a chance.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is long overdue. And last year, Eliot Engel and I brought this up, and we passed it unanimously, yet the other body did not take it up before we adjourned.  I urge all Members to support this legislation as we seek to ease the suffering of the Syrian people.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

10034,topic-id,1443,"Mr.President, I rise to speak briefly this afternoon on the ongoing crisis in There is a growing interest in the matter here among my colleagues in the Senate and the White House and other places--certainly, in the press--and thankfully so. This has been going on now for a significant period of time.  Just to put it in context, a lot of times, when we talk about these sorts of showdowns around the world--these sorts of internal strife--there is this notion that there is this government in place and there is this group that does not like the government and that they are arguing with each other about the future of the country. What is interesting in Venezuela is that both the opposition and the ruling party are in government. The government, obviously, at the Presidential level is controlled by someone who has turned himself into a dictator. He is a successor of Hugo Chavez's--he is the President, Nicolas Maduro--and those who surround him. Then there is the National Assembly that is elected by the people of Venezuela, the majority party in their legislative branch.  What has happened over the last year and a half is that the President of Venezuela, Maduro--the now dictator--has nullified the legislative branch. He basically refuses to recognize the laws they have passed and has stopped allowing transfers. So, basically, today, those in the National Assembly in Venezuela are not getting paid. They have no funds for offices, and they have no funds for material. They will pass a law, and those laws are ignored. That is the ongoing crisis.  The second part of it is that, under their Constitution, Venezuela's Constitution, if you had collected a certain number of signatures by December of this year, by the end of the year, they had to hold a referendum on the President, a recall referendum. They refused to certify the signatures even though the people who collected them turned in four times as many signatures as were necessary.  The third is that they are supposed to have a Governor and legislative elections this year in Maduro has canceled those, and there is no telling, but it does not seem as though they are going to have a Presidential election either.  Here is the bottom line: The strife in Venezuela that is going on today can be solved by having an election of the people of Venezuela, by basically following their existing Constitution, but that is not what they have allowed to have happen. On the contrary, not only are they not allowing these elections to happen, but anyone who protests against them has been jailed; press has been kicked out of the country; CNN has been kicked out of Venezuela, as an example. Now we are seeing reports of there being escalating violence in the streets, and it is extraordinary. What is interesting, though, is that fissures are beginning to develop.  The message we send here today--first of all, to those who are in the streets who are fighting for democracy and for following the law and having elections in Venezuela--is that we stand with you. We will never let your cause fall, and we will never accept these ridiculous moves that Maduro is now taking to rewrite the Constitution, yet again, through a flawed and fraudulent process.  The second message we have is to the people in the Venezuelan Government who do not want to be a part of what is happening. We now see examples of the Attorney General, Luisa Ortega, who is part of the Maduro government and has been largely friendly but who, lately, has begun to break away from the government, going so far as to criticize the government's escalating repression.  You see it increasingly among the rank and file in the National Guard of Venezuela, who are all armored up like G.Joe, facing down these unarmed protesters, but on the other side of the protests are their mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their wives, their husbands, and their friends and neighbors. What is really troubling now is that these armed groups--irregular groups, these militias--that Maduro has armed and trained with the help of Cuban intelligence have spun completely out of control.  These groups are going around randomly beating people up, setting up roadblocks, and committing all sorts of acts of violence. They are not uniformed. These are collectives, as they call them--basically, these armed militias--outside of the government who are funded, created by Maduro and who have now begun to spin out of control, even to the point at which they, themselves, I believe, are potentially threatened by these groups who, in addition to funding themselves through the government, have found other ways to fund themselves through illicit means, including through street crime.  This situation is reaching a breaking point, and I think it is an important moment to remind the men and women in uniform in the National Guard of Venezuela that their job is to protect the people of Venezuela, not to oppress them; that their job is to protect and uphold the Constitution of that country, not to cancel it out; to remind them that the men and women on the other side of these protests are their families and their fellow  Now the time has come to tell the men and women in the Venezuelan Government--many who, perhaps, sympathize with Hugo Chavez and Maduro up to a point--that they do not want to go down with this ship, that they do not want to wind up on the list of people who have participated in this crackdown and in this oppression.  I hope that my colleagues here will continue to work hard. I am encouraged by the amount of bipartisan support that we have begun to create on the issue of I know my colleague, Senator Cardin, and I have worked out bipartisan legislation that urges the Maduro regime to release all of its political prisoners and express support for a solution to the crisis. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in cosigning this bipartisan legislation.  We also support the administration's efforts at the OAS to continue to work[[Page S2844]]with regional governments in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Brazil, and others who have taken heed of this issue and have played an extraordinary leadership role in raising this in international forums.  Beyond that, I encourage the administration to continue to look for names to sanction. They have the authority under the law--passed not once but twice by this Congress--that allows them to identify specific individuals within the Venezuelan Government who are stealing the money of the Venezuelan people and committing grotesque human rights violations and have real estate and other personal property and cash deposits and bank accounts around the world from what they have illicitly stolen from the people of  Here is my closing point: Maduro's government is now relying on credit from all parts of the world in order to continue to sustain itself.  To any private investment banks and any of these large global banks that are thinking about lending money to Venezuela, you are abetting this regime and its repression, and you will be singled out and named if you participate in continuing to lend them money to fund this.  To the Russian Government, I say that you are not going to get your money back. These guys cannot pay you back.  It is the same for the Chinese  If you continue to lend money to the Maduro regime, they will not be able to pay you back, and you are going to be embarrassed.  The Chinese Government is going to be embarrassed if it continues to loan money to  They cannot and will never pay you back.  The Russians cannot afford to continue to lend money to a government that will not pay them back either.  I urge them to look at that very carefully before they continue to embarrass themselves by lending out their people's money that they will never get back.  This is an important issue. It is in our own hemisphere, and the answer lies one election away. If only the Maduro regime would follow its laws and its Constitution, Venezuela would be on a better path that its people would choose. The alternative to this situation will continue to spiral out of control.  We in this Chamber and in this country will continue to be on the side of the men and women who seek nothing but democracy and seek nothing but peace and reconciliation and a way forward for this nation, which has a deep history of democratic order.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-09-pt1-PgS2843-2.txt,2084,1230,2017.0,9.0,May
9912,topic-id,1506,"Mr.President, first I wish to thank my friend and our great Senator from Massachusetts, Mr.Markey, for the great work he has done on the opioid issue. He was one of the first to sound the alarm when prescription drugs just began to be overprescribed and has worked very, very hard, with many successes, in trying to deal with this problem. We have a long way to go. Things would have been a lot worse without the great work of the Senator from  I see my colleague from New Hampshire on the floor, as well, and the same goes for her. She has done an outstanding job. She has worked and campaigned on this issue and is keeping her promises, working very hard here in the U.We know that their States are among the top States with opioid abuse problems.                          Russia Investigation  Mr.President, at yesterday's Judiciary Committee hearing, we heard from former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James In their testimony, both of them confirmed what we already know--that Russia tried to interfere in our elections and likely will do so again. Underline ``likely will do so again.''  In particular, Deputy AG Yates made the point that General Flynn misled the Vice President about his contact with the Russian Ambassador and was vulnerable to blackmail since the Russians knew about those conversations.  It is still an open question whether or not the Trump administration will hold General Flynn accountable under our criminal law. Needless to say, his presence in the administration and the length of time it took to dismiss him raise serious questions about why the President brought him onboard to begin with and why the President and his staff did not respond more quickly to protect our national security.  Both parties in Congress should be focused on the threat posed by Russia's hacking activities and Russia's attempt to influence foreign elections, especially ours. Make no mistake about it. These cyber attacks will not be limited to any one party or any Anyone who draws the ire of President Putin--President, Senator, Member of Congress, elected official--could be subject to these dark attacks. Whatever is good for Russia at the moment, whatever hurts the United States the most, that is what he will pursue.  Director Clapper testified that Russia likely feels ``emboldened'' to continue its hacking activities, given their success at disrupting our 2016 elections. He said:       If there has ever been a clarion call for vigilance and      action against a threat to the very foundation of our      democratic political system, this episode is it.  Those are his words, not mine.       I hope the American people recognize the severity of this      threat and that we collectively counter it before it further      erodes the fabric of our democracy.  I couldn't agree more with Mr.I hope these hearings are just the start of a bipartisan discussion on how to combat these efforts and safeguard the integrity of our elections. Democrats and Republicans should join together and figure out what Russia had done to us in the past and how we prevent it from happening in the future. Again, as Director Clapper said, the very foundation of our democracy is at stake.  The Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, wrote in the Constitution that we had to worry about foreign interference. It is happening now in a way that has never happened before, and in a bipartisan way we must act.                               TrumpCare  Mr.President, now a word on healthcare. The bill the House of Representatives passed last week is devastating in so many ways and to so many groups of Americans--to older Americans, who would be charged five times as much as others; to middle-class Americans, who will be paying on average $1,500 a year more for their coverage in the next few years; to lower income Americans, who are struggling to make it into the middle class and who will be paying thousands of dollars more per year; to women, for whom pregnancy could now become a preexisting condition--amazing.  Why are they making these cuts? For all too many on the other side of the aisle, it is for one purpose: to give a massive tax break to the wealthy--folks making over $250,000 a year. God bless the wealthy. They are doing well. They don't need a tax break at the expense of everyone else, especially when it comes to something as important as healthcare.[[Page S2825]]  Amazingly, this bill is even devastating to our veterans. That is what I would like to focus on for the remainder of my time this morning.  You would think that when the House of Representatives was writing its bill, the House Members would be more careful to make sure that our veterans, who put their lives on the line for our country, wouldn't be hurt by their legislation. In their haste to cobble together a bill that could pass the House, the Republican majority actually prohibited anyone who is eligible for coverage at the VA from being eligible for the tax credits in this bill.  I am sure my Republican friends who rushed to draft this bill thought that was a perfectly fine policy. After all, our veterans can get care at the In fact, many veterans don't get their care from the Department of Veterans Yes, they are eligible, but many live in rural communities that don't have a VA facility. Many can't go to the VA because of means testing. Some get treated at the VA for a specific injury related to their service but rely on private insurance for the rest of their healthcare. I am sure some veterans would simply prefer the choice to have private insurance rather than go through the  Under TrumpCare, any veteran who falls into one of these categories would be denied the tax credits they need to get affordable coverage. Let me repeat that. As many as 7 million veterans, possibly more, who qualify for VA healthcare wouldn't be eligible for the tax credits they need to get affordable insurance on the private market.  For the sake of perspective, under TrumpCare, folks who make over $250,000 a year get a massive tax break while taxes and costs would go up for so many of our brave veterans.  I am not sure it is possible for a bill, and for the party that passed it, to get its priorities more wrong than that. It is the shameful consequence of a slapdash, partisan bill that was thrown together at the last minute--a bill whose purpose, it seems, is not to provide better coverage or lower costs or even to provide better care for our veterans. Its purpose seems to be to provide tax breaks to the very wealthy.  For the President, who lobbied for this bill down to the individual Member, it is another giant broken promise to the working people and, in this case, to our veterans.  President Trump made improving the healthcare of our veterans a theme of his campaign. Just a few weeks ago, he said that ``the veterans have poured out their sweat and blood and tears for this country for so long and it's time that they are recognized and it's time that we now take care of them and take care of them properly.''  His healthcare bill, TrumpCare, would deny the means of affording private insurance to as many as 7 million veterans and maybe more--another broken promise, saying one thing and doing another. Many of the people who support Donald Trump don't want to embrace that idea, but it is happening in issue after issue. They will see it--saying one thing and doing another. That is another reason for Senate Republicans to scrap this bill, scrap repeal, and start working with Democrats on bipartisan ways to improve our healthcare system.  Today, we Democrats will be sending a letter to the Republican leadership laying out our position on healthcare. All 48 Democrats and the two Independents who caucus with us have signed it. It has been our position all along: We are ready to work in a bipartisan, open, and transparent way to improve and reform our healthcare system.  Look, we have made a lot of progress in the last few years. Kids can now stay on their parents' plan until they are 26. Women are no longer charged more for the same coverage. There are more Americans insured than ever before. These are good things. We ought to keep them and then build on our progress.  To our Republican friends we say this. Drop this idea of repeal. Drop this nightmare of a bill, TrumpCare, which raises costs on our veterans, and come work with us on ways to reduce the cost of premiums, the cost of prescription drugs, and other out-of-pocket costs. We can find ways to make our healthcare system better if we work together. TrumpCare is not the answer.  I want to thank my friend from Massachusetts for the courtesy.

Second, we see Trump's threats to defund the subsidies. This is a blatant violation of law. Seven million Americans would lose health care immediately if that happened.

Unfortunately, after several years of carefully revising and finalizing an updated Worker Protection Standard, the EPA decided last month to delay key elements of worker protections, including the much needed revisions to the Certification of Pesticide Applicators rule.  Without strong and timely farmworker protections, PRIA simply does not make sense for some stakeholders who are a part of the coalition. The funds from PRIA allocated to farmworker protection should be meaningful resources that complement strong, effective protections and should not be undermined by changes to EPA's Worker Protection Standard and the Certification of Pesticide Applicators rule that would weaken farmworker protections.  Therefore, I strongly oppose any future efforts by the EPA to delay or amend the worker protection rules that the Agency finalized in November 2015 and January 2017, respectively,[[Page S3914]]without undertaking a negotiated rulemaking, which must include all relevant stakeholders, to ensure that all voices are heard.  I hope the EPA will take a cue from our recent bipartisan and consensus-based committee action on PRIA and proceed in a similar fashion should they decide that any delays or adjustments to the Worker Protection Standards or the Certification of Pesticide Applicators rule are necessary.  Should the Trump EPA dismiss the concerns of farmworkers and environmental advocates, I fear that last month's committee vote may unfortunately be the last bipartisan PRIA reauthorization that this panel is able to report out. I hope that is not the case, and I know other members of the committee share my concerns on the matter.  Once again, I want to thank Senator Roberts for his leadership. I am glad we were able to move forward in a bipartisan and consensus manner to reauthorize PRIA last month.

9827,topic-id,596,"Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose 114.  A strong and sustainable Veterans Health Administration is critical to providing America's veterans with the care they deserve. By funding the Choice exception without investing in the VA itself, this legislation explicitly prioritizes the private sector at the VA's expense. This is not an acceptable way forward.  Care in the community has always been and will always be important in ensuring veterans have access to care, the care that they have earned, but it would be a profound mistake to funnel billions of dollars into private care while neglecting the VA and the millions of veterans it serves every year, and that is exactly what this bill does.  Veterans service organizations are speaking out, because they know what is at stake. They understand the bigger policy implications of today's vote.  This legislation is a referendum on the mistaken belief that the private sector is better equipped to care for our Nation's veterans than specialized VA doctors.  I have a statement from eight VSOs that echo these concerns, and I include it in the Leading Veterans Organizations Call on Members of Congress To Defeat                 Unacceptable Choice Funding Legislation    Urge House to Work with Senate to Reach a Bipartisan, Bicameral                                Agreement (Joint Statement from AMVETS, DAV (Disabled American Veterans), Iraq     and Afghanistan Veterans Association (IAVA), Military Officers    Association of America (MOAA), Military Order of the Purple Heart   (MOPH), Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Vietnam Veterans of America                (VVA), and Wounded Warrior Project (WWP))       As organizations who represent and support the interests of      America's 21 million veterans, and in fulfillment of our      mandate to ensure that the men and women who served are able      to receive the health care and benefits they need and      deserve, we are calling on Members of Congress to defeat the      House vote on unacceptable choice funding legislation (     114, with amendments) scheduled for Monday, July 24, and      instead work with the Senate to reach a bipartisan, bicameral      agreement.       As we have repeatedly told House leaders in person this      week, and in a jointly-signed letter on June 28, we oppose      legislation that includes funding only for the ``choice''      program which provides additional community care options, but      makes no investment in VA and uses ``savings'' from other      veterans benefits or services to ``pay'' for the ``choice''      program.       Veterans health care benefits have already been ``paid      for'' through the service and sacrifice of the men and women      who wore our nation's uniform, millions of whom suffered      injuries, illnesses and lifelong disabilities.       In order to ensure that veterans can receive necessary care      without interruption, we call on House leaders to take the      time necessary to work together with Senate leaders to      develop acceptable ``choice'' funding legislation that not      only fills the current funding gap, but also addresses urgent      VA infrastructure and resource needs that led to creation of      the ``choice'' program in the first place.       All of our organizations are committed to building a future      veterans health care system that modernizes VA and integrates      community care whenever needed so that enrolled veterans have      seamless access to timely, quality care. However, if new      funding is directed only or primarily to private sector      ``choice'' care without any adequate investment to modernize      VA, the viability of the entire system will soon be in      danger.       We call on leaders in both the House and Senate to work      together in good faith, and we remain committed to supporting      such efforts, in order to quickly reach an agreement that      ensures veterans health care is not interrupted in the short      term, nor threatened in the long term.

This bill is evidence that the loophole is an issue and that the existing regulation would no longer apply if the Affordable Care Act was repealed.  While I am glad we are making this fix, I am concerned that the rushed process for considering the AHCA led to the House passing disruptive healthcare legislation without fully understanding its impact on millions of Americans, especially our Nation's veterans.  The tax credit issue is relatively easy to solve, but there are more complicated issues for veterans under the AHCA that require more comprehensive solutions.  The $834 billion cut to Medicaid could impact nearly 2 million veterans. The potential for States to waive protections like essential health benefits could lead many veterans without health coverage for the invisible wounds of war. Indeed, military service could be construed as a preexisting condition.

9822,topic-id,1975,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, you are going to hear today and we have a series of bills, many of them historic in nature, many of them--all of them--worked in a bipartisan manner.  There has been a lot of talk lately of the one place in Congress that is really functioning well, and that is in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I would echo that. It is because of the commitment, the dedication, and the end state that all of us agree on is the best possible care for those warriors willing to put their lives in harm's way, their families, and the care that was pledged to them.  Also, with that being said, democracy is hard. It requires us to do the work here, with the stakeholders, and there is no issue that has a more committed group of stakeholders than the veterans' community. Some of the names you are going to hear of veterans service organizations are a hallmark and a bedrock of not just veterans' issues, but of our communities. We work with them hand in hand to make sure that this Congress understands exactly what they need.  And democracy is hard. It is that old sausage-making adage sometimes. It is a disappointment to me that we are on the floor because I think we are just a little bit early; I think we are about a day. Like we have before, we stood on this floor when we had a very important accountability bill forward, and I said at that time we were going to have to work with the Senate to make sure we got something passed. We did that, it passed, and I am proud that we were able to do that.  It happened with the GI Bill that is coming up. The first run we went at it did not work because we had not built that collaboration, and I am disappointed today that I believe 114 has fallen into that.  This is a very fast-moving problem, because I want to be clear. What this does is it extends veterans' access to care in the community through the Veterans Choice Program without providing additional resources for the Department of Veterans Affairs to enhance its internal capacity.  I agree with my colleague who was very clear about the capacity of the VA, what Choice does, and I would absolutely echo not funding this program before we leave for the August recess is unacceptable. But not getting a bill that the Senate can agree on, not getting a bill that the President can sign, and not getting a bill that actually does what we are supposed to do is also not acceptable.  The gentleman is also right: we have quadrupled the VA budget, and I am proud of that. I also think it is probably not lost on anyone that that started in 2001 at the same time that we fought America's longest war and are still engaged around the world, with an aging population of Vietnam, Korean, and World War II veterans.  As it became apparent that the Veterans Choice Program was facing a funding shortfall earlier this summer, nine veterans service organizations--Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Military Officers Association of America, Military Order of the Purple Heart, and Vietnam Veterans of America--issued a letter which provided very clear guidance to House and Senate leadership and House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees in terms of a solution, and I include in the Record the letter from these organizations.                                                    June 28, 2017.

Specifically, we call on you to reach agreement on      an emergency appropriation and authorization bill that would      address urgent resource shortfalls endangering VA's medical      care programs--including Choice, community care and medical      services. Further, in order to prevent these problems from      recurring in the future, we call on you to equally invest in      modernizing and expanding VA's capacity to meet rising demand      for care, as well as finally address the glaring inequity in      law that prevents thousands of family caregivers from getting      the support they need to care for their veterans severely      disabled before September 11, 2001.       In recent weeks, VA Secretary David Shulkin has repeatedly      made clear in his public statements and congressional      testimony that current funding is no longer projected to be      adequate to meet the needs of an increasing number of      veterans seeking medical treatment directly through the VA      system as well as through community care programs,      particularly the Choice program. Secretary Shulkin has made      clear that rising demand for care by veterans has consumed      more VA resources than previously anticipated, threatening      the ability of VA to meet all of its obligations to ill and      injured veterans both this year and next. Although Public Law      115-26 extended the Choice program beyond its prior sunset      date of August 7, 2017, VA now projects it will likely run      out of funding prior to the end of fiscal year (FY) 2017      unless additional funding is made available. Further, based      on recent utilization trends, VA projects a higher demand for      both community care and Choice next year (FY 2018), and      anticipates additional funding requirements above the budget      request made just weeks earlier. In order to ensure      continuation of the Choice program--and absent an infusion of      new funding--VA has stated its intention to take      extraordinary budget[[Page H6153]]     actions, including pulling back unobligated funding from VA      medical facilities and utilizing funding in FY 2017 that had      been designated as carryover funding for its FY 2018 budget      request, thereby further reducing available medical care      resources for next year.       Chairmen and Ranking Members, our nation has a      sacred obligation to ensure the men and women who served and      sacrificed to defend our way of life receive timely, high-     quality health care through a fully-funded VA health care      system, which includes community care or Choice options      whenever and wherever necessary. With the Choice program      rapidly running out of funds and its successor community care      program still many months away, it is imperative that      Congress not allow veterans to go without needed care before      this transition is completed.       We note that VA's FY 2018 budget submission included a      request for $3.5 billion in mandatory funds to continue the      Choice program. In order to meet Congressional PAYGO      requirements, VA also included two legislative proposals we      vehemently oppose which would cut billions of dollars from      veterans disability compensation through changes to      Individual Unemployabilty eligibility and rounding down cost-     of-living adjustment (COLA) increases to ``pay'' for the new      Choice funding. We find it absolutely unconscionable to cut      benefits for disabled veterans to ``pay'' for their medical      care. Congress imposed these PAYGO rules on itself and      Congress has the authority to waive them by designating new      funding for the existing Choice program as emergency      spending, just as it did when the Choice program was created      in 2014 through Public Law 113-146, the Veterans Access,      Choice and Accountability Act (VACAA). It is our      understanding that the actual need to continue the Choice      program for the balance of this year and through the end of      FY 2018 is approximately $4.3 billion.       We remind you that the primary reason the Choice program      was created was to address gaps in access due to the lack of      clinicians and clinical space necessary to provide timely      access to health care for all enrolled veterans. As such,      VACAA not only included emergency funding to allow additional      access to community care outside VA, it also contained      funding to rebuild and expand capacity inside Therefore,      we call on you to continue this commitment to strengthen and      modernize the VA by providing equal emergency funding to      address VA's infrastructure and personnel gaps. There are at      least 27 VA health care facility leases awaiting funding in      order to be activated. In addition, there are dozens of minor      and major construction projects that require billions of      dollars in funding to sustain and expand VA's capacity to      provide timely care to enrolled veterans. Furthermore, VA has      tens of thousands of vacant positions which will require not      just funding, but innovative new programs to recruit and      retain hard-to-fill clinical positions in many areas of the      country. Therefore, we call on you to include an equivalent      level of funding--$4.3 billion--to support VA's internal      capacity to deliver care.       Finally, since enactment of the Public Law 111-163 in 2010,      which created the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for      Family Caregivers (PCAFC), eligibility has been restricted to      caregivers of severely disabled veterans injured or made ill      on or after September 11, 2001. The clear intention of the      law was to initiate this program rapidly for post-9/11      veterans to address their urgent needs, thereafter working to      expand the program to meet the critical needs of family      caregivers of seriously disabled veterans of all generations      as soon as feasible. However seven years later, Congress has      yet to begin addressing the blatant unfairness facing      caregivers of severely disabled veterans injured prior to      September 11, 2001. As Secretary Shulkin and other experts      agree, supporting caregivers who allow veterans to remain in      their homes will save VA money that would otherwise need to      be spent for long term institutional care. Therefore, we call      on you to include both authorization and funding to eliminate      this indefensible inequity based on existing bipartisan      legislation in the Senate (591) and the House (H.1472,      H.1802).       While the current funding crisis must be addressed in the      short term through emergency funding and authorization, we      remain focused on moving beyond the flawed Choice program as      soon as practicable. We continue to urge you to work with us,      Secretary Shulkin and other critical stakeholders to design      and implement a new paradigm for veterans health care built      around an integrated network, with a modernized VA serving as      the coordinator and primary provider of care, and community      providers addressing remaining gaps in access and services.      We further urge you to consolidate all community care      programs through a single unified discretionary funding      source that includes the necessary flexibility and      accountability to ensure that VA can deliver the highest      quality of care in the most appropriate clinical settings      within the network.       Chairmen and Ranking Members, we recognize the      continuing attention and commitment you have all shown to      providing timely and accessible care to our nation's injured      and ill veterans, and we hope you will work with us and      Secretary Shulkin to address this urgent funding shortfall.      America's veterans have earned the right to high-quality,      timely and accessible health care. We believe that the      comprehensive plan outlined above will ensure our nation      continues to meet that sacred obligation and call on you to      support it.           Respectfully,         Garry Augustine, Executive Director, Washington            Headquarters, DAV (Disabled American Veterans); Robert            Wallace, Adjutant General, Veterans of Foreign Wars            of the United States; Joseph Chenelly, National            Executive Director, AMVETS; Dana Atkins, Lieutenant            General, U.Air Force (Ret.), President, Military            Officers Association of America; Rick Weidman,            Executive Director for Policy and Government Affairs,            Vietnam Veterans of America; Verna Jones, Executive            Director, The American Legion; Sherman Gillums, Jr.,            Executive Director, Paralyzed Veterans of America; Paul            Rieckhoff, Founder and CEO, Iraq and Afghanistan            Veterans of America (IAVA); Hershel Gober, National            Commander, Military Order of the Purple  ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgH6151-4.txt,1856,VENEZUELA,2017.0,24.0,June
9823,topic-id,907,"In their letter from June 28, they wrote: ``Specifically, we call on you to reach an agreement on an emergency appropriation and authorization bill that would address urgent resource shortfalls endangering VA's medical care programs--including Choice, community care and medical services. Further, in order to prevent these problems from recurring in the future, we call on you to equally invest in modernizing and expanding VA's capacity to meet rising demand for care. . . .''  Choice means choosing to go to the VA hospital and choice means choosing to use community care. Both are equal opportunities for our veterans to get the care they need.  The current bill before us does not meet the requirements asked for by our veterans service organizations. In fact, in order to keep the Veterans Choice Program going, House leadership and the Budget Committee have refused to see this as an emergency and are requiring $2 billion in offsets to pay for the bill.  While the actual offsets being offered are noncontroversial and are the ones the committee has used in the past, the fact that the leadership is requiring offsets from VA programs to pay for private care is wrong--all of this to appease a small vocal minority who simply sees any spending as unnecessary.  On Friday, a number of the same VSOs listed above issued a joint statement, which noted:  ``Veterans healthcare benefits have already been `paid for' through the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wore our Nation's uniform, millions whom suffered injuries, illnesses and lifelong disabilities.''  I agree with them. Without emergency funding, robbing Peter to pay Paul, an analogy used by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, is not a viable path. It is actually robbing future Peter to pay current  Had it been apparent VA would be facing this shortfall, Congress maybe would have never extended the Veterans Choice Program beyond its sunset of August 7 and would have, instead, begun working on legislation that would have consolidated VA's multiple community care programs into one easy-to-understand and -use program.  I reiterate: Choice is not a permanent VA program. Now, it may end up being that. It may be someone's wish, but it is not. It was a short-term fix that was testified we need to extend the program. Several weeks later, leadership of the VA came back and told us they are 4-point-whatever billion dollars short and asked us to fix it. That is not the chairman's fault; that is not the Members of this House's fault; but it is our responsibility.  Now, the question is: How do we ensure that the care is continuous? How do we make sure care is not interrupted? How do we make sure a veteran who is getting chemotherapy in the private setting right now is not told to not come back because we are not going to pay it?  The sense of urgency is with all of us. What I ask is that we try and come back, take a look at what we can do. And I will say this: the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee in the House has made as good faith an effort to do this as anyone could possibly ask. I understand the challenges coming from a broader caucus and asking for this. This, where we are at today, is significantly changed from where we started, but it is apparent, in the Senate, that it will not pass.  We will not have money for the Veterans Choice Program, so we need to[[Page H6154]]decide: Do we stand and make a statement of ideological, fiscal, whatever they want to call it, or do we come together, unanimously agree on something we can move forward, build capacity into the VA to assure that Choice is there, everything from the research into the VA to the care in the communities, and come together to find that?  Moreover, these shortages are further reinforced in Choice when you take into account veterans' reliance on VA's system for care has steadily increased. While enrollment has been flat in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, the total number of veterans utilizing VA healthcare has grown by 3 percent. The total appointments in VA increased by more than 5 percent during this period.  In order to address that need, since the Veterans Choice Program was implemented, the total number of community care appointments has increased by 61 percent, and more than 25 million appointments were completed in fiscal year 2016. Over one-fifth of this care was completed in the Veterans Choice No disagreement. Community care has always been there, and community care is an absolute staple of the  What is also not debatable is capacity inside the VA must remain there. Any shortfall in capacity is going to distort where people are getting their care.  While we are not here to oppose the premise of veterans having access to care, members of my Caucus, as this stands right now, cannot go forward until we figure out how we are going to come to a compromise that gets the capacity as it should be in the VA and also allows us and everyone--we should never have this discussion in this If we can't find compromise that gets something across the finish line that actually does something for veterans, everything else is just messaging for politics.  Madam Speaker, I look forward to the chairman's words, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgH6151-4.txt,1856,1230,2017.0,24.0,June
9824,topic-id,831,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would just like to respond to the chairman.  I, too, have not made the argument on privatization. I do not believe that is the goal here. I do not believe that is what we talked about. If there are those that have that, that is not the intention of this committee, the chairman, his staff, or anyone involved with this.  And when we did talk--and I think this could be an interesting way for this House to listen to how we do this. There was transparency in these negotiations, and we sat in front of people and did them. And one of the issues in there was we had to build the capacity amongst the  We need to stop for a minute. There may be times we need to take those hard votes against it, but I ask all of the Members to think about this, Madam All of the veterans service organizations have lined up in opposition to this.                              {time}  1430  Now, that doesn't mean that they are totally right, and it doesn't mean that there isn't something here we can talk and debate about. The question is trying to get their goodwill.  I think when we talked the last time, we had some leases, and I am not calling them token, but in the budget of the big VA, which I do think in many cases is adequately funded, trying to get some of that to show the sense of goodwill.  If I were counting on the decision being made strictly by the VA Committee, I would encourage people to know this would get done, but I am deeply concerned we are going to see a Frankenstein monster of appropriation process this week that in no way resembles regular order. That has nothing to do with this committee.  Again I would say, if it were left to us, bifurcating this issue and coming back and fixing it, I have faith in that. In this House of Representatives and the leadership now, I do not have that, nor do the veterans service organizations.  So the question here is not questioning the motive, the question here is not a false canard of privatization versus inside-the-VA care, it is not even the discussion we are having right now of the adequacy overall of the whole budget; it is a case of the VA leadership running a program, running out of money way before they had, and coming to the House and telling us that. And this is not and cannot be made that the idea is you are going to go home without funding the No one will say that about you, and no one should say that about us. Everybody in this House will get this thing done and get it funded. So it is not the case.  I do understand this: we are against the wall, we are under the gun, because they just handed us this. So it is our job to figure out how to build everybody into this.  So the things that are being asked to do with the Choice Program, I support that. The offsets and pay-for, I disagree with. To make that work, our side was willing to say: Can we show some good faith and fund some of these leases and get some payments for these folks in terms of an emergency spending? But I understand the difficulty is if a spending bill comes, there is going to be a vocal group of folks who are going to make the case, as we have seen, that makes it very difficult to move legislation.  Madam Speaker, you have witnessed it with healthcare, you have witnessed it with other things, that we are going to have to compromise. If we get into our corners, it is not going to work.  So I want to be very clear. The motives of the chairman to care for our veterans is unquestioned, Choice being funded is unquestioned. Making sure there is capacity and goodwill and the funding needs in these leases and some of the things we are asking for is a necessity to make sure the Senate can pass this, and that it shows them that we are moving in the right direction.  So I would ask, give us a day, have us come back at this. Don't put this thing on the board to fail and then let everyone else take the message. Everyone here knows we are going to end up here and pass something that can be signed into law, and that will happen. The questions are: Do we do damage amongst ourselves; do we keep the goodwill and the collaboration; or do we decide we need to make a message first, then come back and then blame someone because they are not funding the veterans? No one in here wants that to happen.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgH6151-4.txt,1856,DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS BONUS TRANSPARENCY ACT,2017.0,24.0,June

9830,topic-id,632,"Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, to be clear, we are very aligned on the goals here. I am not implying that wait times went down if we didn't have I was on the conference committee that created Choice as part of it. There is community care that has been there. There is also a $12 billion shortfall in facilities rated D and We had sewer lines breaking and running feces back into hospitals, those types of things.  I am not saying that maybe the money is not already there or they are not using it correctly. The fact of the matter is this was a program that was created out of the crisis of It did not stand up as quickly as it could have; it was plagued with tons of problems that many of us heard about. We kept committed to it. I would argue that they are getting their legs under them and providing care in a timely manner.  It grossly overspent where it was at. We have had no audit. And I think we need to keep this in mind, that on this side of the aisle, I will be the first to talk to anyone who grandstands this and makes this as a case that this is a failure at the VA or the administration. I don't know that yet.  What I would say is we are all in this together, so we want to get it done. I am simply making the case today that in light of opposition that is rarely seen from the VSOs in such opposition to this, that even though the outcome is there, and nothing the chairman said was incorrect, it is the spirit of what it takes to legislate that is missing around here. You can go to the White House after passing a bill in the House, and if the Senate doesn't do anything, it is not a law.  So we have other people to deal with: constituents, veterans, veterans service organizations, Democrats in the Senate, Republicans in the Senate, Democrats on this side.  So what I am asking is, just give a little on the side of what it takes to build the coalition, get the thing passed, and then let's go back and fund VA care and end this ridiculous argument of privatization versus nonprivatization. Wherever a veteran can get the care and access it as quickly, timely, and quality as possible is what we are trying to shoot for. In many cases, that is in the VA; in other cases, it is in the community. So this is not a drop-dead.  My hope on this is, is that a debate, when it comes to emergency spending of money and depending on the Senate, is not going to split the goodwill, the good work, and, I would argue, the fair democracy and execution of how the House of Representatives is supposed to work.  So my final statements on this would be, I am in virtual total agreement with the chairman on what needs to be done here. Our differences lie in, he is right, when I went back and talked to people, I could not sell to the VSOs the plan as it is, and they have every right to speak out on that. And we could not sell the Senate at this point.  So what I would ask the gentleman again is, don't make us oppose this piece of legislation simply to make a statement for a few members. Bring it back when we can have the Senate, the VSOs, and everyone in and accomplish our goal.

10024,topic-id,1189,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Whitehouse for his important words and all the Senators who have come to the floor this afternoon to talk about the Republican plans to dismantle our healthcare system.  As we speak, Republicans in the Senate are busy behind closed doors working overtime to come up with a secret health plan to ram through the I guess they are afraid of how the public would react if we could see the full scope of their plans, but in the last 24 hours, we have seen new details about what they want to do. The formula is as clear as it is cruel: destroy healthcare for tens of millions of Americans, including people struggling under the weight of our national opioid crisis. Why? In order to give tax cuts to rich people.  These plans are simply unforgivable, and I say ``unforgivable'' because I cannot find any justification that makes it[[Page S3184]]OK to take away health insurance from 23 million I cannot come up with a single sliver of an argument that says it makes sense to rip away more than $800 billion from kids with complex medical needs, seniors in nursing homes, and one of the largest sources of help for people and families struggling with substance abuse disorder, all to produce tax breaks for a handful of millionaires and billionaires.  The Republican agenda is destroying healthcare in this country, and it has never been clearer. President Trump released his budget proposal this week. If the healthcare bill is a punch to the gut, his budget is a knife in the ribs. The Trump budget is about the future, and for the future, Trump says there is too much medical research. He wants to cut more than $5 billion from the NIH budget. That is the place where research is ongoing about treatments for Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes, That is America's future that President Trump wants to cut by more than $5 billion.  Then there is the Republican effort to blow up our existing healthcare system. The Republican bill would open the door to discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, and there is more. Insurance companies could drop coverage for mental health and substance abuse disorders. Insurance companies could decide not to cover pregnancy or maternity care. They can drop coverage for prescription drugs. Insurance companies could, once again, impose lifetime limits on diseases like cancer and heart conditions, even for people on employer plans in States like Massachusetts that want nothing to do with the waivers the Republican bill allows.  The CBO says that out-of-pocket costs for these services that are no longer covered would rise ``thousands of dollars a year,'' but cutting out cancer patients and mamas and newborn babies and people with preexisting conditions just wasn't enough for the President Trump used his new budget to cut hundreds of millions of dollars from the Federal agency leading the fight against opioids. Tens of thousands of people are dying, and the Trump budget cuts money needed in the fight against opioids. It gets even worse.  Together, the Republican healthcare bill and the President's budget rip well over a trillion dollars out of the Medicaid Program, which provides health insurance to one in five people in this country. Medicaid funds more than half the people in nursing homes. When a new baby is born in this country, Medicaid pays for about half of those births. Seniors in nursing homes and new babies are just targets for the Republican cuts.  Then, like extra chocolate sauce drizzled over this misery sundae, the budget also cuts the Children's Health Insurance Program by 20 percent over the next decade. Children's health insurance is the program that works together with Medicaid to provide health insurance for one out of every three kids in this country. Trump and the Republicans say: Let them go sick.  What does that mean? Don't repair a hole in their hearts or fix their broken arms? Don't treat them when they get ear infections or does it just leave someone else to pay? If that is the answer, then tell us who? Who exactly is going to pay for the healthcare for these children?  I just don't get what the Republicans in Congress are thinking. I know they have people back in their home States who are begging them to keep healthcare coverage. Disease, accidents, old age, substance abuse, these misfortunes don't ask whether you are a Democrat or a Republican before they come knocking at your door. I just don't get how Republicans can turn their backs on people who will be hurt, but I understand whom the Republicans are helping.  The CBO score lays it out in black and white. The budget lets you go line by line to see just whom the Republicans do care about. The Republican healthcare bill burns down healthcare access for millions of people in this country in order to hand out tax breaks to a tiny handful of millionaires and billionaires.  The Republican budget rips away coverage for people with disabilities so that giant corporations can keep more of their giant profits. The Republican budget tosses seniors out of nursing homes and puts the brakes on Alzheimer's research so the richest people in this country can rake in millions in tax cuts. That is not puzzling; that is unforgivable.  Let's be clear about what is at stake here. A couple of weeks ago, I was at Malden Care Center, which is part of the Cambridge Health Health providers like these in Massachusetts are on the frontlines, and they are fighting back against the opioid epidemic.  The folks at Cambridge Health Alliance told me that before the ACA, they were lucky if one out of every three people walking through their doors had health insurance. Today, after years of hard work in Massachusetts to pass bipartisan health reform and then to implement the ACA, more than 97 percent of the people in our State have healthcare. More than 9 out of 10 people coming into Cambridge Health Alliance clinics now have coverage. Because of that coverage, CHA could offer a wide range of services, including treatment for opioids. They are making headway: More lives saved, more success stories, more healthy babies.  I am not going to tell the seniors and the mamas and the people on the frontlines of the opioid crisis they have to give up those gains to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest people in this country. If Senate Republicans want to defend this indefensible budget and unforgivable healthcare bill, then they can start by coming out from behind closed doors where they are conducting secret negotiations over healthcare. They can look the American people in the eye and admit they care more about the wealthy few in this country than they do about hard-working families and people who need our help. They can be straight up, and the American people--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--can hold them accountable for what they are trying to do to our families and to our country.

10030,topic-id,2659,"Mr.President, it is perhaps a providential happenstance that I should be giving this particular speech while the Senator from Louisiana is presiding because we are both from coastal I am sure he will find things that are familiar in my Rhode Island remarks, particularly given that his Governor has declared the Louisiana coast a state of emergency due to sea level rise.  As the Presiding Officer knows, one place where the effects of climate change are most evident is in our oceans and along our coasts. Rhode Island is the Ocean State, and we have almost 400 miles of beautiful coastline. Everyone in Rhode Island lives less than a half hour from the shore. We count on a healthy ocean and vibrant coast. Our ocean economy, including fishing, tourism, and shipbuilding, amounts to nearly $2.5 billion every year--perhaps not what Louisiana's coastal economy is but pretty good for our small  It employs over 42,000 Rhode Warming, acidifying, and rising oceans are a clear and present danger to many aspects of our Rhode Island way of life. Sea level rise now threatens to remake our Rhode Island coast, swallowing low-lying land, widening existing inlets, eroding beaches, and stranding higher shorefronts as new islands.  For my 166th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I want to show the Senate what this new island chain, the new Rhode Island Archipelago, would look like. The latest modeling software allows us to visualize these projected changes, and the latest science shows that they may be coming sooner than we thought. How soon and how much? Well, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a new report in January updating global sea level rise estimates based on the latest peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Ice sheets, it turns out, and glaciers, are melting faster than expected, raising the so-called extreme scenario for average global sea level rise in this century, the ``we do nothing on climate change scenario,'' by around 20 inches.  When NOAA and its partners applied these findings to America's coasts, taking into account things like regional variations in ocean circulation, in gravitational pull, and in landside conditions like erosion, settling, and depletion of groundwater, the news was particularly harsh for the northeast Atlantic coast--from Virginia through Maine, including Rhode  Our Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council is now telling us that for planning purposes we need to face the possibility of 9 to 12 vertical feet of sea level rise along our shores by the end of the century. A little girl born today at Rhode Island's Women and Infants Hospital will likely actuarially live to see all of these changes. That invasion of our shores by the rising oceans will leave Rhode Island's map unrecognizable.  Early explorers to Rhode Island found our coastline looking much like it does today. Before the 1600s, it had looked much the same for many centuries before that to the Narragansetts and the Wampanoags who lived here. In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution, which began in America in Rhode Island, brought our Nation great wealth, but it also created manmade pollution which began changing our climate.  Climate change causes sea levels to rise. As oceans warm, they expand. As the world warms, ice sheets melt and pour water into the oceans. We measure these things happening. This is not a guess or a projection.  Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council has developed STORMTOOLS, which is an online simulation that models sea level rise and storm surge so we can see ahead what is coming at us. Once again, science gives us the headlights to look forward and see what is coming at us. This is what Rhode Island can expect.  Here is the high water scenario. This is the upper part of Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, including Providence, up here, Warwick, and Warwick Neck and Greenwich Bay over here to the west. Bristol and Warren here, with Mount Hope Bay to the east.  This graphic shows the same image overlaying that previous scenario with the scenario that Rhode Island's CRMC now predicts for our This bright blue color depicted is land that gets covered up with 10 feet of sea level rise, and this teal color is what we get when the sea level rise hits 12 feet. Over here, Bristol gets two new islands, and Bristol and Warren become an island themselves.  If you cross over the bay to Warwick Neck, which is now part of our new coastline, that becomes a new island, Warwick Neck Much of Barrington, which is a well-developed and[[Page S2885]]prosperous bedroom community, just disappears under the water. As I said, Warren and Bristol become their own island.  Now we move down the bay to historic Newport, RI, and the historic waterfront area completely floods, the historic Point section here floods, down here the western part of Newport becomes a new island. Again, all of this is now land that we lose to rising seas.  Not only does Western Newport become Western Newport Island, but it gains its own Castle Hill Island off to the side of it. Up here, the existing Goat Island virtually disappears.  This story is repeated all along Rhode Island's coast. The tip of Little Compton breaks off to become its own tiny little archipelago of new islands. This is Tiverton, which is just north of Little On the other side, here, is the shore of Portsmouth on Aquidneck What you see is that the sea level rise turns Nonquit Pond into ocean and makes an island of this section of Tiverton here near Fogland Point, another new island.  Here we see the point on the other side of the opening into Narragansett Bay from Little You have Little Compton here, Aquidneck Island comes down in the middle, and on the other side you have Point Point Judith also begins to break up into little islands.  If you go up here, Galilee is our fishing port. It is where most of the fishing trawlers have their home port and the entrance runs right up here into the protected harbor area. As you can see, Galilee is now pretty much underwater.  So for folks who like to go to Champlin's Seafood, you will probably have to row there, and it might not even be there. For those who like Aunt Carrie's better, it is here, and it is not in great shape for surviving storms.  So we can go offshore to Block Island, which has been designated by The Nature Conservancy as one of the world's last 10 great places. Well, it is no longer one of the world's last 10 great places, it is now two of the world's last--I guess it would have to be 11 great places because it breaks into two separate islands. Block Island becomes Block  The beautiful town of Jamestown, which is its own island between Aquidneck Island and our mainland shore, breaks up into three separate islands. It is now one. Jamestown goes up a little bit further, that part stays intact, but the upper part breaks away from downtown Jamestown, here, and the Beaver Tail area breaks off into, I guess it would become Beaver Tail  Now let's go up to our capital city. We started with the first map showing This series of images will show what happens to Providence as sea levels rise. Just to orient people who are seeing this, this is the Providence River coming in. This is the Woonasquatucket This is the circle at Waterplace Park and the Woonasquatucket River goes out over the Providence Place Mall, and it goes on from there.  This is Providence's downtown business district. That is 3 feet of sea level rise--not much change. Now you get to 7 feet of sea level rise, and you see the encroachment of the ocean into our business center. Seven feet used to be our worst-case scenario, but as the evidence comes in and we are seeing things happening faster and the sea level rise occurring greater than had been expected, we have been raising our expectations.  So here is the new worst-case scenario--10 feet of sea level rise. As you can see, the business section of downtown Providence is entirely overwhelmed. Twelve feet of sea level rise is a natural consequence once you get to 10 feet of sea level rise because if you have 10 feet of sea level rise, then what you get is a regular and recurring, what people call astronomic tides or king tides, when celestial bodies line up so you have a higher than usual tide. For sure people from Florida know about it because those are the days when the street in front of their house on a sunny day is filled with saltwater because the tide has washed in over it. If you go at king high tide time along the Boston wharf, you see parking areas and walking areas already flooded. So it is not unreasonable to look at 12 feet of sea level rise if you are expecting a baseline, what they call bathtub level of 10 feet.  As you can see, downtown Providence, our business district is more or less completely inundated. So this is Climate Climate Central has allowed us to get these images of what downtown Providence looks like up close, with various levels of sea level rise, and this is something they run off of Google This, again, is downtown  This is Providence City This is Kennedy Plaza, you will be pleased to know, It is named after another John Kennedy because he gave his last speech in his campaign for President before he went home to take in the election results and find out that he had been elected--his last speech was right here to a huge crowd that had come out to see him in downtown  This is our famous Biltmore This used to be the train station. Now the offices of the Rhode Island Foundation are there. As you can see, most of these historic buildings are up to their second floor. If you look at old pictures from the hurricane in 1954 and the hurricane in 1938, you see buildings where the water got that high, but that was at a peak of a hurricane surge. This becomes the baseline. This is what it looks like every day.  Here is a closeup of Providence City Instead of coming along the sidewalk and walking up the steps, you would have to come over in one of our gondolas in order to get in the front entrance, and the first floor of City Hall is lost.  If you look at all of this, it represents a loss of billions of dollars in property value to Rhode  Let me grab the original. All of these areas are occupied right now--people's homes, people's businesses are there, and if they disappear below rising seas, all that value is lost. It is actually worse than that because if this is the new coastline, then behind that coastline is going to be a new set of flood zones and a new set of velocity zones. For those who are not familiar with what a velocity zone is, that is the part of the flood zone in which it is deep enough and exposed enough that you actually get wave action against structures. So you get the physical force of waves damaging structures rather than just tides rising. Between the V-zones and flood zones, there is a much larger area in which structures become uninsurable, they become unmortgageable, and as a result they become unsellable. So the economic harm from this potential sea level rise inundation of Rhode Island is virtually incalculable, and we are not the only ones who are looking at this.  Looking ahead at this coastal threat also is the massive government-backed home loan mortgage corporation Freddie Freddie Mac has predicted ``the economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually, but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession.''  Think about that. Think about the economic damage that this country sustained and the pain the families experienced after the 2008 Wall Street meltdown in that housing crisis, the great recession. Here is Freddie Mac saying this problem is going to be greater in total than the harm from the housing crisis and great recession. Some people would say you can't trust the government about this stuff. You have to trust the private sector. The government doesn't know what it is talking about.  Here is a quote from a recent article in the trade publication Risk & Insurance, an insurance trade publication. The editor of that publication wrote that this was what he called ``a growing and alarming threat.'' He went on to say: ``Continually rising seas will damage coastal residential and commercial property values to the point that property owners will flee those markets in droves, thus precipitating a mortgage value collapse that could equal or exceed the mortgage crisis that rocked the global economy in 2008.''  For anybody who wonders why I come and give these speeches every week, for anybody who wonders why I am up to 166, it is about seeing the coastline of my home State of Rhode Island being whittled away into this chain of islands--this new Rhode Island archipelago. If this were your State, you would be up here too.[[Page S2886]]  We have a responsibility here in Congress to all Americans to face up to what is happening. This is not just a Rhode Island circumstance. It is going to be It is going to be North and South It is going to be Massachusetts and Maine and It is going to be the gulf coast. We are all going to have to face up to this and help communities prepare.  The carbon dioxide that we have already pumped into the atmosphere will make some of this sea level rise inevitable. It is baked in now, and we just have to wait for it to happen. We can still avoid these worst case scenarios if we act promptly and if we will, for one minute, say to the fossil fuel industry: You have had enough. You have fed enough at this trough. You have silenced Congress enough. Your power and your greed will no longer prevail here. We are going to solve this problem for the people of our  We can still do that, but we do have to act promptly.  With regard to the stuff that we cannot avoid, we also have an obligation to help our coastal communities prepare for this, to make this transition. All of these islands are going to need bridges to get to them where there are now roads. Where things are falling into the ocean and you can shore them up and protect them with hard protection, you need to do that. Where not, you need to go back and adjust zoning and planning so that nature can defend herself a little bit better through dunes and through marshes and so forth. There is a lot of work we need to do with this coming at us.  This is not funny. Nature will not wait for our politics to sort themselves out. The laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of biology do not give a hoot about the laws in the They are going to do their thing, and we need to get ahead of them. When this happens, that big, old fossil fuel industry, with all of its lies and its long, dishonorable campaign of calculated disinformation and phony front groups--so that you do not see its hands--and deliberate political mischief to prevent us from acting, is not going to be around to help us. It will be no help when this flooding comes, so it is up to us. That is why we have to wake up.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-10-pt1-PgS2884.txt,1823,HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION,2017.0,10.0,July
9978,topic-id,1466,"Mr.President, as chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, I rise this afternoon to direct the attention of this body to an important national security issue: building and sustaining a larger  President Trump wants a 350-ship Navy, which aligns with the Navy's requirement for 355 ships. Right now we have only 275 ships in the battle fleet. Increasing the size of the Navy by 80 ships, even as older ships retire each year, is a test of national will. It will not happen overnight. However, Congress has the responsibility to lay a firm foundation this year to prepare for a deliberate and responsible buildup in the future. A healthy shipbuilding industrial base is necessary to succeed.[[Page S3391]]  Today, I will offer some general comments about the state of shipbuilding. Then I will focus on the submarine industrial base, in particular, because of its unique challenges. Finally, I will make suggestions on how Congress can support the industrial base in general and the submarine yards specifically.  Last month, my subcommittee convened two hearings on this matter. The first was with naval officials. This took place in a classified setting because of their expertise and because of sensitive information. The other hearing was with the country's two top shipbuilders--Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics--as well as the Shipbuilders Council of America, which is the trade association for suppliers. We discussed the industrial base as it exists today and the challenges associated with building up the fleet.  Based on my subcommittee's work, here are four general impressions of the state of shipbuilding.  1, the yards are turning out most classes of ships on time and on budget. Ingalls Shipbuilding just delivered the newest big-deck amphibious ship--the LHA--13 weeks early. Electric Boat and Newport News continue to deliver Virginia-class attack submarines, or Construction time for attack submarines has declined by 1\1/2\ years--from 84 months to 66 months. There are a few notable exceptions, but, by and large, industry is delivering for the warfighter and for the taxpayer.  2, most yards have excess capacity to ramp up shipbuilding. This is very good news for national security. The Navy's accelerated fleet plan concluded that the industrial base can build an additional 29 ships--above projections--over the next 7 years. The glaring exceptions are the submarine yards, which will struggle to meet planned demand as the new Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine production starts. In terms of capacity, our submarine yards have a ways to go.  3, two decades of low-rate shipbuilding have significantly reduced the supplier base. The Congressional Budget Office has stated that ships cost more today than they did during the Reagan buildup, even when adjusting for inflation. Twenty years ago, about 17,000 suppliers served the submarine business. Now only about 3,000 first-tier suppliers are left. Let me repeat this. We used to have 17,000 suppliers. Now we have 3,000. These 3,000 suppliers include large corporations, such as Northrop Grumman and L3, which have tens of thousands of employees. These 3,000 suppliers also include mom-and-pop small businesses with just a few employees. Whether they deal with large corporations or small businesses, the shipyards increasingly buy from sole-source suppliers. In fact, Newport News spends about 65 percent of its budget in buying pieces and parts from single and sole-source suppliers. General Dynamics faces a very similar situation. I have little doubt that this dramatic erosion in the supplier base explains why ships cost more today.  4, in terms of my general observations, Congress has a critical role to play in supporting a buildup through advance procurement funding, through multiyear procurement authority, and through block buys. These tools can stimulate the supplier base, stabilize the workforce, and achieve significant savings through producing economies of scale. In addition, incremental funding authority is a tool that Congress can authorize to smooth out peaks and valleys in appropriations. This makes it easier to buy more ships in 1 year without busting the budget.  To sum it up, most yards are performing well and have the capacity to ramp up. The submarine yards are doing exceptional work but will struggle because of capacity. All shipbuilders face a diminished supplier base, which undermines competition, and Congress can help improve the supplier situation and stabilize the skilled workforce through using acquisition authorities.  That is a snapshot of the overall shipbuilding industrial base. Now let's turn to submarines specifically. Let's begin with the Navy's requirements.  In 2016, the Navy set a new requirement. The total requirement for ships is 355. That includes an increase of 47 ships from the previous level. For the Navy's submarine fleet, the new plan calls for 66 attack submarines and 12 ballistic missile submarines. We currently have 52 attack submarines--a number that will eventually decline to 41 over the next decade unless we do something about it. I propose we do something about it. We currently have 14 ballistic missile submarines as part of our nuclear deterrent. Beginning in 2021, 12 of these will be replaced by the new Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines.  To reiterate, we need 355 ships. That includes 66 attack submarines and 12 ballistic missile submarines. How does the President's budget request match up? The fiscal year 2018 request includes nine ships and prioritizes readiness more so than modernization. Congress needs to work with the President to reach his goal and to reach the requirement of 350 to 355 ships. I look forward to working with the administration on these budget numbers in order to make them work and to help the President achieve his goal.  Now let's talk about submarines. The budget request fully funds R&D for Columbia-class SSBNs to keep the program on track. The budget also funds the procurement of two Virginia-class submarines. We have followed this policy for years.  The Navy will struggle to ramp up submarine production because of the industrial base for submarines and how it will be stretched to capacity. The CBO tells us that reaching 355 ships in 15 years is not possible because we lack submarine production capacity. Electric Boat and Newport News are investing billions to recapitalize facilities, workforce, and suppliers, but that recapitalization effort is aimed at meeting current projected demand.  Arresting the decline in attack submarines, while maintaining the schedule for the Columbia-class SSBN, will take a significant recapitalization effort. We have done it before, and we can do it again. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, industry steadily delivered three attack submarines per year and added a fourth SSBN on time and on budget. There is no reason we cannot do this again. We must take decisive action now to make this a reality. There are four ways in which Congress can help.  1, repeal the defense budget caps. Sufficient and stable funding is the starting point for expanding submarine and shipbuilding capacity. The Budget Control Act-mandated budget caps have damaged military readiness and choked off modernization. While intended as a way to incentivize us to reform mandatory programs, the BCA defense caps have proved to be a self-inflicted wound. We cannot solve our spending and debt problem on the backs of our warfighters and industrial base, much less on the backs of the security of Congress needs to end the defense budget caps immediately.  2, we need to accelerate and fully fund advance procurement. This will help stimulate and encourage new entrants into the supplier base. We need more competition. We need more suppliers. Driving down the cost per ship will free up resources to buy more ships.  3, we need to incentivize capital investment. Congress should work with industry to identify responsible and cost-effective ways to incentivize investments in facilities and capital equipment.  4, we need to target some appropriations to fund process improvements. I mentioned earlier that Newport News and Electric Boat have shaved a year and a half off Virginia production through more efficient manufacturing. We need more of this sort of thing.  Shipbuilding is a team effort, and these are four ways in which Congress can help to constructively participate in this national project.  The requirement for a bigger Navy is clear. The Navy needs our help to fulfill its mission. Numbers matter when it comes to projecting naval power in this day and age. The President and the Navy agree that we must build a bigger  To summarize, the shipbuilding industrial base is up to the task. Submarine production will be the most challenging part of this. There is limited capacity for submarine yards, and we need to do something about that, but Congress can take a number of steps now. We must start to build a foundation this year. I am committed--and I hope the entire Congress is committed--to setting this firm foundation, and I certainly intend to use my[[Page S3392]]chairmanship on Seapower for this goal.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-12-pt1-PgS3390-2.txt,1226,BUILDING AND SUSTAINING A LARGER NAVY,2017.0,12.0,May
