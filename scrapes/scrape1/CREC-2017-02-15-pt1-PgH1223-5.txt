                      OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, California has been blessed with a lot of 
rain this year, a lot of snowfall in order to alleviate a drought. It 
has gone a little extreme here, but we are still thankful for the 
water.
  I would like to report that Lake Oroville is stable right now with 
the dam, and the spillway situation is such that they are working very 
hard to make sure that that will be something, if we get continued 
rainfall, we will be able to handle the new load.
  I also want to commend and thank President Trump for his very rapid 
reaction to our request for emergency help from the Federal Government 
on Oroville Dam. His team responded very quickly to our ask, and he 
understands and is working for infrastructure needs and repairs across 
this whole country.
  He also understands that it isn't just about building new things, but 
it is going back and repairing our aging infrastructure, whether that 
is our highways, our bridges, or what needs to be done, like on 
Oroville Dam spillway. So I appreciate that.
  Again, my full thanks to President Trump's staff, as well as the 
President himself, on his speedy response to our need.
