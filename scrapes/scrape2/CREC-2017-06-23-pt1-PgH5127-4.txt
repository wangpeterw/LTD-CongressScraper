                       IMMIGRATION HERITAGE MONTH

  (Mr. REICHERT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, during Immigration Heritage Month, I want 
to recognize the great spirit and desire for a better life that lives 
within our Nation's immigrants today and those before them.
  America's immigrants have started companies big and small, 
contributed to their local communities, and have been our friends, 
family, and neighbors. But our immigration system is broken. It is 
failing the many children who are brought to the United States outside 
of their own control.
  That is why I have sponsored and cosponsored the BRIDGE Act and the 
Recognizing America's Children Act to protect these children who only 
want to live the American Dream.
  I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we have to work together, we must work 
together to pass a long-term immigration reform bill that secures our 
borders, yes, but just as importantly, protects our children, protects 
the families and the workers who want nothing more than to be a part of 
this great country and live the American Dream.
