                         TRIBUTE TO EMMA HOMER

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct 
honor of recognizing Emma Homer of Ashland for the many years she has 
helped children in eastern Montana. Her generosity and compassion is 
commendable.
  Emma began fostering children in 1979. For nearly 38 years, she has 
opened her home, and her heart in order to help the local community. 
The longevity of her noble accomplishment is truly remarkable. Over the 
years, Emma has directly helped to improve the lives of over 40 
children through her service as foster parent. The children she has 
cared for have varied in age from infants just a few months old to 
teenagers in high school.
  In addition to her contributions as a foster parent, since 1981, Emma 
has worked in the food service department at St. Labre Indian School. 
During that time, she has helped prepare hundreds of thousands of 
nutritious meals for the students and staff.
  A loving home and a warm meal are essential elements in every Montana 
community. Emma has helped provide both of these essentials to many 
children for well over a generation. Thank you, Emma, for the 
outstanding example you have set for the next generation.
