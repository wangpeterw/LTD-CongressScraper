                  SUPPORTING THE FINANCIAL CHOICE ACT

  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 10, the 
Financial CHOICE Act, replacing the harmful Dodd-Frank Act, with 
reforms that help all Americans.
  The CHOICE Act keeps the promise to my constituents to remove Obama-
era regulations, increase choice for consumers in my community, and 
impose the toughest penalties in history for financial fraud.
  Strong communities like the ones I represent in north Texas are based 
on the strength of their local businesses. Under Dodd-Frank, America 
loses an average of one community bank every day. The Financial CHOICE 
Act will help businesses on Main Street reform business on Wall Street 
and fuel economic growth throughout the country.
  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 10.
