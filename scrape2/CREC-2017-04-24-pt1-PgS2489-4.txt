                         TRIBUTE TO DAVID CAPP

 Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the service of 
David Capp, who is retiring from the U.S. Department of Justice after 
31 years of service. Let the record reflect how proud I am of Mr. 
Capp's service to fellow Hoosiers and our country.
  After graduating from Valparaiso University School of Law in 1977, 
Mr. Capp served in the private sector for 8 years prior to joining the 
U.S. Attorney's Office in 1985. During his tenure, Mr. Capp served as 
interim U.S. attorney, as well as first assistant. On April 28, 2010, 
Mr. Capp was sworn in by Chief Judge Philip Simon as the U.S. Attorney 
for the Northern District of Indiana and has been serving in that 
capacity ever since.
  Mr. Capp has undoubtedly left this office and community a better 
place. Mr. Capp's tireless commitment to his work helped alleviate 
gang-related violence and drug-related offenses. In addition, Mr. 
Capp's dedication to ending

public corruption serves as an example for current and future district 
attorneys in Indiana.
  Mr. Capp, on behalf of all Hoosiers, thank you again, for your 
service to our State and country.
