                           WE NEED TAX REFORM

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some of the 
feedback I have heard from my constituents about the tax bill that has 
already passed this House and is now under consideration in the Senate.
  More than 2,000 of my constituents have taken the time to reach out 
to me and share their overwhelming opposition to this bill.
  I have heard from people like the 83-year-old man in Lake Forest who 
will face financial hardship when he is no longer able to deduct his 
medical expenses; or the professor at Rosalind Franklin University in 
north Chicago who emailed that she is worried about what the 
elimination of the tuition waivers will mean for her medical students; 
or the man in Libertyville who fears that, with the elimination of the 
State and local tax deduction for property taxes, he will face both a 
higher annual tax bill and more than a 10 percent hit on the value of 
his home.
  Mr. Speaker, we need tax reform. I remain committed to working across 
the aisle to achieve it, but this partisan proposal is not the way. I 
urge my colleagues to listen to their own constituents, abandon this 
fatally flawed bill, and work in a bipartisan way to accomplish fair, 
responsible tax reform.
