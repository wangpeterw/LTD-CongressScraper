        INVEST IN THE HEALTH OF BOTH OUR PEOPLE AND OUR ECONOMY

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, the GOP's American Health Care Act 
would turn back the clock on health care for the American people while 
driving States toward bankruptcy and devastating our economy.
  Under the Affordable Care Act, 1 million people in Illinois gained 
health insurance. Under this plan, over 1 million would lose it. 
Millions more across our country currently receiving coverage through 
their jobs would lose their health care as well.
  State and local budgets would face cuts in Federal aid, forcing a 
choice between cutting coverage and raising taxes. My home State of 
Illinois alone would lose $40 billion over the next decade.
  And this bill would wreak havoc on the American economy. The American 
Health Care Act would kill nearly 2 million jobs, while eliminating 
billions in healthcare funding that would otherwise support hospitals, 
community health services, and the development of new cures.
  We need to invest in the health of both our people and our economy. 
Unfortunately, this plan does neither.
