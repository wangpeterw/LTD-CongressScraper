                      RECOGNIZING DR. DAVID RAINES

  (Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my good friend, 
Congressman Mike Johnson, to recognize Dr. David Raines, a Louisiana 
legend in the field of gastroenterology.
  Dr. Raines has worked with patients across the United States, 
including a gastroenterology fellowship serving our Nation's veterans 
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center here in Washington.
  Dr. Raines is a pioneer in the field of gastroenterology, and is 
almost single-handedly responsible for bringing free-standing endoscopy 
centers to Louisiana. Because of him, patients can get these important 
lifesaving procedures in cost-efficient and convenient outpatient 
facilities.
  Dr. Raines is admired among his peers, me being one of those and 
Congressman Johnson being another, not only for his professional 
accomplishments, but also for the way he has cared for others, 
including mentoring new doctors attending and entering his field.
  Congressman Johnson and I wanted to take a moment today to thank Dr. 
Raines for his career of service to patients throughout Louisiana. He 
has saved many lives, and our State is a better place because of him.
