MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE THREE VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE AT THE VETERANS 
                     HOME OF CALIFORNIA-YOUNTVILLE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a very sad 
and heavy heart to ask that we stand for a moment of silence for three 
of my constituents who were murdered in another senseless act of gun 
violence, three women at the California Veterans Home in Napa Valley, 
California,

[[Page H1530]]

Yountville--a veterans home, the largest in the country, serving the 
most veterans in the country.
  This was a particular program designed to help Iraq and Afghanistan 
veterans who were coming home with serious problems.
  These three women got up every morning, they put on their clothes, 
they kissed their families good-bye, they walked out the door to do one 
thing and one thing only, and that was to help troubled veterans.
  And on Friday, they were murdered. They were held hostage and gunned 
down in cold-blooded murder. One more senseless act of gun violence.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like this body to recognize a moment of silence 
for Christine Loeber, the executive director of The Pathway Home 
program at the California Veterans Home in Yountville; Dr. Jennifer 
Golick, the clinical director and staff psychologist; and Jennifer 
Gonzales, the clinical psychologist with the San Francisco Department 
of Veterans Affairs, who was on assignment at The Pathway Home and was 
also pregnant.
