                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Lord God, source of righteousness and the center of our joy, forgive 
us when we assume we know what is right without seeking Your wisdom. 
Inspire our lawmakers to think Your thoughts, to listen for Your 
directions, and to follow Your guidance. Lord, lead them to seek what 
is best for our Nation and world, depending always on Your sovereignty 
and might. May they constantly remember that You possess all power and 
can accomplish the seemingly impossible if they would only believe. 
Continue to sustain them with Your might, showering them with Your 
bountiful blessings.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
