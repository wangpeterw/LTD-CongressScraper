 HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF GRANT COUNTY FIRE DISTRICT BATTALION 
                            CHIEF DAN DISHON

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. Newhouse) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service 
of Grant County Fire District Battalion Chief Dan Dishon from Moses 
Lake, Washington. Dan passed away on January 8, 2018.
  Dan was a husband, a father, a friend, and a highly respected fire 
servicemember. His love of firefighting and his dedication to his 
community were evident in his 15 years of volunteer service at both the 
Grant County Fire District 13 as well as District 5, where he 
eventually secured his dream job of shift captain.
  Local firefighters, members of his team, and the community will 
remember him for his leadership, humility, and commitment to keeping 
the citizens of Grant County safe. My prayers and sincere condolences 
go out to his family and his friends and all those affected by his 
passing during this difficult time.
  I urge all my colleagues to join me in thanking Dan Dishon for his 
inspirational life of service to Washington State in the Fourth 
District.
