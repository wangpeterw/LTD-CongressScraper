                     HONORING SERGEANT JOSH RODGERS

  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, Army Sergeant Josh 
Rodgers was killed in action during a raid targeting an ISIS prison in 
Afghanistan, making the ultimate sacrifice while working to free those 
imprisoned by evil.
  A native of Bloomington, Illinois, in my congressional district, 
Sergeant Rodgers' heroism and bravery have not been forgotten. A 
graduate of Normal Community High School in 2013, where he competed on 
the track and football teams, his teachers, teammates, and coaches 
remember him fondly. They say he was a natural leader and a hard worker 
who believed it was his duty to serve his country in the military.
  That is why I am proud to stand here today to announce the 
introduction of a bill, with the support of the entire Illinois 
delegation, Republicans and Democrats, that would rename the post 
office in Bloomington, Illinois, the Sergeant Josh Rodgers U.S. Post 
Office.
  Mr. Speaker, there is no way to truly thank Sergeant Rodgers or his 
family, but it is my hope that this building will serve to honor him 
and remind all of us of the price of our freedom.
