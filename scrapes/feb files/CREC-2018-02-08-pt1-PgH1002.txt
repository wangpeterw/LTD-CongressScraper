        IMPROVING RURAL CALL QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ACT OF 2017

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unfinished business is the question on 
suspending the rules and passing the bill (S. 96) to amend the 
Communications Act of 1934 to ensure the integrity of voice 
communications and to prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination 
among areas of the United States in the delivery of such 
communications.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
