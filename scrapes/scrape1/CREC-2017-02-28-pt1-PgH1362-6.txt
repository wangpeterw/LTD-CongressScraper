                    DONALD TRUMP AND VLADIMIR PUTIN

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, last week I hosted a dozen of 
constituent events in my district. At every turn, families asked the 
same question: When will Congress investigate the President's 
involvement with Russia?
  I have received many calls and e-mails about Russia for weeks. The 
American people are deeply and rightly concerned with this 
administration's involvement with the Putin regime. We know the 
President's hand-picked national security adviser was forced to resign 
over his communications with Russia. We know that if Moscow did indeed 
influence our free elections, we have a duty to stand up against those 
threats and not sweep them under the rug.
  We do not support Putin's human rights record, his treatment of 
journalists, or his invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, where my 
grandmother was born.
  So why is the people's House protecting Vladimir Putin? Why are we 
not standing up to President Trump and investigating his dealings with 
the Putin regime? What are we afraid of?
  To my colleagues on the House Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee, what are you afraid we will find out if we investigate?
  Mr. Speaker, when are we going to get answers for the American 
people?
  Lastly, I welcome Chicago WVON's Matt McGill and Planned Parenthood's 
Donna Miller to tonight's joint session.
