                  AMRO FABRICATING CELEBRATES 40 YEARS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Takano) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 40th anniversary 
of AMRO Fabricating Corporation, whose Riverside manufacturing facility 
is adjacent to the March Air Reserve Base in my district.
  AMRO is a small business manufacturer that plays an important role in 
supporting NASA, the Department of Defense, and our community.
  Under the guidance of CEO Michael E. Riley, the grandson of founders 
Michael K. and Thora A. Riley, this family company is helping to 
develop a strong and skilled workforce in southern California.
  AMRO is partnering with the State and Federal Government on projects 
that place high school and college students in internships and 
apprenticeships, which prepare them for a successful future and support 
our local economy.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the AMRO team on this milestone, 
and I am proud to represent this terrific small business that is doing 
such great work for our community and for our Nation.
