               RECOGNIZING EMILY AND MICHAEL BROADBRIDGE

  (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about some incredible 
young people back home in Michigan. Meet Emily and Michael Broadbridge. 
Emily is a sixth grader and Michael is a first grader in Macomb County.
  This is no ordinary lemonade stand. Instead of simply making money 
for themselves, Emily and Michael are donating all the money they earn 
to the Homeless Education Project, which provides school supplies and 
clothes for homeless students in Macomb County.
  Emily held her first lemonade stand on National Lemonade Day in 
2011--yes, there is one--when she was just 5. Her parents thought it 
would be a good lesson in entrepreneurship, but it became so much more 
when she decided on her own to donate her proceeds to charity. Since 
then, Emily and her brother, Michael, have raised over $13,000 for the 
Homeless Education Project. They expect to raise $7,000 this year.
  Emily and Michael have selflessly put others' needs before their own. 
I am proud to recognize them and their example today as role models for 
our community.
