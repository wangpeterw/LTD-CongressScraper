                     MEDIA DESERVE FAKE NEWS AWARDS

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President highlighted 
examples of media bias and irresponsible news stories. All Americans 
should call out purveyors of fake news and point out slanted coverage.
  The President is certainly correct in using the term ``fake news'' to 
describe the media when they intentionally misrepresent his comments 
and take them out of context. They intentionally omit relevant facts 
and only report one side of the story, and they intentionally promote a 
liberal agenda.
  In a democracy, the media have a profound responsibility to give the 
American people the facts, not tell them what to think.
