                                DREAMERS

  (Mr. KHANNA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, thousands marched in every city 
across America for racial justice, gender equality, and a moral vision 
of America. Today, we let them down.
  It was not complicated what citizens wanted. They wanted a vote, a 
guaranteed vote in this Chamber about whether we would keep our word to 
the DREAMers, and we failed to deliver.
  Now, I have no doubt that most Democrats, Senators and congressmen, 
care about the DREAMers staying in this country, but citizens expect 
more. They want us not just to look at generic poll numbers or 
battleground districts. They want us to lead with our hearts because 
they are leading with their hearts.
  The question today, Mr. Speaker, is: When will the elected 
representatives be worthy of the courage of our citizens and the 
grassroots?
