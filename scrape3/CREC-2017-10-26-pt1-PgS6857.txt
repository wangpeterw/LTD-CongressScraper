   SENATE RESOLUTION 309--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF 
        OCTOBER 2017 AS ``NATIONAL PROTECT YOUR HEARING MONTH''

  Ms. WARREN (for herself and Ms. Collins) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions:

                              S. Res. 309

       Whereas the National Institute on Deafness and Other 
     Communication Disorders and the Centers for Disease Control 
     and Prevention have found that up to 24 percent of adults in 
     the United States, 40,000,000 individuals, may have noise-
     induced hearing loss in 1 or both ears;
       Whereas individuals take part in activities every day that 
     can contribute to increased exposure to harmful noise levels;
       Whereas potential sources of noise-induced hearing loss 
     include--
       (1) portable music;
       (2) movie and game systems;
       (3) sports recreation activities, such as auto racing, 
     hunting, and snowmobiling;
       (4) athletic events;
       (5) concerts;
       (6) yard work, such as mowing the lawn; and
       (7) hobbies, such as woodworking;
       Whereas workers in the fields of mining, manufacturing, and 
     construction and individuals serving in the military go to 
     work each day in damaging noise conditions and occupational 
     hearing loss is among the most commonly recorded work-related 
     injuries;
       Whereas living or working on a farm can also expose 
     individuals to harmful levels of noise, including from farm 
     machinery, other equipment used on farms, and animals;
       Whereas musicians of all ages, both amateur and 
     professional, can be regularly exposed to levels of noise 
     that can be harmful;
       Whereas, over time, continued exposure to harmful noise 
     levels can lead to permanent noise-induced hearing loss;
       Whereas hearing loss from harmful noise can negatively 
     impact communication and quality of life for an individual;
       Whereas hearing loss from harmful noise is permanent and is 
     not reversible, but is preventable;
       Whereas individuals can protect themselves against noise-
     induced hearing loss through simple measures to reduce 
     exposure to loud sounds, including turning down the volume, 
     moving away from the source of sound, and wearing hearing 
     protection when involved in a loud activity;
       Whereas protecting the ears of children is an important 
     measure to help prevent noise-induced hearing loss because 
     children may be more susceptible to damage than adults and 
     are too young to protect their own ears;
       Whereas Congress can help raise awareness among the general 
     public about the importance of protecting hearing; and
       Whereas October 2017 would be an appropriate month to 
     designate as ``National Protect Your Hearing Month'': Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the designation of October 2017 as ``National 
     Protect Your Hearing Month''; and
       (2) recognizes that all individuals in the United States 
     should become more aware of--
       (A) the potential for noise-induced hearing loss as a 
     result of daily activities; and
       (B) the measures that individuals can take to protect 
     hearing for a lifetime.
