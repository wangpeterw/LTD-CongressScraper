                     2017 CONTINUED APPROPRIATIONS

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the continued 
appropriations for 2017 and to say: Say it isn't so.
  When the Trump budget was presented--the skinny budget--$600 billion 
was cut out of NIH, which would impact a major research in diseases 
that impact Americans. Thank goodness that we worked for a $2 billion 
increase for the NIH in this appropriations bill.
  And, equally so, how important it is that we can announce in Houston 
that the Houston Housing Authority will be able to reissue vouchers for 
homeless families because $654 million-plus was put in the section 8 
vouchers, $40 million-plus was put in for veterans who are homeless, 
and $10 million was put in for the disabled.
  In addition, we added to the Cops on the Beat program and, as well, 
provided additional dollars to enhance the Civil Rights Division some 
$897.5 million.
  The budget or the appropriations should be a road map for serving 
Americans, not a nickel-and-dime approach to undermine. I am glad the 
resistance remains strong, and that is why we have a budget or an 
appropriation that listens to the people and the healthcare subsidies 
are being paid for, so that people can have that health insurance.
