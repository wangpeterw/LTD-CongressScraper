                      IN MEMORY OF TOWNSEND WOLFE

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, this weekend I had the opportunity to visit 
the exceptional exhibit of Ansel Adams' photography, from his early 
years, at the Arkansas Arts Center, and it made me reflect on the life 
of Townsend Wolfe, the ultimate southern gentleman and truly a cultural 
visionary. Townsend passed away earlier this month at the age of 81.
  Townsend served as the director and chief curator of the Arkansas 
Arts Center in Little Rock for 34 years, until his retirement in 2002. 
That year, he was honored with the Governor's Arts Award for Lifetime 
Achievement by the Arkansas Arts Council. During his tenure, the Arts 
Center experienced unparalleled growth in numbers of annual visitors 
and in its exceptional collection.
  Townsend's love of art extended beyond the walls of the galleries, 
bringing beauty into the lives of countless Arkansans. Townsend leaves 
behind a legacy of warmth and passion, and his contributions to ``The 
Natural State'' will continue to live on at the Arkansas Arts Center.
