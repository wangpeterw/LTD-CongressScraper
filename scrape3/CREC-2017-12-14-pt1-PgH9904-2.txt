                  TRUCKERS' ELECTRONIC TRACKING DEVICE

  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, millions of American truck drivers helped 
elect President Trump last November, and I am calling on him to step in 
and give them a hand.
  President Obama left office back in January, but a $2 billion 
regulation that he wrote in 2015 to require electronic tracking devices 
be put in every truck in America is still scheduled to go into effect 
this Monday. Yes, an Obama regulation that shamefully seems to remain 
on the books is going into effect this Monday under a Republican 
Congress and White House.
  The Department of Transportation can give a 90-day waiver for all 
truckers from this mandate, giving several waivers for specific 
industries, including one just this week. Instead of offering fairness 
and relief, they are picking winners and losers.
  Millions of American truckers are pleading 24/7 for relief from this 
mandate using the hashtag #eldorme, but it has fallen on deaf ears at 
the Department of Transportation.
  Mr. President, you call the shots in this administration. Please 
issue an executive order today and instruct the Department of 
Transportation to give all truckers relief from this mandate for 3 
months. Don't implement this colossal Obama mandate a week before 
Christmas.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). Members are advised to direct 
their remarks to the Chair.
