                     HEALTH INSURANCE IN NAME ONLY

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a few of my 
constituents who are struggling under the weight of ObamaCare. Like 
many Americans who are self-employed, Kim and Randall are two Kansans 
who obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act's 
marketplace.
  Kim's premiums have more than doubled from $188 to $392 per month; 
but, worse, her deductible has actually gone from about $700 to $6,500. 
Randall's premiums are even worse, coming in at around $700 per month, 
with a deductible of $6,800.
  I reference these two examples because they highlight one of the 
primary problems of the Affordable Care Act: coverage with deductibles 
approaching $7,000 really isn't coverage at all. It is health insurance 
in name only.
  This week House Republicans have rolled out the initial draft of our 
plan to repeal and replace the ACA. We are doing it thoughtfully and 
carefully through the open committee process as we speak. The bill and 
summaries are available online at readthebill.gop.
  Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is collapsing. Let's work together as 
Democrats and Republicans to repair our broken healthcare system and 
truly give the American people access to affordable care.
