                    THANKING FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA

  Mr. McCONNELL.Mr. President, I wish to offer a few words regarding 
our outgoing President. I had a chance, as some others did yesterday, 
toreceive a call from him, which I appreciated. I want to say farewell 
to President Obama. I think it is worth, once again,reflecting on the 
significance of his election and the historic achievement it 
represented in terms of our country's past. Thatis something both he 
and our country should be very proud of.
  It is no secret that the President and I and other Members ofmy party 
have not always seen eye to eye. Over the years, we have pursued 
totally different legislative priorities. Everybodyaround here knows 
that. The American people know that too. It is a big country. We have 
different views about what ought to bedone.
  Let me say this. I think I speak for all Americans when I thank our 
former President for his tremendous service to ourNation. As can be 
said of all First Families, he and his family have made many personal 
sacrifices over the past 8 years.Through it all, they have done so with 
dignity and with grace.
  To our 44th President, I wish to say, for your leadership, weare 
grateful. We wish you, Michelle, Malia, and Sasha all the best as you 
embark on this new chapter of your lives.
  TheACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic whip is recognized.
