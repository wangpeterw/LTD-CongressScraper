                    PROTECT SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, I addressed this House on the 
issue of Mr. Mueller and his important investigation in the Special 
Counsel's Office.
  I am concerned, as we leave on Thursday or Friday, that the President 
could fire Mr. Rosenstein--who has authority over Mr. Mueller--or fire 
Mr. Sessions and put somebody in who will jeopardize Mr. Mueller's 
investigation.
  Accordingly, a bill I have, H.R. 4669, was filed in December to 
protect Mr. Mueller. It gives him due process rights--if he is fired--
to go to court before a three-judge Federal panel to show that he was 
fired for purposes which were political and not relating to his job 
performance.
  I am filing a discharge petition today. I will be filing it in 10 
minutes, asking all Members of the House to sign it; to bring this bill 
to the floor immediately for a vote so that we can protect the special 
counsel, protect Mr. Mueller, and protect America.
  God Bless America.
