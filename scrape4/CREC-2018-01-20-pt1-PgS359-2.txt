                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Lord God, You are the God of our salvation. Guide our lawmakers to 
trust in Your mercy and not in themselves. Fix their hope in Your love 
and power, not primarily in human resources. Lead them around the 
detours that bring confusion, chaos, and destruction. Placing their 
trust in You, help them to do nothing without desiring Your purpose to 
be accomplished.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
