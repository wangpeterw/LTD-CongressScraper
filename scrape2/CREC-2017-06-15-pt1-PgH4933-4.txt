 GOD BLESS STEVE SCALISE AND ALL THOSE INJURED IN THE SHOOTING OF JUNE 
                                14, 2017

  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that my thoughts and prayers 
are with our colleague, Steve Scalise, and the others who were injured 
as a result of the horrific shooting yesterday morning. This makes us 
realize how vulnerable we all are and, in serving our country, we risk 
a lot of things from time to time.
  The people who were injured, besides Congressman Scalise, the brave 
first responders who probably saved many more lives as a result, what 
can we say, other than thank you to the first responders all over this 
country who save us day in and day out.
  The other young people, the staffer and lobbyist, everyone who was 
injured yesterday, my thoughts and prayers are with them as well.
  Steve is a tough guy, and I know he is going to heal quickly, and I 
know he is going to get better and have a full recovery, so I just 
wanted to wish him a good Father's Day. Let the small pleasures of life 
come back to him because he deserves it.
  I want him and his family to know that our thoughts are with them 
during this difficult time. We are all in the same family together, the 
congressional family. And it matters not what party you belong to, but 
the fact is we are all there to serve our constituents and help 
America.
  So God bless America, God bless Steve Scalise and all the people who 
were injured. We are not going to stop until they are brought back home 
and mending and recovered 100 percent.
