                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  There have been many prayers this day rising to You from those 
engaged in the political discourse of this Nation. We give You thanks 
for those who were able to gather at the National Prayer Breakfast and 
those across this land who joined their prayer intentions with the many 
who attended.
  Bless the Members of this people's House now as they gather to do the 
legislative work they are called to do. May their prayers this day be 
authentic and heard by You, the living God.
  May their work be fruitful and beneficial to those whom You favor, 
the poor. And may all they do be done in humility and charity, knowing 
that we are all earthen vessels through whom Your Spirit might shine 
forth.
  And, finally, may all that is done this day be for Your greater honor 
and glory.
  Amen.
