       HONORING BRANCH COUNTY SHERIFF POSSE DEPUTY MICHAEL WINTER

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Branch County, 
Michigan, Sheriff Posse Deputy Michael Winter, who lost his life in the 
line of duty. He is survived by his wife, Connie, and two daughters, 
Cheyenne and Sierra.
  Deputy Winter was known as a committed family man with a sense of 
humor and a big smile. He loved being around horses and loved the 
posse.
  From his time in the United States Navy to the Branch County 
Sheriff's Posse, Deputy Winter was the type of person who put his 
community and country before himself. He is a hero in every sense of 
the word.
  This week, during National Police Week, his name was carved into the 
National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, D.C. It 
is a lasting tribute to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to 
protect us.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful nation, we honor Deputy Winter's 
memory and his service to Branch County and our country. He will not be 
forgotten.
