                       PULL THE PLUG ON TRUMPCARE

  (Ms. VELAZQUEZ asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the Senate has postponed a 
vote on their TrumpCare bill, which would have deprived 22 million 
Americans of health coverage. The truly vicious nature of this bill is 
most clear when it comes to Medicaid.
  Are you a working family relying on Medicaid for long-term care of an 
aging grandparent? Well, with TrumpCare, you will pay more out of 
pocket.
  For a low-income working mom who insures her kids through Medicaid, 
TrumpCare takes dead aim at you.
  How about a person with a disability? TrumpCare means potentially 
losing coverage.
  Why did the Republicans make these cuts? To give billions of dollars 
in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and corporations.
  The President says the House-passed bill is ``mean.'' It is. So is 
the Senate cold-hearted proposal.
  A delay on this vote is not enough. Congress needs to pull the plug 
on TrumpCare, not the American people. Then we can work together on 
real, bipartisan healthcare legislation aimed at strengthening the 
system, not harming the most vulnerable among us.
