       RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF JOHN AND KAREN SHIMKUS

  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, as my colleague from Colorado recognized 
the 100th anniversary of Estes Park, I take to the floor to thank my 
wife for putting up with me for 30 years--30 years ago today.
  Madam Speaker, as we all know, behind every good man is a great 
woman. I wanted to come to the floor to thank her for helping raise our 
three boys, helping make sure that we attend church faithfully, and 
putting up with the hectic life that a lot of our constituents don't 
understand living in two places at one time, trying to manage a family 
in another State, while we are gone almost half of the year.
  So I come to the floor just to pause and thank my beautiful wife, 
Karen, for sticking with me for 30 years.
