                       TRIBUTE TO TIMOTHY CORLEY

 Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Timothy Corley for his hard 
work as an intern at the Republican Policy Committee. I recognize his 
efforts and contributions to my office as well as to the State of 
Wyoming.
  Timothy is a native of Maryland and a graduate of American 
University, School of International Service. He studied U.S. foreign 
policy. He has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has made him an 
invaluable asset to our office. The quality of his work is reflected in 
his great efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank Timothy for the dedication he has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have him as part of our team. 
I know he will have continued success with all of his future endeavors. 
I wish him all my best on his journey.
