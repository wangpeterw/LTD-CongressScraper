                 PROTECTING AND DEFENDING OUR DREAMERS

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to protect and 
defend our DREAMers.
  Now that President Trump has failed all of us by rescinding DACA, 
Congress must now move immediately to protect these courageous, 
patriotic DREAMers like my constituent and aspiring cardiovascular 
surgeon, Cinthya Moran.
  Cinthya just wants an opportunity to contribute to her community, and 
in her own words: ``We are only here to contribute to this amazing 
country.''
  Like Cinthya, all DACA recipients are our friends, they are our 
neighbors, they are soldiers on the battlefield, they are new 
homeowners, they are entrepreneurs, they are students.
  I urge my colleagues to support our DACA constituents and pass 
legislation that protects these brave young people, and I ask you to do 
that as soon as possible.
