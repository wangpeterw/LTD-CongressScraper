              IMPROVE THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Original Pizza in Broomfield, 
Colorado, has been in business since the 1990s. Now they are being 
sued.
  The plaintiff claims they do not have ADA-accessible parking signage 
or proper insulation wrapped around the pipes under the restroom sink.
  The claims waged against Original Pizza are mostly false. The sink is 
compliant, and the parking issue could be fixed with a better sign and 
a bit of paint. Not to mention, Original Pizza was never notified of 
the alleged violations by the plaintiff.
  Now the plaintiff is demanding money to pay or a lawsuit will be 
filed. The same plaintiff has filed over 70 other lawsuits against 
businesses for alleged ADA violations.
  Plaintiffs and attorneys hope companies will decide to settle rather 
than face an expensive court trial.
  The ADA Education and Reform Act will require giving businesses 
notice and time to fix the alleged infraction before the lawsuit is 
filed. Notice and cure are a fair way to handle ADA violations.
  And that is just the way it is.
