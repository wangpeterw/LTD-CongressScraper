                     ENHANCING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I have the honor and the privilege of 
being a United States Congressman, and with that comes tremendous 
responsibility. We have a country of over 320 million people--men, 
women, and children. And right now, we may be days away or even a 
couple of weeks away from watching the United States Senate possibly 
change healthcare for America like we have never seen before.
  I hope and pray that my colleagues in both Houses and the President 
of the United States try their best to make sure that we enhance 
healthcare access rather than divert more than 20 million people away 
from being able to see a doctor.
  Just last week I was visited by some young folks and I was given this 
red band called ``Will Power'' for a little boy named Will, who has 
gone through many operations. If these bills see the light of day and 
the President's desk and gets into law, people like Will just might not 
be around very much longer.
  Mr. Speaker, let's hope and pray that we do the right thing
