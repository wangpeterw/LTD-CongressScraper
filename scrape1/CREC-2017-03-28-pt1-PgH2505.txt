                          THE MARCHANT FAMILY

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I must confess, as my wife and kids know, I 
am not the most romantic guy. I have never dreamed I would be a 
matchmaker. Believers say the Lord works in mysterious ways, and, Mr. 
Speaker, those words are, oh, so true.
  In 2007, I came home and ran for Congress. It was brutal: a 10-person 
primary, a runoff against a former Member, and a general election 
against an incumbent. But I had a secret weapon on my campaign: this 
man, Luke Marchant. Luke is the son of our colleague, Kenny. Luke would 
show up in a campaign office with ratty flip flops, in wrinkled, baggy 
shorts, and an unwashed T-shirt. Luke was a beast. But a beauty showed 
up like out of Disney: Katie McDonald. The matchmaking began. Beauty 
and the beast fell in love.
  I was there on June 12, 2016, when they were married. Last week, 
Walker Ross Marchant was born to these two amazing young friends.
  Katie and Luke, congratulations. In the future, for number two, maybe 
Peter Graham Marchant should be a name you all should consider.
