                   THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR VICTORY

  (Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, today, on this day that lives in infamy, 
we recall MacArthur's message from the Philippines. He said famously:

       From the Far East, I send you one single thought, one sole 
     idea written in red on every beachhead from Australia to 
     Tokyo: There is no substitute for victory.

  Mr. Speaker, I ask the Corps of Cadets at the United States Military 
Academy to remember that on the football field on Saturday.
  Go Army. Beat Navy
