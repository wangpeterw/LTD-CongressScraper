                            VOTE EXPLANATION

 Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I would have cast my vote 
in favor of Scott Brown to represent the United States as Ambassador to 
New Zealand and Samoa. New Zealand has been a treaty ally of the United 
States since the signing of the Australia-New Zealand--United States 
Treaty in 1951. As a crucial partner and ally, the United States and 
New Zealand share core values of democracy, human rights, and liberty, 
and I believe it is imperative for the United States to maintain strong 
allegiance to our longstanding friends throughout the world.
