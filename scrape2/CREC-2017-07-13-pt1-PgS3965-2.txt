                                 PRAYER

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today's prayer will be offered by Pastor Bill 
Ewing of Christian Life Ministries in Rapid City, SD.
  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Please join me.
  As we bow our knees before You, Father, grant us thankful hearts and 
let our eyes see the many blessings we have been given living in this 
great land.
  Put a protective hedge around these leaders, their marriages, and 
their families, and let peace dwell in their homes. O Lord, strengthen 
these that You have placed with this authority so Christ may dwell in 
their hearts through faith; and that they would be rooted and grounded 
in loving kindness and truth. May they be able to comprehend the 
knowledge of Your will and to know the love of Christ so they make 
decisions that protect and preserve the lives You have entrusted to 
them.
  Lord, teach us to listen. The times are noisy and our ears are weary 
with the thousands of sounds that continuously assault us. Give us the 
spirit of young Samuel when he said to You, ``Speak, for Your servant 
is listening.'' Let us hear You speaking in our hearts so that we get 
used to the sound of Your voice; that its tones may be familiar to us, 
and we would lead this great Nation accordingly.
  Amen.
