     PERMANENT STATUS FOR LIBERIANS IN DEFERRED ENFORCED DEPARTURE

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my support as a 
cosponsor of the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act, which gives 
Liberians in deferred enforced departure permanent status.
  Thousands of Liberians came to the United States to escape civil war, 
seeking a better life and a safer environment to raise their families. 
For the last 25 years, many have sought and realized the American Dream 
through hard work, drive, and determination. They have become small-
business owners and leaders in our community. Minnesota is home to one 
of the largest Liberian communities in the United States, many of whom 
live in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities.
  Mr. Speaker, I have had the distinct pleasure and honor of getting to 
know many members of the Liberian community personally. I have heard 
their stories, and I have seen their love for America firsthand. 
However, they are facing uncertainty today because their temporary 
period of protection is about to expire, so it is imperative that 
action be taken to ensure they are able to live here, work here, and 
continue to offer their contributions as important members of our 
community.
