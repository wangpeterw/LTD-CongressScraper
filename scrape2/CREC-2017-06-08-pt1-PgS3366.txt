SENATE RESOLUTION 189--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF JUNE 5 THROUGH JUNE 11, 
                     2017, AS ``HEMP HISTORY WEEK''

  Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Paul, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. McConnell) 
submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 189

       Whereas Hemp History Week will be held from June 5 through 
     June 11, 2017;
       Whereas the goals of Hemp History Week are to commemorate 
     the historical relevance of industrial hemp in the United 
     States and to promote the full growth potential of the 
     industrial hemp industry;
       Whereas industrial hemp is an agricultural commodity that 
     has been used for centuries to produce many innovative 
     industrial and consumer products, including soap, fabric, 
     textiles, construction materials, clothing, paper, cosmetics, 
     food, and beverages;
       Whereas the global market for hemp is estimated to consist 
     of more than 25,000 products;
       Whereas the value of hemp imported into the United States 
     for use in the production of other retail products is 
     estimated at approximately $76,000,000 annually;
       Whereas the United States hemp industry estimates that the 
     annual market value of hemp retail sales in the United States 
     is more than $570,000,000;
       Whereas despite the legitimate uses of hemp, many 
     agricultural producers of the United States are prohibited 
     under current law from growing hemp;
       Whereas because most hemp cannot be grown legally in the 
     United States, raw hemp material and hemp products are 
     imported for sale in the United States;
       Whereas the United States is the largest consumer of hemp 
     products in the world, but the United States is the only 
     major industrialized country that restricts hemp farming; and
       Whereas industrial hemp holds great potential to bolster 
     the agricultural economy of the United States: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the week of June 5 through June 11, 2017, as 
     ``Hemp History Week'';
       (2) recognizes the historical relevance of industrial hemp; 
     and
       (3) recognizes the growing economic potential of industrial 
     hemp.
