                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  God and God alone, we praise You that You give power to the weak, and 
to those who have no might You increase their strength. Increase the 
stamina of our lawmakers when their hearts are overwhelmed by 
challenges.
  May they look to You, the fountain of every blessing, to enable them 
to solve our national problems with wisdom and faithfulness. May they 
not be afraid or dismayed, always placing their trust in You. Lord, 
inspire them to remember that Your plans stand firm, as Your purposes 
prevail through all generations. Instruct them in the way they should 
go as You give them Your peace.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
