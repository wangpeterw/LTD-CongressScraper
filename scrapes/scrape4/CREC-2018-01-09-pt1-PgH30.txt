          IF YOU DON'T WANT A TAX CUT, MAIL IT BACK TO THE IRS

  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, some folks in Washington are upset because 
we just passed the largest tax cut in American history. They think this 
money is Washington's money and that politicians and bureaucrats should 
decide how to spend it.
  I could not disagree more. You and I know that this money belongs to 
the American people, came right out of their wallets.
  Under our new law, we put hardworking families first by helping them 
cope with the cost of raising children by doubling the child tax 
credit. We also help small businesses by cutting their taxes so that 
they can compete with foreign companies and create jobs right here in 
America.
  Well, for those folks who don't think they need an extra $1,500 or 
so, or who think politicians and bureaucrats can spend their money 
better, I have a solution: go ahead and drop your new refund check in 
the mail. Send it to the IRS. They will be glad to take your money.
