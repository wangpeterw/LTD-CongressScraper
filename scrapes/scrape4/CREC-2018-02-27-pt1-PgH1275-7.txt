                    AMERICAN LEGION STORMS THE HILL

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the American Legion 
convenes in Washington this week for its annual policy conference to 
meet with Federal lawmakers.
  The American Legion was chartered and incorporated by Congress in 
1919 as a patriotic veterans organization devoted to mutual 
helpfulness. It is the Nation's largest wartime veterans service 
organization, committed to mentoring youth and sponsorship of wholesome 
programs in our communities, advocating patriotism and honor, promoting 
strong national security, and continued devotion to servicemembers and 
veterans.
  Hundreds of local American Legion programs and activities strengthen 
the Nation one community at a time. Whether it is connecting veterans 
through sporting programs, honoring fallen heroes through Legion Riders 
or advocating for homeless veterans, the American Legion plays a 
priceless role in creating a sense of community among veterans of all 
ages and service periods.
  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the American Legion. The Legionnaires 
have a tremendous sense of obligation to their community, their State, 
and their Nation. They advocate honestly for veterans in Washington, 
and I look forward to meeting with my local Legionnaires later today.
