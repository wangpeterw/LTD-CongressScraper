                    RENEW VITAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, healthcare in rural America faces many 
challenges and many difficulties.
  This month, there are a couple of issues we will be facing. On 
September 30, we have the expiration of a program for community health 
centers and teaching health centers, which both aid greatly in rural 
healthcare, where it is difficult to get doctors and others to locate 
to those areas.
  On September 30, if Congress doesn't act, we will have to at least 
get an extension in place to keep those programs alive. Community 
health centers are often a lifeline to rural residents in areas lacking 
major hospitals. Teaching health centers, in particular, help train 
physicians in underserved areas and have been a great tool to address 
doctor shortages in rural America.
  Mr. Speaker, we have much to do. We need to reauthorize these 
programs before the end of the month or, at the very least, have an 
extension so that we don't put an even greater burden on rural America 
and its health challenges.
