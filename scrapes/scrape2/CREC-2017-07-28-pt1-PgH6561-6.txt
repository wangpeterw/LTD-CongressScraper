                     HONORING RABBI AVROHOM HOFFMAN

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I take great pleasure in sharing this 
story of Rabbi Avrohom Hoffman, a truly remarkable man whose presence 
has illuminated our community for decades.
  Rabbi Hoffman has called Washington Heights his home for more than 35 
years, fathering nine children with his wonderful wife, Miriam. He has 
served our community by teaching precollege students at a yeshiva and 
by providing spiritual guidance to those in great need.
  I am honored to have such an exceptional individual in my district. I 
was recently informed that Rabbi Hoffman has donated his kidney to a 
62-year-old woman diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease. His 
boundless acts of philanthropy serve as a testament to his tremendous 
character and remind us of the power of human kindness.
  He serves as a role model to all of us, and I am proud to have 
recognized a man of such compassion and virtue on this floor.
