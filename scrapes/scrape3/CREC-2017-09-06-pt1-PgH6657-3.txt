                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear Lord, thank You for giving us another day.
  These are energized days when Americans are being challenged to 
consider who we are as a people. Please bless all our citizens--and 
those who would be citizens--with generosity and discernment, that the 
national discourse would be a wonder for the world to see, and not a 
time of ever-widening divisions.
  For the Members of this people's House, we ask a surfeit of wisdom 
and patience that they might work together, and through the differences 
that are all too familiar to a new vision of those qualities that might 
bring us together as one people.
  Finally, we ask Your blessing of the people of Texas, Puerto Rico, 
the Virgin Islands, California, Oregon, Washington, and Montana, all 
who suffer the ravages of extreme natural disasters. Comfort them, and 
strengthen those who labor to bring relief to their hardships.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
