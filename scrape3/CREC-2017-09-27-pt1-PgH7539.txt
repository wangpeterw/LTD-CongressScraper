                 URGE PASSAGE OF THE DREAM ACT OF 2017

  (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with the DREAMers, and 
I urge the passage of H.R. 3440, the Dream Act of 2017.
  I know what it is like to leave your country of birth as a child 
through no choice of your own, and I know that those kids have grown up 
to become just as American as each and every one of us here.
  Despite what their immigration status might say, this is their 
country; this is their home. We cannot stand by and allow their lives 
and well-being to be put in jeopardy. The country is on their side. 
Don't let petty politics get in the way of good policy.
  The DREAMers are courageous young men and women who came forward to 
register in the DACA program, and now they are more vulnerable than 
ever. Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues to support H.R. 
3440. The clock is ticking. We must act to protect the DREAMers.
