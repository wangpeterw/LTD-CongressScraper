               WHAT WE DIDN'T DO FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what we did not do 
today for the American people's enhancement.
  What we did not do today is provide for enlisted men and women. We 
need to increase compensation for their families who are on food 
stamps. We did nothing for them today.
  We did nothing for Rose Escobar and her husband. Her husband was 
departed to El Salvador, a place where he has never been. They have two 
children and live in Houston, Texas. We have been pleading for his case 
to be reviewed. He is a DREAMer. He is DACA-eligible. He was managing a 
paint store. He was buying a house. We did nothing for him today.
  Who else did we not do anything for?
  The millions of people who use community health clinics and whose 
funding will expire. For 25 years, Central Care has been the facility 
that has served African Americans, Hispanics, and others for fee-for-
service and Medicaid. We did absolutely nothing for them.
  So we should not be afraid of stopping this government, if we have to 
do it, because we need to do something for the DREAMers. We need to do 
something for people who don't have healthcare and have to use 
federally qualified health centers.
  My God, we need to do something for the enlisted men and women whose 
families are on food stamps and whose salaries are not commensurate 
with the sacrifice they make.
  I am standing, Mr. Speaker, with each and every one of them.
