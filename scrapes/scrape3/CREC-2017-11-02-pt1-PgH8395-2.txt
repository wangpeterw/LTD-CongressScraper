                             INDIANA DUNES

  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the recent 
passage of H.R. 1488, the Indiana Dunes National Park Act, which passed 
the House unanimously yesterday.
  This bill renames the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore as the Indiana 
Dunes National Park, creating the first national park in Indiana and 
the 60th in the country.
  The Indiana Dunes are a treasured source of natural beauty where 
Hoosiers and their families can enjoy countless recreational 
activities. It is a diverse landscape consisting of dunes, oak 
savannas, swamps, bogs, marshes, prairies, rivers, and forests, 
creating one of the most biologically diverse areas in the country. The 
park contains over 2,000 unique animal and plant species.
  Making the Dunes National Lakeshore Indiana's first national park 
will draw the attention of more Americans from around the country and 
give them an opportunity to enjoy one of the most beautiful places in 
our land.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to this bipartisan bill being quickly 
passed by the Senate and signed into law by the President.
