        CAREER AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS ARE A PATHWAY TO SUCCESS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, I had the 
privilege of visiting Central Mountain High School's Career and 
Technology Education Center. It is a state-of-the-art 235,000-square-
foot academic career technical education complex.
  The Keystone Central School District has introduced and implemented a 
CTE curriculum that offers a totally integrated academic, career, and 
technical education for all 9th through 12th graders.
  The integration model allows all students to explore and attain high 
academic and technical skills in their chosen profession. This system 
is designed to provide all students with an educational exploration 
opportunity that is both rigorous and relevant for career and post-
secondary success.
  Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus 
and author of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 
21st Century Act, I am thrilled to see this kind of educational complex 
in my community.
  Offering CTE programs to students in high school truly gives them an 
opportunity to explore career options. There is an enormous skills gap 
that exists today in America. There are good-paying, family-sustaining 
jobs out there,

but people need the right skills to obtain those jobs. CTE programs are 
the pathway to success.
