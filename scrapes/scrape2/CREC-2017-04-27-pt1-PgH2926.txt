                    DISTRICT SCHOOL ACCOMPLISHMENTS

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
talent and hard work of the youth in New Jersey's 12th District.
  This past weekend, a group of East Brunswick High School students 
were recognized as the best team from the Northeast in the We the 
People competition. Competing against more than 1,200 students, this 
team demonstrated knowledge of constitutional principles in both 
historical and contemporary contexts.
  This weekend, students from John Witherspoon Middle School of 
Princeton and West Windsor-Plainsboro South High School will come to 
Washington to compete in the final round of the 2017 National Science 
Bowl.
  To all of these students: The guidance of your teachers, Alan 
Brodman, Bill Merritt, and Sunila Sharma, and your hard work is 
evident, and New Jersey's 12th District is very proud of you.
  It is an honor to represent a district that continues to emphasize 
the importance of STEM and civic education, and encourage our Nation's 
youth to thrive.
