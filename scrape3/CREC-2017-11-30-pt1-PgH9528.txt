                 RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JERLINE HARVEY

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of my 
friend, Jerline Harvey of Forest Hill, Texas.
  Since making Forest Hill her home in 1975, Jerline was a true 
champion for the improvement of the city. Among her many 
accomplishments, she was the first Black female elected to the Forest 
Hill City Council. She played a critical role in establishing the first 
library in Forest Hill, serving as its first librarian and also on the 
board of directors.
  During her tenure serving on the board, Jerline coordinated the 
purchase of over five acres of land for the library district, and 
dedicated the Forest Hill Community Garden in 2011.
  Jerline also made a mark in the community by operating and serving as 
the community outreach coordinator for the food bank at the Love 
Sanctuary Church of God in Christ for 15 years.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honor of her life. While the 
community will be sad that we are losing Jerline, I know that she is 
probably happy right now with Coach Harvey in Heaven.
  I want to thank her for being the driving voice to help get that 
library created. When I see those kids on the computers in the library 
reading those books and having a good time, I think of Jerline and her 
vision of Forest Hill having their own library.
