           REJECT TAX PLAN FOR BILLIONAIRES AND CORPORATIONS

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in total opposition to the Republicans' 
rigged tax plan for billionaires and corporations.
  Despite having one of the largest economies in the world, one in five 
Californians live in poverty. Yet Republicans in Congress are pursuing 
one priority: tax breaks for billionaires and corporations.
  Their tax package is Robin Hood in reverse: it steals from the poor 
and gives to the rich. And it will decimate Medicare. It will cripple 
many essential programs like the child tax credit and the earned income 
tax credit.
  This billionaires-first plan will devastate many States, including my 
home State of California. California will suffer tremendously. The 
earned income tax credit and child tax credit really has saved more 
than 1 million Californians from falling below the poverty line. 
Undermining the earned income tax credit and child tax credit would 
push millions of Californians even deeper into poverty.
  Americans should not be forced to pay more than their fair share in 
order to give tax breaks to the ultrarich. Any tax plan that pushes 
even one more American deeper into poverty and forces middle-income 
people to pay more should not even be on the table.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to reject this plan that lavishes tax breaks on 
President Trump, his billionaire buddies, and giant multinational 
corporations.
