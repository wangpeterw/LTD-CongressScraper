1212,topic-id,224,"Mr.Speaker, here are the facts: the Affordable Care Act covered over 20 million The House Republicans' bill will strip 24 million people of their health care.  I have received thousands of calls, emails, and social media messages regarding this topic from constituents opposing a repeal and sharing their stories of how the Affordable Care Act has helped them and how terrified they are of losing their coverage. I would like to share just one of those stories.  Daria from Redlands wrote to me about how Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is called a lifeline in her[[Page H2174]]family. Daria, who suffers from a debilitating and rare disease, closed her letter by saying: ``There are tens of millions more like me. American citizens, Moms and dads. Working hard, struggling with illness. Loving our families through hardship and disease. All of us--these tens of millions of American families, would be absolutely devastated by the loss of our insurance coverage.''  Mr.Speaker, what would you say to Daria about your plan that would cut Medicaid and raise the cost of insurance on families like hers while giving tax breaks to the uberwealthy?  Instead of working with Democrats to improve the bill, Republicans drafted it in secret, rushed it through committee in the dead of night, and are now ramming it through This plan is bad for the middle class.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-17-pt1-PgH2173-5.txt,2229,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,17.0,March

Mr.Speaker, today I rise in support of H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness  Since 2008, the number of small businesses offering health insurance to its employees has dwindled nearly 36 percent. The culprit? Well,  You know, the American people deserve choice. I have lived this reality. I owned and operated a small business for over 40 years back home in I know how ObamaCare premium increases hurt and, in some cases, affect a business' ability to provide health care for its employees.  I believe the greatest gift God gave me as a small-business owner was the ability to give others a good job along with the dignity and respect they deserve to provide for their family, their community, their church, and, yes, this  All hardworking American small-business owners should be able to give their employees these same opportunities. For this reason, I am a strong supporter of the Small Business Health Fairness Act legislation, which would allow small businesses to band together and purchase health care for workers and their families at a lower cost.  Folks, this is innovation. This is what the small business community does. Small businesses are the backbone of I will fight for their strength and their survival.

910,topic-id,1105,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We know earthquakes pose one of the greatest natural hazards here in the United They strike without warning and result in potentially catastrophic casualties and damage to buildings and infrastructure.  The Pacific Northwest is at risk of severe earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. According to the experts, a massive earthquake is coming to the area. We just don't know when. Six years ago this month, a 9.0 earthquake in Japan created a tsunami that killed over 15,000 people and caused a nuclear disaster.  Earthquakes cannot be prevented, but their impacts on life, property, and the economy can be managed. FEMA is responsible for coordinating the Federal response to a catastrophic earthquake, and has been diligently working to help States plan and prepare for an earthquake. Good planning and preparedness can save lives and property.  H.654, the Pacific Northwest Earthquake Preparedness Act of 2017, directs FEMA to plan the development of an earthquake early warning system for the Cascadia Subduction The bill also directs the President to establish an earthquake and tsunami task force to develop a comprehensive strategy and recommendations on how to prepare and plan for seismic events.  I want to commend the ranking member for his leadership on this critical national issue. He has been an advocate for his State and the Pacific Northwest, supporting preparedness and mitigation efforts and the development of a public West Coast earthquake early warning system.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Bill Shuster,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Mr.Chairman: I am writing concerning H.654, the      ``Pacific Northwest Earthquake Preparedness Act of 2017,''      which was reported by your Committee on March 9, 2017.       H.654 contains provisions within the Committee on      Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. In      order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the      Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego      action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our      mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or      alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,      and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,      or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject      matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.       I would request that, in any final version of the      legislation, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology      be included as a recipient of the reports called for in      Sections 2 and 3 of the bill.       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming      this understanding, and would request that you include a copy      of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record      during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in      advance for your cooperation.

Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.654, the Pacific Northwest Earthquake Preparedness Act      of 2017. I appreciate your willingness to expedite      consideration of this legislation before the House of      Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the      Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will not seek to      litigate its claim of jurisdictional interest in this bill.       The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure concurs      with the mutual understanding that by foregoing the      litigation of its claim of jurisdictional interest in the      bill at this time, the Committee on Science, Space, and      Technology does not waive any claim to jurisdiction over the      subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation      in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill      become necessary, I would work with the Committee on Science,      Space, and Technology to litigate its jurisdictional claim      and, if such a claim is established by the Parliamentarians,      support your request to be represented on the conference      committee.       I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional      Record during consideration on the House floor. I look      forward to working with the Committee on Science, Space, and      Technology as the bill moves through the legislative process.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Shuster,                                                          Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the chairman for his kind words for the work I have been doing for a number of years on this issue.  I traveled with the committee last year to Japan to see what lessons they learned from the horrible earthquake 6 years ago, in which more than 15,000 people perished. They did have in place a land-based and near-ocean early warning system, which gave them enough time to shut down the high-speed trains, get people out of elevators in buildings, shut down production lines, mitigating economic losses[[Page H2452]]and property damage. But, unfortunately, the system was not adequate to predict the height of the tsunami, and 15,000 people died.  They are now deploying a realtime deep ocean system. It is time for the United States to emulate that. The Cascadia Subduction Zone, off the coast of northern California and Oregon, has had at least a dozen massive earthquakes over the last 5,000 years. It is currently well overdue for an earthquake. If we had in place a deep ocean system near the southern end of that fault where they expect the major quake will start, it would give enough warning time for people on the coast of Oregon, and at least those a little further up the coast, to seek higher ground and not be inundated. It would provide more time in the valleys, and up in Portland and up in Seattle for transit systems to be shut down and people to take shelter. So this could save many lives.  This bill directs FEMA to develop a plan to identify the necessary funds and the potential costs to purchase the equipment for an earthquake early warning system. It is basically off-the-shelf technology.  It requires the President to establish an earthquake and tsunami task force. The task force will consist of representatives from potentially impacted areas, as well as earthquake and tsunami experts to develop comprehensive strategy recommendations on how the Nation should prepare for, mitigate against, respond to, recover from, and adapt to an earthquake, tsunami, or combined event in the Cascadia Subduction  I strongly recommend this bill to my colleagues. We should learn from the disaster in Japan and take action here to save lives and property in the event of this quake in the Cascadia Subduction  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

1098,topic-id,1622,"Mr.President, I am very honored to follow my distinguished colleague from Vermont on issues that he has worked so long and so hard and so well, and that is health care for our Nation and focusing on the fight for women's health, for access to affordable care for all Americans, and for a Cabinet truly free of conflict and corruption--a cause that we share in opposing Tom Price as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  What is so painfully apparent to him and me and many of our colleagues is that Representative Price's nomination is a doubling down of the ongoing blatant attack on women's health by his administration. His radical anti-choice policies, antiquated views on reproductive health, and demands to repeal the women's health provisions of the Affordable Care Act disqualify him from serving as the next Secretary of Health and Human  Before the ACA was signed into law, being a woman meant higher health care costs for simply being a woman. It is estimated that this discrimination cost them about $1 billion more every year. They had to pay higher costs simply because they were women.  Representative Price has been clarion clear about where he stands on this issue, with his policy effectively eliminating important protections against discrimination that were guaranteed under the Affordable Care Under Representative Price's reckless proposal, all women, including healthy women, could see their insurance costs rise--and rise astronomically. His plan also means guaranteed coverage of maternity care services could be lost. It means well-woman visits, birth control, domestic violence screening, and breastfeeding support--all provided now without any out-of-pocket costs--would be lost. The simple truth is, with Representative Price's policies, many women will go without necessary care.  More than a quarter of all women and 44 percent of low-income women already rely on publicly funded health clinics like Planned Parenthood for contraception. Without guaranteed access to birth control, without cost-sharing, this number will certainly climb.  It isn't hard to see why, despite the lonely opposition of Representative Price and the Republican Party, 70 percent of Americans support a birth control benefit. Representative Price callously asked to see one woman who couldn't afford birth control, one woman who was left behind. If he is confirmed and if the policies he vigorously supports are enacted, he will see millions without necessary health care and particularly birth control.  As many know, Representative Price's attempt to defund Planned Parenthood means more than just losing access to birth control; it means cutting off preventive care, cancer screenings, and STD testing for millions of low-income women. The women who get their care from Planned Parenthood seek what all of us want, what all of us should have a right to receive--trusted, compassionate, and medically sound health care. Representative Price's politically motivated tax on Planned Parenthood put this care, and their lives, at risk.  Clearly, Representative Price is one of the most extreme Members of his party on issues of women's health, and that includes his views on women's reproductive rights--a woman's right to choose. He has supported radical legislation that would ban virtually all safe abortions and even some forms of birth control, which, in essence, would send our country back to a time when women died because the care they needed was outlawed. It was made unlawful; it was banned. That time has gone. We do not want it to come again.  Simply put, Representative Price's anti-choice views are not only ill-informed and unconstitutional, but they are downright dangerous.  Representative Price has also shown remarkable indifference to the concerns of the millions who will see their health insurance disappear--vanish--following repeal of the Affordable Care Act, if that disgrace should occur. For millions, the Affordable Care Act has been the difference between seeing a doctor at the first signs of disease and waiting until treatment is no longer an option. It has been the difference between financial security and bankruptcy. Much of the bankruptcy in the United States of America has to do with medical costs.  For many, it has been the difference--no exaggeration--between life and death.  The numbers support this point, whether or not Representative Price wants to believe them. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the percentage of uninsured Americans is the lowest it has been in 50 years or more. The positive impact of this law is felt every single day in the State of It has reduced our uninsured rate by a massive 34 percent, resulting in 110,000 Connecticut residents gaining coverage. Many of my constituents have felt emphatic about--and have told me so--exactly how the Affordable Care Act has changed their lives and their family's lives for the better.  Representative Price refuses to guarantee that these families will be covered following repeal. So I hope he hears their stories and understands what the Affordable Care Act means to them and the millions of other Americans whom he chooses not to see, not to hear, not to know exist.  Representative Price refuses to guarantee that these families will be covered. For example, I point to a woman in Connecticut named Colleen who told me that before the ACA was passed, her medications alone cost $250,000 each year. That is a quarter of a million dollars. Thanks to this law, she has affordable care, no lifetime limits, and knows she will not be a victim of discrimination or denied coverage of her preexisting condition. Colleen said the Affordable Care Act has been the difference for her between life and death.  I have also heard from a father whose daughter has a chronic illness. He asked that I emphasize to all of you, my colleagues, that health insurance is ``not a luxury, but a necessity'' for his family. His daughter represents one of the 1.5 million people in Connecticut who are now protected from discrimination based on preexisting conditions, thanks to the Affordable Care  I have heard from a retired pastor who counts on the Affordable Care Act for coverage, a farmer who fears for his family's health after repeal, a young woman who was able to start her own business because of the assurances promised by health reform, and a veteran who is scared for his wife.  Representative Price cannot promise that these people will keep their coverage, and he has said that outlawing discrimination because of preexisting conditions is ``a terrible idea.'' He thinks it is a terrible idea to outlaw preexisting conditions. I saw the effects of preexisting conditions year after year when I was attorney general, and I went to bat and fought for people who were denied health care because their insurance companies told them that health care isn't to take care of a preexisting condition not covered by their policy. His proposals do not expand access to affordable care, and they do not protect patients.  Representative Price's nomination is wrong for the people of Connecticut and for the people of this  Representative Price's plans would also do away with the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, disrupting the lives and health of nearly 15 million This would leave so many people without access to preventive care, lifesaving medications, and necessary medical interventions. This is simply unacceptable and cannot be the policies of the[[Page S1044]]Secretary of Health and Human  In fact, instead of expansion, Representative Price wants to block-grant Medicaid and cap the program, resulting in higher costs, less coverage, and devastation for millions of Americans, half of them children who rely on this program.  In Connecticut, we have been hit hard by the opioid addiction epidemic. It is a national scourge, a public health crisis, and we have relied heavily on Medicaid to fill the gaps. At a time when this epidemic needs more resources, not less, Representative Price would work to strip that away, leaving people who rely on Medicaid without treatment.  His plan for our Nation's seniors is just as dismal. He champions privatizing Medicare by turning it into a voucher system and ending the promise of guaranteed health benefits.  Giving seniors a fixed amount of funds to buy health insurance would result in high premiums, increased out-of-pocket costs for seniors, many of them already on a fixed income. And for many Americans, Representative Price may mean the difference between being able to purchase lifesaving medications and putting food on the table or heating their homes.  Finally, like many of my colleagues--and Senator Sanders made this point so well--I have serious concerns over Representative Price's potential conflicts of interest. Having repeatedly purchased stock in health care and pharmaceutical companies that would directly benefit from his legislative efforts and advocacy on the company's behalf, he nonetheless made those investments and kept them.  In the face of these allegations, Representative Price has simply refused to provide information that could disprove violations, which has led many Americans to question whether Representative Price will truly put their best interests before crony capitalism.  The American people know better. These potential conflicts of interest and views on the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and Medicare are out of touch and out of line with what Americans want and our Nation needs. We should be building on the success of these programs, not tearing them down, and we should be working with one another to improve the health of all Americans, not fostering divisions. Sadly, Representative Price's views and policies make this very attainable goal really impossible. Simply put, his proposals are dangerous, they are disgraceful, and they are disqualifying.  I cannot vote for Representative Price to lead the Department of Health and Human I will oppose his nomination and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

Roughly one-quarter of these borrowers are behind on their payments either in delinquency or default. The Federal Government has a responsibility to protect these borrowers and American taxpayers from unscrupulous institutions that saddle students with exorbitant debt in exchange for an education of dubious value.  Hardworking students, like those who attended Corinthian Colleges or ITT Tech, could be harmed if Congress passes a law that potentially strips them of a clear process for having their debt forgiven after institutions fabricate job placement figures or close unexpectedly.  This bill could allow institutions like Corinthian Colleges to require pre-dispute arbitration clauses, and prohibit class-action lawsuits--making it much less likely that students will get the justice they deserve when a school misrepresents the quality of its programs.  Millions of borrowers who rely on popular income-driven repayment plans could be left without options for keeping their payments affordable.  Active-Duty servicemembers could lose access to deferment benefits.  Rules banning incentive pay could be undone, exposing student veterans and others to aggressive marketing.  This bill could weaken Federal protections for millions of student loan borrowers when, instead, Congress should be working together to make college more affordable.

1225,topic-id,301,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment to exempt rules related to title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act from the misguided provisions of the SCRUB  Title I is the core feature of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a critical civil rights law that holds States accountable for helping all students succeed.  The SCRUB Act threatens rules for implementing title I, which, in turn, threatens students. For example, title I rules clarify important accountability requirements that we passed into law just last session with strong bipartisan support.  Clear rulemaking is necessary to give education leaders certainty so they can benefit from the law's new flexibility and innovate on behalf of students.  Title I rules also include important details about the use of assessments in schools. These rules were negotiated with broad consensus. Would the SCRUB Act repeal them and deny States clarification about reducing the burden of testing?  My colleagues across the aisle may argue that no rule should be exempt from the SCRUB Act and that somehow the unelected commission in the bill will identify only bad rules. I am not so sure. The commission in the bill could create any methodology for targeting rules and, without knowing the commission's method, it is disingenuous to say that essential rules, good rules, wouldn't be affected.  Additionally, rules are rarely black and white as the majority suggests. Title I accountability rules, for example, sometimes push States to report on how they are serving each subgroup of students. But where some local officials may complain, these rules make sure that low-income and minority families are being counted.  Will the commission hear the concerns of those families?

1099,topic-id,6564,"Mr.President, we have had a lot of long nights here, and I just want to take a moment again to really give my gratitude to the staff. A lot of folks go into making the Senate work. We can see a lot of them down here. I can't imagine the days that they have been pulling, as we have been pulling long nights. Many of them get here early in the morning and they go a long way. So I want to thank them, from the stenographers to many of the Senate staff who make it work.  I also want to thank the pages again. These are young folks who have to carry a full load of classes and course work--hard stuff. I don't understand why they haven't come to me to help them with their calculus homework. But the reality is they are working a full class load of courses as well as being here with us around the clock. They probably aren't caught by cameras. They aren't even getting C-SPAN glory. But your presence here really means a lot, and I am grateful for that as well.  I rise specifically to speak about the President's nomination of Congressman Price to be his Secretary of Health and Human  I want to take a step back and talk about the profound history that the United States of America has in terms of our bringing together the resources of this country to combat public health crises. We have a country where every generation has been able to step up and take on things that threaten the common health.  There was a time in this Nation when we had actual child death rates that were tragically high, and that for an industrializing nation, our water, the quality of our milk, women dying in child birth, and children dying was a common thing. But we had this bold understanding that in America, a Nation that believes in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, the common health is important. And we took steps that, frankly, in a booming industrial economy, the private sector couldn't do. We took steps to protect the public health, and we made great strides.  It was a Republican President, actually, in 1953, Dwight Eisenhower, who actually created what was then a version of what is now the Department of Health and Human Specifically, it was called the Department of Health, Education, and  Now, the very first Secretary was a woman, and her name was Colonel Oveta She had served as the director of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps during the Second World She was, in my just great reverence, someone who served and fought for health and safety and security during World War  As Secretary, Secretary Hobby had an expansive and expanding role. It was a demanding role. She was coordinating the distribution of polio vaccine, overseeing countrywide hospital expansions, overseeing Social Security and the Federal education policy. She had a huge role, one that was so full that one newspaper joked that ``when she [actually] learns her job, Oveta Hobby may trim her week to just 70 hours.'' This was someone who went out there as an agent of the government to lift up the welfare of all of our citizenry, the health and well-being of everyone, again pushing toward those ideals.  In the United States, we really do believe in this idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, freedom from deprivation, freedom from illness, the belief that we can have life and have it more abundantly. To Secretary Hobby, this was her duty to her country--someone, again, who served valiantly in World War  In the collection of papers from Secretary Hobby's lifetime, Rice University includes that she was a great humanitarian and that she believed there was a role--a ``common thread,'' to use her words--to service to her country toward the empowerment of health for all. She set a standard, a powerful standard, as the first Secretary of Health for the greater good that we, acting collectively, could do to ensure the health and well-being of our  In fact, it was an understanding from President Dwight Eisenhower all the way down to Secretary Hobby that if we ensure people's health and access to health care, it is not just an individual concern, but actually, societally, we become better and we become stronger. The healthier all children are, the more likely they are to go out there and compete. If you are battling sickness, it undermines your economic well-being. In the world of infectious diseases, the words of Martin Luther King are true: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere; in fact, an illness somewhere is the threat of an illness to people everywhere. This was the brilliance of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, and it is how this great Department began, setting the standard, understanding that in many ways we are all in this together when it comes to our health.  So for me, this is another point in history. It is a challenge to us as to who we will be as a Will we continue to be a country that believes, as a fundamental birthright in the richest Nation on the Planet Earth, that everyone can access the highest quality health care, the best access to quality doctors with wide avenues to pursue the rich abundance of life because we have the best health care system on the Planet Earth?  I actually was happy to hear President Trump on the campaign trail talk specifically about this issue, tell us we were going to have a health care system better than the one we have now, specifically calling it ObamaCare; that we were going to have one that is amazing, one that is going to be covering more people. I think the word that was used was ``terrific''; it was going to be terrific. He specifically spoke about some of the bedrock elements of our current health care system that Republicans and Democrats[[Page S1045]]both agree are things we want to preserve, protect, and in fact make better. He specifically talked about Medicare and Medicaid, defending them: They wouldn't be taken away; they wouldn't be undermined; people wouldn't be kicked off.  So with this excitement, hearing that we have a President committed to these ideals, creating a terrific health care system, we stand on this history in our country where we know our greatness, and it is an affront if we don't have a system that takes care of our most valuable natural resources: the people of this country and a global, knowledge-based economy. What helps us compete is the quality of our workforce.  I am telling you right now, I have learned in my professional life that when children are sick, they don't learn; when a mother is sick, it throws the whole family into crisis; if someone can't afford their medication, it is not just a sin to this country's values, it is a sin morally.  So when President Trump nominated his person to be Health and Human Services Secretary, we might imagine they would reflect the values that he espoused during his campaign and reflect the values he has talked about as But instead, he has chosen someone who is diametrically opposed to the things he says he is for--preservation of More than this, he has advocated a view on health care that unequivocally would take millions of Americans off of health coverage, thrust millions of Americans into economic crisis, and put the health of many millions of Americans in jeopardy. Usually people say these things hyperbolically, but this is quite clearly a matter of life or death.  For years, Congressman Price has told us who he is. He has led the charge in the House of Representatives to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take coverage away from millions of Americans while advocating specifically for the privatization of Medicare and the gutting of For years, Congressman Price has advocated for anti-choice, anti-contraception access, anti-commonsense measures, and supported efforts to defund and eliminate proven programs like title X family planning, programs like Planned Parenthood which, through their Medicare reimbursements, often in many communities is the only access women have in their communities for cancer screenings or to get contraception.  Congressman Price has been one of the loudest voices on tearing down many of the things that now Americans overwhelmingly say ``Hey, now that we've got this, we don't want to lose it,'' whether that is not having insurance companies dictating to you whether you get health insurance or not having pharmaceutical companies ratchet up prices so much that your lifesaving drugs are out of reach.  Then finally, at a time when we cannot afford to have people who have conflicts, we have a Congressman right now for whom other House Members are calling for ethics investigations because his personal financial interests clearly have been in conflict. In fact, he seems to be building a career as a Congressman working on health policy on one hand while building a fortune trading health stocks directly related to that work. This is a man who is so conflicted, a man who is so contrary to what our President says he believes, a man who has been leading the charge to take our health care back in an affront to the ideals that literally stem from the founding history of our Department of I cannot support this individual.  But let me quickly go through some of these things. We now have to have an honest conversation in our country about this idea of repealing the Affordable Care Act without replacing it because objective organizations like the Congressional Budget Office, conservative organizations like the American Enterprise Institute, and fellow Republican Senators of mine have acknowledged that to repeal the Affordable Care Act would throw into crisis millions of hard-working Americans who have been able to get coverage because of the health insurance marketplace and the Medicaid expansion. Millions of Americans can now go to a doctor when they feel sick instead of going to an emergency room. By the way, as a local mayor--when people use emergency rooms as their primary care facility, it is extraordinarily more expensive; it is fiscally irresponsible.  Because of the ACA, millions more Americans can now access basic health and preventive services that can lead to lifesaving opportunities that did not exist before. Millions more Americans have the peace of mind of knowing that they are no longer one illness away from financial ruin.  Let me put up a chart for a second about the history of people having insurance.  This is the percentage of uninsured in the United States--going along, about 18 million uninsured. And then what happens? The uninsured rate has been driven down. Enrollment in the individual market continues to rise but has now decreased since 2014.  In late December 2016, Standard & Poor's--hardly a Democratic organization, but a market-based organization--released an incredibly optimistic report for the future of the individual market in the Affordable Care But Congressman Price, on the other hand, has repeatedly introduced legislation and resolutions to repeal critical elements or the entirety of the law responsible for these successes without any regard for consequences. He has done this again and again and again and again, eight times. He authored a bill last year that would repeal critical parts, like the Medicaid expansion provision that has expanded access to care for millions, tax credits that would help millions buy insurance. And Congressman Price has introduced legislation that would fully repeal the Affordable Care  I want to let you all understand that, to me, this is a point in our American history where this isn't arguing over opinion; these are facts about what Congressman Price has done. If he were successful in any of those eight attempts to rip down the Affordable Care Act, we now know objectively from organizations like the independent Congressional Budget Office that it would mean 18 million people losing their health insurance in the first year alone, 32 million of our fellow Americans by 2026. Objectively, there would be increases in premiums in the market by 20 to 25 percent; 4.4 million of those Americans who would lose coverage would be children; and 11 million of the most vulnerable would lose their Medicaid coverage.  There is a man named Andy Slavitt who is a former Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid--again, what our President says he wants to preserve. He put together a list because so many people were calling him, writing him: What are going to be the consequences if they repeal the Affordable Care Act without replacing it? What are the consequences? And he just went through a list: Small businesses, farms, self-employed Americans represent 20 percent of the coverage of the exchange. These are individual entrepreneurs, many of whom, by the way, experience something called job lock, where they are afraid to become entrepreneurs because if they lose their jobs, they lose health insurance. Twenty percent are covered by the exchange, and 127 million Americans--127 million Americans--have preexisting conditions. They would be put at jeopardy, and insurance companies would be able to deny them coverage.  Seniors, Medicare beneficiaries, have saved $2,000 on prescription drugs because of the ACA--$2,000; 30 million Americans are on individual policies and Medicaid; 2.8 million Americans with drug disorders would lose coverage; 1.25 million Americans with mental health disorders would lose coverage--1.25 million Americans with mental health disorders. In other words, the ACA put mental health care on parity with physical health care. A 42-percent reduction in uninsured rates for veterans has resulted. He said that bad debt--bad debt, bankruptcy--would go up by $1.1 trillion because health care bills would again be the lead cause in this country of bankruptcy. In other words, before the ACA, the 1 reason people were declaring bankruptcy was because of medical bills. After the ACA, that can't happen. There are steps to prevent that from happening, at least to the extent of $1.1 trillion.  The Medicare trust fund, which has been extended, will have several years reduced off its life expectancy. Taxpayers will lose $350 billion added to the deficit and $9 trillion would be added to the debt if it is repealed--2.6 million jobs lost, especially in communities like rural hospitals, where they[[Page S1046]]depend upon the ACA to keep doors open and hospitals running. Anyone who likes free preventive services like mammograms and better cancer treatment, preventive services that literally save lives by early detection, gone.  Young adults, 3.1 million right now on their parent's plan because of extending the years. Women who want to buy health insurance will pay more than men in premiums because, amazingly, at times insurance companies would be charging you more simply because of your gender and 105 million people had lifetime limits on what insurance companies pay.  This is a list from one of the great experts who knows factually what would happen if we were to turn back the clock. Let me drill down a little bit more. As head of Health and Human Services, Congressman Price would be responsible for insuring the continuance of  Americans like Kelley from New Jersey are able to access care right now because of the Medicaid expansions under the I want to read what she said. She said:       Thank you for supporting the I hope that you will      continue to fight hard for it. It's the ACA and Medicaid that      allow me to be able to seek medical treatments for my      scoliosis (which causes me to suffer from chronic pain) and      ensure that my newborn receives appropriate medical care when      need be.       I work full time and go to college but I still struggle to      pay the bills, as I'm only 18 and fast food doesn't pay much      even at 35 to 40 hours a week.  Here is someone going to college, raising a child, working full time, and relying on the ACA so she can inch toward her American dream, being a college graduate, getting a better paying job.  She concludes by saying:       I want my baby to have the health care she deserves so she      can be happy and healthy.  The Medicaid expansion under the ACA has extended access for millions in our country, millions of hard-working people like Kelly and their children, like her baby, across the country.  In New Jersey alone, hundreds of thousands of people gained coverage. Uncompensated costs were driven down, and my State saved a billion dollars, all because of Medicaid expansion.  Republican Governor of New Jersey: Medicaid expansion was the right fiscal decision for our State and for our communities' families who live in our  In Price's efforts to undo ACA Medicaid expansion, he has indicated people like Kelly and her newborn baby are not a priority.  I know for a fact that hard-working people across the country and in my community will suffer if Price is able to do what he intends to do and has tried to do.  Let me go to another issue; that is, How about Medicare? As Secretary Price, he will be responsible for overseeing Medicare, the health care program that services 57 million American seniors and those with disabilities.  Under the Affordable Care Act, we know that the quality of Medicare coverage has improved. The life of the Medicare trust fund has been extended, and we have begun to close the gap in prescription drug coverage that too many seniors and people with disabilities--they know about this. It is known as a doughnut hole. There is more work to do to strengthen Medicare and to make prescription drugs more affordable for everyone, including our seniors.  The changes we have done already have had real positive impacts on the daily lives of Let me read another letter from Myra in Willingboro, She wrote to tell me about the difference that Medicare is having for her family as they live with chronic illness. She said:       As your constituent and an advocate of affordable,      accessible health insurance, I would like to share how      adjustments to the health care system could impact me. As you      consider policy changes, I urge you to think about how your      constituents living with chronic conditions will be affected.       It is so important to my husband who lives with Parkinson's      disease and myself who is being treated for Chronic Lymphatic      Leukemia that our Medicare benefits continue without any cuts      in benefits. It is most important that we continue to be able      to visit doctors able to care for our specific needs and have      the expensive medications covered that are needed as we live      with these diseases.       As a support group leader for people living with      Parkinson's disease--  I pause here to say, my father suffered for years with Parkinson's, died from Parkinson's. The support groups are essential, and the medical challenges that this chronic disease brings are great.  I continue with her letter.       As a support group leader for people living with      Parkinson's disease and their caregivers, I know all the      members would echo my requests. Many people actually need      further assistance to purchase the needed drugs as their      policies do not cover them adequately presently. Often the      medication prices are prohibitive for folks. They have to      constantly check to see which drug plan will allow their      medication at an affordable price.       In addition, specific supports for caregivers is another      very important need for the Parkinson disease population.      Please consider assistance for these people who require      assistance throughout the day.  Let me tell you, this is a person writing to say keep what we have and make it better because it is still not enough to meet the challenges. Instead, we are considering making someone the Secretary of Health and Human Services who doesn't want to improve, build upon, get better but wants to throw out.  Take Tom, who believes that for his family, their lifeline to health care access is an intrusion. This is Tom Price--excuse me, who believes that this is an intrusion. He writes: ``I can attest that nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.''  I want to put these words up. This is what the nominee to Health and Human Services is saying about one of the most valued parts of our health care in He is saying: ``I can attest that nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.''  I would like to tell you that is an insult to Myra and her husband, millions of American seniors, those on disabilities who rely on what he calls an intrusion. Someone who is calling for an end to a program that millions of Americans rely on, that the President himself swore that he would do nothing to disturb, we are now putting the chief architect of the destruction of Medicare from the House into a position where they can wreak havoc on the health care of millions.  I want to go into that area of preexisting conditions. Imagine yourself as someone who has a child with diabetes or that you are a survivor of cancer and an insurance company can now look at you and say: I am sorry. I am not going to cover you. The people driven by the market, driven by profits, driven by the bottom line are going to look at you and your humanity and simply say: Sorry, I am not going to cover you. And you live in that place in America, that dark, painful place where you know you are one illness away from destitution.  This is what Maureen wrote to me recently. She said:       Please do not repeal the Affordable Care My 18-year-     old son has been fighting cancer for over a year. I am scared      to death of what his future will hold without the protections      of the He may be subject to a lifetime cap on insurance      payments or be rejected for health insurance entirely on the      basis of a preexisting condition.

After fighting cancer as a teen, it scares and      upsets me to think that his battles will continue throughout      his life in the form of financial hardships from the loss of      protections he currently has through the  She ends saying:       Please consider my family when voting on the  Please consider my family. There are millions of Americans who now are living in this state of fear, looking at the rising and the ascendancy of Congressman Price to a position--someone who has tried again and again to end insurance for people with preexisting conditions.  I don't understand what we are trying to achieve with putting someone who believes that somehow the free market will take care of these folks. I began with our history as a country: booming industrial economy. The free market didn't take care of ensuring that our waters and rivers were cleaned up. The free market didn't take care of eradicating polio. We are a nation that has learned from our history that we have a responsibility to each other, and in our common civic space and in the[[Page S1047]]governments that are established amongst men and women, we have to do better for folks who are victims or vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the free market.  That is why we are stepping up to say that we can create a system that serves all. We are the richest country on the planet What even makes this worse than Medicaid under assault, Medicare under assault, people with preexisting conditions, which are issues that are simply around contraception.  Congressman Price would be expected to uphold protections currently in place that prohibit insurance companies from charging women more because of their gender and ensuring that insurance companies abide by the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive care.  All that talk about preexisting conditions, many insurance companies saw gender as a preexisting condition. As something as critical as having access to contraception, Tom Price has voted time and time again to restrict access to essential health care services and limit reproductive rights.  Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, cost was a major barrier for women seeking access to birth control. Congressman Price has repeatedly opposed the provision requiring insurance plans to cover contraception. This is what he said in an interview in 2012:       Obviously one of the main sticking points is whether      contraception coverage is going to be covered under health      insurance plans and at hospitals, and whether or not they're      going to be able to pay for it, especially low-income women,      where do we leave these women if this rule is rescinded?''  That is the question. Price's response was simple:       Bring me one woman who's been left behind. Bring me one.      There's not one.  I am sorry, in this case, Price is not right; Price is wrong. There is not just one you could bring. There are millions of women who were left behind and struggled with access to coverage before the Affordable Care For this man to stand there and cast a shadow over the basic commonsense understanding that when you allow women to make their reproductive health decisions and have access to contraception, you give them power over their lives and their destinies. You actually reduce unwanted pregnancies dramatically. This is an economic issue. This is an empowerment issue. This goes to the core freedoms as a country.  The Center for American Progress reported in 2012 that before the ACA contraceptive provision went into effect, that ``a recent study shows that women with private insurance paid about 50 percent of the total costs for oral contraceptives, even though the typical out-of-pocket cost of non-contraceptive drugs is only 33 percent. Surveys show that nearly one in four women with household incomes of less than $75,000 have put off a doctor's visit for birth control to save money in the past year.'' Because of the ACA's contraceptive provision, America has changed. According to the National Women's Law Center, 55 million women have saved $1.4 billion on birth control pills alone since 2013.  Listen to Rachel from West Orange, NJ, a couple towns over from where I live. She benefited from the contraception provision of the ACA as well as access to Planned This is what she wrote:       The Affordable Care Act is something that has made a huge      impact on my life. I come from a poor background, and there      is no additional money to spare on things like birth control,      which I take for my independence and legitimate medical      issues. Without birth control, I'm unable to get out of bed      for days at a time because of painful periods. This means      losing out time off work and opportunities because of a      serious medical malady.       I never thought I would be able to normalize my life      because I can't afford a $40 copay every month, in addition      to my expensive transportation passes, student loan payments,      and helping my parents pay their bills. However, with the      Affordable Care Act, I have access to free birth control that      allows me to live my life and succeed. It enables my      independence, and makes me a healthier individual. I am      terrified that any repeal of the Affordable Care Act will      harm my health, my career and my ability to lead a normal      life.  We want people to lead the life of their dreams--their health, their careers. What she is asking for is not a luxury. It actually benefits us all because we are empowering her to succeed. That makes this country greater. Yet Tom Price, this nominee, has voted 38 times on measures that would restrict women's access, including 10 times voting to defund Planned At a time when there are fewer unwanted pregnancies, when women have more power, more control over their lives, Tom Price wants to roll things back.  Struggling women are fighting to raise families and go to college and pay the bills and run businesses or be entrepreneurs, that they are having constrictions placed on their lives--you empower women, you empower this  In New Jersey, Planned Parenthood's 26 health centers provide access to lifesaving care for women across the socioeconomic spectrum. I will fight tooth and nail with all that I have for not rolling things back. We are not going back. And a Congressman who has pledged to do just that should not be the Secretary of Health and Human  Tom Price has spoken out against sex education. I am a believer. I said this when I was mayor, all the time. In God we trust--I am a man of faith--but everybody else, bring me data. Sex education is actually something that has a powerful economic benefit. When it comes to advocating for better health options and outcomes, we know this is not an idea or theory, but there is a connection between poor, incomplete, or absent sexual education and increasing rates of teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual assault. Young people are also disproportionately infected, without sex education, with HIV, and HIV rates among young adults are truly problematic in this country. Kids who are granted full information live healthier lives. But Congressman Price advocates against that. He thinks sex education doesn't reduce rates of teen pregnancies--it does; doesn't reduce rates of sexually transmitted diseases--it does; doesn't reduce rates of sexual assault--it does; doesn't reduce rates of HIV--it does. But he thinks that it promotes promiscuity among young people.  I want to end with my last point. All of this is enough, but this is the more astonishing part of my opposition because in this, I would at least think we could get my Republican colleagues to join with me because if you look at past Presidents, something less than this has sunk nominations before. This doesn't have to do with health policy; this has to do with conflicts of interest.  There was a great Senator who pulled himself out of consideration for what, compared to this, is a mild issue that he moved to correct on paying taxes on a benefit that he received. He pulled himself out of consideration. He had that kind of dignity to say: You know what, I have this small issue. I am pulling myself out of consideration.  But Tom Price is charging right ahead, while people in the House are calling for his investigation. Some of my colleagues have already addressed this, so I won't go into it much, but the SEC investigation should be there. An independent watchdog from the Office of Congressional Ethics should be there. We don't know because these organizations, the SEC and the Office of Congressional Ethics, don't announce when they are investigating somebody. But there are a whole bunch of people saying that Congressman Price has potentially violated something called the Stock Act, which was basically put in place so that Congresspeople, who know things about regulations or issues affecting companies, can't benefit off of that insider information to profit themselves. I don't understand why, at a time that this is all hanging over his head, that there should be an investigation, that we should get to the bottom of it before we put him in the President's Cabinet, Democrats and Republicans here, given past history and past nominees who had to withdraw, why aren't we joining in a bipartisan way and saying: Hey, there is a lot of smoke here, and the facts are kind of screaming for attention.  Let me just be clear. As an example, last March Congressman Price bought between $1,000 and $15,000 worth of shares in a company called Zimmer They are a medical manufacturer that specializes in hip and knee devices. House ethics disclosures show that he invested in the company just 6 days before introducing a bill that would have directly benefited hip and knee replacement companies like Zimmer Biomet, H.4848. Let's do this[[Page S1048]]again. He invests in a company 6 days before he introduces legislation that would have benefited such a company. That is astounding, to me, and it should raise alarms in terms of the codes of conduct of a potential Cabinet nominee. He invested in a medical manufacturer of hip and knee devices and shortly thereafter introduces a bill, the HIP  What is more, though, is while Congressman Price has said that he was unaware of the stock purchase because it was bought by a broker, his financial disclosure forms show that he initialed the purchase to note an error. He initialed the purchase. So to say he had no knowledge of it is a stretch.  Congressman Price then added nearly two dozen cosponsors to the bill over the next 3\1/2\ months. I am sorry, if a Senator here did that--knowingly buying stock, then introducing a bill--I know this body would look askance on that. More than that, I don't think you need to explain much of this because it is so obvious that American folks at home are knowing that you should not introduce legislation to self-deal to yourself.  Let me give another example. Price also bought stock in an obscure Australian biopharmaceutical firm called Innate Immunotherapeutics through a private offering that was not made available to the public. The private stock offering gave Congressman Price access to hundreds of thousands of discounted stock.  At his Senate confirmation hearing, he asserted the stocks were ``available to every single individual that was an investor at the time,'' but this is how the Wall Street Journal reported it--not quite a liberal periodical. It said:       In fact, the cabinet nominee was one of fewer than 20 U.     investors who were invited last year to buy discounted shares      of the company--an opportunity that, for Mr.Price, arose      from an invitation from a company director and a fellow            The shares were discounted at 12 percent off the traded      price in mid-June only for investors who participated in a      private placement arranged to raise money to complete a      clinical trial. The company's shares have since tripled      during the offering.  I am sure that Americans at home who are saving for their retirement would love to have an insider deal like this, would love to be clued in by company heads to an opportunity to triple their money, but clearly something is wrong when a Congressman is doing that. That should cause us to pause as a nation before we put him in as a Cabinet Secretary over all of our health care.  It is a disturbing pattern when Congresspeople use their position of power for personal gain with no regard for public interest. This type of behavior would be unacceptable in most industries. It should be unacceptable to Congress, to Senators on both sides of the aisle who have to advise and consent.  Look, we are at a point in our country where we have taken steps forward on health care. It has been controversial, I understand, but there is no arguing with the fact that we are now at a point in America where someone with a preexisting condition is not stopped from having health insurance, where young people all over our country have the security of knowing they can stay on their parents' health insurance until they hit 27. We are at a point now where being a woman is not a preexisting condition, where we have expanded access to contraception. We are at a point in our country where the uninsured population has gone down dramatically.  We cannot have someone whose attitude is not what I would hope it would be, one of ``Hey, we accomplished a lot. Let's figure out a way to make it better. Let's build on it.'' Instead, they not only want to take back the gains I just mentioned, but they want to go further and take back Medicaid and Medicare, privatize them, gut them, block-grant them.  So this is not a close call. This is a Congressperson who for years has told America what his intentions are. He just didn't have the power to do it then because he was 1 out of 435. Frankly, if you include the Senate, he was 1 out of 535 and had a Democratic President also to get through. He couldn't get done what he wanted to get done. Now he is going to go from being one voice on the fringe, yelling for getting rid of Medicaid and Medicare, yelling against women's access to contraception, yelling to put insurance companies back in charge of your life, your destiny, and your health care--he is going to go from a fringe voice, 1 out of 435, to now being the head of the Department of Health, advising the President on things, frankly, that he has said, at least, that he doesn't want to do: gutting Medicare, gutting health care for seniors.  So I go back to where we came from--a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, and the first head of the Health Department, an incredible woman, World War II--served soldiers in World War And they had a vision for this country, that, hey, what we have is not good enough. Let's figure out a way to do better because a healthy society is an economically strong society. A healthy society is a prosperous society. A healthy society lives up to our common values.  We are the United States of We should set the national standard for health care. When it comes to the most vulnerable amongst us, whether it is a poor kid on a farm, whether it is someone in an inner city, whether it is an immigrant, we are a country that believes--like the old African proverb: If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.  One of the great singers and artists and inspirations in my State is a guy named Bruce He has a song where he says: We take care of our own. Well, we have done well on that idea. We have gotten better. We have made strides toward that standard.  We have work to do. We should be working together, both sides of the aisle, to make our health care better, more inclusive, more accessible, and more affordable. We have a lot more work to do. But I don't want to go back. So help me, I will fight every day to prevent us from going backward where there will be fewer people covered, more people, because they can't afford things, suffering untold health crises.  I don't want to go backward to where women are denied coverage or access to empowering things, basic things, fundamental things like contraception.  I don't want to go backward with senior citizens who are in the sunsetting years of their lives, when they should be free of stress and worry and strain but suddenly are worried again and struggling and suffering. I don't want to go back to those days; therefore I will vote a resounding, full-throated no on Congressman Price because, as the poet Maya Angelou said, if someone tells you who they are, believe them. He is someone who has told us what he wants to do. We should stop him from doing it.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Perdue).

1094,topic-id,2084,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this evening to continue my remarks from earlier today in opposition to the nomination of Congressman Price to be Secretary of Health and Human Services and to continue talking about the Medicaid program.  My colleague from New Jersey was talking about the affordability of health care in general and some of the critique about where we are going with health care in the future. That is really what I think the next few years here in the Senate are going to be about--the future of health care.  Unfortunately, the nominee before us is more about the past of health care, focusing on issues like fee-for-service instead of the patient-centric health care that we need.  Earlier today, I was talking about the innovation that is happening in Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act and, specifically, what is happening in Midwestern States, Eastern States, Southern States, and Western States--how the expansion of Medicaid is not just giving more people access to health care but how innovative programs that are reaching that population are allowing people, instead of going into nursing home care and costing States more and having more expense, going into community-based care and home-based care that will help us keep costs down and give patients what they want: the ability to stay at home and have care.  I also talked about how, on top of the Medicaid expansion, we put a program like the Basic Health Plan into place, which drove down the costs of premiums for people in that program.  Through Medicaid, not only have we expanded health insurance by helping states cover their citizens, but the uninsured rate has also dropped. I mentioned that in our State of Washington, it dropped to just 6 percent. Through delivery system reforms, we are also driving a better way for us to improve the Medicaid  Now I want to contrast that to the position of this administration and to Congressman Price, because it is a very different view. As I said, I think it is a very backwards-looking view about what we need to improve our health care system. I want to make sure that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand this.  Now, my biggest concern is that the current administration and members of that administration are talking about what they want to do with I know that Speaker Ryan has said that he would like to block-grant Medicaid back to the This may sound like some great idea until you realize that, right now, Medicaid is already a state option. Medicaid is a voluntary program for States to participate in. The money goes back to the State based on the need. It is not block-granted.  I talked earlier today about when you block-grant it and cap it at a certain level, you are asking people to do more with less. Instead of addressing their needs and improving the system,[[Page S1035]]like I mentioned on rebalancing to community-based care versus nursing home care, or making it more affordable like in the Basic Health Plan, all you are doing is capping it and continuing to give an amount of money that doesn't meet the needs of individual citizens. So I did not like the fact that Speaker Ryan seems to be on this parade of saying: Let's block-grant  The reason we came to this is that my dear colleague from Vermont came to the Senate floor one night and showed a tweet from--I think it was actually then-Candidate Trump, but it might have been President Trump--that said: No, I am not touching Medicare or Social Security or My colleague from Vermont wanted to know whether the President was going to stick to that promise. What has happened since then is we have seen that there has been a promise, so to speak, on some of these programs, but not on others.  I know Vice President Pence said that he and Donald Trump will give States new freedom and flexibility through block-granting So they are for this idea of block-granting  In fact, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said: block-grant Medicaid to the  So many on the other side are saying you are going to keep your health care; don't worry, it is going to be there for you; no one is going to lose it. I guarantee that if we block-grant Medicaid, which is the premise that Mr.Price has been rallying on, not just once but many times, it is not going to work out for many Washingtonians in my State, and it certainly is not going to work out for many people all across this country.  Mr.Price wrote a budget that would block-grant And he wrote a bill that would repeal the Medicaid expansion in its entirety and repeal all of the Affordable Care So I know for some people, as I said, that might sound like giving the States flexibility, but right now, that dollar goes up and down based on need. When Medicaid is block-granted, you are going to give States a set amount of money and, as I said, that set amount of money may not keep pace with the cost of care.  Through Medicaid waivers authorized by Congress and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, States can work with the Federal Government to deliver flexibility. I just mentioned two programs that are already in the Affordable Care  Earlier today I mentioned all of the States that were utilizing rebalancing programs and the shift they are seeing in keeping people out of nursing home care and putting them in community-based services. So that is a huge win.  A number of States have pursued these Medicaid waivers through a section of the Social Security Act called 1115. It is really not necessary for anybody to know the number, but basically those innovations are allowing States to continue to improve the delivery of health care. In the State of Washington, that means we are delivering better care, better outcomes, at lower cost. That should be our target--not taking a hatchet to Medicaid and chopping it and saying we are going to give you less and less money.  We know that our health care delivery system is going to be challenged in the future, and we know Mr.Price's budget would cut one-third of Medicaid funding within 10 years. That is a huge cost to the Medicaid program. So what would it mean? It would mean millions of Americans would lose their health insurance because States will not have the investments to cover them. Uncompensated care will skyrocket, and that would really hurt the safety net that hospitals provide. People don't go without health care just because Medicaid doesn't cover them. They show up in the emergency rooms, they get uncompensated care, it is more expensive, or they ignore their health care needs until they can absolutely afford it. We are seeing this across America even now. We have had physicians tell us stories of people who are just waiting until they can afford coverage.  So that is why it is so important to get affordable coverage like the Affordable Care Act has been able to provide and to unleash innovative programs within these systems, like the Basic Health Plan that I mentioned earlier today, which allows us to buy in bulk, like a Costco model. Costco delivers Americans a lot of cheaper products because they buy in bulk; it drives down the price. The consumer wins and the insurer wins because they know they are going to get big purchases, and that provides flexibility. I mentioned how New York has more than 600,000 people on the Basic Health Plan, and instead of paying a yearly premium of about $1,500, they were basically saving about $1,000 or more on their annual insurance premiums. Why? Because the State was able to offer up a bundle to New York residents and drive down costs. That is the kind of flexibility we need in the health care system. We don't need to just say we are going to cut one-third over a 10-year period of time.  Let me again contrast this progress with Mr.Price's ideas. Congressman Price's budget would cut $1 trillion from States over 10 years through Medicaid block grants--$1 trillion, leaving States with a hole in their budget that I know, if they are like our State and are challenged with other issues, they would not be able to cover. The notion that block-granting Medicaid and repealing the Medicaid expansion is the way forward is absolutely not what the people of Washington State think. I am here to represent the viewpoint that innovations in the Affordable Care Act are working, and we shouldn't just simply block-grant and cut  So instead of improving the delivery system of health care and instead of expanding coverage and giving peace of mind, here is what Mr.Price's Medicaid cuts would do, according to some of the independent experts who study  The National Council on Disability says about block grants: ``Older Americans and people with disabilities would be at special risk. . . . States would face strong financial pressure to reduce services to low-income seniors and people with disabilities if the Federal Medicaid funds were capped.''  The Center on Budget and Priorities says: ``To compensate for the federal Medicaid funding cuts a block grant would institute, states would either have to contribute much more of their own funding or, as is far more likely, use the greater flexibility the block grant would give them to make draconian cuts to eligibility, benefits, and provider payments.''  The Commonwealth Fund says that ``the federal contribution under a block grant program would remain the same, or grow only according to a present formula, no matter how large the population in need becomes or how much a State actually must spend on health care for Medicaid recipients.''  So we can see that people understand that block-granting Medicaid is nothing more than a war on Medicaid--nothing more than a war on  That is why I cannot support Mr.Price's nomination. We gave him chances in the hearing to talk about why this kind of approach is not acceptable and why the programs within the Affordable Care Act that are driving down costs, giving people access, making improvements, working all across the United States in various parts of our Nation are actually the right ways to improve the delivery system, but we couldn't get commitments.  So if my colleagues are being honest with themselves or if they actually understand this, they should be very afraid of the notion that Mr.Price is putting forward in wanting to block-grant I think some of them do understand. It is why the Governor of Nevada, Brian Sandoval, and the Governor of Michigan, Rick Snyder, and others, are asking Congress to let them keep the Medicaid gains already in the Affordable Care Act and not shift those costs to the  So while shifting costs to the States might be exactly what some people want to do, this is exactly why we need to fight to make sure that the Medicaid expansion remains supported, and that we have the right focus moving forward--a delivery system, that is, that works for the patients and improves outcome and lowers costs. That is why I mentioned two aspects of the Affordable Care We did the Medicaid expansion, and then, for a working family just above the Medicaid eligibility level, which is 138 percent of the federal poverty level, they were able to buy in bulk and get the kind of cost savings in health care that, as I said, let more than 600,000 New Yorkers[[Page S1036]]sign up for truly affordable health care in impressive numbers.  So that kind of progress being made in Medicaid and in the income levels just above it is exactly the kind of progress we must keep pursuing. Our colleagues seem to want to turn back the clock on this plan.  We did not get a single commitment from Mr.Price on keeping Medicaid healthy for more than the 70 million Americans that depend on it. Therefore, all I can do is go back to his record, his votes, and his comments to understand his desire to block-grant Medicaid, which is a war on It will not make that population healthier. It certainly will not really control health care costs for the future, and it is certainly the reason I will be voting no on Mr. Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1076,topic-id,3659,"Mr.President, the point I was starting with is that in Maryland, yes, there are 400,000 people who now have coverage who didn't have coverage before, and they are benefiting by being able to get preventive health care and get affordable care, but it is all Marylanders who are benefiting because there is less use of emergency rooms and fewer people who use our health care system who don't pay for it, the uncompensated care.  Many of my colleagues have read letters that they have received from constituents, or phone calls, and I am going to do that during the course of my discussion. I am going to tell you a story that I heard from a 52-year-old who lives in Harford County who frequently used the emergency department prior to the adoption of the Affordable Care This is what this Harford County resident told me: After the passage of the Affordable Care Act, I began working with Healthy Harford Watch Program and shortly after was insured.

As I said, over 2 million people have private health insurance in They are all benefiting from the Affordable Care  If Mr.Price has his way and we repeal the Affordable Care Act, every Marylander will be at risk. They will be at risk because of the protections that we put in the Affordable Care Act against abusive practices of insurance companies.  To me, probably the most difficult thing to understand by my constituents was the cruel preexisting condition restrictions that were placed in the law prior to the Affordable Care Simply put, if you had a preexisting condition, the insurance company would restrict coverage for that preexisting condition. So exactly what you needed the health care system to pay for, your insurance company didn't[[Page S1018]]pay for it. They said: Look, you had this heart condition before you were insured; we are not going to pay for your heart needs. You had cancer; we are not going to pay for your cancer treatment in the future. You have diabetes, and that leads to a lot of different health care needs. We are going to restrict your insurance coverage and not pay for diabetes care. That is a thing of the past with the Affordable Care  Once again, we are now talking about repealing the Affordable Care We don't know what it will be replaced with, if at all. Mr.Price, in the House, has not given us a satisfactory explanation during the confirmation process of how we are going to be able to guarantee that everyone who has insurance and everyone who has a need for coverage with preexisting conditions will be able to get insurance that won't discriminate against that person because of preexisting conditions.  Another aspect that was an abusive practice before the Affordable Care Act is that our insurance policies had caps on how many claims you could make in a year over the lifetime of your policy, and that would kick in exactly when people who have chronic needs need insurance the most.  Let me give an example. Juanita, who lives in Hyattsville, MD, told me about her son. She said her son seemingly was in perfect health, had graduated from Harvard with a master's degree and was working at a nonprofit. Then he was diagnosed with a rare cardiovascular disorder. He didn't know he was going to have that. Well, that required him to have multiple operations, and it would have fully exceeded his lifetime cap in hospital stays, and he would not have been able to afford the care. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Juanita's son has full coverage. That is another example of a person who is at risk if Mr.Price is able to carry out what he said--repeal the Affordable Care Act--and we don't have a way to guarantee that insurance companies must take all comers and must eliminate the caps that we have seen in the policies before.  Another area which I think has been a pretty popular part of the Affordable Care Act and which I heard many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle say they want to keep is allowing 26-year-olds to stay on their parents' policies--under 26 years of age. That is a very popular provision. I heard many of my colleagues speak in favor of it. Remember, when you repeal the Affordable Care Act, that will be repealed. Unless we have adequate replacements, unless we have an improvement, that is at risk as well.  I want to talk about another provision that was in the Affordable Care I authored the provision. It is called a prudent layperson standard for emergency care. Let me take you back before the Affordable Care This is why it is important for Congress to be careful as to how we pass laws. And if we repeal laws, we can go back to these types of practices. Before the Affordable Care Act, if you had chest pains and shortness of breath, you would do what I would think any reasonable person would do: You would be taken to the emergency room as soon as possible to see whether you are having a heart attack. Those are classic signs of a heart attack. Yet there were insurance policies that said that if you went to a hospital that was out of network, they weren't going to pay the full amount even though you went to the closest hospital because you had an emergency situation. That makes no sense at all, but that was the case.  You went to the hospital. You did the right thing, and you found out you didn't have a heart attack. You went home. You were happy until you got the bill, and your insurance company said you didn't need to go to the emergency room because you didn't have a heart attack. Then you do have a heart attack because you can't pay the bill.  That was the circumstance that existed before the Affordable Care Act, and we put into the Affordable Care Act, for all insurance companies, the prudent layperson standard. If it was prudent for you to go to the nearest emergency room, your insurance plan must cover that cost. That is the standard today, and I wonder whether, if we repeal the Affordable Care Act, we will be going back to those types of abusive practices.  Before the Affordable Care Act, women in some circumstances were in and of themselves a preexisting condition. Are we going to go back to those days?  Let me go on to another point that worries me about Mr.Price's position if we were to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and that is affordability. It is one thing to say people can buy insurance--you know, there is insurance out there; just buy it. It's another thing whether you can afford the insurance coverage.  One of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act that I don't think has been fully explained to the American people is that since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we have been able to keep the growth rate of health care costs below what we had seen before the passage of the Affordable Care We have reduced costs for all individuals and companies that have health policies. The rate of growth has been at a slower rate because of the Affordable Care And I have already alluded to one of the reasons--we reduced uncompensated care because more people are paying their bills. We kept the growth rate down.  But there are other aspects to the Affordable Care Act that have helped bring down the costs, and that is, we have premium tax credits. In 2015, 70 percent of those who were enrolled in the Maryland Health Connection--that is our exchange in the State of Maryland--received some form of a credit. That was provided in the Affordable Care We recognize that not everyone can afford the premiums, so we provided credits. If you repeal the Affordable Care Act, we may very well not have affordable policies for those individuals who have been able to get credits under the Affordable Care  I want to talk about a situation that was brought to my attention at several of the roundtable discussions I have held in Maryland with interest groups on health care, and that has to do with small businesses.  Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, if I had a forum on small businesses--and I did. I have been a member of small businesses and entrepreneurship committees since I first came to the I believe in the importance of small businesses. That is where job growth and innovation takes place. It is critically important that we help small businesses.  Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the 1 issue that would come up at roundtable discussions I had with small business leaders of Maryland was the affordability of health coverage for their employees. It is no longer an issue that they talk about because the Affordable Care Act has allowed small companies to have competitive premium costs with larger companies.  Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, if you were a small business owner and you had maybe 10 people in your employ on your health policy and one of those individuals unfortunately had a major health episode during that year, you knew that the next year you were going to get a major premium increase because you were rated on your own experiences as a small group. That is a thing of the past under the Affordable Care Now, under the Affordable Care Act, you are in this big pool, and you are not discriminated against because you happen to have someone in your employ who needs health care.  It also enables small business owners to hire people who have particular health needs. They are not going to be discriminated against because they hire somebody who happens to have the need for health insurance. Before that, small companies were very reluctant to hire individuals who had health needs because they knew it would affect their health policy.  I want to mention one other factor that is pretty telling. Let me read from a letter I received from Nancy of Silver This is something that really gets to me, something I think we have to be very careful about, because the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is going to hurt our economy.  Nancy of Silver Spring is a 60-year-old freelance writer/editor and depends upon the Maryland Health Connection exchange for her health insurance and the tax credit that helps reduce her premium. She is a healthy 60-year-old, but no insurance company will write her an individual policy, she knows--she tried. One of the big factors that helped Nancy get the courage to leave[[Page S1019]]her salaried, full-benefits job and go out on her own was the fact that the ACA was right on the horizon when she made the leap in 2012.  Nancy writes:       You want a world-class work force? How about giving      everyone access to affordable health care so we can keep      ourselves functioning? You want job creation? How about      keeping the ACA so freelancers, gig workers, and startup      entrepreneurs don't have to split their energy between the      jobs they are creating and some soul-sucking ``day job'' just      for the sake of keeping our health insurance?  This is a real problem. You repeal the Affordable Care Act, people become what is known as job-locked. They don't like where they work, they know they can do better, but they can't afford to leave and lose their health coverage. It may be their spouse, it may be their child, may be their self, but they are job-locked because they don't have the protection of knowing they can get affordable coverage if they give up the insurance they currently have. That hurts our economy. That hurts the entrepreneur spirit. That hurts innovation. And it is something that is critically important that we solved in the Affordable Care  Mr.Price talks about the repeal and we will have something to replace it with. That is not an easy one to fix. That is not one that you can just say we will take care of because you have to have pools for individuals in small companies that are competitive. If we don't have the type of comprehensive coverage we have under the Affordable Care Act, it is very difficult to understand how that can, in fact, be done. So that gives me great heartburn with someone who espouses the repeal of the Affordable Care  We have many stories, many letters here from people who literally would have had to go through bankruptcy.  In Laurel, MD, Mark tells me about his son Timmy, who developed a rare genetics syndrome called Opitz G/Timmy's medical expenses would have reached his family's lifetime maximum of $1 million when he turned 3 months old. When Timmy finally made it home, the ACA covered and continues to cover his cost of medical equipment. The law covers all of Timmy's specialist appointments, surgeries, and hospital stays.  Recently, Timmy was sick and coughing up blood. Mark and his wife took him to the emergency room without fear that he would incur debt he would never be able to pay. Without the Affordable Care Act, Mark's family would likely be in bankruptcy.  Go back before the Affordable Care Look under bankruptcies. Look up what the major reason was for bankruptcy. It was people's inability to pay their medical bills in the United States of That is something we don't want to go back to.  I started my comments by talking about pediatric dental. The Affordable Care Act provides essential health benefits so that every person who is insured, every person who is in our system, is guaranteed certain benefits. That affects nearly 3 million Marylanders who are protected by the essential health benefits in the current law. They include such things as maternal benefits and newborn health care, mental health and addiction.  Mr.President, you have been the leader of this body on dealing with mental health services and addiction services, and I applaud you for your efforts, but quite frankly, if we lose the essential health benefits, private insurance companies aren't going to cover these costs.  We have an epidemic nationwide on drug addiction. We have seen opioid misuse lead to heroin, lead to fentanyl. The death rate in Maryland is up about 20 percent every year. We have doubled and quadrupled the number of ODs the last 5 or 6 years, and the numbers are still going up. We need coverage so that we can, first and foremost, stop people from using it in the beginning--an education program, a prevention program; we have to do more of that. We also have to keep people alive and get them into treatment and save their lives, and the Affordable Care Act helps us get that done.  You repeal these essential health benefits, I really worry as to whether--mental health and drug addiction have never been a priority for private insurance companies or, for that matter, the Medicaid system. So we have to make sure that we maintain that type of coverage, and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act puts all of that at risk.  One of the areas I worked on very carefully when I was in the House, and now in the Senate, was preventive health care services. Immunization, cancer screenings, contraception--those types of services are critically important. We had a meeting at lunch today. I found out that unwanted pregnancies are at a historically low level. Are we going to go back to the day where women cannot afford contraceptive services? That makes no sense at all. It is counterproductive to what we all agree we need to do.  I want to talk about one or two other issues which I think are important which are also in jeopardy with the repeal the Affordable Care Act or policies that have been espoused by Mr.One is the Medicaid expansion.  The Medicaid expansion covers our most vulnerable. These are people who don't really have a strong voice in our political system. They are people who really depend upon us, every one of us in the Senate, to protect their health care needs. These are people who are desperate, who can't afford health care other than through our medical assistance program, the Medicaid Yet there has been talk about block-granting that program to the Have you looked at State budgets recently? Do you really believe our States have the financial capacity to deal with the Medicaid population without a partnership with the Federal government?  Maryland has been a pretty strong State with Medicaid expansion. My Governor is doing the right thing. I am proud of what Maryland has done, but if you withdraw the Federal partnership, the Governor doesn't have that type of flexibility in the budget to make up the difference. It is going to hurt. It is going to hurt our health care system, hurt our most vulnerable.  It has been estimated that a block grant--that by 2019, Maryland will lose close to $2 billion. We can't make that up. Would we still cover substance abuse under Medicaid? We didn't before. If we don't cover that, are we going to now be denying those centers that are located for substance abuse? All this is put at great risk.  We know that Mr.Price, in his fiscal year 2017 budget proposal, looked at this proposal, and I believe it was at $1 trillion at that time.  There is a provision in the Affordable Care Act that I authored that sets up Offices of Minority Health and Health Disparities within all our health departments and sets up the National Institute for Minority Health and Health We elevated it in the Affordable Care I would certainly hope that we would not be repealing that, although it is in the Affordable Care But I can tell you that the mission of Minority Health and Health Disparities will be severely restricted if we repeal the Affordable Care Act or we block-grant the Medicaid Program because it is the minority population who had been discriminated against historically in our health care system who are most at risk.  I can give you one example of that: our qualified health centers. We significantly increase the resources in the qualified health centers as part of the Affordable Care I have been to our qualified health centers in Maryland, and I have seen that they now have dental services that they didn't have before the Affordable Care They now have mental health facilities. It is one thing to have third-party coverage but another thing to have access to a facility. We know that in rural areas, it is very challenging. In poor neighborhoods, it is also challenging. Qualified health centers help fill that void.  I was talking to our qualified health centers in I said: What happens now if we repeal the Affordable Care Act? They literally told me that they can't stay in business because they would lose so much of their reimbursement because it is now being reimbursed under the Medicaid system because these people enrolled; that it would jeopardize their ability to provide the types of services they are providing today. So you are not only denying people third-party reimbursement, you are denying them access to care by the repeal of the Affordable Care  Lastly, let me talk about our Medicare population. Medicare was part of the Affordable Care We don't hear too much talk about that today. We extended the solvency of Medicare as a[[Page S1020]]result of the Affordable Care We brought down the cost of Part B premiums as a result of the Affordable Care And we are closing the doughnut hole coverage gap for prescription medicines within the Medicare system. Before the Affordable Care Act, how many times would we go to a senior center and someone would tell us they didn't pick up their prescriptions from the counter because they didn't have the money to pay for the cost because they were in the doughnut hole? Well, that is coming to an end. It has already closed enough so people are not in that vulnerable situation. But it is now coming to an end as a result of the passage of the Affordable Care  So I take this time today because of Mr.Price's nomination. I care deeply about the principle Senator Van Hollen talked about and others have talked about; that is, health care in America should be a right not a privilege. The Affordable Care Act has helped us in achieving that.  Somehow I believe that if we ask the American people, some would say: Well, we don't like this ObamaCare, but we like this Affordable Care Let us be honest with the American people. Let us recognize that this bill has changed the landscape of health care in America for the better: reduced costs, extended coverage, more quality coverage, insurance companies now have to spend at least 80 percent of their premiums on benefits.  So much of that has been done as a result of the Affordable Care Can we do it better? Let's work together, Democrats and Republicans, to improve the health care system in this country without scaring Americans that they are going to lose the benefits they already have.  For those reasons, I believe Mr.Price does not represent what we need, and I will, unfortunately, be voting against his confirmation.  With that, I yield the floor.

921,topic-id,338,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of 92, condemning North Korea's development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles.  Without question, North Korea's relentless effort to develop ballistic missiles poses a serious threat to the security of the United States, especially to our allies in the region, and possibly all across the globe.  For the past several years, Kim Jong-un has made significant strides in their nuclear missile program. It seems like every few weeks we hear new reports concerning the growing North Korea nuclear threat. North Korea has conducted multiple nuclear tests and demonstrated that it is bound and determined to develop a ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the continental United  It has also become abundantly clear that the Kim regime will continue to[[Page H2608]]work toward a nuclear warhead, no matter the cost. Just today, a senior North Korean defector stated that the young, irresponsible dictator will do anything to remain in power and that Kim believes nuclear weapons will help guarantee his rule.  We must condemn these actions and begin taking concrete steps to mitigate the growing North Korean threat. I also believe we must work closer than ever with our South Korean partners and increase our already strong security alliance by assisting with technological developments, carrying out more joint exercises, and quickly making the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems, or THAAD, in South Korea operational.  I commend my friend, Mr.Wilson of South California, for his leadership in championing 92. I also want to thank Chairman Royce and the ranking member, Mr.Eliot Engel, for, again, using the format of the Foreign Affairs Committee in a bipartisan manner.  This is one committee in the House--and there are a few others--that works very much in a bipartisan manner. This is one we do need to be united on. The threat from Kim Jong-un is serious. It is dangerous. It is a threat to world peace. We need to take it seriously. 92 goes in the right direction. I, again, want to thank Mr.Wilson for proposing it.

999,topic-id,298,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for her leadership on this issue.  Mr.Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness I thank my colleagues from Ways and Means and from the Education and the Workforce Committee for getting this great idea onto paper and moving this bill forward today.  As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I am always very appreciative to see Members from across this body find solutions for small businesses. That is exactly what this bill is.  For virtually any one of us in this Chamber, it can be said that hundreds of thousands of our constituents depend on small businesses for their livelihoods. They have been looking to those same small businesses for options, as ObamaCare has done the opposite of what it was supposed to do and it has diminished choices for workers.  By allowing small businesses to join together through association health plans, the Small Business Health Fairness Act would give small business employees at least as many choices as those who happen to work for larger companies.  Association health plans have long been a solution suggested by small businesses that share their views with me and other members of the Small Business This bill puts that idea finally into action.  Mr.Speaker, in our current state of affairs, there are fewer and fewer healthcare options available for hardworking This bill addresses that problem for our hardest hit small businesses and communities.  While we begin the hard work of making health care not only affordable but worth buying at all, this bill is an important step in giving Americans the certainty and choices that they want. I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.

1033,topic-id,461,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this issue. I rise in strong support of H.79, the bipartisan HALOS  As the chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I have the honor and pleasure of hearing and speaking with many of America's small-business owners and their employees almost every day. I hear case after case of small-business owners working days and nights and weekends. I hear stories of sacrifice. I hear inspiring stories of success.  But all too often, I hear about how the government continues to make it difficult for small businesses to prosper and grow and create more jobs, which is, obviously, very important to our Nation and its economy.  Perhaps one of the most common and most alarming concerns is just how difficult it is for entrepreneurs who are starting out to access the capital they need in order to grow. We must provide entrepreneurs a better way to build their businesses. The HALOS Act does just that.  The Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act expands access to capital by ensuring small businesses are able to continue to connect and interact with angel investors. One popular way in which small businesses connect with angel investors is through demo days. These exciting events are sponsored by universities, nonprofits, local governments, and many other groups that allow entrepreneurs to showcase their products and informally meet investors and customers. However, SEC regulations are threatening to force these events out of business by imposing unwieldy regulations that dictate who is and who is not allowed to simply attend.  These ill-considered regulations would force everybody who merely walks through the door to go through what is essentially a full financial examination--handing over tax documents, bank statements, paycheck information, and on and on. This just doesn't make sense. We should be encouraging participation in demo days, not creating obstacles. We should be allowing the largest group of attendees to gather in the room, not be limiting who can walk through the door. After all, not only are these events places to connect people with our communities' small businesses, but they also provide a great opportunity for our next generation of entrepreneurs to ask questions and learn what it takes for a business to open its doors and be successful.  I thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership as well as Representatives Sinema and Schneider for working in a cooperative and bipartisan manner.  An identical bill, as the chairman mentioned, passed this House in the last session of Congress in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion. We must continue to work together to create an environment in which our small businesses--the engines of our economy--grow and flourish. This bill is one more step in that direction.

1031,topic-id,828,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups This bill, under the guise of helping angel groups attract additional investors for small businesses and startups, would alter the balance between capital formation and investor protection that we sought to achieve in the JOBS  Let me remind my colleagues of what we did in the wake of the financial crisis when bank lending was scarce. Our Nation's startups had trouble getting off the ground and attracting new capital. Previously, they had done so using rule 506, which allows companies to sell private securities to accredited investors who are financially savvy and have the means to bear their heightened risks and lack of SEC oversight. As a condition to using rule 506, however, companies could not solicit purchasers from or advertise to the general public.                              {time}  1415  This condition was viewed as a barrier to capital formation for startups. Therefore, Democrats worked with Republicans to provide companies in the JOBS Act with an alternative so that they could broadly advertise and solicit new investors.  Recognizing the need to balance investor protection with this expansion, Ranking Member Waters offered an amendment requiring companies to take reasonable steps to verify that the ultimate purchaser was an accredited investor. This verification requirement is a necessary investor protection designed to prevent unsophisticated investors from purchasing--either accidentally or by fraudulent means--risky, illiquid, and lightly regulated Rule 506 securities.[[Page H260]]  I would remind my Republican colleagues that this amendment was agreed to unanimously, in part because the amended provision struck the appropriate balance between capital formation and investor protection. Nevertheless, here we are today seeking to alter it in H.79.  This bill would remove the verification requirement and allow companies to broadly solicit and advertise their private stock at any event sponsored by a college, nonprofit, government organization, angel investor group, or other group. That means that America's college students can walk into an event on campus and be talked into buying stock that they don't understand and may not ever be able to sell. Having created this initial relationship, the company can then sell the students stock without ever checking if they are accredited investors.  What is more, the bill would make it much easier for fraudsters to swindle unsophisticated investors by, for example, encouraging the unsophisticated investors to buy stock in a fake or failing company, only to sell off their own stock at artificially inflated prices.  Republicans claim that the bill is merely a clarification; that these demo days are not merely solicitations or advertisements in and of themselves and can be used by companies to generally discuss investment opportunities along with their products and services with the general public. But that is not the case.  Companies can already go to a broadly advertised, widely attended demo day and discuss their businesses and not implicate the securities laws if they don't offer securities for sale or otherwise condition the market for their security, but the bill would allow them to offer securities or condition the market by describing the type and amount of stock they are offering, the intended use of the proceeds, or any of the other information in subsection (a)(4) of the bill.  Therefore, today, a company discussing such information would have two options: one, to ensure that the event is limited to persons with whom they or the event organizer has a preexisting, substantive relationship or have been contacted through an informal personal network; or two, verify at the time of purchase that their investors are accredited by, for example, looking at bank statements, W-2s, or third-party verification letters.  The bill would allow companies to avoid both options and broadly advertise their stock, solicit purchases from the general public, and never check to make sure they are financially sophisticated, accredited investors. The only limitation--that the stock offerings only be at events sponsored by certain groups--does not provide a meaningful investor protection. Phony private universities or nonprofits that may be guilty of fraud themselves can hardly be held accountable for policing it in stock offerings.  So rather than clarify existing law and preserve the compromise we struck in the JOBS Act, H.79 provides a potential loophole that is overbroad and harmful to investors.  Mr.Chairman, I am even more troubled that Republicans have brought this bill and another Financial Services Committee bill to the floor this week without a hearing or a committee markup. In fact, there are 10 new Republican Members and 4 new Democratic Members on our committee that have never even considered this bill.  Collectively, they represent millions of Americans that are being denied the right to better understand this legislation. It is deeply troubling that Republicans have decided to use their newfound power to rush through changes under cover of night without the benefits of an open, public process.  For these reasons, I oppose H.79.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

1056,topic-id,592,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Chairman, both Democrats and Republicans want to help facilitate capital formation, particularly for groups such as angel investors, who have substantial experience in the private securities market, and for small companies like startups who are seeking funding to innovate and grow. But as Members of Congress, we also have the responsibility to protect investors and ensure that the rules of the road are reasonable and appropriate. This is especially important for retail investors, those of us who are looking to save for retirement or to buy a house or to support our children's education.  That is what concerns me about the bill we have before us today. We cannot create loopholes in the securities laws that could have a serious negative impact on Americans' nest eggs, so we must strike the right balance between capital formation in our securities markets and investor protection.  It is with these goals in mind that Democrats supported the current rules in place. Companies can raise money to grow and support their businesses in our securities markets under the purview of the SEC and State regulators. The regulatory framework we have set up allows for different activities and oversight depending on the nature of the security offering.  For example, public offerings provide robust information to investors about the risks and rewards of a particular securities purchase. They require the SEC or State securities regulator to preapprove and review an offering, and they provide legal recourse to investors that may be deceived. This is a strong regulatory framework that ensures our markets are safe and sound. In exchange for complying with these rules, companies can advertise and sell their stock to anyone in the general public.  On the other hand, private offerings do not come with the same regulatory requirements and protections, which can make it easier and less costly for firms to raise money. This means less information for investors, less legal recourse, and little to no scrutiny by regulators. So we put in place procedures to ensure these private offerings, which are inherently riskier, are only sold to accredited investors.  Private offerings now play a significant role in the market. Unregistered securities have surpassed registered securities in terms of capital formation. They have accounted for more than $2 trillion in new capital. Moreover, $71 billion has been raised since 2012 through the general solicitation and advertising exemption that we put in place in the JOBS This is clearly an important and growing segment of our market, and, as such, I believe we need to be even more cautious about who is participating in it.  In fact, the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee said we should do more, not less, to protect investors in the general solicitation and advertising market for private offerings. They think we don't have enough guardrails in place. And yet this bill would do the opposite, by expanding the exemptions on general solicitation without similarly protecting the investor.  The bill also undercuts an important amendment Ranking Member Waters offered to the JOBS Act, which was approved unanimously. It required companies to verify that the purchaser is an accredited investor and is financially sophisticated enough to bear the risks involved in private offerings. By effectively allowing purchasers to ``self-certify'' at or after demo days sponsored by certain groups, the bill could open the door to financial ruin for a retail investor who may not have understood the consequences of his or her investment. So I oppose this bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH259-2.txt,1654,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,10.0,February

This amendment, combined with Velazquez amendment, if adopted, would ensure that the bill strikes the appropriate balance between capital formation and investor protection.  First, the Waters amendment would prohibit event sponsors from collecting finders' fees for connecting potential investors to companies. This prohibition helps ensure that event sponsors, including colleges, nonprofits, and trade associations, don't have perverse incentives to drum up sales of stock.  Second, the Waters amendment would require the company selling securities to be a company operating in the real economy, not a hedge fund, shell company, or company going through bankruptcy. Not only does this provision protect investors from purchasing shares of an opaque or speculative firm, but it also ensures that the bill is targeted to provide relief to our Nation's startups and small businesses.

895,topic-id,595,"Mr.President, when his nomination comes to the floor next week, I will vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme This is my first time voting on a Supreme Court nominee, and I don't take the decision lightly. It is a lifetime appointment, after all, and the Court's rulings have shaped our country's history--for good and for ill--and will continue to shape our future. But after reading Judge Gorsuch's writings, meeting with him in person, and listening to his testimony, I can say with confidence that it is not a hard call. I believe Judge Gorsuch will be a fine addition to the Supreme  There is no denying Judge Gorsuch's distinctive qualifications. We all know his credentials: Columbia, Harvard law, and an Oxford doctorate to boot. He clerked for an appellate judge and two Supreme Court He had many years of experience in both private practice and in public service and, of course, over 10 years as an appellate judge. He possesses fine judicial temperament: highly erudite, highly accomplished, and highly regarded by those who know him best. It is no surprise, then, that the American Bar Association, in a unanimous vote, declared him ``well qualified'' for the job.  While I wouldn't outsource our responsibilities to any advocacy organization, I would note that the minority leader himself once said the ABA rating is ``the gold standard by which judicial candidates are judged.''  But, of course, Judge Gorsuch is not just filling any seat, but the seat once held by the late Justice Antonin Justice Scalia was a giant of American jurisprudence. Most Justices earn their place in history by writing opinions, giving voice to their colleagues, and speaking for the Court as a whole. Justice Scalia did that many times throughout his career, of course, but he did something more. He changed the way judges--both conservative and liberal--think about the law and defend their decisions. He reminded us all that a judge's job is to apply the law--including the Constitution, our most fundamental law--as written, to the case before him, not to rewrite it all together.  Adhering to the law, even when the judge doesn't like the result, is the greatest public service that a judge can render, because to respect the rule of law is ultimately to respect the rule of the people.  This is what Justice Scalia taught and what he inspired a whole generation of judges and lawyers to understand. As we prepare to fill his seat on the Supreme Court, let us also acknowledge that no man can fill his shoes. We honor the memory of Justice Scalia and we thank his wife, Maureen, and his whole family for sharing this great man with our country for so long.  Judge Gorsuch is a child of the Scalia generation. He has long advocated for and followed the originalist judicial craft--one rooted in the text, structure, and history of our Constitution, which is to say that he respects the rule of law and he respects the people. Whether defending the religious liberty of the Little Sisters of the Poor or the Fourth Amendment rights of a regular household, he has shown a profound respect for the I also think he has demonstrated throughout his career a firm independence of thought. He has had his influences and his mentors, his promoters and his critics, but I believe he will be his own man--as he should be.  So I am pleased to announce my support for the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge Neil I look forward to his confirmation next week.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2139.txt,2098,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,30.0,February

995,topic-id,706,"Mr.Speaker, again, as someone who was a small-business employer for 27 years and provided health benefits for my staff, I am acutely aware of the challenges in the small-business market which long predate passage of the Affordable Care Act and which is still something that we can do better in terms of helping folks deal with this issue, which, again, is so important because small businesses are the job creators in the American economy.  What I want to sort of point out is that this legislation, in my opinion, is just a complete misfire. Let's, first of all, remind everyone that there are over 670 association health plans existing in America today.  The notion that the Affordable Care Act somehow is smothering or stifling association health plans is, in fact, just factually false. There are many that are in business, providing coverage, as has been said by some of the prior speakers, for people in industries like restaurants, et cetera. Again, we are not talking about some existential threat that is out there in terms of association health plans today.  The guts of this bill--and it is quite extraordinary coming from, again, the Republican Party--is to preempt State Governments from having any say over the solvency and the benefit design of plans that operate under association health plans.  Back in the 1990s, there was a spate of problems with association health plans going belly up because, again, there was no State insurance solvency standards to make sure that there were funds set aside to pay the bills of people who were employed in the businesses that these plans were set up to serve.  As a result, Congress acted. We basically said that the Federal Government was doing a lousy job in terms of protecting patients. And we gave States the ability, through their State insurance departments, to make sure that certain solvency standards were met and, as was stated earlier, that they weren't able to cherry-pick just the healthiest and leave the rest for the other segments of the health insurance industry.  As a result of the fact that we made this change, again, the State insurance commissioners all across America, Republican States and Democratic States, have weighed in. They sent a letter on February 28 pleading with Congress not to do this, not to pass this bill which eliminates their ability to protect the citizens of their  So this bill is actually an anti-states' rights bill because it is basically saying the Federal Government is just going to step in and wipe out the way in which these plans operate and just lead, again, a race to the bottom, the lowest threshold of protections for patients; and that is considered healthcare reform or somehow advancing the ball in terms of helping small businesses.  There are many other ways to deal with this issue, and this is not the right one. Again, this is not some new idea that we are debating. This has been back and forth over the years, in the 1990s and the early 2000s. It predates the Affordable Care Act by decades, and it is just an old chestnut that is being thrown out in the floor in the name of some idea to sound like we are doing something for small businesses.  Again, under the Affordable Care Act, we set up a 50 percent tax credit for businesses that qualify for it to make health insurance affordable.  I did two townhalls back in my district. I had a plumber from the next town over who, again, took advantage of that 50 percent tax credit. He saved thousands of dollars in terms of providing health benefits for his small business.  We can expand that tax credit to get a wider universe of small businesses, and that is what we should be doing. We should be building on what is successful, again, not watering down existing patient protection and consumer protection laws that ensure that plans are actually going to have enough funds to pay the bills when people get sick or go to the hospital and certainly not be able to cherry-pick what benefits are considered essential or not.

Again, this is the wrong approach. This is, again, turning the clock backwards. It is not going to provide any protections, and it certainly is not responding to some existential threat of association health plans. There are 672 in operation today. Let's help them with programs like tax credits. Let's not just sort of turn that whole sector of the health insurance marketplace into the Wild West because it is patients who are going to lose.

1239,topic-id,204,"Mr.Chairman, I support this amendment to exempt rules under the Clean Air Act from this bill.  According to a 2011 study by the Environmental Protection Agency, the central benefits of the Clean Air Act exceed costs by a factor of more than 30 to 1, and the high benefits exceed costs by 90 times. Cleaner air provides exceptional economic benefits because it results in the improved health and productivity of Americans and reduces medical expenses for air pollution-related health problems.  The Clean Air Act will prevent thousands of early deaths; and its air quality and health benefits, including the prevention of heart attacks and the reduction of pulmonary diseases like chronic bronchitis, will grow over time.  Representative Raskin's amendment, which would exempt all rules that relate to the Clean Air Act, is based on common sense. Cleaner air benefits every man, woman, and child in the country. If the Environmental Protection Agency is prevented or delayed from promulgating new regulations relating to the Clean Water Act because of cost, the children of this country will pay a very heavy price.

This bill would jeopardize all agency rulemakings--no matter how important--even rules that protect whistleblowers.  The Department of Energy issued a ruling in December that would authorize the department to impose civil penalties on Federal nuclear contractors who retaliate against whistleblowers who report information concerning nuclear safety. On January 31, 2017, DOE put a moratorium on that rule in response to President Trump's mandated freeze on rulemakings.  This is exactly the kind of rule that could become a casualty of this bill. We must ensure that agencies can issue rules that protect individuals who blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as safety issues that can be a matter of life and death.

As such,      our organization is deeply committed to protecting      whistleblowers within the federal government and its      contractors. This amendment will explicitly protect any      agency-promulgated regulations that protect whistleblowers or      that lay out penalties for those who retaliate against      whistleblowers from being targeted as ``unnecessarily      burdensome'' under the SCRUB       These regulations, like a Department of Energy (DOE) rule      that would have allowed the Department to impose civil      penalties against contractors who retaliate against      whistleblowers, are already being disrupted by the current      regulatory freeze.

They were trying to make sure that they did the right thing, and they brought it to the attention of people that they thought would listen to them and would do something about their concerns when they felt they had got to the point where, in many instances, they felt that they had nobody to go to.  This administration has been very interesting.

Jenny is a wonderful example of a local leader who is always willing to take on additional responsibility and devote her time and talent to others.  Jenny graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in sociology. At her graduation in Missoula, one of the soldiers in the honor guard escorting the national flag caught her attention. With that chance encounter as the spark, the two were married about a year later. The young couple settled near Helena, in Montana City, where today they are raising their four children. In Helena, Jenny became very active in the Mothers of Preschoolers, also known as MOPS, by serving initially as the director of hospitality, and then after a period of rapid growth, she graciously took on additional duties as the president of a newly formed MOPS group. Jenny served in this capacity for nearly 8 years.[[Page S2150]]  A few years ago, Jenny passed on her MOPS leadership baton and began serving as the chairperson for the education program in her church. As chairperson, Jenny spurred a program to have educational activities available during parent-teacher conferences in order to help parents attend the conferences. Jenny also volunteers each week at the local pregnancy resource center and coordinates the center's annual banquet. Not only does Jenny excel at serving her community, she has done so even while her husband, Noah, a Montana Army National Guard pilot, was gone for nearly a year conducting missions in southwest  Montana is a State with many unsung heroes, and people like Jenny are the community glue that make Montana a great place to raise a family.

This nomination is not a referendum on President DonaldTrump's immigration policy. If it were, I would have voted against the nomination.  In considering this nomination, thequestions are whether General Kelly is unqualified to serve as Homeland Security Secretary and whether his views are too extremeto lead our homeland security and immigration enforcement efforts. In my view, General Kelly easily passes both tests.  Gen.John Kelly is clearly qualified to head up the Homeland Security He served honorably in the U.Marine Corps formore than four decades, first as an enlistee and later as an officer, culminating in his role as commander of U.As SOUTHCOM commander, Kelly oversaw a variety of operations in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America fromheadquarters in  General Kelly knows better than most what is at stake in our efforts to protect our Nation from harm.He served three tours in Iraq, and in 2010, his son, Marine 1st Robert Michael Kelly, 29, was killed in southern Afghanistanwhile leading his platoon on a combat patrol when he stepped on a concealed bomb. He is the highest ranking military officer tolose a child in combat in Afghanistan or  I am sure that I will disagree with General Kelly on some occasions, but hedoes not have a track record of extreme statements on immigration or the other issues that will be under his jurisdiction asHomeland Security  I know that some of my Democratic colleagues voted against General Kelly's nomination becausehe refused to publicly commit to keeping the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--DACA--program in place and to protecting DACArecipients from deportations. Reasonable people can disagree, and I respect my colleagues who are voting against General Kelly'snomination, but I don't believe this justifies opposing this nomination.  There is no one in the Senate who is more committedthan I to protecting the DACA program and no one who has worked harder to protect the young immigrants who are eligible for thisprogram. Seven years ago, I was the first Member of Congress to ask President Obama to establish the DACA program. DACA is basedon the DREAM Act, legislation I first introduced 16 years ago that would give undocumented students who grew up in this countrya chance to earn their citizenship.  The young people who are eligible for DACA and the DREAM Act are known as Overthe years, I have met hundreds of DREAMers and I have come to the floor more than 100 times to tell these DREAMers' stories,which make the case for DACA and the DREAM Act better than I ever could.

Based on these assurances, I am pleased to be able to support General Kelly's nomination. But letme be clear.

1187,topic-id,1336,"Mr.President, ``Hidden Figures'' has been lodged at the top of the box office charts for 2 months now--and with good reason. ``Hidden Figures'' tells the fascinating, true story of three mathematicians who worked as ``human computers'' at NASA in the early years of America's manned space program.  Their job involved double-checking the accuracy of intricate calculations made by NASA's computers. And they carried the weight of awesome responsibility. Fifty-five years ago this week, their calculations helped launch John Glenn into the heavens and return him safely after he had orbited the Earth three times.  Coming in the midst of cold war tensions and the real fear that the Soviet Union was winning the space race, that historic flight was a source of intense pride and relief to It made John Glenn a national hero and an international symbol of American ingenuity and ambition.  But the brains behind that flight remained largely unknown--until now. Why? It is because those formidable mathematicians--those ``human computers''--were three African-American women. They served this Nation at a time when racial segregation was the law of the land and gender-based discrimination was almost as common as air.  As America marks Black History Month, this month seems a good time to say thank you to Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Katherine  America's history is filled with the stories of men and women whose contributions have been minimized or overlooked entirely for the same reason the ``Hidden Figures'' of NASA remained unknown for so long--because our Nation's tortured history with race blinded us to large parts of our own national story.  Ninety years ago, an historian and scholar by the name of Carter Woodson suggested a way to overcome this historical myopia. Woodson and other prominent African Americans proposed that 1 week each February be designated Black History  This is the first Black History Month since the opening last fall of the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, This remarkable new museum represents America's first official attempt to tell the African-American story. In the not quite 5 months since the museum opened, more than 900,000 people have visited. My wife and I toured the museum over the Thanksgiving holiday. We spent hours there--what a moving experience.  The history of African Americans is a story that stretches back 600 years. It is a story of brutal subjugation, racial violence, and discrimination. It is also story of a resilient people who survived those horrors and created a rich and vibrant culture and who have enriched our Nation by their contributions in every walk of life.  In a speech a few months ago, then-First Lady Michelle Obama alluded to the vast and inspiring sweep of that history when she said, ``I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves and I watch my daughters--two beautiful, intelligent, black young women--playing with their dogs on the White House lawn.'' It was a simple but powerful image that captured how far we have come on questions of race since our founding.  As America's 44th President, Barack Obama grappled honestly with complex challenges facing America and the world and delivered solutions that has improved the lives of millions. He and Michelle served our Nation with uncommon dignity, wisdom, and compassion. I am proud to call them both friends.  The Obamas' story is just one of the stories told in the new African-American History Other famous African Americans are featured as well, from Crispus Attucks, the first patriot to give his life in the American Revolution; to the great abolitionists and women's suffrage champions, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman; from Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and singlehandedly shattered the racist myth of Aryan superiority; to the Tuskegee Airmen, who helped democracy defeat fascist tyranny in World War  The museum tells the stories of other prominent men and women, including Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King; Malcolm X; Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Justice of the U.Supreme Court; Congressman John Lewis, my friend, an icon of the civil rights movement; and Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman ever elected to Congress--in 1968. Some of the best advice I have ever heard about making a difference came from Shirley She said, ``If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.'' I think Shirley Chisholm would have loved to see the way the women of America are making their voices heard today and changing the debate in this country.  The new African-American History Museum and Black History Month give us a fuller, truer picture of our past. They also give us hope and guidance for today. Here are just a few quick examples of what I mean.  Ida Wells, born into slavery in 1862, was a journalist, activist, and feminist who led an antilynching crusade in the 1890s, speaking throughout the United States and She reminds us that brave journalists, armed with the First Amendment, can shine a light on wrongdoing and change history.  Garrett Morgan had only a sixth-grade education, but he also had a natural mechanical genius and an entrepreneurial bent. In 1914, he invented a ``safety hood'' that protected wearers from smoke, gases and other pollutants. It became the prototype in World War I for gas masks and for the breathing devices that firefighters wear today. His inventions have saved untold millions of lives.  While some argue that we should cut funding to public schools that serve low-income children, Garrett Morris reminds us that American genius and ingenuity isn't limited by race, or gender, or family income. Our future prosperity depends on our willingness to invest in the potential all of America's children.  Finally, Philip Randolph organized and led the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first predominantly African-American labor union. In 1941, he was part of a group that convinced President Roosevelt to ban discrimination in the defense industries during World War In 1948, that same group persuaded President Truman to issue an Executive order ending segregation in America's Armed And in 1963, Philip Randolph helped led the March on If you want to know how to raise the wages of working people and mobilize ordinary Americans to create a more perfect union, study the life of Philip  Black History Month actually started as Black History Week 90 years ago. The choice of the week had special significance; it included the birthdays of both Abraham Lincoln and the mighty abolitionist, Frederick Douglass.[[Page S1393]]  President Lincoln once predicted that, if history remembered him for anything, it would be for issuing the Emancipation With that great promissory note of freedom, President Lincoln declared that the 3 million persons living in bondage in the rebellious states ``shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.''  The Emancipation Proclamation marked a turning point in America's Civil War; it transformed the fight to preserve the Union into something even larger and nobler: a battle for human freedom.  But without Frederick Douglass, the ``Great Agitator,'' there might never have been a ``Great Emancipator.'' Frederick Douglass was one of the best-known men in He was a powerful and respected speaker and journalist. He criticized Lincoln frequently and publicly for what he viewed as the President's timidity in denouncing slavery. But rather than denouncing Douglass, Abraham Lincoln sought his counsel, and their respectful relationship changed history.  Without Frederick Douglass's prodding, Lincoln might not have issued the Emancipation Lincoln might not have agreed to allow free men of color to serve in the U.Without Frederick Douglass, it might have been harder for Lincoln to see that the Civil War could not end until slavery had ended, that only ``a new birth of freedom'' could redeem the carnage of Civil  The relationship between Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass shows us the good that can be achieved when patriotic citizens dare to speak truth to power and leaders are secure enough to listen. That is a lesson worth pondering during this Black History Month and beyond.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1392-3.txt,326,HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT,2017.0,16.0,March

990,topic-id,518,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness  Mr.Speaker, the concept of association health plans, AHPs, is nothing new. Versions of this bill have been around for many years. They don't work.  Currently, AHPs are regulated by the States, ensuring the ability to protect consumers. H.1101, however, will yank association health plans from the realm of State oversight by federally certifying them and holding them to few, if any, regulatory requirements. This would strip the States of the ability and fidelity to regulate beneficiary protections that exist to protect their citizens.  Federally certifying AHPs will allow selective choice of which benefits are provided and which persons can enroll. This is a complete and total disservice to all individuals and citizens in a State's health insurance market. Association health plans currently exist and operate in New York State, serving many thousands of beneficiaries and avail New Yorkers' protections, benefits guarantees, and avenues for appeal through the Department of Financial  This bill does nothing to offer guaranteed affirmative coverage. It would permit preexisting conditions as a legitimate reason to exclude individuals. It has no minimum threshold for anything resembling essential health benefits, and it fails to offer a requirement for the actuarial value of the insurance product to cover total health costs.  What then remains is not a health plan. In fact, what remains is strikingly similar to what the American Health Care Act purports to offer millions of Americans: less coverage for those enrolled and more expense for those who are too sick, too old, and too poor to be approached by an  AHPs would lead to higher costs for seniors and individuals who are sicker and will dilute the risk pool of entire States, leading to higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Where the American Health Care Act will unilaterally hurt all Americans, H.1101 would accomplish the same harm directed at the sickest and most underserved in a more prejudicial manner.  Mr.Speaker, I offered an amendment to this bill, which was germane, yet not made in order. My amendment would have protected the rights of the States to regulate association health plans, to include regulation of benefits, consumer protections, and rating restrictions. The goal of my amendment was to ensure that all States and their constituents have the same security and protections that my constituents have benefited from over the past 7 years: consumer protections against surprise billing and adverse selection, provider protection for prompt claim payment and preauthorization, protection for local and regional insurers so that large national insurance companies cannot cherry-pick the good risk.  I certainly believe and would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support program integrity and protecting our constituents, which is what my amendment would have made clear.  Lastly, I would like to be clear that I am supportive of increasing access to health care that is comprehensive and affordable for all The bill before us does not do that. The American Health Care Act certainly does not do that.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this rolling back of health care.

1154,topic-id,570,"Mr.President, I rise to introduce the Extending Justice for Sex Crime Victims Act, a bill to extend thetime for minors to seek justice against their perpetrators.  Sex crimes committed against children tragically remain a vile and dangerous reality in communities across this country.  Just this past summer, as the world tuned into the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, the Indianapolis Star reported thatUSA Gymnastics had failed to report to law enforcement allegations of child sexual abuse committed by some of its coaches.  Due to these purported failures, athletes as young as 7 years old were reported to have been abused for years, without anyaction taken to prevent the abuse.  Since the initial Indianapolis Star report, more and more young gymnasts have come forward about their abuse.  All over the world, and all over this country, sex abuse victims are bravely coming forward to tell their stories of abusewhen they were children.  In my home state of California, numerous victims have contacted my office. They have shared the amount of courage andstrength it took to finally come forward with their experiences.  These stories represent an untold amount of pain and suffering. They also represent how difficult it is to come forwarduntil later, in adulthood.  It has been estimated that 90 percent of child sex crime victims never go to the authorities concerning their abuse.  To put this into context, studies indicate that at least one in four girls and about one in five boys is sexually abused. 90percent of those victims never go to the authorities.  A great number of victims don't ever disclose their abuse. If they do, they do not come forward until many years later,after reaching adulthood.  This bill extends the civil statute of limitations in two ways for minor victims of Federal sex crimes to seek justiceagainst their perpetrators.  For one, the bill extends the statute of limitations for minor victims until the age of 28, from age 21, for injuriesstemming from sex crimes such as sexual abuse and child pornography.  Second, for the two laws that provide civil remedies for sex abuse and sex trafficking victims, the bill clarifies that thestatute of limitations does not begin to run until after the victim actually discovers the injury or the violation.  This is significant because victims of sex crimes are sometimes abused even before they can remember the abuse, some asyoung as 3 years old. Some victims are unable to connect their abuse to the injurious symptoms they exhibit throughout theirlives.  The bill therefore clarifies that the limitations period begins when the victim first discovers the injury or the violation.  Through these provisions, the bill ensures that minor victims have an extended period to seek justice against theirperpetrators after discovering their injury or violation.

The original impetus for this bill was the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico in April of 2010, whichdemonstrated yet again the risks of offshore oil and gas extraction.  When the Deepwater Horizon well blew out, 11 people died and 17 others were injured. Oil and gas rushed into the Gulf ofMexico for 87 days.  Oil slicks spread across the Gulf of Mexico, tar balls spoiled the pristine white sand beaches of Florida, wetlands werecoated with toxic sludge, and more than one-third of federal waters in the Gulf were closed to fishing.  While Deepwater Horizon served as an important reminder, the dangers of offshore oil and gas were already too well known toIn 1969, the Santa Barbara oil spill leaked up to 100,000 barrels of oil, and remains the third largest oil spillin the country to this day.[[Page S62]]  Like the Deepwater Horizon, the Santa Barbara oil spill was caused by a natural gas blowout when pressure in the drill holefluctuated.  It took 11 days to plug the hole with mud and cement, but oil and gas continued to seep for months.  Using containment technologies still in place today, the cleanup effort relied on skimmers, detergent, and booms.  There has been no new drilling in waters controlled by the State of California since then, and there has been no newdrilling in Federal waters off the coast of California since 1981.  Appropriately, the most recent plan from the Department of the Interior for Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing willnot allow new leasing off the Pacific Coast of California, Oregon or Washington through 2022.  The fact is that those of us on the Pacific coast do not want any further offshore oil or gas development.  In 2012 California's 19 coastal counties generated $662 billion in wages and $1.7 trillion in This accounts for 80percent of the economic activity in the  California's Ocean economy, including tourism, recreation, and marine transportation, accounts for over 489,000 jobs.  Unlike other areas of the country, any potential fossil fuel resources off the coast of California are likely to be foundwithin only 50 miles of the coast, because of the narrow shelf off the California coast. This means that any potential drilling,and any potential spills, would be in direct conflict with the ocean environment and economy that my state enjoys.  Enacting a permanent ban on offshore drilling would protect our coast for generations to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgS60-2.txt,1332,ADJOURNMENT,2017.0,4.0,March
1199,topic-id,478,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan legislation with my colleague Senator Portman that would align HUD homeless assistance with existing Federal children and youth programs and provide flexibility to local communities to use available resources to meet the needs that they identify.[[Page S1781]]  According to the U.Department of Education, approximately 1.2 million children were homeless during the 2014 to 2015 school year; this is a 34-percent increase from the 939,903 homeless students in the 2009 to 2010 school year.  In California, over 229,000 children experienced homelessness in 2015, nearly four times the 65,000 homeless children in the State in 2003.  Unfortunately, the numbers reported by the HUD Point-in-Time count fail to reflect these increasing numbers.  According to the national 2015 HUD Point-in-Time count, there were only 206,286 people counted as homeless in households that included children, a fraction of the true number.  This is important because only those children counted by HUD are eligible for vital homeless assistance programs and included in local planning efforts. The rest of these children and families are simply out of luck.  The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2017 would allow HUD homeless assistance programs to serve extremely vulnerable children and families, specifically those staying in motels or in doubled-up situations because they have nowhere else to go.  These families are especially susceptible to abuse and trafficking because they are often not served by a case manager and thus remain hidden from potential social service providers.  As a result of the current narrow HUD definition, communities that receive Federal funding through the competitive application process are unable to prioritize or direct resources to help these children and families.  This bill would provide communities with the flexibility to use Federal funds to meet local priorities. The bill requires the Secretary to assess the extent to which Continuums of Care use separate, specific, age-appropriate criteria for determining the safety and needs of children and unaccompanied youth and divert people to safe, stable, age-appropriate accommodations.  And I would note that the bill does not impose any new mandates on service providers.  Finally, this legislation improves data collection transparency by requiring HUD to report the point in time PIT count and the Annual Homeless Assessment Report, AHAR to include data on all categories of homelessness.  Mr.President, I am pleased that Senator Rob Portman has joined me as an original cosponsor on this bill. Homelessness continues to plague our If we fail to address the needs of these children and families today, they will remain stuck in a cycle of poverty and chronic homelessness.  It is our moral obligation to ensure that we do not erect more barriers for these children and families to access services when they are experiencing extreme hardship.

Now nearly stripped of their preferred health insurance, residents in 14 of 15 Arizona counties--14 out of 15counties--logged into the ObamaCare exchanges to shop for new plans only to discover that instead of the vibrant marketplace theyused to have, they were left with only one insurer to choose from--so from 24 to 8, to 1 for 14 of Arizona's 15 counties.  So today, when I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talking about preserving this wonderful program, I am saying``What State of denial do you live in?'' because it is certainly not working in In fact, Pinal County in Arizonabriefly held the unfortunate distinction as the only county in America without a single insurer willing to offer plans on itsexchange, not a single one. Fortunately, a few months later, one stepped in--just one. Of the plans that were ultimately madeavailable to Arizonans on the exchange, the average policy came with a premium hike of nearly 50 percent--an average of nearly 50percent. With only one game in town, there was no shopping around for a better deal.  To help put this in perspective, I would like to compare the average cost of health care coverage in Arizona to one of themost important purchases a family will ever make, and that is a home. Throughout most counties in Arizona, it is now cheaper toput a roof over your family's head than it is to pay your monthly health insurance premium under  Let me say that again. Throughout most counties in Arizona, it is now cheaper to put a roof over your family's head than itis to pay your monthly health insurance premium under This is for Maricopa It is the county in which I liveand includes Homeowners can expect to pay nearly $500 more per month on their health insurance than they do on theirhouse--$500 more on their health insurance than they do on their house. This is for the ObamaCare silver plan premium. This is afamily--age 40 with two children. So that's about the median, and this is the median mortgage payment with respect to MaricopaCounty--$500 more.  Let's see the visual for Pima Pima County is home to Health care premiums ran an average family $100 moreper month than their mortgage. So in Pima County you are still paying more--$100 more for your health insurance premium than youare for your mortgage.  Then there is Pinal County, the third largest in According to Arizona's Department of Insurance, the averagepremium for a silver plan in Pinal County for the average family of four is over $1700. That is double the median monthlymortgage payment for the same county. If you live in Pinal County, AZ, you are paying twice as much for your health insurancepremium.  Keep in mind, we are talking about the premium, to say nothing of what happens when you go to the hospital or to your doctorand you have to pay deductibles that are through the roof or co-pays that people have never experienced before. So when theyutilize that coverage they paid for with their premium, they realize they can't afford that either.  The situation isn't unique to these counties, the three most populous counties in In all 15 of Arizona's counties,premiums for a family of 4 dramatically exceed the median monthly mortgage.  It is unacceptable for the Federal Government to force families to spend upwards of $1,700 per month of their hard-earnedincome on a substandard product without options or choices, only to then slap them with a draconian penalty that they simplycan't afford to pay for an untenable law.  Arizona is, without a doubt, ground zero for the structural failures that are plaguing insurance markets around the country.Insurance exchanges are on the verge of collapsing; premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses are skyrocketing; and ourhealth care system is in desperate need of reform. That is why I stand here today to introduce the Health Savings AccountExpansion  The Health Savings Account Expansion Act goes a long way toward reforming our health care system by putting consumers backin charge of their own health care. The bill provides individuals and families with freedom to choose the health care that bestmeets their needs and allows them to use their health savings accounts on medical products and services they value most.[[Page S61]]  HSAs give consumers greater control over their health care dollars by providing them with a tax-advantaged savings optionfor their medical expenses. This means that the dollars they work so hard to save can grow over time, tax free, and can bewithdrawn tax free for qualified medical expenses. The HSA Expansion Act strengthens this important tool by nearly tripling thearbitrarily low contribution limits, thus allowing for greater tax equity and more universal participation in The billwould then allow individuals to use these expanded HSAs to help cover the costs of their monthly health insurance premiums. Thisis a critically important feature, particularly for middle-class families whose incomes fall slightly above the qualifiedthreshold for subsidies but whose health insurance has become unaffordable.  In Arizona, I like to go to the gym in the morning, and I like to get on an exercise bike. By that bike is kind of a hallwaywhere people will walk by. Inevitably, in the morning, I will have a lineup of people who will stand to tell me their ObamaCarehorror stories--how much their premiums have gone up or that they no longer have any options or that they have had to pay thepenalty or that when they go to utilize their care, they simply can't afford the co-pays and deductibles. I can tell you, it issobering to hear these stories again and again and again.  In addition to further incentivizing prudent savings for health expenses, this legislation repeals existing restrictions putin place by ObamaCare on over-the-counter medications while also reducing the penalty for withdrawing HSA funds for nonqualifiedpurchases. These reforms will help streamline HSAs while also making them more user-friendly for consumers.  Arizonans are struggling. They are struggling under the weight of bureaucracy that is complicating their health caredecisions that are some of the most personal and important decisions individuals make for themselves and their families. If wehope to lift that burden off the backs of our constituents, we have to recognize that the key to reforming our health caresystem is not more government intervention; rather, it is allowing individuals the freedom to take back control of their healthcare and incentivizing prudent decisionmaking.  As the Senate looks to repeal this disastrous law and replace it with real reforms that would successfully lower health carecosts and improve choice, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this legislation is included in thosenegotiations.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgS60-2.txt,1633,FAST START UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,2017.0,4.0,March

988,topic-id,622,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, this week marks 7 years since ObamaCare was signed into law. We all remember the promises former President Obama and Washington Democrats made at the time.  Families were promised that their healthcare costs would go down. They were promised more choices and more competition. Small businesses and their employees were promised greater access to affordable health care.  But for 7 years, we have watched as all of those promises were broken. For 7 years, we have heard from families and small businesses across the country that have seen their healthcare costs skyrocket and their choices diminish.  Members of the House Education and the Workforce Committee recently heard from Scott Bollenbacher, an Indiana small-business owner with 11 full-time employees. The company has been forced to switch healthcare plans twice now under ObamaCare, and their only viable option this year was a plan with a 78 percent premium increase.  Mr.Bollenbacher is one of countless small-business owners struggling to make ends meet under a failed government takeover of health care. Because of ObamaCare, 300,000 small-business jobs have been destroyed, including nearly 8,000 in my home State of North                              {time}  1400  Additionally, an estimated 10,000 small businesses nationwide have closed their doors, and small business employees have lost $19 billion each year in wages.  It should come as no surprise that, since 2008, the share of small businesses with fewer than 10 employees offering health coverage has dropped 36 percent. It is not that they don't want to; it is that onerous mandates and regulations have made it simply unaffordable to do so.  Fortunately, relief is on the way. This week we are not only moving to repeal ObamaCare, we are also advancing positive reforms that promote affordable coverage for working families, including the Small Business Health Fairness  As its title implies, this important legislation is about fairness for small businesses and their employees. Today, small businesses are on an unfair playing field with larger companies and unions when it comes to health care. Large businesses have the ability to negotiate for more affordable healthcare costs for their employees, but small businesses do not have the same advantage. Because of their size, small businesses have limited bargaining power, which means their employees can end up paying more for health insurance.  With millions of Americans employed by a small business, it is long past time to level the playing field. That is exactly what this commonsense legislation is about. This bill would empower small businesses to band together through association health plans, or AHPs, to purchase high-quality health care at a lower cost for workers.  This bill represents a first step toward a more competitive health insurance market that crosses State lines. Under H.1101, small businesses in different States could join together through a group health plan. These plans would have strong protections and solvency requirements to ensure workers can count on healthcare coverage when they and their families need it.  What does all of this mean: more choices, more freedom, and more affordable health care for working families and small-business owners like Scott This is a better way, one that stands in stark contrast to ObamaCare's failed approach. Instead of more mandates, this bill empowers individuals to access the high-quality, affordable healthcare plan that meets their needs.  I want to thank my colleague Representative Sam Johnson for championing, for years, the positive reforms in this bill.  I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on H.1101 so we can level the playing field for small businesses and expand affordable health coverage for working families.

1006,topic-id,583,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent a lot of their time extolling ObamaCare and indicating that we should just stay with what we have, but we all know that ObamaCare is failing.  Republicans are on a rescue mission. We truly do have a better way. As some of my colleagues have stated, we will be passing the American Health Care Act tomorrow. What we are doing here with this bill is something we could not include in that legislation that will round out what it is we want to do with keeping our promise in what we promised last year in our program called A Better  Let me just talk a little bit about the failures of As my colleagues have said, all the promises were broken: if you wanted to keep your doctor, you could keep your doctor; if you wanted to keep your healthcare plan, you could keep your healthcare plan. Those promises were the most obvious ones that went away. The cost of health care would be going down, and none of that happened.  Mr.Speaker, in addition to that, there is a 25 percent average increase in premiums this year for millions of Americans trapped in ObamaCare, healthcare.gov exchanges. Nearly one-third of U.counties have only one insurer offering exchange plans; 4.7 million Americans were kicked off their healthcare plans by There was $1 trillion in new taxes, mostly falling on families and job creators; 18 failed ObamaCare co-ops out of 23, which my colleague from Tennessee so eloquently pointed out.  These were established as an alternative to the public option. Those healthcare co-ops collapsed, costing[[Page H2327]]taxpayers nearly 1.9 billion and forcing patients to find new insurance; $53 billion in new regulations requiring more than 176,800,000 hours of paperwork. ObamaCare regulations are driving up healthcare premiums and costing small-business employees at least $19 billion annually.  As I said in the hearing that we had on this bill, the Democrats want a coercive system. Republicans want a system based on freedom.  Today we have an opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of hardworking men and women who are employed by small business. We have an opportunity to deliver much-needed relief to small-business owners who are trying to do the right thing and provide high-quality healthcare coverage for their employees. This legislation represents a truly positive reform that will help lower healthcare costs for working families and put small businesses on a fair and level playing field.  Small businesses are the backbone of our Nation's economy, and there is no reason why they should be at a disadvantage when it comes to finding an affordable healthcare plan. They should be treated in the same fashion as larger businesses and have the ability to craft healthcare plans that meet the needs of their employees. If we want to encourage small businesses to offer health care at a lower cost to workers, this is one commonsense step we can make.  Again, I thank our colleague, Congressman Sam Johnson, a true patriot and servant of this country, for his longtime support of this legislation.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act, which will help more Americans access high-quality, affordable health care.

1087,topic-id,2779,"Mr.President, I have to start this over fresh. I don't know if the Congressional Record needs to have this first half paragraph twice, but so be it.  On February 3, 2009, Tom Daschle, President Obama's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, withdrew his nomination because he hadn't paid his taxes on his car service. On January 9, 2001, Linda Chavez, President George Bush's nominee for the Department of Labor, withdrew her nomination after questions were raised about her decision to shelter an undocumented immigrant. Most recently, Vincent Viola, President Trump's nominee to be the Secretary of the Army, withdrew his nomination after it proved too difficult for him to distance himself from his business ties.  Congressman Price's conflicted financial investments and his affiliation with conspiracy-theory-peddling extremists should be enough to disqualify his nomination. On top of that, Congressman Price's policy agenda squarely contradicts what the majority of the American people want and the key promises President Trump made during his campaign. It is, frankly, hard to believe that we are seriously considering someone who has advanced policies that would privatize Medicare, gut Medicaid, and rip coverage away from millions of  For all of these reasons, I strongly oppose Congressman Price's nomination for Secretary of Health and Human  Let's take these issues one by one.  First, Congressman Price's stock trades. Public documents show that between 1993 and 2012, Congressman Price owned shares in tobacco companies worth tens of thousands of dollars. At the same time, Congressman Price voted against landmark legislation in 2009 that gave the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco and bring down the death toll inflicted by tobacco products. That means Congressman Price, a physician who swore to uphold the Hippocratic oath of ``do no harm,'' voted against public health and for Big This is the person who is slated to become the next Secretary of Health and Human Services, someone who personally profited from increased sales of deadly, addictive products.[[Page S1026]]  When asked about this during his hearing in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Congressman Price's best defense was that his broker made the stock trades on behalf without his knowledge.  Here is the problem with that defense:  First, Congressman Price annually reported his financial holdings, signing off on documents acknowledging his investments in tobacco companies, meaning that he would have knowledge of the fact that his vote to block tobacco regulation could have a direct financial benefit to him.  Second, these were not investments in diversified funds; these were individual stocks that he owned for nearly 20 years and that he reported paid him dividends. Let me repeat that. Congressman Price, medical doctor, owned individual tobacco company stocks that paid him dividends.  Owning tens of thousands of dollars of tobacco stocks while voting to help tobacco companies was not Congressman Price's only questionable investment. In late December, the Wall Street Journal reported that over the past 4 years, Congressman Price has traded stocks worth more than $300,000 in about 40 health-related companies while at the same time serving on the House Ways and Means Committee, where he drafted and cosponsored legislation that could affect his investments.  Let's talk about one example that is particularly troubling. Congressman Price made his largest ever stock purchase in a company called Innate Immunotherapeutics, a small biotech company based in This is a company that has only one experimental therapy in the early stages of testing, has never generated revenues from drug sales. It is not exactly a household name. How did Congressman Price get in on this sweetheart deal? He was told about Innate by Congressman Chris Collins, who, in addition to being a Member of the House of Representatives, serves on the board of directors for Innate Immunotherapeutics and is the company's largest shareholder.  The Wall Street Journal reported that Congressman Price was part of a small group of fewer than 20 U.investors who participated in the private stock sale. The New York Times and the Buffalo News reported that many of those people had close ties to Congressman Collins, including Collins' chief of staff, a prominent DC lobbyist, and several of Congressman Collins' campaign contributors.  On August 31, Congressman Price reported that as part of this special private stock sale, he bought about 400,000 shares of Innate stock for as little as 18 cents a share. That same day, the stock was trading on the Australian Stock Exchange for the equivalent of 31 cents per share. That is a 42-percent difference--42 percent below the market price--and Congressman Price now stands to make a profit of more than $200,000. That is quite a stock tip.  Richard Painter, George Bush's chief ethics lawyer, describes Price's stock trades as ``crazy. . . . We wouldn't have put up with anybody in the Bush administration buying and selling health care stocks.'' Painter went on to explain that ``if you, as a member of Congress, buy and sell health care stocks at the same time you are possessing non-public information about that legislation, you are taking the risk of being charged with criminal insider trading.''  Let me repeat that. Mr.Painter, who was George Bush's chief ethics official, suggested that Mr.Price's actions risk a criminal insider trading charge.  Congressman Price could have directed his broker to stay away from tobacco stocks. He could have directed his broker to stay away from health care stocks or individual stocks altogether given that health care was one of his legislative priorities. But he did not. Why would Congressman Price take this risk?  My colleagues and I have sent Congressman Price a number of letters asking for more information about his stock trades and investments. If this is all aboveboard, then Congressman Price should have nothing to hide. I also submitted questions for the record as a member of the HELP In response to all of these questions, I have received nothing. It makes no sense that his nomination has been brought to the floor despite his refusal to respond to committee questions.  Congressman Price has demonstrated a lack of judgment with his stock trades and now is stonewalling the committee, refusing to answer our inquiries, but Congressman Price's questionable stock trades aren't the only area raising red flags.  My second set of concerns stems from Congressman Price's longstanding association with conspiracy-peddling, anti-science extremists. For more than 25 years, Congressman Price has been a dues-paying member of the Association of American Physicians and He has spoken at the organization's conferences and even described the organization's executive director as one of his personal heroes. This organization is way out of the mainstream. It promotes anti-vaccine pseudoscience and denies the scientific fact that HIV causes It is an organization that blames ``swarms'' of immigrant children for disease and has published scientifically discredited theories linking abortion to breast cancer. At one point, it even accused President Barack Obama of hypnotizing voters with ``neuro-linguistic programming.''  Let me repeat that. It accused President Barack Obama of hypnotizing voters with ``neuro-linguistic programming.''  That is not all. The statement of principles for the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons has an entire section devoted to urging doctors to refuse to participate in Medicare, in which it says the effect of such government-run programs is ``evil, and participation in carrying out his provisions is, in our opinion, immoral.'' Congressman Price--the person poised to become the next Secretary of Health and Human Services, the person responsible for leading Medicare--has been an active, engaged member of this organization for 25 years.  Just in case you don't think he has bought into these ideas, let me read you what Congressman Price wrote in 2009 in an op-ed: ``I can attest that nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.''  Since Congressman Price will not answer my questions, I will pose this to one of my Republican colleagues: How are the American people supposed to trust Congressman Price as Secretary of Health and Human Services given that he has belonged to an organization for over 25 years that has such blatant disregard for science and a propensity for putting partisanship and ideology above evidence?  Lastly and most importantly, the policy reforms that Congressman Price has put forward are so extreme that they should be disqualifying in and of themselves. As an editorial recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine stated, ``As compared with his predecessors' actions, Price's record demonstrates less concern for the sick, the poor, and the health of the public and much greater concern for the economic well-being of their physician caregivers.'' That is from the New England Journal of  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       [From the New England Journal of Medicine; 12, 2017]Care for the Vulnerable vs. Cash for the Powerful--Trump's Pick for HHS         (By Sherry Glied, Ph.and Richard Frank, Ph.D)       Representative Tom Price of Georgia, an orthopedic surgeon,      will be President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary      of health and human services (HHS). In the 63-year history of      the HHS Department and its predecessor, the Department of      Health, Education, and Welfare, only two previous secretaries      have been physicians. Otis Bowen, President Ronald Reagan's      second HHS secretary, engineered the first major expansion of      Medicare, championed comparative effectiveness research and,      with Surgeon General Everett Koop, led the fight against      HIV-Louis Sullivan, HHS secretary under President      George H.Bush, focused his attention on care for      vulnerable populations, campaigned against tobacco use, led      the development of federally sponsored clinical guidelines,      and introduced President Bush's health insurance plan, which      incorporated income-related tax credits and a system of risk      adjustment. In their work at HMS, both men, serving in      Republican administrations, drew on a long tradition of      physicians as advocates for the most vulnerable, defenders of[[Page S1027]]     public health, and enthusiastic proponents of scientific      approaches to clinical care.       Tom Price represents a different tradition. Ostensibly, he      emphasizes the importance of making our health care system      ``more responsive and affordable to meet the needs of      America's patients and those who care for them. But as      compared with his predecessors' actions, Price's record      demonstrates less concern for the sick, the poor, and the      health of the public and much greater concern for the      economic wellbeing of their physician caregivers.       Price has sponsored legislation that supports making armor-     piercing bullets more accessible and opposing regulations on      cigars, and he has voted against regulating tobacco as a      drug. His voting record shows long-standing opposition to      policies aimed at improving access to care for the most      vulnerable In 2007-2008, during the presidency of      George Bush, he was one of only 47 representatives to      vote against the Domenici Wellstone Mental Health Parity      and Addiction Equity Act, which improved coverage for      mental health care in private insurance plans. He also      voted against funding for combating AIDS, malaria, and      tuberculosis; against expansion of the State Children's      Health Insurance Program; and in favor of allowing      hospitals to turn away Medicaid and Medicare patients      seeking nonemergency care if they could not afford      copayments.       Price favors converting Medicare to a premium-support      system and changing the structure of Medicaid to a block      grant--policy options that shift financial risk from the      federal government to vulnerable populations. He also opposed      reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and has      voted against legislation prohibiting job discrimination      against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people      and against enforcement of laws against anti-LGBT hate      crimes. He favors amending the Constitution to outlaw same-     sex marriage.       In addition, he has been inconsistent in supporting      investments in biomedical science. He opposes stem-cell      research and voted against expanding the National Institutes      of Health budget and against the recently enacted 21st      Century Cures Act, showing particular animus toward the      Cancer       Price has also been a vociferous opponent of the Affordable      Care Act (ACA) and a leader of the repeal-and-replace      movement. His proposal for replacing the ACA is H.2300,      the Empowering Patients First Act, which would eliminate the      ACA's Medicaid expansion and replace its subsidies with flat      tax credits based on age, not income ($1,200 per year for      someone 18 to 35 years of age; $3,000 for someone 50 or      older, with an additional one-time credit of $1,000 toward a      health savings account). Price's plan is regressive: it      offers much greater subsidies relative to income for      purchasers with high incomes and much more meager subsidies      for those with low incomes. In today's market, these credits      would pay only about one third of the premium of a low-cost      plan, leaving a 30-year-old with a premium bill for $2,532,      and a 60-year-old with a bill for $5,916--along with a      potential out-of-pocket liability of as much as $7,000. By      contrast, subsidies under the ACA are based on income and the      price of health insurance. Today, a low-income person (with      an income of 200% of the federal poverty level) pays, on      average, a premium of $1,528 per year (regardless of age) for      a plan with an out-of-pocket maximum of $2,350, and that      payment does not change even if health insurance premiums      rise.       To put the plan's subsidies into perspective, consider that      in 1992, when per capita health expenditures were just one      third of what they are today, President Bush and HHS      Secretary Sullivan proposed a slightly larger individual tax      credit ($1,250) for the purchase of insurance than Price      proposes today. Even in 1992, analysts reported that the      credit would be insufficient to induce most people to buy      coverage.       The Price plan would eliminate the guaranteed-issue and      community-rating requirements in the ACA and create anemic      substitutes for these commitments to access to comprehensive      coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions. These      replacements include an extension to the nongroup market of      the continuous-coverage rules that have long existed in the      group market with little benefit; penalties on reentering the      market for anyone who has had a break in coverage; and a very      limited offer of funding for states to establish high-risk      pools. In combination with relatively small tax credits,      these provisions are likely to lead low-income and even      middle-class healthy people to forgo seeking coverage until a      serious health problem develops. Without the income- and      premium-based subsidies in the ACA acting as market      stabilizers, Price's provisions would erode the non-group      health insurance market.       Price's plan would withdraw almost all the ACA's federal      consumer-protection regulations, including limits on insurer      profits and requirements that plans cover essential health      benefits. By allowing the sale of health insurance across      state lines, the plan would also effectively eliminate all      state regulation of health insurance plans, encouraging a      race to the bottom among insurance carriers. Finally, Price      would fund his plan by capping the tax exclusion for      employer-sponsored health insurance at $8,000 per individual      or $20,000 per family. These caps are well below those      legislated through the Cadillac tax in the ACA, a provision      that Price himself has voted to repeal.       In sum, Price's replacement proposal would make it much      more difficult for low-income Americans to afford health      insurance. It would divert federal tax dollars to people who      can already buy individual coverage without subsidies and      substantially reduce protections for those with preexisting      conditions. The end result would be a shaky market dominated      by health plans that offer limited coverage and high cost      sharing.       Whereas Price's actions to date have not reflected the      tradition of the physician as advocate for the poor and      vulnerable, they do harken back to an earlier tradition in      American medicine: the physician advocate as protector of the      guild. His Empowering Patients First Act would directly      advance physicians' economic interests by permitting them to      bill Medicare patients for amounts above those covered by the      Medicare fee schedule and allowing them to join together and      negotiate with insurance carriers without violating antitrust      statutes. Both these provisions would increase physicians'      incomes at the expense of patients. Price has consistently      fought strategies for value-based purchasing and guideline      development, opposing the use of bundled payments for lower-     extremity joint replacements and proposing that physician      specialty societies hold veto power over the release of      comparative effectiveness findings. These positions reduce      regulatory burdens on physicians at the cost of increased      inefficiency and reduced quality of care--and reflect a      striking departure from the ethos of his physician      predecessors, Secretaries Bowen and       The HHS Department oversees a broad set of health programs      that touch about half of all Over five decades and      the administrations of nine presidents, both Democratic and      Republican secretaries have used these programs to protect      the most vulnerable The proposed nomination of Tom      Price to HHS highlights a sharp contrast between this      tradition of compassionate leadership and the priorities of      the incoming administration.

Price has also been a champion of efforts to repeal the Affordable Care The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that if the ACA is repealed, nearly 20 million Americans will lose their health care coverage immediately, with the number growing to 32 million over the next 10 years, and 300,000 of those individuals live in my State of Let me tell you about at least two of them.

I have yet to see their plan. What I have seen Congressman Price advocate for so far is pretty awful. His proposals would strip away coverage for people with preexisting conditions, strip away preventive health benefits, strip away protections from annual and lifetime limits, strip away coverage for young adults. Moreover, Congressman Price views Medicaid and Medicare as government expenditures to be cut, rather than lifelines to millions of seniors, disabled populations, children and families. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Congressman Price introduced proposals to cut funding for Medicaid by more than $2 trillion.  In my State, Medicaid provides health insurance to 14 percent of the residents. That includes two out of five low-income individuals, one in four children, one in two people with disabilities, and one in two nursing home residents. Think about that. One in two[[Page S1028]]people in nursing homes are covered by Medicaid in my  What is going to happen to these people--our parents, our children, our spouses, our families--if Congressman Price and his colleagues succeed in slashing Medicaid's budget? I can guarantee you, it will not be kind and it will not be just and Americans are going to lose out.  Congressman Price's assault on our health care system doesn't end there. He wants to slash Medicare's budget by hundreds of billions of dollars, undermining our basic guarantee of coverage to our Nation's seniors, and no wonder. Let me remind you, this is the same person who wrote: ``I can attest that nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the Federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.''  Do we really want the person who wrote this to be running Medicare? Price's determination to gut Medicaid and Medicare is directly opposed by the vast majority of Americans and in direct opposition to President Trump's campaign promise never to cut Medicaid or  When Tom Daschle withdrew from consideration for HHS Secretary, he talked about the challenges of health care reform and said:       This work will require a leader who can operate with the      full faith of Congress and the American people, and without      distraction.

1119,topic-id,758,"I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. I similarly thank him for many nights coming to this floor and defending values that are not only uniquely American, but which are unmistakably conservative. I appreciate him for being the fire keeper on this floor for those values and those principles for constituents in his district and in mine and all throughout this great country.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of my fellow northwest Floridians, brave airmen who serve at Eglin Air Force Base and Duke Field and skilled[[Page H731]]aviators who train out at NAS Pensacola and Whiting Field and some of the planet Earth's most hardened and successful warriors in the 7th Special Forces Group and those who also deploy out of Hurlburt Field in northwest They are the best among us and they often inspire the best within us as a consequence of their patriotic service.  So when I encounter them at townhall meetings or in church or at grocery stores, I often ask: How do you do it? How do you leave your family, your home, your community, risk your life, your health to go to places that many Americans couldn't point to on a map and to fight against an enemy who is evil and vicious and determined and increasingly equipped?  And almost to a man and woman, they tell me: We fight them over there so that we don't have to feel the consequences over here in  It is that spirit that I join in supporting and honoring in my full-throated and unequivocal support of President Trump's most recent executive order so that we are not devaluing the service of my constituents by risking the lives and the health and security of Americans here in this great country.  Mr.Speaker, I wish so much that President Trump's executive order were unnecessary. I wish that we lived in a world that was more stable and secure, where America could welcome with open arms anyone from anywhere for whatever reason at whatever cost. But the reality is that American taxpayers can't pay for everything, and American families cannot shoulder the risks of insecurity for the consequences of terrible foreign policy decisions that have been made over the last 8 years.  Maybe if the former President hadn't withdrawn from the Middle East, these regions would be more secure. Maybe if our policies hadn't so destabilized north Africa that we had failed state after failed state functioning as a caldron of Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism, this order would not have been necessary. But, alas, it is necessary.  I think it is important to distinguish between the realities of this executive order and the hysteria that has been created by the media. Some would believe, if they were to look only at media reports, that this was a ban on all Muslims who would seek to come to this country.  Let me affirm: our war, our conflict is not with the Muslim faith. As a matter of fact, this consequence, this conflict we are engaged in is all about the future of that faith and religion, and I am hopeful as a Christian that we are able to forge a lasting peace among all people on The reality is that there are more than 50 countries that are majority Muslim, and most of those countries will see no impact as a consequence of this most recent executive order. But there are seven countries--I guess it is perhaps a bit generous to call them countries, Mr.Speaker, because they are failed states that function to do very little other than to breed more terror and discontent and anti-But from those seven countries, the President has taken the position that we ought to take a closer look, we ought to have a belt-and-suspenders approach to the security of American families. Of the more than 325,000 people who have recently come to the United States from foreign countries since the President's most recent executive order, about 100 have been kept for additional screening, more thorough review, and a more thoughtful approach.  So as I stand here with the gentleman from Texas, Mr.Speaker, know that I am in full support of President Trump's most recent order. When I go back to northwest Florida and I look into the eyes of the warfighters, the airmen, the sailors, and the patriots, I will know that in this House there were those who were willing to stand with them, honor their service and sacrifice, and do everything possible to put America first and to keep Americans safe.

1121,topic-id,592,"I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. I believe his question highlights an increasing problem that we have had for the last 8 years that I hope we will cure, and that is the politicization of the important work that the executive branch ought to be doing on behalf of the American people.  The Justice Department should not be Republican or It should stand up for the rights of all Americans, the laws that are enacted by this Congress, and the orders that are issued by the We shouldn't have circumstances where we have to wonder whether or not the people who are tasked to uphold the law, as the gentleman from Texas did as a jurist and did in a very colored legal career--we shouldn't have to worry about that. But, in fact, for the last 8 years, that has been the problem. That is perhaps one of the reasons why the Senate should act with due haste in confirming Jeff Sessions as the Attorney General, so we go back to a system that is governed by the rule of law, not the rule of popular opinion or politics or one particular ideology.  More specifically to the gentleman from Texas' question, I believe that what undermines the Justice Department is this partisan tilt, are these lenses through which many of President Obama's appointees evaluate the great questions that impact the security of  The gentleman from Texas correctly points out that what President Trump has done is hardly unprecedented. In 1979, President Carter, hardly one that is held out among conservatives as a great standard-bearer on foreign affairs and a strong America, was one who recognized that there were unique challenges in a unique period of time from those who may be coming to the United States from Iran, and he took action.                              {time}  2045  Similarly, in 2011, President Obama was concerned that, during an act of conflict with Iraq, there may be circumstances where people would come from Iraq to do harm to Americans on American soil, and so he took action. I guess the difference with President Trump is that he is willing to take action immediately, and that we are not going to have a Presidency with a bunch of handwringing and bedwetting over the questions that impact the safety of Americans and the dignity of this country and its borders.  President Obama was unwilling to heed the counsel of those in his own administration who indicated that there were insufficient vetting procedures in place previously. And so it strikes me as only reasonable, Mr.Speaker, that a new President coming in, having heard that there were inadequate screening procedures, not from a Trump appointee but from an appointee of President Obama, that we would take a finite period of time, 90 days, and we would analyze what would be the appropriate protocols, screening procedures, and vetting algorithms that we would use to ensure that America's interests were placed first.[[Page H732]]  I am glad we have a President who puts this country first; I am glad we have a President who does not view himself as a citizen of the world more than he views himself as a citizen of this country; and I am glad that he takes that responsibility seriously.  And to answer the gentleman's question, I would say that we ought to have a Justice Department that is led by those who will follow the rule of law, who will defend the rights of Americans, and who will stand up for the security of this country.

Not long ago, we heard members of the Congressional Black Caucus take to this floor and make the argument that it was hypocritical and improper that in President Trump's order and in the follow-on execution of that order by the Department of Homeland Security that there would be some preference given to religious minorities in these predominantly Muslim countries, particularly Christians, who are often persecuted, harmed, or killed. In many circumstances in which the President has allowed for through exceptions to his order, there will be people from these seven countries allowed into the United States as a consequence of the persecution that they feel and that they endure as a consequence of their Christian faith.  And so my question to the gentleman from Texas is whether or not he shares the Congressional Black Caucus' view that it is improper to treat Christians who are being discriminated against in these predominantly Muslim countries differently and to give them the opportunity to immigrate to the United States of America and realize freedom in the absence of this terrible persecution that they feel?

1118,topic-id,1622,"Mr.Speaker, we are off to a fast start this year under the Trump administration. It is difficult, apparently, for some of the press to keep up with how quickly some of the things are going.  I did want to make clear something that has been completely muddled by the mainstream media. They keep wondering why they continue to lose out to news channels like FOX News and why some of the conservative news sources online do so well compared to the leftwing sources. It is because a majority of people really are seeking truth, really are seeking answers.  I realize that is not true for everywhere. The areas that Hillary Clinton won are basically relegated to the edges, the fringes of the country: around the coasts and southern valley, Chicago, Detroit, and some of those areas. It is really the fringe party.  After someone--anyone with the least amount of even a small modicum of fairness--looks at the actual executive order that Donald Trump issued, it seems eminently reasonable. When looking at it, for example, compared to orders signed by a President named Obama, a President named Carter--I couldn't find any CNN, MSNBC, or anything like CNBC, and I could have missed that somebody did break through all the misrepresentations of those networks and actually point out,[[Page H730]]because sometimes I am going by and I don't have the sound on and I will be reading the subtext, but you would think that someone in one of those networks would make a big deal out of the fact that Muslims were not banned under the Trump executive order. Yet people all over the world and all over this country are still under the mistaken impression they can trust certain networks. They still haven't figured out that they can't.  They see that, my gosh, the President has banned I actually have the executive order here because, just as I read ObamaCare before I voted against it, I have read the President's executive order. I made highlights in bold on some things. I saw that there is no reference--not one--to Muslims, to It is just not there. So it is a total misrepresentation.  Now, to try to cover for the way the executive order news is being spun, some of them, to try to grasp back just a small portion of something resembling fairness, would say the words ``Muslim-majority country banned,'' try to bring it back so they can work in the word ``Muslim'' when it wasn't about religion at all. It is about the safety of the United States, the people we are sworn to protect, the Constitution that we raise our right hand and we swear to protect. We just took that oath earlier this month, and already it is forgotten.  The refugee program that President Trump has paused is the same one that ISIS terrorists have repeatedly vowed that they are infiltrating, and they are intending to use it to kill The President is acting temporarily and prudently to give his administration and this Congress the time it needs to properly evaluate the refugee program and reform it to ensure that we help legitimate refugees and ensure the safety, as much as is possible, of the American people.  When an FBI Director warns that they have no information from a country with which to compare identity information that refugees have or present or even orally convey, then I would think at some point we would take that information seriously from the sworn testimony.  Now, I realize that the past administration has played fast and loose when you keep telling the American people and the Members of Congress that the attack in Benghazi was all about a video, and you even try to cover that by encouraging the producer of the video to be arrested and put in jail to help with this misrepresentation of the truth. Then I guess, under those circumstances, you don't take testimony from the prior administration Cabinet members all that seriously because you know that they have been out there and misrepresented the truth before.  I don't know if Klein's book about, I think it was, the blood feud between the Obamas and the Clintons was right, but there had to be a reason that Hillary Clinton did not come out on the Sunday shows after Benghazi and make this claim that was adverse to what she emailed her daughter and what she emailed to the President of Libya, saying that it was an attack. She didn't mention a video because it wasn't about a video. She knew that. I realize that, between the concussion, the problems, she may not remember that, but she knew it at the time.  According to that book, she called and talked to former President Bill Clinton; and she was encouraged not to go public and say it was about a video, that, in essence, that was indefensible. Nobody in their right mind was going to believe that, so she couldn't be out there.  There were thoughts being entertained of maybe resigning rather than going out and trying to defend that story, but, gee, they realized that if she was going to run for President in 2016 and she resigned right before the election in 2012, it would have likely cost President Obama a second term, and then Democrats would not be very kind and forgiving even though that would have been a stance based on truth and honor. If it cost the Presidency in 2016, it was just not something that could be done.                              {time}  2030  Apparently, according to the book and his sources that he says are close friends of the people involved, they decided the best way was not to resign and cost the President the reelection in 2012, but refuse under all circumstances to go on the Sunday shows and try to tell America six times that the attack at Benghazi was not planned; it was just instantaneous that arose from a protest over the video, but just don't go make that representation. Make that clear to the administration you are not going to do that, and then let the chips fall where they may. Because we haven't been able to figure out outside that representation in the book, why in the world did Susan Rice come out and say all that?  That should have been Hillary Clinton's role. So he provides the excuse or the reasoning. So Susan Rice goes out and over and over on Sunday shows, it was all about a video.  Well, I know from my days as a judge hearing of incidents where someone perhaps in a company that was not being honestly run would keep somebody in the dark so they could go out and make certain representations. The person really didn't want to know what the real truth was so they could come out and say with a clear conscience, here is what happened, and that wasn't it. So it may well be Susan Rice just did not know that her statements were lies. And if she didn't know, then they are not lies; they are just falsehoods she didn't know were false.  We don't know, but it is an interesting representation. And it still brings us back to the fact that in certain countries in the world, we don't have adequate information to check individuals coming in against. No matter how much the credibility of the FBI Director may have been harmed last summer when he came out and made a totally political move of outlining that Hillary Clinton basically committed a crime, but no reasonable prosecutor would pursue this, that is my interpretation of what he said basically, and those who have prosecuted--I have prosecuted. You know, there are a lot of prosecutors who would take that. But he made the statement. So I figured that was pretty political.  Despite that, when he says, you know, look, we had some information from some of these countries we got from their governments so that when we see their passport, we see some of this information, we could say, all right, we can check it against their government's records: What do you have on this person?  But we had heard from Syria, for example, that they had actually taken over facilities that could print official passports. So they could print a totally fictitious passport because they have the means to do it. They have captured that. Not only do we not have a cooperating government, but we have no information. We don't have fingerprints off IEDs like we did from Iraq, and most of the time we had cooperation so we could compare this information. But we had nothing in some of these countries that could give us the assurance that the leaders of radical Islamist groups were not doing exactly what they said they were, and that is infiltrating the refugees with people who were going to come in and kill They said they were doing that in At some point we need to take these things seriously.  I am thrilled to death to have a President--fortunately it is nice being thrilled to death instead of being beaten or knifed or hit with a truck. But I am thrilled to have a President who is taking seriously the things that the Obama administration found should be taken seriously. Let's be clear, no one is being discriminated against in the President's executive order based on religion. Christians, Jews, Muslims, any religious group, agnostics, atheists from the countries designated for a pause--it is not a ban; it is a pause so we can look better at what we need to do.

1120,topic-id,258,"Mr.Speaker, as I told my friend from Florida, I am honored anytime he comes to the floor to speak because he knows what he is talking about. When I was a judge back in Texas, a young prosecutor also shared his first name, and he is now the He is as sincere and intelligent. Anyway, it is just an honor to serve with Mr.I wondered if he might yield for a question.  The Attorney General--I am sorry, this is the acting Attorney General because the Senate is dragging its feet on one of its own, Jeff Sessions, but this came out today in The Hill that ``Acting Attorney General Sally Yates sent a letter Monday ordering the Justice Department not to defend President Trump's executive order . . .'' even though it is an order that basically has been done by the Obama administration--except President Obama had done it one country that is included in the seven for 6 months instead of 3--and also by President I don't think he was a Anyway, these things have been done before, and the letter says we are not going to defend it.  This story from Lydia Wheeler today says: ``Yates's''--the acting Attorney General--``decision suggests she does not want to put the credibility of the Justice Department behind the order. . . .''  I wanted to ask the gentleman from Florida, does he have concerns that, if the Justice Department were to defend this executive order, it would hurt the credibility of the Justice Department when acting under its Democratic leadership?

1122,topic-id,432,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Great points. And I wish I were as articulate.  I have been critical of the majority leader in the Senate, Senator McConnell, but this story is from CNS Majority Leader McConnell says: ``Well, I think it's a good idea to tighten the vetting process.''  And he went on to say: ``I don't want to criticize them''--the Trump administration--``for improving vetting.''  And I applaud the majority leader for not running for the hills when all of the media does their typical thing and just goes freaking out. But, we found this story goes also, I think, to illustrate the point Mr.Gaetz was making. This is from Daniel Horowitz's article today. It turns out that 17 sitting Democrats in the House and Senate voted to ban visas from some Muslim countries and that law still exists today. Of course, this was back in 2002. And back at that time, you had some quite conservative Democrats in the House and Senate, people like Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Dianne Feinstein, you know, real bulwarks of conservatism, who voted to ban visas from these type countries, of the Muslim majority countries, as CNN would like to call them. Gee, names like Cardin, Markey, Menendez, Murray, Nelson of Florida, Reed of Rhode Island, Sanders of Wow, there is another conservative, Sanders of Schumer, another strong hearted conservative. Stabenow, Wyden, Durbin, Feinstein, Leahy, and  So it kind of begs the question: If this is only a temporary ban from countries until we can ascertain better vetting, how much worse is it for these 73 sitting Democrats to have voted for a permanent ban? That is rather shocking.  And it is notable that President Obama, not exactly consistent with former President George Bush who went 8 years without coming out and making formal criticisms--well, President Obama has said he is very heartened by all of the anti-Trump protests. We even have Democrats here in the House who said: `` . . . as we've heard before, the President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.'' Because I know my friend here in the House would not misrepresent the truth. So it just shows, obviously, he hasn't read this executive order that makes very clear it is not banning a religion or a faith, it is countries where we don't have enough information.  And I just find it interesting that we are standing on the side of 73 Democrats--Markey, Bernie Sanders, Feinstein, people like that--who thought it was a good idea when they were closer to 9/11.

1125,topic-id,972,"Mr.Speaker, my friend makes such a great point. I think the way this country has, in recent years, been so discriminatory as has been the United Nations against Christian refugees, I am afraid that this United States of America could be called to account for the slaughter of so many Christians who we could have helped. And as we know from the numbers, there are a lot of excuses by the U.as to why they are not helping an equal percentage of Christians to the percentage of makeup of those countries they are coming from. There have been all kinds of excuses.  But even our Secretary of State, under the last administration, John Kerry, admitted there was a genocide going on of Christians in the Middle Now, there is not a genocide going on of Muslims in these countries. There are Sunni versus Shia and vice versa, and there are clashes within the Islamic religion, but there is not a genocide of all Muslims in any of these countries. And yet there is clearly a genocide clear enough for John Kerry to note.  So one of the most heinous and outrageous answers that I have heard a U.general secretary make was--well, I didn't hear it, I read--that the U.general secretary was asked about a year and a half or so ago, when he was in charge of the United Nations' refugee program, and this issue of the U.not helping the same percentage, in fact, just helping a fraction of the percentage of Christians who exist in these countries, his response was basically that it was important to leave these Christians in the areas where they are being killed because they have historical precedence in those areas.  So we are going to bring Muslims out, according to the U.general secretary, because they didn't have as much historical significance, whereas the Christians who are being wiped out--throats cut, heads cut off, crucified, women raped, and just the most heinous of crimes committed against individuals are taking place--our U.general secretary and, apparently under our past President, the State Department felt like it was important to leave Christians there in larger percentages than existed among the refugees of Muslim because, hey, they have been there a long while, so let's leave them there, which ultimately means they will all be slaughtered. It is quite distressing.  But here is a point made by George Rasley today in an article, ``President Trump Stops Suicidal Immigration Policy . . . ,'' where he points out that:  ``Had President Trump's policy been in place participants in many Muslim terrorist incidents would have been prevented from entering our country, for example the Ohio State University attack by Somali `refugee' Abdul Razak Ali Artan, the September 2016 stabbing attack in a mall in Cloud, Minnesota, and two foiled bomb plots--one in Portland, Oregon, in 2010 and one in Columbus, Ohio, in 2000.  ``Indeed, some 74 terrorist incidents have been attributed to Somali Muslims alone. And while the Obama administration did its best to cover-up the immigration status of the perpetrators we know that at least 13 of them were admitted to the U.as `refugees.'  ``Fourteen were legal permanent residents at the time of their radical activity, and 10 were naturalized citizens.''  So it is quite disturbing.  And by the way, as a result of the Kentucky case where we had two refugees who had been brought in from Iraq, it was reported, in 2013, that in 2009, two al Qaeda Iraq terrorists were living as refugees in Bowling Green, Anyway, because of that discovery, the Obama State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for 6 months in 2011.  So I do think it is important, as people keep screaming around here, what I believe as a Christian, Jesus said: The greatest commandment is to love God, and the second, he said, is to love each other. But he had also stated: Love thy neighbor as thy self.  And what some have not realized, if you don't like America, if you don't[[Page H733]]like Americans, if you don't like our own country, and you don't love yourself, it is a bit hard to love your neighbor as yourself if you don't love yourself.  I think it is time Americans stood up and thanked God for--and/or thank whatever force they may be, some would say, or agnostic, whatever--just thank your lucky stars, but be thankful we have had the opportunities to live in the greatest country in the history of the world. And the only one who has truly given lives and treasure, not for imperialist sake but simply for freedom sake, for liberty sake, for people we didn't know, but we wanted them to share in freedom and liberty. That is a rare country. It has been a blessed and blessed country.  And I think it is important that if we are going to continue or get back to being that city on a hill, glowing that draws people to it, that would draw people to the Statue of Liberty, you have to be a nation of laws, you have to protect the people in the country, otherwise we go back to the Dark Ages, and we become a country that no one wants to come risk their lives to get to because there is nothing special.                              {time}  2100  We squandered our opportunities and refused to take up our responsibilities to protect this Nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1109,topic-id,2857,"Mr.President, I rise today to join my colleagues in opposing Congressman Tom Price's nomination to be the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  Every American deserves the opportunity to have quality, affordable health insurance coverage to help them live healthy and productive lives. Having health care is not just critical to the freedom, dignity, and well-being of our citizens but also to the strength of our economy.  As Governor, I worked with Democrats and Republicans in New Hampshire to expand health insurance coverage--including coverage for substance use disorder and behavioral health services--to tens of thousands of Granite  We need to bring this same bipartisan approach to the We know that there are serious challenges in our health care system that must be fixed, and we need to work across party lines to support commonsense improvements to move our Nation's health care system forward, not rip health insurance coverage away from millions of  This is why I cannot support Congressman Price's nomination. Throughout his time in office, Congressman Price has promoted policies that would undermine the health care that so many in my State and across our Nation depend on. Congressman Price wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would strip coverage away from millions of Those who seek to repeal the ACA, including Congressman Price, have not come up with a plan to replace it.  Repealing the ACA without a replacement would send insurance markets reeling. It would be devastating for millions of people who have coverage because of the law.  Repealing the ACA would eliminate New Hampshire's bipartisan Medicaid expansion plan, harming our State's efforts to combat the heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis. This crisis is the most pressing public health and public safety challenge facing our State, and thousands of Granite Staters have accessed substance misuse treatment because of Medicaid expansion.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I met a young man named Noah at Harbor Homes in Noah is an active participant in the Nashua drug court and a former enrollee in our Medicaid expansion program.  Last month, after 14 years of struggling with addiction, Noah was celebrating 1 year sober. Because of legislation that expanded Medicaid, passed under bipartisan leadership, Noah received health insurance through Medicaid expansion, and he was able to quickly begin treatment.  Noah's recovery process required medication-assisted treatment which he would not have been able to afford had it not been covered under He is now 5 months off that treatment and hasn't had an instance of relapse.  Noah said the ACA and Medicaid expansion are ``working miracles every single day in this recovery community.'' For Noah and so many others, we cannot afford to set back our efforts, but that is what the repeal of the ACA would do.  I also oppose Congressman Price because he is determined to turn back the clock on women's access to reproductive health care. He has fought against the woman's constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions and control her own destiny. He has voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood, and he has voted against a resolution to protect employees from being punished or fired by their employers for their reproductive health decisions.  And I oppose Congressman Price because he has pushed to turn Medicare into a voucher program, which will increase costs for seniors. Congressman Price's views and priorities are simply at odds and out of touch with the views and priorities of many, many Granite  Additionally, Mr.President, serious issues have been raised throughout this nomination process regarding Congressman Price's conflicts of interest and his potential violation of the STOCK Act, including recent reports suggesting that he received a private discount to purchase a health company stock while engaged in legislative efforts that would directly affect the company's financial interests. Congressman Price's insufficient responses concerning his stock purchases raise the question of whether, if confirmed, he will put corporate interests ahead of the American people. That is unacceptable. I believe we need a health care system that works for every American, and that is why I will vote against Congressman Price's confirmation.  I want to talk a little bit more about what Congressman Price's confirmation would do with respect to Medicaid expansion and particularly how it would affect the opioid crisis in New In New Hampshire, we proved that Democrats and Republicans can come together to move our health care system forward when we passed our Bipartisan Medicaid Expansion Passing and reauthorizing this program included healthy debate, and at times some argument, but what matters of course is what we do after our argument, after those debates. We were able in New Hampshire to put our differences aside and take a critical step forward to continue strengthening our families, our businesses, and our economy. This is the approach we need to be taking in the United States  The benefits of Medicaid expansion are clear, over 50,000 Granite Staters are now covered in a population of 1.3 million people. We included in Medicaid expansion coverage of substance use disorder and behavioral health services. I have heard story after story of Granite Staters who are in recovery, thanks to Medicaid expansion. I told Noah's story just a few minutes ago.  At another round table I met a young woman named Ashley at the Farnum Center in Manchester, Ashley told of suffering from addiction for over 10 years. One day she woke up to discover that her husband had died of an overdose. She lost custody of her young daughter, but because of Medicaid expansion, Ashley was able to get treatment. She has been in recovery now for a little bit over a year--recovery through medical treatment made possible by Medicaid expansion. Because she is in recovery, she was able to get a job. Because she began working again, she actually has now moved off Medicaid expansion onto private health insurance. So Medicaid expansion was there when she needed it to get healthy. Now she doesn't need it anymore, and she is participating in the private health insurance market. By the way, she is beginning to reestablish her relationship with her young son. That is the power of the Affordable Care That is the power of Medicaid expansion.[[Page S1064]]  Representative Price, on the other hand, has advocated for repeal of these very programs. Such a repeal would have such harmful impacts, pulling the rug out from those who have coverage right now for critical medical conditions. At his confirmation hearing, Representative Price declined to guarantee that Americans with substance use disorders who got on insurance through Medicaid expansion would still be covered for these services if the Affordable Care Act is repealed under Representative Price's leadership.  He also would not commit to continuing the requirement under the Affordable Care Act that health insurance companies must cover essential health benefits, including treatment for substance abuse.  Representative Price's support for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act also requires more discussion. The Affordable Care Act has helped families across our Nation access quality, affordable health insurance coverage. We need to come together now and find bipartisan areas in which we can agree to improve the law, but we should not be repealing it. We should not be taking coverage away from millions of people. I have joined a number of my colleagues in expressing our willingness to work across the aisle with our colleagues to improve the law, but unfortunately it seems our colleagues in the Senate are headed down a path to repeal the law without a plan to replace it. Repealing the ACA without any replacement is a recipe for upheaval and instability, a recipe for hurting our families, small businesses, and our economic progress. Representative Price and those who seek to repeal this law have not agreed on any path forward other than repealing and stripping coverage away from millions of Repealing would have major consequences for many Granite State families and small businesses.  My office has heard from constituents about the impact the Affordable Care Act has had on their lives. One resident from Keene, NH, wrote to say this law has helped fulfill his goal of starting a small business. He wrote:       I have had health insurance through the exchange under the      ACA since late 2015, when I quit my job to start up a      business. Before the ACA, I wouldn't have taken the risk to      start a business, because I have a preexisting condition and      I wouldn't have been able to get an individual      health insurance policy.  He continued:       Under the ACA, I am able to get good health insurance at an      affordable premium. Since I left my job I built up a      profitable business and expect to be in a position to hire      employees within a year or two. None of this would have been      possible without the  And he added:       If the ACA is repealed, I am concerned that I will need to      put my business on hold in order to go back to a corporate      job that I don't need, only to get the health care benefits.      The ACA has flaws, but overall it has allowed me to take an      entrepreneurial risk and start a small successful business.  It is clear that this law has truly made a difference not just for the health of our citizens but also for our economy, and we cannot undermine the progress we have made.  I am also deeply concerned about Representative Price's record and his statements concerning women's health care. Representative Price has consistently opposed women's reproductive freedom. I have always fought to protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions and to chart her own course, and I always will. This is not just a matter of individual freedom, which of course is a good enough reason in its own right to support women's reproductive choice, but it is also a matter of economics. When women have to pay more for their health care than men do, it puts them at a financial disadvantage.  As Governor, I restored family planning funds and pushed to restore State funding to Planned Parenthood because I know how critical these services are for the women and families of my It is unacceptable that Washington Republicans continue to play games with women's health, and Representative Price has been at the forefront of that effort. Representative Price does not support a woman's constitutionally protected right to a safe and legal abortion. He has cosponsored and repeatedly voted for measures that would ban all medically appropriate abortions, without exceptions for rape, incest, or to protect a woman's health. He has voted to penalize small businesses that choose private health plans that include abortion coverage. Additionally, he has voted to allow employers to discriminate against employees based on their reproductive health decisions. He voted to eliminate the Title X Family Planning He voted 10 times to defund Planned  Defunding Planned Parenthood, a critical health provider, would have devastating effects. A recent article in the Washington Post highlighted the impact of what can happen when legislatures attempt to defund Planned  This report in the post found:       In 2011, the Texas legislature cut the two-year budget for      funding family planning from $111 million to $38 million in      an effort to defund Planned After these cuts, 82      Texas family planning clinics, one out of every four in the      state--closed or stopped providing family planning services.      An unintended consequence of the law was that two-thirds of      the clinics that closed were not even Planned Parenthood      clinics. Organizations that remained open, many with reduced      hours, were often unable to offer the most effective methods      of contraception, such as IUDs and contraceptive implants, to      women who wanted them. The closings and reduced hours also      limited or cut back access to primary care providers for a      significant number of women.  Women and their families deserve better than an HHS Secretary who would disregard their constitutional right and roll back their access to reproductive health care. They deserve better than an HHS Secretary who appears to believe that women are neither capable nor trusted to make their own health care decisions. I believe women should be full and free citizens in the United States of America and can be trusted to make their own health care decisions.  Representative Price's nomination and his confirmation would be harmful to our seniors as well. Seniors deserve a high quality of life, high-quality care, and access to the benefits that they have earned throughout their life. I believe we must continue to strengthen and protect Medicare for years to come, not undermine it. Unfortunately, Representative Price has long sought to undermine Medicare and the important benefits it provides to seniors. His budget proposals have included extreme cuts to the program. He supports turning Medicare into a voucher program. In fact, he even said he wants to voucherize Medicare within the first 6 to 8 months of the Trump administration. This would increase costs for seniors.  He has also repeatedly opposed allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices for seniors. He has argued that seniors have no drug cost problem. Imagine that, a Health and Human Services Secretary who believes that drug costs are not an issue for our seniors. He even said allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription drugs would be ``a solution in search of a problem.''  I can tell Representative Price that there are certainly seniors in New Hampshire who have found that the cost of their prescription drugs are truly a problem, and as we talk about the need to shore up and strengthen the Medicare Program, one of the best ways to stabilize its finances would be to allow Medicare to negotiate for prescription drug prices to lower those prices, lower the cost of the program, while making the program even more affordable for our seniors.  That is not something that Representative Price has even expressed a willingness to consider because he doesn't even acknowledge there is a problem. Representative Price has also supported raising the Medicare age from 65 to 67. This amounts to a devastating benefit cut for seniors, shifting costs onto them, which is unacceptable.  Whenever I hear people suggesting raising the retirement age for Social Security or the age for Medicare eligibility, I am reminded of my father-in-law. My father-in-law was one of the hardest working people I ever knew. He worked as a wholesale meat cutter, and for anybody who has never seen what that means, it means standing on your feet for hours at a time in a cold meat locker as large carcasses come through, and with time pressures, the way any production facility has, cutting those carcasses into salable product.  My father-in-law left the house before dark. He often came home, having[[Page S1065]]been assigned overtime, after dark, having been standing on his feet in the cold, doing incredibly hard, physical labor.  When it came time for him to retire, when he became eligible for Medicare, he really couldn't have worked at that job much longer. And the fact that he had a dignified retirement after those years of hard work was in large part due to Before the physical impacts of that job slowed him down, it was our great pleasure to watch a man who had provided for his family with such hard work know the dignity of playing with his grandchildren, sleeping in until 7:30 or 8 in the morning, and watching his family grow and strengthen and thrive.  That is the dignity of It is the dignity of Social And to have a Health and Human Services Secretary who believes we should just be raising that age, as Representative Price does, contradicts the very notion of what it means to earn a benefit and to know a dignified retirement.  I am proud of the progress we have made to help ensure that more Granite Staters and Americans have the quality health care they need at an affordable cost. There is much more work to do to move our health care system forward and to combat the heroin opioid and fentanyl crisis that has devastated far too many families in New Hampshire and across our I am ready and willing to work with anyone who is serious about making improvements to our health care system to improve affordability and access to care, but that does not start with pulling the rug out for millions of It does not start with rolling back women's access to critical health care services.  Congressman Price's record demonstrates that he puts a partisan agenda and corporate interests before the health and economic well-being of our families. The American people deserve a Secretary of Health and Human Services who will help more Americans receive quality, affordable health insurance coverage, not one who supports stripping it away by repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement.  For these reasons, I will be voting no on Congressman Price's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

During the campaign, President Trump promised to protect Medicare and Yet he has nominated Congressman Price to head Congressman Price has led the effort to privatize Medicare and dismantle Medicaid in the U.This is hardly someone who would protect Medicare and  Shortly before taking the oath of office, President Trump said he supported the concept of universal coverage. He said:       We are going to have insurance for everybody. They can      expect to have great health care.  Yet he nominated Congressman Price, who has spent the past 6 years trying to end universal health care coverage by repealing the Affordable Care  President Trump says a lot of things. He tweets his thoughts daily, but at this point, instead of listening to what President Trump says, we should pay attention to what he does. By nominating Congressman Price, the President demonstrated he does not intend to protect access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans--not by protecting Medicare and Medicaid, not by protecting health insurance fraud. President Trump's health care agenda would have far-reaching, negative, painful consequences for tens of thousands of people in Hawaii and millions all across the country. Maybe President Trump should tweet less and listen more.  Over the past few months, I have heard from thousands of Hawaii residents concerned that they will no longer be able to afford health care if President Trump succeeds in repealing the Affordable Care Act and privatizing I would like to read a few of the messages I have received.  Catherine from Honolulu wrote:       I am writing to you to express serious concern over the      repealing of ACA and other health insurance changes. As a      working (teacher) and single parent of two young children I      am very afraid for our future. I am afraid my insurance will      not cover my psoriatic arthritis if I change jobs, they      change companies, or for some reason I should lose my job or      coverage. My medicine without insurance would cost more than      my mortgage payment, and would thus be cost prohibitive.       If I don't have my medication I would be in so much pain. I      would be unable to work and would therefore lose my insurance      which would mean I would never be able to get coverage      because of a preexisting condition. I am certain there are      many other people out there with similar stories.       Please do everything you can to make sure this scenario      doesn't happen to us. If there is anything I can do, please      don't hesitate to let me know. I just don't know who else to      turn to.  Next, I would like to share a note I received from Julie from Papaaloa on the Big       My husband and I are on Medicare, together with a      supplemental plan. We are totally dependent on Social      Security for our income and Medicare for our health plan.      Many millions of seniors are in the same situation as we are.      Please continue to fight for us as this abominable horror of      an administration goes forward. I shudder to think what would      happen if these programs are repealed or privatized.  Finally, I would like to share a heartbreaking story from Desi from Mililani on Desi is an extremely hard-working, self-employed teacher and the single mother of two daughters. Her youngest daughter has Down syndrome, autism, and is hearing impaired. Desi is self-employed because she needs the flexibility to work and care for her daughter. This year, as a sole proprietor over the age of 55, Desi's premiums for her HMO plan rose to over $680 per month for 2016.  In a letter she wrote to me, Desi said:       Paying this high monthly premium was no longer possible and      was jeopardizing our family's ability to pay our mortgage,      food, and other essentials alone.  Desi successfully found a cheaper plan in the ACA marketplace for 2017. In her letter she went on to say:       If the ACA is successfully repealed, we will no longer be      able to afford medical coverage! Families like ours are the      reasons why it is so important to defend the Affordable Care       These letters and stories demonstrate what is at stake for our 200,000 seniors on Medicare in Hawaii and millions more across the country. That is why I will continue to fight tooth and nail to prevent any cuts that would jeopardize our crucial social safety net progress.  The fight has already begun. Last month, Republicans in Congress pushed through a partisan budget resolution that would give them the tools they need to repeal the Affordable Care This assault on the Affordable Care Act is also an assault on Medicare and Medicaid because the ACA strengthened Medicare and Medicaid through, for example, closing the prescription doughnut hole and providing free preventive checkups for seniors. This is why I joined with my colleague from Indiana, Senator Donnelly, to introduce an amendment that would block congressional Republicans from privatizing Medicare or increasing eligibility standards for It would also prevent changes that reduce funding for  During the debate on our amendment, one of our Republican colleagues, in his opposition to the amendment, basically made our point for us. He said something to the effect of, a vote in favor of our amendment to protect Medicare and Medicaid is a vote against repealing the Affordable Care In the end, it was a close vote on our amendment. While the amendment lost, I was encouraged that two of our Republican colleagues, Senator Heller of Nevada and Senator Collins of Maine, voted in favor of the amendment.  In the coming weeks and months, there will be other battles to protect Medicare and It is going to be a daunting fight, but I am not going to shy away from it. I am going to do whatever I can, whenever I can to protect the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and In this fight, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on Tom Price's nomination to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Tom Price is not the champion that millions of people in our country are counting on to protect their health and welfare.

1036,topic-id,787,"I thank the chairman for his leadership.  Mr.Chairman, we all know that small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the American economy. We meet them in our districts and we see firsthand the benefits that their dreams and hard work provide to our constituents and to our communities.  These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers are really small-business people who are critical for our country's economic prosperity. Small businesses helped to create more than 60 percent of the Nation's net new jobs over the past two decades. So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunities for every American, then we must promote and encourage the success and growth of our small businesses and our startups.  In order to succeed, these companies need capital and credit--the lifeblood for growth, expansion, and job creation. Yet, the government continues[[Page H261]]to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential financing as smaller companies are caught up in red tape that was created, frankly, for the largest public companies, but those public companies have the financial means to hire lawyers and accountants and management consultants and all of those things that would then guide them through the sheer weight, volume, and complexity of the Federal securities laws.  Congress has made strides in tailoring the regulatory environment for smaller companies, most notably when we passed with strong bipartisan support the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS Act, in 2012. The JOBS Act's benefits are notable as more and more companies use its provisions to raise investment capital in both the public and private markets.  One essential form of capital for many startups comes from angel investors--sophisticated, high net-worth individuals who invest their own money into startups and other early stage companies. Not many college students of whom I am aware would fit that definition of a sophisticated, high net-worth individual. In 2015, angel investors deployed over $24 billion to about 71,000 startups--many of these investments going to companies in their own communities and Beyond capital, angels provide advice and guidance to help these companies succeed and create jobs.  Mr.Chairman, I believe that it is important to note that companies such as Amazon, Costco, Facebook, Google, and Starbucks, among a myriad of others that we have not necessarily heard of as public names, were all initially funded by angel investors. Without angel investors, these very successful companies would have never gotten off the ground.  Yet, the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose neglect of its statutory mission to facilitate capital formation necessitated that Congress pass the JOBS Act in the first place, has further restricted startups from interacting with angel investors at demo days and similar pitch events. Startups rely on demo days and similar events to build relationships with angels and other investors and generate interest in their companies and their ideas. These events existed prior to the JOBS Act, but the SEC's rules jeopardize their future.  H.79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or HALOS Act, is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that is aimed at removing a significant regulatory hurdle for innovative companies and startups that seek early stage equity investments. Specifically, the HALOS Act would clarify that these demo days, which are sponsored by angel investor groups, universities, municipalities, and nonprofits, are not considered to be general solicitations and would, instead, ensure that angel funding remains available to those businesses that seek investment capital. These are really educational opportunities.                              {time}  1430  Mr.Speaker, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim that the HALOS Act guts critical investor protections and will subject honest, hardworking Americans to rampant fraud. We just had an example of college students being brought up. That is simply not true.  A company that offers securities to investors under these rules may only sell their securities to sophisticated or accredited investors. If these individuals do not meet the standards of an accredited investor, they are not then eligible or even allowed to invest in these types of startups that would participate in a demo day.  Instead, the HALOS Act is a simple, bipartisan, bicameral, and, I might add, short bill that will provide small innovative companies and startups the ability to interact with angels and other investors who can provide the capital that they need to succeed, grow, and create jobs.  Indeed, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said it best when he introduced the HALOS Act last Congress: ``I have heard from local entrepreneurs and interested backers alike that the most important thing we can do to help these businesses is to make it easier for angel investors to put capital behind them--and that is exactly what our bipartisan HALOS Act will do.''

1057,topic-id,544,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I have actually had the pleasure and the honor of sitting through a number of these demo days and seeing these pitches being made. People are coming in, and they are literally laying out their dreams, their hopes, and, frankly, their hard work because they wouldn't be there that day if it wasn't for their hard work. They are looking for a couple of things. As small businesses and entrepreneurs, they are looking for capital and credit. We use the word ``capital'' a lot around here, but think of it as cash and credit. They really are looking for someone who will buy into their dream, who will look at their hard work, and who will understand that their dreams can become a reality with hope. This bill is trying to do that.  Members are hearing a lot of doom and gloom on the other side. In fact, I think the phrase was just thrown out, financial doom for the retail investor. Let's talk about these retail investors.  For you to become an accredited investor, someone who would qualify to be able to invest in these startup companies, according to SEC rule 501, you need to be married, jointly; $300,000 in income; and $1 million of net worth, excluding your home. So you cannot include a million-dollar home. You have to have $1 million net worth outside of your home and have an income of $300,000. Earlier, college students were brought up. Not a whole lot of college students that I am aware of have $300,000 annual income or $1 million net worth.  These are people who are sophisticated, typically. They are high net worth, by definition. Interestingly enough, as Members of Congress, if we allowed some of these amendments to go through and these restrictions to go through, as Members of Congress, we would be excluded from the room. We would be excluded. We couldn't even go in there to educate ourselves about how this process works. That, ultimately, is what this is about.  Those pitch days are not just for those people who are going to invest. Those pitch days are not just for the people who are going to do the investing. Those pitch days are for others to learn, to have an understanding.  If you are a college student sitting in the back row, to understand what it looks like to become an entrepreneur, to really become a part of that engine of the American economy, you should be in the room. If you are someone who might be making a pitch later on and want to see how this happens and[[Page H264]]works, you ought to be in the room. Let's not exclude those people.  Why would we have a government closed off, closed room, a government-sanctioned closed room that would keep people from understanding and achieving their hopes and dreams and success?  I am pleased to be up here and to talk about this issue because we know that for our standing in the world, we need to have a dynamic economy. Our dynamic economy starts with our entrepreneurs and the risk-takers who are willing to invest in those ideas.

1061,topic-id,413,"Mr.Chairman, so here is the alternate reality you are expected to believe in this scenario that has been created. You are going to have somebody wander off the street with their checkbook in their pocket, listen to a 3- to 5-minute pitch on an idea that is going to change the world, and then they are going to sign away their financial future and life savings. That is the scenario that is being painted for you out there today by the opponents of this commonsense legislation.  Again, to be an investor, you must be an accredited investor, according to the SEC rules, Rule 501, that says you have $300,000 of income annually and a net worth of $1 million outside of your home. Owning your house doesn't count towards that.  I have been to these pitch days. You know what you are walking into. You don't just stumble on it and go: Wow, what's going on here?  I have never thought about this. Tell you what, I am going to write a five- or six- or seven-figure check today and put myself into financial ruin. That is not how these things work.  Mr.Chairman, at the end of the day, I think it is important to just review a little bit of the history here.  First of all, this amendment isn't necessary. It would create yet another SEC-required disclosure and further burden the ability for startups to present their ideas to demo days.  I would note that this amendment could have been offered last March, either in committee or while we here in the House had consideration last April 2016. However, in both cases that didn't occur.  Let's remember why we are here today, Mr.When the SEC promulgated the rules to implement Title II of the JOBS Act, the agency made something that was legal prior to April 5 of 2012 suddenly illegal. The SEC decided that demo days that bring together those entrepreneurs and those companies suddenly became a general solicitation.  That isn't the case, and this amendment would require the SEC to prescribe a disclosure that ``describes the nature of the event and the risks of investing in securities being advertised.''  There is no sale that day, Mr.No sale at all is going to happen. There is no exchange that happens at that event.  This amendment is unnecessary, overly broad, and would delay the return to the certainty that the pre-JOBS Act had brought.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Today, I am proud to speak in support of the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or HALOS I would also thank Chairman Chabot and Congressman Sinema for putting forth this important bipartisan legislation, and I am a proud cosponsor.  I am fortunate enough to regularly hear from innovators across Illinois and through my work on the House Science, Space, and Technology These are the people who harness technology to accomplish the impossible, whether that is making life-changing medical breakthroughs or just finding a better way to do everyday tasks.  As we all know, startups are the job creators that drive our economy by creating new jobs that can get our constituents back to work.  Angel investors play a key role in the earliest stages of these startups. They provide the initial rounds of funding to help these life-changing ideas get off the ground. We shouldn't have unnecessary barriers in place for our innovators to have access to the capital they need to grow.  The situation we currently find ourselves facing is frustrating for startups and potential investors. There is some regulatory uncertainty from implementation of the JOBS In short, Regulation D may imply a demo day is a general solicitation, which would require companies to identify if investors meet the definition of accredited.  If demo days are treated as general solicitations, startups and investors are required to comply with burdensome, third-party verification rules. However, the purpose of these demo days is not to seek investors. It simply is to promote good ideas. No solicitations or sales of securities take place. This confusion may prevent any conversation--even a very informal one--between angel investors and startups from happening. This can be easily clarified by the legislation under consideration today.  As I mentioned, startup companies frequently participate in demo days to increase the visibility of their company, explain their ideas, and hope to informally attract investors. These demo days are sponsored by a variety of organizations interested in promoting innovation and job creation. For example, the University of Illinois' Research Park told me that this bill would make things like the Cozad New Venture Competition, Urbana-Champaign Angel Network or UCAN angel presentations, the Share the Vision technology showcase, pitch practice at EnterpriseWorks, and other public forums for startups in Illinois problematic. They want to encourage showcases of startups without fear of these programs constituting a formal fundraising solicitation to report to the  The bill simply clarifies SEC regulations to ensure startups may participate in educational demo days without having to verify that attendees are accredited investors.

Disparate impact is where you take two facts that are extraneous and put them together for an appearance of an irregularity or an impropriety without any fact being true.  The statements made about the CBO estimate were accurate in what he said but wrong in the implication. He is accurate that CBO did say it would cost money if we didn't have a replacement for ObamaCare, which is the replacement being worked on as we speak right here today. Both are facts, but when put together the way he put them together, it makes it look as though we are spending money that we are not, in fact, spending at all.  The CBO estimate also does not include the impact of legislative and administrative action to stabilize individual markets. In the absence of making that consideration, of course it is going to be more costly.

977,topic-id,459,"Mr.President, that Kevin Concannon retired is not news--he has done that several times before--and each time he moved on to more exciting and challenging positions.  In 2016, Kevin Concannon retired from the USDA as the Undersecretary of Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services after 8 years of service.  Kevin is a tireless advocate of people--all people. His work to assure that every effort was made to address hunger in this country is an indicator of his compassion, understanding of both the issues and solutions, and his unwavering faith in the ability of this great country to care for those who are struggling--whether it is food insecurity or earlier in his career on mental health issues, long-term care, and child welfare.  At USDA, Kevin worked tirelessly to increase options for SNAP beneficiaries to access fresh local foods at farmers markets; he was determined that children should have more access to nutritious foods in WIC, schools and child care--while Kevin and I agree on that goal--I must add--that as a native Mainer, Kevin may have missed the mark on where white potatoes fit into those meal plans.  Kevin Concannon came to USDA with an amazingly broad spectrum of experience. From 1987-1995, he served as the director of the Oregon Department of Human Resources, after having served as Commissioner of the Maine Department of Mental Health and In 1995, I was fortunate to be able to bring him back to his home State of Maine to serve as the commissioner of Maine's Department of Human At the time, I commented that he was the Dan Marino of commissioners and welcomed him back. I would point out that Dan Marino is now serving as the vice president of the Dolphins, and I expect that, in the same way, Kevin Concannon will find ways to continue his public service--and that will benefit us all.  Kevin led efforts throughout his career to improve child welfare, expand Medicaid and child health insurance, integrating programs of public health and medical care, improving systems for long-term care for elders and people with disabilities. Many of those efforts were national in scope, and he was selected by his peers to serve as the president of the American Public Welfare Association from 1994-1995.  In every role, in every effort, Kevin Concannon has been an exemplary public servant and leader.  Margaret Chase Smith said it best: ``Public service must be more than[[Page S1070]]doing a job efficiently and honestly. It must be a complete dedication to the people and to the nation.''

1102,topic-id,4036,"Mr.President, I am a former Governor, and as such, I have an inclination to support the Executive's nominees for their Cabinet--for their Secretaries or Commissioners in my case, in I think that is an[[Page S1053]]important principle, and it is how I start when I approach the analysis of any nominee to any position put forward by the Executive, whether the Executive is Donald Trump or Barack Obama or anybody else. That is a kind of starting point, and that is how I started this And, indeed, thus far, as we have voted here on the floor, I have supported five of the seven nominees who have come before us, plus I supported two additional nominees in committee which have not yet come to the floor, but whom I will support on the floor.  So I am not in total opposition: Don't vote for any nominees. I don't think that is the way our system works, and it is certainly not the way I intend to approach these issues. I have approached them one at a time, looking at the position of the nominees, their policies, their views, their hearings. I have tried to follow the hearings as closely as possible, including their answers to questions. Again, I start with a bias toward approval, perhaps because of my experience as a chief executive myself.  But I can't support nominees who are fundamentally opposed to the mission of the agency they have been asked to lead. To me, that just doesn't make sense. That is why I voted against Betsy DeVos 2 days ago because I didn't believe that she had the best interests of American education--particularly public education--at heart. Her whole career has been about attacking and undermining public education by trying to, in effect, voucherize it, provide vouchers to people to use in other schools which, by the way, in a rural State like Maine, simply wouldn't work as a practical matter. So I could not support her because I felt she was hostile to the very premise of the agency that she was being asked to lead.  Today, I come to the floor to talk about I think he falls into the same category. I understand policy differences, and I understand the election took place, and I understand elections have results and that there are going to be different policies, but his policies on the fundamental mission of the Department of Health and Human Services are just inimical to what that Department was established to do for the American people. The title is Health and Human Services, and that is the role that Department has played and should play and will play in the future of  Now, my problems with Price and his positions--and there is no doubt about his positions on various issues. He has a long record in the House of Representatives writing and legislating and advocating, so there is not much argument about where he stands, and there are really three areas that I want to touch on tonight. One is Medicare, one is Medicaid, and one is the Affordable Care I want to try to put these all in the context of my home State of  Health care in Maine is an enormous part of our economy. It is somewhat higher, actually, as a percentage of our GDP than it is nationally. We are at about 20 percent of One-fifth of our economy is health care. In part, that is because we have a great number of seniors who, of course, require more health care expenditures, but it is a very important part of our economy, which I will touch on a little bit later. But let's talk about  First, Medicare in Maine: 306,000 people in Maine are Medicare beneficiaries. The expenditure in Maine by Medicare is $2 billion. Now, when we are talking about cutting or changing Medicare, of course we focus, as we should, on those 306,000 people--and I will talk about them--but we also need to talk about that $2 billion. If we are talking about savings--savings don't just evaporate, they occur in real life, and those are funds that don't go to support medical care for seniors in Maine and don't go to our hospitals and don't go to our practitioners. So $2 billion is a very significant part of our GDP, and that is just what Medicare spends in Maine, 306,000 people.  Now, I want to touch on an aspect of this that I don't think has been discussed much in these debates; that is, the burden of anxiety about health care and the cost of health care that was lifted from generations of seniors in this country by the passage of Medicare, now some 50-plus years ago. As you get older, there is anxiety about retirement, there is anxiety about income, there is anxiety about your health, but there is also anxiety about the cost of health care. The miracle of that Medicare was that it lifted that burden of anxiety from our seniors. It was one thing they didn't have to worry about. ``I have Medicare'' have been the words that have comforted thousands and millions of people in this country since 1965.  To change the fundamental premise of Medicare, which is what Price has advocated for vigorously and continuously, from the current system, which is, if you get sick, if you have hospitalization, if you need medical care and you qualify for Medicare, it is paid for. To change that to a system which is essentially a voucher, which is capped at some level of inflation but not the health care level of inflation, is a cruel trick on our seniors. What it will do is, through compounding of interest, if inflation is 2 percent a year, and medical inflation--the cost of medical treatment--increases at 4 or 5 or 6 percent a year, which is typical of what has happened in the last 15 or 20 years; there have been ups and downs, but 4, 5, 6 percent is about where medical inflation has been. So if inflation is at 2 percent, and that is what your voucher is going to increase to, and medical costs increase at 6 percent, that gap is going to grow to the point where we are back where we were in 1964, before the passage of Then, seniors suddenly have to worry about how they are going to pay for their health care. They are going to have an added burden of anxiety, and they are going to have an added burden of money, of finance, of cost.  You can call it all kinds of highfalutin things. You can call it a voucher program, whether or not it is privatization. There are all kinds of ways to paper it over, but what it really is, is shift and shaft. It is shifting the cost from Medicare to seniors, and over time that shift and shaft is only going to increase. I think that is unconscionable, and there is no reason for it.  Yes, the cost of Medicare is going up as a percentage of our budget. That is because we are getting older. That is because we have a demographic bulge going through our society for people who were born in the 1940s and 1950s--the baby boom generation--but that is anticipated, that is understood. There are things we can do to deal with that issue without the radical solution of essentially shifting the cost over to the seniors. It makes the Federal books look good, but it is not going to make the household books in Maine look good.  That is what really bothers me about this policy. We are trying to improve our miserable budget situation by shifting a great deal of these costs off to individuals. That is just wrong. Medicare is too important financially, emotionally, psychologically. It is too important as an essential part of the promise that we have made to each generation of Americans for the past 50 years. And to fundamentally change that and realize, I believe cynically, that as the gap increases over time, the percentage of the premiums that is being shifted onto seniors is going to grow over time, until at some point--and you can do the arithmetic--it is going to eat the whole thing. And the Federal share, yes, will be capped--or capped at some lower level, and the share that is paid by the individual, by the family, by your mom, by your dad is only going to be greater. That is wrong. That is a breaking of the promise that we made to our seniors.  The second piece where Price, I believe, is fundamentally at odds with the premise, with the mission of the agency, is in He has talked about various programs. First, let's get rid of the expansion of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and then let's block-grant Medicaid and send it to the It is the same principle: It is shift and shaft, only this time you are shafting the You are taking a program which now says, if you have medical expenses and you are qualified, they are paid for, and you are saying, OK, in the future, we will give you a fixed amount of money, but if the medical expenses go up, it is on you, Mr.State; it is on you, State of Maine or Michigan or California or Georgia or Florida, or anywhere in this country.[[Page S1054]]  It is simply, again, repairing the miserable books of the Federal Government because we are not facing up to our responsibility to pass reasonable budgets. It is fixing those books at the expense of somebody else. Those moneys they are talking about: a $2 trillion cut in Great, Medicaid is going to look a lot better, but that $2 trillion doesn't evaporate and doesn't go anywhere. It is not like everybody is going to say: Well, they are cutting Medicaid so we are going to charge less for our hip or for our surgery or for our treatment of drug abuse. It is going to have consequences. It is going to come out of treatment. It is going to come out of health.  There is something about Medicaid that often isn't observed. I learned this as People think of Medicaid as a kind of welfare program, and there are these people who are taking advantage of it, and perhaps there are. There are always people who take advantage of programs.  The truth is, the majority of the funds for Medicaid go to people in nursing homes--your parents, your uncle, your aunt. Nursing home expenditures for the elderly are a significant cost for Medicare doesn't pay nursing home expenses except for a limited period of time, but a great deal of Medicaid expenses go to nursing homes. You are going to cut Medicaid? You are going to have people who aren't going to be able to afford to stay in nursing homes. That is going to shift that cost back on to the family.  The other majority of people on Medicaid are children. They are children who are covered who wouldn't have coverage otherwise.  One of the best things in this country is the combination of Medicaid and CHIP, which has resulted in an enormous increase in the covered health coverage of children. And it is so important because health problems in children that can be dealt with when they are young, when they are children, when it is covered by insurance, can save us enormous costs later on.  So, again, what does Price want to do? Cap, eliminate ACA expansion of Medicaid, and block-grant it.  Let's not kid ourselves. Block-granting is shifting and shafting to those elderly people who would lose coverage for nursing homes, to the children who need the coverage, but most especially, to the As a former Governor, I can see the impact of this on my State of It is a difficult issue, and if we limit it, the only option will be to limit coverage or to cut back.  Of course, Medicaid is one of the places we are covering the treatment of opioid addiction. The greatest public health crisis in this country in my lifetime is the opioid crisis. We are losing 1 person a day in the State of Maine to overdose deaths--1 person every day. I met a young man at Christmastime at a treatment center. I went to the Christmas party and met his family and he was hopeful and he was under treatment. I learned this week that he is gone. He is gone, taken by the scourge of drugs.  These are real people. These are real people. These aren't just numbers and statistics. In the next hour, as we are here debating this nomination, four people in America are going to die of overdoses--four people an hour. And when you think of how we mobilized this country and the money we spent to deal with Ebola where one person died--one person in the whole country--and yet we have this horrible disease and scourge that is just decimating our societies and we are talking about cutting back one of the basic props for providing treatment. We have cases where we--there is a huge backlog of treatment beds.  I have been working on this problem in Maine for a long time. One of the things I have learned is that once a person who is addicted reaches a stage where they are willing to ask for help, we have to be there--then. To say to that person there will be an opening in 3 weeks or 3 months is akin to a death sentence because they might not be able to make it 3 weeks or 3 months; yet that is the situation in much of the country today. That is the situation, and we are talking about knocking one of the props out from under our ability to deal with this horrible public health crisis that is devastating this country in every State, but particularly in rural It is taking people out of the workforce that we need, it is tearing families apart, and it is affecting everybody. It is not just certain people in certain places. It is everybody. It is middle-class families. It is people of all ages.  To blithely talk about we are going to block-grant Medicaid and fix the amount--it is the same as what I said about Medicare; the iron law of the percentage changes. If you fix it today and inflation continues, then ultimately it withers away, and it is not going to meet the needs of our people. Yet that is what the nominee for the Department of Health and Human Services wants to do. I don't get it.  Finally, there is the Affordable Care I have talked on this floor before about the Affordable Care Act and why I feel so passionately about it, how having insurance when I was a young man saved my life, how not having insurance costs lives.  The mathematics is pretty clear. There have been a number of studies: For every million people who don't have insurance, there are a thousand people who die prematurely. The Affordable Care Act now covers something in the neighborhood of 22 million people, so here is the arithmetic: 22,000 premature deaths a year. This isn't ideology. These are people. To ignore that and say we want free markets and free choice--free choice means death for a lot of people. It meant death for a young man who had what I had 40 years ago and didn't have insurance, didn't get a checkup, didn't have surgery, and he is gone and I am here, and that is not fair. That is not fair.  I have said since I got here that the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. It can be changed; it can be fixed. I hear every now and then that my colleagues are saying: Let's repair it. I am all for it. Let's repair it. Let's get over this talk about repeal. But Price has been one of the leading voices, if not the leading voice, in the Congress to repeal the Affordable Care I don't know his exact voting record, but I suspect he voted for every one of those repeals in the House 60, 70 times over the last couple of years: Repeal, repeal. Well, you are repealing people's health care.  He doesn't want to have the patient protections in the Affordable Care Act, the ones that keep it so that you can't discriminate against women in health insurance because they are women. And there have to be preventive services. Preexisting conditions--he says: They have to insure; they have to keep you on for the preexisting condition. But if you lose your health insurance for a few months, sorry. The clock stops, and you can't get it again because of a preexisting condition. That is one of the most important and fundamental promises of the Affordable Care Act, yet he wants to get rid of it.  Here is the reality in We are a rural We have a lot of rural hospitals. I urge every Member of this body to talk to their hospitals. I have done it. I have gone to the hospitals and sat down with them. I did it as recently as 2 weeks ago with a small rural hospital, the Penobscot Valley Hospital in Lincoln, They told me the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would cost them $1 million a year, and they can't afford it. I have been to the Bridgton I have talked to people from--not all, but many of our small hospitals, and 50 to 60 percent of our rural hospitals are running in the red right now. The Affordable Care Act has provided insurance coverage to people who are the customers of those hospitals, and the estimates are that repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a reasonable replacement would reduce their revenues anywhere from 5 to 8 to 10 percent. These hospitals can't stand that kind of cut, and they have told me there are only two choices: One is to shrink their services to their communities, and the other is to close their doors.  In Maine, in our rural State, we have only 16 counties. In 8 of our 16 counties, the hospital is the largest employer in that county. I am sure that is true in all of the States in our country that have these small rural hospitals; the hospital is the major employer. So again, when we are talking about cutting the Affordable Care Act and all these policy things and ideological things, what we are doing is cutting jobs in small towns that can't afford to lose them, and they are good jobs. If that is what you want to do, fine. But fess up and understand that is the consequence of policies that are espoused[[Page S1055]]enthusiastically by this nominee for the Department of Health and Human It doesn't make sense to be putting someone in charge of an agency that is supposed to be looking out for the welfare and the health of our citizens who is diametrically opposed to maintaining the health and welfare of our citizens.  In Maine, we have 75,000 people on the Affordable Care I know people who have it who couldn't have coverage otherwise without those subsidies. But he is not going to allow those subsidies anymore. It is every man for himself. Every man for himself means a lot of people fall by the wayside, and that is wrong. That is wrong in Maine, and I can't vote for somebody who is going to put a dagger in the heart of these citizens of I cannot do it. My conscience will not let me.  So on Medicare, shift and shaft to the seniors. On Medicaid, shift and shaft to the On the Affordable Care Act, shift and shaft to those people who need health insurance and the hospitals in our communities, the hospitals in those communities. If you take paying customers away, it is a double whammy: You lose the revenues from the customers, and then you have to treat them as charity care. It makes the bottom line in these hospitals even worse. As I said, they have told me in my State--and I suspect this is true practically everywhere--50 to 60 percent of our hospitals are skating on the edge. They are in negative territory. They are in the red, and we are going to cut their revenues by 8, 10 percent? It is unconscionable. It is truly unconscionable. That is a word used around here sometimes, but this is it.  All in the name of some kind of ideology, we want to go back to the health care--I can't believe we are debating Medicare, a program that has been so successful and so important to seniors throughout the last three to four generations. We are now debating it? It doesn't make any sense. To put somebody in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services that is inimical to Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act--this guy is a wrecking ball. He is not a He is going into this agency to destroy it. He wants to undercut and diminish and, in some cases, literally destroy some of the major underpinnings of providing health care to people in this country.  If we were sitting in this body and somebody walked by me and was stricken by a heart attack and fell on the floor, I would help him. Every one of us would help him. I suspect Price would help him. He would be the first one there. But by these changes, what we are doing is having people fall by our side and ignoring them in large scale across the country. It is just as real as if it is happening right before our eyes. Twenty-two thousand people will die if health insurance is lost prematurely. Seniors will take on a burden of anxiety and fiscal drain that they can't afford that they have avoided for 50 years.  The final point is that this man's policies are at odds with those of his boss. Through the campaign, President Trump issued pretty much ironclad guarantees to seniors that he was going to maintain Medicare, maintain Social Security, but then he appoints a guy whose whole professional career has been aimed at undermining I think they had better get on the same page. I don't always agree with President Trump, but in this case I think he is right. I wish he would whisper into the ear of his nominee: You can't have it both ways. You are either for it or you want to gut it. That is what we are facing in this vote.  This is a vote of conscience for me. It is also a vote about my I love those people. I know them. I started out as a legal services attorney in a small town in My first boy was born in that town, in a little, rural hospital that is struggling. I can't stand by and see someone take over this Department who is going to do harm. That is the medical creed, isn't it? Do no harm; that is the oath. But we are talking about harm to seniors, to children, to people with insurance who will not have it. We are talking about real harm.  That is why I come to the floor tonight to urge my colleagues to reject this nominee. If the President wants to put somebody forward who is conservative and has ways of fixing some of these things and thinks some improvements should be made--and we don't have to do everything the way we have always done it. I'm not arguing that. But goodness, gracious, don't give us a nominee whose whole career has been spent aimed at undermining and diminishing and gutting the very programs that have meant so much to the people of  I am voting no on this nominee. I believe my colleagues should do so as well.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1092,topic-id,773,"Mr.President, the Cabinet nomination we are considering today is one of great consequence. The reach of the Department of Health and Human Services is extensive, with direct and indirect consequences for the health and well-being of all Like many other nominations that this body is rushing to confirm, Representative Price has not satisfied the many questions that have been raised about his ability to defend programs that are vital to so many In fact, his record in Congress runs counter to these goals.  I have always believed that all Americans deserve access to quality, affordable health care. We made a tremendous step in this direction through the Affordable Care Act, ACA, which has extended health insurance coverage to more than 20 million Americans and their families through cancer screenings, immunizations, and preventative health care at little or no cost-share. The law has ensured that vulnerable populations have access to quality care through State expansions of The ACA stopped insurance companies from discriminating against women, seniors, and individuals with preexisting conditions. And it has already saved taxpayers billions in Federal health care costs, while bolstering reserves for our Nation's Medicare and Social Security Trust funds.  Unfortunately, Representative Price does not see it this way. As one of the first lawmakers to draft legislation calling for the full repeal of the ACA, Representative Price believes that health care should once again be under the largely unfettered control of big businesses and insurance companies. He may say that he wants more Americans to have ``access to affordable coverage,'' but his record in the House shows otherwise.  It is not only the Affordable Care Act that Representative Price has put in the crosshairs, but virtually every Federal, health program. Representative Price's track record in opposing programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security is extensive. As Congressman, he has proposed dissolving or block granting Medicaid and replacing Medicare with vouchers, unadjusted for income, for consumers to purchase private plans on the market. In November, he released an agenda proposing across-the-board cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social He has also long fought against women's healthcare and access to family planning services. And he has advocated banning abortions and abolishing funding for Planned Parenthood, which would make it far more difficult for women to have access to health care.  Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid are crucially important to patients and their families. Medicaid provides vulnerable populations, including children, with essential and comprehensive health benefits, like mental health care and substance abuse treatment, which are required to be covered by Medicaid under the And for decades, Medicare and Social Security have offered health care protections to low-income Americans and seniors, offering guaranteed resources in retirement. These are earned benefits that hard-working Americans have paid into throughout their lives. It is only fair that these people should expect to have these resources when they enter retirement.  We cannot deny the vital health protections of Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security to our Nation's families. And I cannot in good conscience support someone who does not share this game goal. Lives, literally, are at stake.  I am also deeply concerned about allegations of Representative Price's violation of the STOCK Act, which prohibits Members of Congress from making investment decisions based on information they receive as a result of their roles in Serious questions of his all-too-coincidental trading with medical companies, after introducing legislation that supports these very companies, are troubling, and signal that this nominee is unfit to lead the very agency responsible for protecting the health of  I am glad the minority members of the Senate Finance Committee refused to join the business meeting scheduled to move Representative Price's nomination last month. There remain serious questions relating to potential conflicts he would have as Despite these concerns, Republicans on the Finance Committee made the unprecedented decision to change the rules and confirm Congressman Price without even one Democratic member present. This move runs counter to the majority's own rules. But more importantly, it contradicts what we stand for in promoting the interests of Americans as their elected officials.  If confirmed, there are valid reasons for the American people to be concerned that Representative Price's agenda will make its way into the Department of Health and Human Services, and Americans will suffer for that. It is the responsibility of this agency to uphold and protect the well-being of the people of this great and good country, and it would be counter to this goal to allow someone like Representative Price to oversee such efforts. That is why I will strongly oppose his nomination, and I encourage all in the Senate to do the same.

1101,topic-id,3585,"Mr.President, tonight I am here to speak in opposition to the nomination of Tom Price to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and I am standing here this evening in solidarity with millions of Americans across this country who, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, have health insurance, some for the very first time in their lives--not just access to coverage but actual health insurance for themselves and for their families, coverage that provides preventive care without copays, coverage despite preexisting conditions, coverage supported by subsidies for those who need it to help make health insurance affordable for their families.  Tom Price's position on health care is contrary to everything those millions of Americans rely upon, and it is against everything that my State of Massachusetts stands for.  So let's take a look at Tom Price's formula for health care for First, Congressman Price wants to repeal the Affordable Care He wants to bring back discrimination against those with preexisting conditions. He wants to kick 32 million Americans off their health coverage. He wants to deprive women of reproductive health choices, and all of this, ultimately, is going to raise prices of insurance, of health care coverage for everyone who has insurance right now, which is 80 percent of America who gets their private coverage.  Second, Tom Price wants to end Medicare as we know it. He would increase the Medicare eligibility age and create a voucher system that pushes the cost of the program directly onto seniors. Finally, he wants to slash Medicaid, which provides health care to disabled and poor families across this country.  So that is his plan. This is the Tom Price health care plan for America in the 21st century: 1, repeal the Affordable Care Act; 2, end Medicare as we know it; and, 3, gut Medicaid and raise premiums for everyone else in our country. No one with any sense believes this is a winning formula.  Voting for the Affordable Care Act was the best vote of my entire political career, and that is because I agreed with Senator Ted Kennedy that health care is a right and not a privilege and that everyone in our country is entitled to health care coverage and that that health care is the solid foundation for our entire country to build their lives on.  Ralph Waldo Emerson said: ``The first wealth is health.'' Without health, you have nothing. That is what the Affordable Care Act is all about--to give every American the first wealth, the most important one, the access to the health care which they need. That is the promise that all Americans were made with the Affordable Care Act, and it is a promise that we still must keep.  Before Tom Price and his Republican allies came up with their blueprint to dismantle the ACA and put their big health insurance companies back in charge of your health, there was a Massachusetts blueprint that helped to create that historic health care law. Many of those core fundamentals were from Massachusetts and were then just built right into the Affordable Care Act: creating a marketplace so that insurance companies compete for customers, expanding Medicare to cover more low-income residents in our State, helping lower and middle-income people buy insurance with tax subsidies, encouraging people and businesses to buy in so we are all splitting the cost and sharing the benefits, and a employer-responsibility requirement for all large employers to offer coverage to their workers.  In Massachusetts, we call this RomneyCare, a good Republican program from my Republican Governor--Then on a national level, they called it In Massachusetts, we just called it successful. It worked. It is a good plan.  Right now in Massachusetts, 98 percent of all adults have health care insurance; 99 percent of all children have health insurance. The Massachusetts unemployment rate is 2.8 percent. We are 1 in math, verbal, and science at the fourth, eighth, and tenth grades out of all 50 We have the cleanest environment in the United We have health care for all children and all adults, and our unemployment rate, again, is 2.8 percent.  It is not a choice. In fact, it is a business plan for the It works--the healthiest families, the most educated children in the Nation, the lowest unemployment rate. It all comes together. It is a plan.[[Page S1051]]  Now, to listen to the critics of this idea--that everyone is entitled to health care--you would think that it would destroy our economy, and they are still waiting for it to happen, as our unemployment rate continues to go down and down and down.  What is up? I will tell you what is up. Cancer screenings are up. Preventive care visits are up. Diabetes treatments have gone up. Health disparities among women and minorities are down. That is who we are. We can do this. It is a plan. It is a plan. It actually ensures that every child in America, every family in America really doesn't have to worry about something happening, some bankruptcy taking place because they can't afford the health care that one of their family members needs. That is what was happening before the Affordable Care Act passed.  So what makes Massachusetts one of the healthiest places in the world to live is in jeopardy with the nomination of Tom He is coming for this plan. He doesn't think it works. He doesn't understand what has happened in Massachusetts or across our country.  In fact, in the State of Kentucky, the Democratic Governor, Governor Beshear, has instituted this plan in his red State, and he took the total number of people up to 95 percent of total coverage for Kentucky--hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.  If we did that across the whole country, then we would essentially have the Affordable Care Act of Massachusetts in the whole country, but there has been strong resistance from States that are ideologically opposed to having this kind of a plan be put in place. So they are coming for it. That is what Tom Price is doing.  Let me give you an idea as to what Tom Price's plan does for Massachusetts and ultimately for the rest of the country that has adopted the plan. In Massachusetts alone, there will be an average per person loss of $2,280 in tax credits, and 83,000 seniors and people with disabilities may lose $1,000 per year in saved prescription drug costs. We could lose an estimated 57,000 jobs just in Massachusetts with all these services just being eliminated. We would have the loss of $1.85 billion in Medicaid expansion funding and the loss of more than $700 million in Federal premium tax credits and cost sharing reduction payments for middle-income families.  We also have to consider the Affordable Care Act's prevention and public health fund. Here is what went wrong with our health care system in the 20th century: We were running a sick care system, not a health care system. So what the Affordable Care Act did was it began to shift the emphasis towards prevention. How do you stop people from getting sick in the first place? That is the way we should be viewing disease in our country. The Affordable Care Act is our government's single largest investment in prevention.  Since enactment of the ACA, the prevention fund has provided more than $5 billion to States and communities across the country to support community-based prevention programs. Nationally, the prevention fund also funneled hundreds of millions into the preventive health services block grant. These grants have been critical in Massachusetts, for example, helping our communities respond to the heroin, prescription drug, and fentanyl crises.  Unfortunately for all of us, Tom Price's assault on health care wouldn't stop there. Congressman Price's march on the Affordable Care Act would slash Medicaid--and listen to this number--which pays for $1 out of every $5 in America for substance use disorder treatment.  The repeal of Medicaid expansion would rip coverage from 1.6 million Americans, newly insured Americans who have substance use disorders. We have an opioid crisis in America, a fentanyl crisis, a prescription drug crisis. People are dying in record numbers. What Tom Price is proposing is going to take 1.6 million of these Americans who are receiving treatment right now and just strip them of this health care benefit.  What happens to them? We know what happens if you don't have treatment. We know what happens if you don't have prevention when you have a drug problem. It leads, inextricably, inevitably, toward a conclusion that is now affecting tens of thousands of people in America every single year, and that is death. You tell these 1.6 million people they no longer have coverage, and you are sentencing them to consequences that, I don't think, our country wants to see.  I have served in Congress for nearly 40 years, and I have never seen anything like this opioid epidemic, never.  In Massachusetts, 2,000 people died last year. We are only 2 percent of America's population. If the whole country was dying at our rate, that would be 100,000 people a year dying from drug overdoses. That is two Vietnam wars every single year.  What Tom Price is saying is that he is going to rip away the Affordable Care Act funding for those who have substance abuse. Nationally, opioids have now killed more people than gun violence, auto accidents. Many people who have substance use disorders benefit from protections under the It is guaranteed. The funding is there for it. So this is for me just one perfect example of many, many examples which I can use in order to kind of just give people insight as to the horrors that are going to be done to vulnerable families all around the country.  Donald Trump is bragging today that he is going to provide a big league tax cut for businesses in America, big league tax breaks for the wealthiest people in our country. That is a commitment. The wealthiest can get a big tax break, businesses can get a big tax break.  Where will that money come from? Well, in order to pay for the Affordable Care Act, hospitals across the country kicked in about $500 billion over 10 years in order to help with the costs, but the hospitals received something in return. Because of the Medicaid subsidies for patients, they would now have insurance, and when they showed up at the hospitals, they would actually have insurance coverage. So that would help the hospitals have the revenue they need in order to take care of business. Since many fewer people were now going to arrive at the emergency room, the uncompensated care--that is the funding which the hospitals just had to provide for patients who just walked into an emergency room--would now be dramatically reduced because the patients would have insurance through the Affordable Care The $500 billion they had promised to the Federal Government that would not be an expenditure, that would be the tradeoff.  Then you say to yourself, what is the Republican plan now? What they are saying is, they are going to kill these subsidies that have reduced the number of people who do not have insurance going into emergency rooms, and they are going to strip that away. They don't have a plan. This is the Tom Price plan--nothing. But they are also saying they are not going to give back the money to the hospitals which had been used in order to deal with the uncompensated care. So it is a con job. The President says you have a big tax break to the wealthiest in our country, big tax break to the businesses in our country. Where is the money coming from? Where is the piggy bank? Here is the piggy bank. The piggy bank is the money that was being used to give insurance for people to go to hospitals with their families. That is being taken away, and they will use it to give tax breaks to the businesses. You are taking it from the people who need it the most, for health care, preventive services, and families and you give it to the people who need it the least, the wealthiest and the businesses in the country. It is a con job--take the money and hand it over to the largest constituency in the Republican And who is the architect? Tom  Is that why he would destroy this health care system? Is that why you would cut back Medicare? Is that why you would gut Medicaid? You do it so you can give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest in our society? That is an unacceptable plan, and it makes him an unacceptable candidate to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services in our country.  We have a raging epidemic of opioids. We have all kinds of problems that can be dealt with if people had the insurance coverage and they knew they could go in order to get the help they need.  Now let's focus on the Medicare Program because they want to save money there too. How are they going to accomplish that? Well, there were doom-[[Page S1052]]and-gloom prospects about the Medicare programs that came from the Republicans, Tom Price himself, but just the opposite happened. The Medicare Program since the Affordable Care Act went into place has resulted in the lowest per member rate of spending growth in its 50-year history for Premiums paid by enrollees in Medicare Part B and Part D have gone down against all the predictions of its opponents, and perhaps more importantly, the savings have helped America's seniors by ensuring that Medicare will continue to be there for them.  Here is a big number for you. Medicare had previously faced a projected insolvency that could have occurred this year--this year. Medicare insolvent. However, because of the Affordable Care Act, it extended the insolvency date of the Medicare trust by 12 years. Good news for seniors. Repealing the law jeopardizes Medicare for a generation of  But Tom Price doesn't just want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the second part of the health care assault is to transform Medicare into a voucher program and increase the Medicare eligibility age. After a lifetime of hard work, Congressman Price would make seniors wait longer for the benefits they earned.  My father was a milkman for the Hood Milk His arms were the size of my legs. Milk men work hard. Blue-collar people work hard across our country. Working-class people work hard. Should they have to wait until they are 66, 67, 68, 69 to receive a Medicare benefit? They work hard. That makes no sense whatsoever. That is Tom How do you increase the age when people can receive Medicare coverage for their health when they are old in order to save money--for what purpose? To then have a tax break for the wealthiest who already have the money they need in order to take care of the health care of their families. That is one thing you never have to worry about. The wealthy in America have all the money they need for their families.  Do you want to know another thing? The higher your income, the more likely you are going to live longer than people who don't have money. You don't have to worry about wealthy people. They are fine. Their health is fine. Their children are fine. Any problems in their family are fine.  Well, how about other families in our country? That is what this plan does. They want to lose that plan in order to give more money to the people who already have enough for the rest of their lives. So that would wind up increasing premiums for grandma and grandpa by hundreds of dollars, making them pay more out-of-pocket for less care. What Tom Price essentially wants to do is get us into the Wayback Machine and return us to a time when corporate insurance companies were calling the shots in our country, back to a time when a person could go bankrupt because of medical bills, back in time to when Americans had to choose between paying for the rent or paying for a lifesaving medical treatment.  The Affordable Care Act moved our country from being a sick care system to a health care system, but Congressman Price wants to undo all of that progress and get rid of all of those protections.  Here is Tom Price's bottom line: repeal the Affordable Care Act, which results in fewer insured patients, and that means more patients in the emergency room and higher premiums for everyone else. That formula is as bogus as a degree from Trump It doesn't add up.  The people who have to pay for it are everyone else's insurance policies that are going to go up. Because you better believe the hospitals and insurance companies, when that money is not there in the Affordable Care Act, insurance policies for those people, and you don't get back the $300 to $500 billion that the hospitals have now committed back to the Federal Government, somebody is going to have to pay. Somebody is going to pay, and you don't have to be Dick Tracy to figure this out. The people who are going to pay will be every other American who has an insurance policy. It will just go up 5, 10, 15 percent, everybody else's insurance policies. The hospitals are getting their dough; the insurance companies are getting their dough.  When people go to an emergency room, they are not going to be turned away. Somebody is going to have to pay. Where is the payment going to come from? Everybody else's insurance policies, which are going up, and the money that had been saved is going to the Federal Government for tax breaks to the Trump administration. He said today big league tax breaks for the wealthy, big league tax breaks for businesses. This is the plan that if you kicked it in the heart you would break your toe. What about ordinary people? What about the people who need help?  Martin Luther King, Jr., said: Of all forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking. You cannot work if you are ill, you cannot learn if you are sick, you cannot be secure if you are constantly worried that medical bills can wipe out your entire savings. These clearly are not concerns for Tom Price, who has a legislative history that has repeatedly favored wealthy individuals and corporations over the health of the majority of  Congressman Tom Price championed legislation that would eliminate young adults' ability to stay on their parents plan until age 26. Congressman Price trumpeted a plan that would let insurance reinstate lifetime and annual limits on coverage and charge women more because of their gender.  Tom Price would rip away the Affordable Care Act income-based subsidies and instead offer inadequate tax credits that can be given to a billionaire, not the middle-class, working-class, blue-collar  If Tom Price had his way, he would implement a plan that would cause health care premiums in individual markets to skyrocket, increasing premiums for average Americans by 25 percent immediately and doubling over the next 10 years. He wants to strip Planned Parenthood of all its resources, and 2.5 million people would lose access to care in those community clinics. If that happens, fewer mammograms, fewer prenatal exams, fewer cancer screenings, and loss of all those vital services would hit women of color and low-income women hardest. It would increase health inequity and health disparity in our communities of color.  Tom Price's assault on women's health doesn't end there. He has proposed legislation that would allow health insurance companies to charge women more than men. He has repeatedly cut and limited access to family planning services. He does not believe that women should get birth control with no out-of-pocket costs. He is an outspoken and virulent opponent of reproductive health and would push women's reproductive rights back to the 18th century. Good physical health and reproductive freedom are critical to supporting women as productive members of their households and our economy. We cannot allow Tom Price to turn back the clock.  So this is the challenge. We have an administration committed to increasing defense spending big time, increasing tax breaks to the wealthiest and to corporations big time, and then promising to cut the Federal budget by $10 trillion over the next 10 years. Well, where is the money going to come from?  We know what they are targeting. They are targeting all these programs that help those who need the help the most in our society. So I urge my colleagues to vote no on this nomination of Congressman He is the wrong man at the wrong time for the wrong job. It just doesn't match up, not with a 21st century strategy that we need to have the healthiest population in the world to compete against our economic rivals across the planet, and if for no other reason, just the moral obligation we have to make sure families are not desperate when their loved ones are hurting.  I thank you for giving me the opportunity to come out here at this time, and I urge my colleagues to vote no on Congressman Price's nomination.  I yield back the remainder of my time.

1091,topic-id,2576,"Mr.President, I have come to the floor to speak on the nomination of Congressman Price to be the Secretary of Health and Human But before I do, I must speak to the decision that the U.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit just decided in the case of the State of Washington and the State of Minnesota v. the President and the Department of Homeland  I am pleased to see that the courts of the United States are still part of the separate coequal branch of government that the Founders dictated when they ultimately created an ingenious document, the Constitution of the United States, which served the Nation well for so long, even though it seems the President may need a review of history and an understanding of the Constitution as it relates to the separate coequal branches of government, because he seems to be willing to try to disparage the judiciary in an effort to try to either effect their decisionmaking or to call into question the legality of their decisions or the righteousness of their decisions.  I am glad to see that that has not affected our judicial system. I just want to read some elements of the court's decision, which I think are pretty extraordinary. Of course, this is far from a final decision on the merits, but it was on a motion for a stay of the order of the district court that said, basically, that the Muslim ban could not be continued to be enforced.  The court said--and I am quoting--in a unanimous opinion which speaks very powerfully to their decision:       We therefore conclude that the States--  Meaning the State that brought forth--Washington, as well as the State of Minnesota--     that the States have alleged harms to their proprietary      interests traceable to the Executive The necessary      connection can be drawn in at most two very logical steps:      (1) the Executive Order prevents nationals of seven countries      from entering Washington and Minnesota; (2) as a result, some      of these people will not enter state universities, some of      them will not join those universities as faculty, some will      be prevented from performing research, and some will not be      permitted to return if they leave.       We therefore hold that the States have standing.  That was one of the critical legal bars.  Secondly, they opined on the reviewability of the Executive order. This is, I think, extraordinarily important. The Court went on to say--I am paraphrasing at this point: Yes, the courts owe substantial deference to the immigration and national security policy determinations of the political branches--legislative and executive. But it went further to say:       Instead, the Government has taken the position--  This is on behalf of the executive branch--     that the President's decisions about immigration policy,      particularly when motivated by national security concerns,      are unreviewable--  Unreviewable--     even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional      rights and protections. The Government indeed asserts that it      violates separation of powers for the judiciary to entertain      a constitutional challenge to executive actions such as this      one.  I did not really capture that the government had made that argument. But that is an extraordinary argument. The court went on to say:       There is no precedent to support this claimed      unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental      structure of our constitutional democracy. Within our system,      it is the role of the judiciary to interpret the law, a duty      that will sometimes require the ``[r]esolution of litigation      challenging the constitutional authority of one of the three      branches.'' We are called upon to perform that duty in this      case.  Further they say: ``Although our jurisprudence has long counseled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution.''  That is an extraordinary set of statements that the government made, saying that the President's actions are unreviewable in this regard.  They further go on to say: ``Nonetheless, `courts are not powerless to review the political branches' actions' with respect to matters of national security.''  It would indeed be ironic if, in the name of national defense, we would sanction the subversion of one of those liberties which make the defense of the Nation worthwhile.  Well, I fully agreed with the circuit court's determination in that regard.  It goes on to say: ``In short, although courts owe considerable deference to the President's policy determinations with respect to immigration and national security, it is beyond question that the Federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action.''  Well, all I can say is, thank Thank God that the courts of the United States feel that they are not controlled by the executive branch in pursuing the decisions that are made. This is a great day for democracy in our country and for the preservation of the separation of powers. This is a great day, I think, from my own perspective, that a ban that does not help the United States but harms us and is against every fiber of our being and the nature of the history of our Nation, which was founded by those fleeing religious persecution--ultimately, today, we restore that sense of our history, and we restore who we are as a nation both at home and across the world.  But today's decisions in this regard are also important as we consider the nomination of Congressman Price, so I want to rise today, along with so many of my colleagues, to voice my strong opposition to the confirmation of Congressman Price to be the Secretary of Health and Human  I am deeply concerned about his views on what is the core mission of Health and Human Services, not only his career-long opposition to the very existence of Medicaid and Medicare but his wavering fidelity in science and his regressive views of women's health care and the social safety net.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services is one of the few Cabinet positions that affect virtually every single man, woman, and child in It affects the health care of 56 million seniors on Medicare, of 74 million low-income individuals and children on Medicaid, and of 12 million Americans who have enrolled in the Affordable Care Act coverage. But more than that, the Department of Health and Human Services is home to the world's leading institutions of research at the National Institutes of Health, of advancing public health and epidemiology at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, known worldwide, of working to ensure that we have access to the most advanced, most effective, and safest medications at the Food and Drug Administration, and many other critical departments and agencies that we as Americans rely on.  Many of our Republican colleagues have pointed out that Congressman Price's history as an orthopedic surgeon is enough evidence that he is someone who should be in charge of the Department of Health and Human I can't speak to his credentials and qualifications in the operating room, but I do have a constitutional obligation to speak about his credentials and qualifications to be the Secretary of Health and Human So I can say without hesitation that his career in Congress and his positions on key issues of policy have proven to me that he is not the right person for the job.  Throughout his time as a congressman--most recently as the chairman of the House Budget Committee and during his confirmation process through the Senate Finance Committee, on which I am privileged to serve--it has become abundantly clear that Congressman Price views patients, including seniors on Medicare and even those with private employer coverage, as nothing more than a source of revenue or a budget line item. The characteristics that had defined Congressman Price's career run contrary--contrary--to the fundamental mission of the Department of Health and Human Services, and it should be a cause for concern across the aisle and across the country.  Despite the alternative reality portrayed during his confirmation hearings in both the Finance Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Congressman Price's vision for our Nation's health[[Page S1030]]care system has been laid bare for the public to see for years. All one has to do is look at the legislation he has introduced and the radical budget proposals he, along with Speaker Ryan, has been pushing through the House of Let's look at some of them.  Let's start by taking a look at his plan for Medicare, which is, by all intents and purposes, a plan to fundamentally end Medicare as we know it, end Medicare as we know it. Despite Congressman Price's seeming denial of this fact, when I asked him about it directly during his confirmation hearing, there is absolutely no other way to characterize his plan: It ends Medicare as we know it.  Currently and for more than 50 years, Medicare has provided a guarantee--a guarantee; that word is critical--to seniors that they will have coverage, access to care, and the ability to rest assured that their health care needs will be taken care of. It is a system into which they paid their entire working lives and a compact that has been made with the Federal Government that we will uphold our end of the deal and ensure that they have quality coverage to stay healthy.  The Affordable Care Act, despite the years-long gnashing of teeth and fake tears shed by some of my Republican colleagues, has improved upon this deal and made Medicare stronger. It has extended the life of the Medicare trust fund by more than a decade. It has saved seniors $27 billion on prescription drugs and last year alone provided more than 40 million seniors access to no-cost preventive services--no-cost preventive services. In my home State of New Jersey last year, seniors on Medicare saved more than $263 million on prescription drugs, and nearly 1 million seniors were able to receive free preventive services.  Additionally, thanks to the law's health care delivery system reforms, we are seeing far fewer hospital-acquired conditions and greater coordination of care that has resulted in a healthier population and a more efficient health care delivery system. That reality stands in stark contrast to Tom Price's vision of what he thinks Medicare should be and in stark contrast with the vast majority of seniors who want to protect the program for their loved ones and for themselves.  Unfortunately, President Trump, who himself spent an entire campaign promising that he is ``not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,'' nominated a leading member of this radical anti-Medicare movement to impose devastating cuts to the program, force seniors to pay higher costs, and lower the quality of care throughout the health care system.  Congressman Price's destructive legislative history on Medicare does not lie. It is there. It is in the record. It is there for anybody who wants to see it. It tells a stark truth about his desire to increase the eligibility age, about ending the guarantee--the guarantee of coverage.  You know, that is why we call it an entitlement. If you meet the criteria under the law, you are entitled to those health care services; you are guaranteed those health care services. But his whole legislative history is about ending the guarantee of coverage we currently have and replacing it with the possibility of coverage. The difference between a guarantee and a possibility is a far, far too significant gulf to be able to overcome--but only if you can afford the difference between Congressman Price's coupon and the actual cost of care under his vision. The Congressional Budget Office has shown that this will unquestionably increase costs for seniors.  His dark view of Medicare, that--to quote Congressman Price--``nothing has a greater negative impact on . . . health care than the Federal Government's intrusion . . . through Medicare''--that is an extraordinary statement. I am going to quote it again. ``Nothing has a greater negative impact on . . . health care than the Federal Government's intrusion''--intrusion, mind you--``through Medicare.'' That is understandably causing a lot of concern back home in New Many people have been calling and writing me to express their thoughts.  William Thar of Summit, NJ, himself a retired physician of more than 50 years, wrote in that Price's ``willingness to privatize Medicare indicates a lack of concern for Americans who need health care coverage.''  I also heard from Cara Davis of Glen Ridge, NJ, who wrote in on behalf of her uncle, who has end-stage renal disease and requires dialysis, saying, ``If [Price] and the Trump administration successfully move Medicare to a voucher program''--again, that is different from a guarantee--``I fear that my uncle will not be able to afford the necessary coverage for his dialysis treatments.''  For me, the battle to protect Medicare is more than a political battle; it is more than a theoretical battle; it is a deeply personal battle to protect a program that allows seniors to live with dignity during the twilight of their lives.  My personal connection to the value of the Medicare Program stems not from my experience but that of my late mother, For 18 long, difficult years, my mother suffered from Alzheimer's disease. During those years, we watched as this strong, courageous woman drifted further and further away from us. After her diagnosis, I, like so many families across our Nation, hoped for the best, but we expected the worst. And while there were times early on when she seemed just fine, those times turned into lost moments, and those lost moments eventually lasted forever.  At this point, I had to wonder if all the moments of her life--her struggle to flee her homeland and seek freedom in the United States, of my youth and all of the time spent together--were still in there, still with her somehow, or whether those memories were lost forever.  As her illness progressed, she lost her cognitive abilities, and eventually we had to admit to ourselves that our mother was no longer with us, until, mercifully, the Good Lord took her, and the long goodbye came to an end.  Throughout this experience, throughout her struggle of fighting back against the progress of Alzheimer's, our family knew that Medicare would be there to provide her with access to the health care she needed. I learned that Medicare wasn't just there for her; it was there for the rest of us, too, providing her with access to care, while granting us the ability to focus on making the most of the limited time we had together.  Medicare was there to meet the challenges of her illness as well as the intergenerational challenges that arise when caring for a parent in the twilight of their lives while simultaneously working to put your own children through college. I lived it, I saw it, and I understand it. My mother would not have lived with the dignity that she deserved in the twilight of her life after working a lifetime and paying for Medicare, but for Medicare as a guarantee.  I know all too well that an underfunded voucher would undermine Medicare's ability to live up to the responsibility that we have to care for one another and to provide that same dignity to seniors as they and their families prepare to say good-bye for the last time.

1244,topic-id,460,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment is very simple. It just says that the provisions of the SCRUB Act will not apply to any rule or set of rules relating to any obligation of the Federal Government with respect to tribal government or supporting tribal sovereignty and self-determination.  Mr.Chair, the United States has a unique legal and political relationship with Indian tribal governments, as outlined in the Constitution, treaties, statutes, executive orders, and judicial decisions. However, too often they have been overlooked when it comes to Federal policies that will have a direct impact on that relationship and that sovereignty.  My concern is that, without explicit language, H.998 would simply continue this mistake, which has had devastating consequences for our Native American brothers and sisters. It has been a decades-long policy of the Federal Government to engage Native American tribes in a government-to-government relationship that respects their right to self-government and self-determination, and my amendment seeks to ensure that nothing in this bill will undermine those efforts.  My amendment would exempt rules that will have an impact on this government-to-government relationship from the bill's requirements. This will, of course, require agencies and this commission to examine the impact on this special relationship in each rule that they bring to the chopping block. It makes clear that protecting the sovereignty and promoting the economic, political, and social self-determination for the Native American community remains a pressing priority.  Now, just 2 days ago, Mr.Chairman, the House considered and passed a bill, H.228, the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Consolidation Act, to make permanent a program that allows tribes to combine up to 13 different Federal, employment, childcare, and job training funding sources.  Of course, the sponsor of this legislation, Representative Don Young, a true champion for Native Americans, described it well. He said: ``This program is what tribal self-determination is all about. Tribes understand their members best and know how to use these tools for creating expanding job opportunities in their communities.''  The same thing with NAHASDA, which has a lot of innovations, and I have worked with Congressman Steve Pearce and Representative Cole and others. Once NAHASDA reauthorization becomes law, it, too, might fall short because of this particular bill. I fear that the SCRUB Act's reckless rush to repeal rules based primarily only on one consideration, cost to the economy, will adversely affect Native  How will members of this commission be experts on the sovereignty and government-to-government relationship with tribes? There is no appointee for Native American communities on this commission, on the needs of native communities, on efforts by Congress to promote self-determination.

1077,topic-id,1532,"Mr.President, I rise tonight actually to support the confirmation of my friend and fellow Georgian and our next Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom I have known Price personally and worked with him for quite some time. He is a remarkable individual, and we should take comfort in his nomination to this important position because he has years of service and years of experience working with our Nation's health care system.  He has been a practicing physician, a state legislator, and a Member of the House of Price knows that government intrusion has already negatively impacted patient care in the last few years. He has years of professional experience as a physician and he is seen as a leading voice in health care policy. My colleagues across the aisle oppose him, they say primarily because of his opposition to the Affordable Care Well, the truth is, ObamaCare is collapsing under its own weight today. In my State of Georgia, this year alone, after double-digit increases last year, premiums are up 33 percent this year. Nationwide, premiums are up 26 percent. So the other side talks about it being affordable. People back home--I am getting letters every week about the fact that people are withdrawing from ObamaCare because of the increase in premiums, and most insidious are the increases in deductibles. Some two-thirds increase--67 percent--increase in deductibles.  You know, we don't have to worry about repealing ObamaCare because it is collapsing under its own weight. We just have to sit back and watch it die of its own volition. Here is how it is going to happen. It is very simple. In my State, out of 159 counties, we have 99 counties that only have one health care provider because of the Affordable Care Even in that carrier, there are limited insurance programs available to their customers.  What happens if that carrier decides they cannot profitably afford to be in Georgia? Then 99 counties will lose any health care carrier. Where do they go? They will be fined under the Affordable Care Act for not having insurance. Where do they go? Well, the Federal Government has an answer, obviously. The U.Government can always step in and be the insurer of last resort. Is that not the single-payer strategy that was behind this all along? It is not what American mainstream voters want.  The fearmongering that is going on right now about any potential repeal is just hypocrisy. I believe there is no question that there is a plan. We know there is, but to fix ObamaCare is very difficult relatively to the way it was built to begin with. It was based on the wrong premise; that is, that the Federal Government is going to step in and take care of everybody's health care.  If you like the Veterans' Administration, you are going to love health care done by the Federal Government in the Affordable Care By the way, if you like the way the post office is run, you are going to love the way the Federal Government runs our health care.  With all of that in mind, the 1 objective of Price that I have heard today and throughout this week has been nothing more than the vitriolic argument that he opposes That is sad. I think we are taking a great American who is willing to volunteer and become a member of this President's Cabinet and try to make health care better for every  I can't think of another person in this country who is more qualified for this timely responsibility.

I am glad we are finally grinding our way to his confirmation later tonight, but while we talk about his confirmation, we also need to talk about this frog walk that the opposition is making us go through to get these nominees confirmed in this This is taking the longest time to confirm a Cabinet since George  We see extreme delays, longer delays than we have seen at any time since the first President was in office. Imagine if Hillary Clinton was President right now. Imagine if Republicans in the Senate were doing what the people across the aisle are doing today. Imagine if we were delaying her Cabinet nominees to the point where we are now confirming them at a pace slower than any time since George Washington was in office in 1789.  Imagine how the mainstream media would be screaming about that story and how it would be a very different story than what is being told today. This last week, the Senate demonstrated exactly the type of behavior that folks in my home State of Georgia, and I must say around the country, are absolutely fed up with and sick and tired after.  They know this is exactly why Washington is gridlocked and why we are not getting results for the American people. We are wasting time. People are out of work. The other side says this is very real. Of course it is very real. It is time to move on. We have a new Put his team in place. The American people are being hurt by and paying attention to this failure of responsibility.  Real results can only be achieved if Washington politicians prioritize the well-being of Americans, rather than their own individual political careers and their next election cycle. The minority party is well within their rights, of course, to dissent and oppose the President's nominees on solid ground. Republicans have done that in the past, but at no time in history have we seen this sort of frog-walk delay being perpetrated on the people of  They are using the rules of the Senate inappropriately, in my mind, to slow down and bring to a halt the confirmation process of a President they don't support. No President since George Washington has had to endure this sort of historic delay, obstruction, and slow-walking we have seen here since President Trump was inaugurated.  If the minority party had its way, all Cabinet-level nominees would not be confirmed until June or July of this year. By the way, that is one-eighth of the first term of this President--12 percent is being wasted right now--if, in fact, the Republican leadership in this Senate were not doing what it is doing. The minority party knows it can't stop any of these nominees on their own[[Page S1021]]merits individually. So they are grinding the entire process to a halt using procedural delays.

I am proud to have attended Michigan public schools, and I have three children who did so as well. I know firsthand the importance of a strong public education system.

He fought for our country in World War II and returned home to help build America's middle class.

Strong public schools are vital to our economy, our democracy, and to our Nation's global competitiveness.

In Colorado, the average student loan borrower owes $26,000.  Why would we want to risk abolishing consumer protections for our borrowers?  These are very personal numbers. The stories I hear, the burden of student loan debt affects people's ability to own a home or buy a car.  A recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that the number of student loan borrowers over the age of 60 has quadrupled. People haven't even paid off their loans as they enter retirement age.  Now, the Obama administration did take important steps to protect and support student loan borrowers. They made it easier for them to pay back their loans and ensured they were treated fairly by student loan services. Rolling back these protections would have far-reaching negative effects for our borrowers.  I strongly support Congresswoman Bonamici's amendment, exempting Federal protections that support consumer protections for student loan borrowers from the SCRUB The last thing we need to scrub away is protections for people to take out student loans.

It is written with the intent that every student--no matter their race, their economic background, their ZIP Code--deserves a great education in our country.  Title I of ESEA gets at the heart of the civil rights spirit for providing additional funding for schools with significant populations of high-needs and at-risk students. Now, title I also provides important performance and equity parameters for States and districts and gives some direction about how States can comply with these requirements to support our most struggling schools.  Of course, the text of the law doesn't do everything, which is why we rely on the protections that have been put in place through rule.

1235,topic-id,709,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would protect all rules relating to the enforcement of the Clean Air Act, which are in danger now under H.998, the SCRUB Act, which seeks to authorize a brand new $30 million Presidential commission of unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats to wipe out agency rules across the whole field of government.  Mr.Chairman, last night in this Chamber, the President of the United States came and articulated policy areas where he said his administration ``wants to work with Members of both parties.'' One of these was to promote clean air and clean water. I was happy to hear it because earlier in the day he signed an executive order to clear the way for weakening safe drinking water standards through redefinition of which small bodies of water are covered under the Clean Water  Now, the amendment I propose provides a chance for all of us to start fresh in demonstrating our seriousness about this new bipartisan commitment to protect the water we drink and the air that we breathe.  The SCRUB Act proposes to create a commission to do what Federal agencies and commissions already do, which is to review and update their rules. That is why a lot of us are deeply skeptical about spending $30 million to create a new roving commission to hack away at rules protecting the public interest.  This commission would be made up of five members appointed directly by the President at his discretion and four members by the President from congressional nomination, too, from each party.  The advocates for this legislation say it is not about dismantling the rules that protect the water that our children drink or the air that our children and our grandparents breathe or the food that all of us eat. It is just about getting rid of unnecessary and obsolete and profligate regulations. And I take them at their word that that is what it is about.                              {time}  1330  So let's all agree that the new supercommission that you seek to establish under the SCRUB Act will not touch, in any way, the rules adopted under the Clean Air If that is not the purpose of this legislation, to undermine the Clean Air Act regime, as its advocates repeatedly insist, then there should be no problem having us formalize this commitment on a bipartisan basis.  Right now, the SCRUB Act does not explicitly protect clean air--or clean water, for that matter--from the prospects of a roving bureaucratic attack. Thus, it exposes all of us to unnecessary harm, threatening to scrub away the rules that protect the air we breathe.  What will that mean for 17 million Americans with asthma, for the millions of people with lung cancer and other respiratory diseases, for more than 30,000 people struggling with cystic fibrosis? All of these people are potentially in danger simply because of an overblown ideological attack on regulations, which are just the rules that we adopt as a constitutional democracy to protect ourselves from harm.  In answer to objections about the bill, the majority says that Congress will still have its say; but if you read it carefully, you see that congressional authority has actually been placed in a straitjacket. The bill requires an up-or-down vote on the commission's recommendations as a complete omnibus package rather than voting on each proposal individually.  So if you agreed with loosening some regulations, for example, in the Title X Family Planning program, which has a lot of rules, but you don't want to eviscerate the regulatory infrastructure under the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, you would have to vote on the entire package at once. This makes Congress into an embarrassing rubber stamp for a nine-person body effectively controlled by the executive branch.  Dear colleagues, let's not play games with the health and safety of our constituents. If this bill passes as is, rules that govern the very air we breathe would be subject to the SCRUB Act's unelected, unaccountable, and unbounded practitioners. My amendment closes a gaping and dangerous hole in the legislation. I ask my colleagues to think about public health and safety first, and not the magical thinking and scientifically ungrounded cost-benefit analysis promised by the SCRUB  I reserve the balance of my time.

1261,topic-id,1218,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  The purpose of this amendment is simply to carve out from the provisions of the legislation any rules that we have adopted in order to prevent conflicts of interest and in order to promote financial transparency and disclosure by executive branch employees.  Mr.Speaker, since I became a Member of the House in January and joined the Judiciary Committee, we have been subjected to an onslaught of bills seeking to free corporate polluters, lead paint and asbestos manufacturers, and other abusers of the rights of consumers and citizens from having to face the people they injure in court and having to comply with the rules that have been worked out over the decades to protect our air, our water, our land, our people, our health, and our workplaces.  In most cases, we don't even get hearings on these bills. In the Judiciary Committee, I have not seen a victim of toxic torts or lead poisoning or medical malpractice testify, but their rights are being flattened every single day by the legislative bulldozer that is running amuck.  These bills are flying at us with lightning speed--no hearings, no real debate, no time to study the measures, no time to do the proper information gathering for our constituents.  Now the SCRUB Act would establish an unelected roving commission with unlimited subpoena power. It would be controlled by the President who gets to appoint a clean majority--five members at his own discretion; and four more, two Republicans and two So when they say it is bipartisan, remember what that means: Seven spots for majority appointees and two spots for minority appointees. More importantly, this roving commission can be lobbied behind closed doors by the special interests that want to splice and dice the regulations that we have worked out over the decades to protect the public against harm.  In all of the rules that our democracy has put in place--not just old rules, not just obsolete rules, not just silly rules--all of them are going to be in the crosshairs of this roving commission--no exceptions, no firewalls, no protections for rules governing public health and safety--like the Clean Water Act or like the Clean Air They just rejected the amendment to carve that out. There are no protections, significantly, and this is what the amendment is about, for rules guaranteeing transparency in government and integrity in government.  My motion to recommit, Mr.Speaker, would incorporate into the underlying legislation an amendment that I advanced in committee that goes to the heart of the crisis of confidence in Washington, in America today. I think every Member of this body can support it without betraying any of their principles or their party. On the contrary, I think it strengthens all of our principles and it strengthens our parties by building public confidence in the political system as a whole. It makes sure we can keep draining the swamp, as the President of the United States said in this Chamber last night.  My amendment states very simply that the Commission may not target for destruction any rules relating to any law governing a potential conflict of interest of an employee or officer of the executive branch, or any law governing the financial disclosures of executive branch employees, and bribery.  Right now, we know there is a dangerous crisis in popular confidence in the national government. This administration has brought to Washington a web of complicated conflicts of interest, real or potential, attendant to a global business empire that engages in business with foreign governments, foreign and domestic corporations, and a huge host of regulated entities.  Just a mile from where we sit today, for example, the Trump Hotel is renting out guest rooms, ballrooms, meeting rooms, and whole floors to foreign governments, embassies, and large corporations in flagrant violation of the Emoluments Clause, article 1, section 9, which requires the President to come ask us--Congress--for permission to receive payments from foreign governments.                              {time}  1445  They even have a director of diplomatic sales now. Furthermore, the standard lease that the Trump Hotel has with the General Services Administration forbids any elected official of the United States Government or the District of Columbia from deriving any profit or value from the lease. Clearly, there is a breach in this lease right now. The problem is that the President is not only the tenant, he is, for all intents and purposes, the landlord too because he controls the GSA and appoints its director. So President-landlord Donald Trump would have to go to court to sue tenant businessman Donald Trump for breaching the lease by collecting money under it as a public official. This just scratches the surface of a welter of ethical conflicts.  Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.  Since I became a member of this House in January, my Freshman colleagues and I have been engaged in two activities. First, we've been sitting in hearings and trying to make sense of bills that fundamentally change the legal and regulatory structure of America--and we've done so without hearing from witnesses, without time to study measures, and without time to do the proper information gathering that I believe is necessary to serve our various constituencies. Second, we've come to the floor at the end of each day to cast votes on deregulation. This house has been in the business of loosening rules on everything. We've[[Page H1418]]made it easier to pollute, easier to harm consumers--all in the name of cutting regulatory costs. And so it's no surprise that a bill like this sailed through the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to the floor.  This bill would establish an unelected commission with unlimited subpoena power and partisan majority to chop through the Federal Register with a chain saw. There are no exceptions, no firewalls, no protections for rules and regulations governing health and safety and there are no protections for rules guaranteeing transparency in government.  My motion to recommit would incorporate into the underlying legislation, an amendment I offered in committee. It's straightforward and unburdensome. In fact, when I offered it in committee one of my colleagues on the other side indicated that the priority of this bill is ``major rules with massive costs.''  If passed, this MTR would make certain that no provision of the SCRUB Act could be used to eliminate rules relating to laws that govern conflicts of interest of executive branch officers or employees. That's it--it reinforces existing law and clarifies provisions of this bill.  Surely, we can agree that rules designed to help maintain the public trust in those representing them in the Executive Branch are sacred enough to be explicitly protected. And if anyone should ask why it's so important, we don't have to look too far. This administration is a walking, talking billboard for the need to protect laws that protect the public trust.  I urge my colleagues to support this common sense measure.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,1.0,January
1107,topic-id,1916,"Mr.President, I rise today in opposition to President Trump's nomination of Congressman Tom Price for the Department of Health and Human The Department he has been picked to lead is charged with protecting the health of all Americans, from safeguarding Medicare and nursing home care for seniors to investing in medical research and supporting public health programs, such as lead poisoning prevention and youth suicide prevention.  Unfortunately, Congressman Price has demonstrated over the last decade in Congress that he is unwilling or unfit or both to protect these critical health programs. In his role as chairman of the House Budget Committee, Congressman Price has offered plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act and turn Medicare into a privatized voucher program. This is the opposite of protecting the safety net programs for our most vulnerable citizens.  Time and again, Congressman Price has proved that he favors corporate interests over patients, which has raised ethics concerns. For these reasons, I will oppose his nomination.  First, I would like to talk about the Affordable Care About a month ago, I was here talking to my colleagues on the floor about the impact of the ACA in my home State of Rhode Island and the consequences of repeal. In short, repeal of the ACA would be catastrophic in Rhode Island and across the country. Yet Congressman Price has led the efforts in the House of Representatives to repeal the ACA without any replacement. In fact, he is the architect of legislation to do just that.  The uninsured rate today is at its lowest point in recent history. That holds true in my State of Rhode The uninsured rate there has fallen from nearly 12 percent to under 4.5 percent. That translates to over 100,000 Rhode Islanders who have gained coverage because of the  While it is not the case in every State, in Rhode Island insurance rates have dropped. In fact, consumers in Rhode Island have saved $220 million since 2012.  We cannot go back to a system that allows private insurers to deny coverage for preexisting conditions or[[Page S1062]]charge more to those who need insurance the most. By contrast, Congressman Price opposes the preexisting conditions ban, one of the most popular provisions of the  His plan would allow insurance companies to deny coverage or to charge more to those with preexisting conditions, older Americans, and women. He has also proposed getting rid of the essential benefits package in the These protections require insurance companies to cover things like prescriptions drugs, maternity care, pediatric services, and mental health care. These are really things that any basic health coverage should include, yet Congressman Price has advocated taking away these consumer protections.  Stop and think about that. Congressman Price does not think that health insurance should cover pregnancy, for example. I mean, we are not really talking about extravagant services. These are the services that a reasonable person would expect their health insurance to cover. In fact, Congressman Price's plan, the Republican plan to repeal the ACA, would mean that nearly half a million Rhode Islanders with preexisting conditions--that is nearly half the population of my State--could be denied coverage or charged more. Those who might still be able to get coverage would quickly find that it does not cover that much.  These consumer protections that are embedded in the ACA affect everyone, not just those who have coverage because of the Before the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans, including coverage through your employer, could impose annual or lifetime limits on coverage, meaning coverage could end just when you need it most. With Congressman Price in charge, if he has his way, we will see a return of these limits, even for employer-sponsored health plans.  The nominee's stance on the Affordable Care Act is not my only worry because when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, benefits that Americans have worked hard to earn and to fund, Congressman Price's views are far outside the mainstream.  Medicare is one of the great success stories in expanding access to care and keeping seniors out of poverty. Since the passage of Medicare in 1965, we have seen significant decreases in the numbers of seniors living in poverty, and this is largely because of Medicare and, of course, Social Security, another critical safety net program for seniors. I believe that Medicare is essential for the quality of life of Rhode Island's seniors and for seniors across the country.  In fact, I supported the ACA because it made key improvements to Medicare that strengthened its long-time solvency and increased benefits, such as closing the prescription doughnut hole and eliminating cost sharing for preventive services, such as cancer screenings.  Over 15,000 Rhode Islanders saved $14 million on prescriptions drugs in 2015, an average of $912 per beneficiary. In the same year, over 92,000 Rhode Islanders took advantage of free preventive services, representing over 76 percent of beneficiaries. We see these benefits because of the Affordable Care  Repealing the Affordable Care Act, as advocated by the Congressman, means repealing these benefits for seniors and shortening the life of the Medicare trust fund by over a decade. What is worse is that Congressman Price not only wants to repeal the ACA and the Medicare benefits that come with it, but he has also advocated for privatizing Medicare, turning it into a voucher-based program, as well as raising the eligibility age.  Simply put, this would end Medicare as we know it. Millions of Americans, including over 200,000 Rhode Islanders, have paid into the system, counting on the benefits that they have earned and worked their entire life for. Under Congressman Price's plan, Republicans would shift more costs to seniors who have played by the rules and planned for retirement with quality Medicare coverage.  Congressman Price and Congressional Republicans will tell you that they are trying to cut costs under the banner of trying to save If that is the Republican standard, then why do they oppose the ACA which actually improved Medicare services, cut costs, and extended Medicare solvency? That seems to be a pattern with many on the other side: Act very serious and concerned about Medicare's finances, but then make every effort to demonize and roll back these improvements.  In fact, Medicare spent $453 billion less from 2009 to 2014 than it expected under growth trends prior to the ACA, all while increasing benefits like free preventive care and better prescription drug coverage and adding over a decade of solvency to the Medicare trust fund. The projected cost--the best projections were actually lowered by the ACA while benefits were increased. This talk of supposedly saving Medicare is really, in my view, a ruse to make draconian cuts to free up more Federal funding for things like tax breaks for the wealthy. We cannot allow Republicans under Congressman Price's leadership to go back on the Medicare guarantee we have made to seniors that we represent all across this country.  Congressman Price has also made a number of troubling statements about Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, First, repeal of the ACA would have a disastrous effect on State Medicaid programs, kicking 11 million Americans off their health insurance, including 70,000 Rhode  However, this is not enough for Congressman He has offered legislation to cut Medicaid even further, to the tune of $1 trillion, by turning Medicaid into a Block Grant  I think my colleagues should really consider how this would impact their Including those newly insured by the ACA, Medicaid covers 74 million Who makes up this population? Well, half of the Medicaid enrollees are children.  Medicaid also pays for half the births in this country.  These are staggering numbers. In Rhode Island, one in four children is covered by Medicaid or CHIP, and one in two people with disabilities is covered by  While Medicaid was initially designed to help low-income families, seniors now account for approximately half of Medicaid's spending nationwide. Nearly 60 percent of nursing home residents are covered by Medicaid across the country, and that holds true in my State of Rhode  Many of these people are our neighbors, our friends. They have been working all their lives, and they have qualified for this coverage because they have been able to move some of their assets out of their ownership because our rules don't recognize retirement accounts. So these are our neighbors.  When Congressman Price talks about turning Medicaid into a block grant program, every Member of this Chamber has to stop to realize that there is no way to cut Medicaid by trillions of dollars without harming children and seniors and placing each of our States in a very difficult position because they, too, contribute to Medicaid; because they have a responsibility to children and seniors for health care; because they do also help support nursing home, nursing facilities for seniors and the disabled. And they would be in a disastrous situation.  Now, all of these are, I believe, reason enough to oppose Congressman Price's nomination. However--and I alluded to this earlier, and Senator Wyden went into great detail--Congressman Price has a history of conflicts of interest, such as investments in the very issues and companies he worked on, as a Member of  Congressman Price traded hundreds of thousands of dollars in health care pharmaceutical stocks, all the while advocating for regulation legislation that would financially benefit these very companies. Again, Senator Wyden has made a very detailed and very persuasive case in this regard.  In fact, as Senator Wyden has pointed out, after receiving information from a fellow Congressman and now a member of President Trump's transition team, Congressman Price was one of a small group who was offered the chance to purchase stock in a biomedical group at a discounted price.  Now, Democrats are not going to have the opportunity to fully examine these issues. I find the examples we do have to be deeply concerning. The very articulate, eloquent, and detailed--exhaustively detailed--statement by Senator Wyden adds further credence to this presumption.[[Page S1063]]  This is a very disconcerting pattern of behavior. Indeed, I believe this pattern of behavior warrants further investigation, but those requests have been denied by the Republican majority. These allegations are now even more concerning because of the need for further investigation, but those requests have been denied by the Republican majority. These allegations are even now more concerning because Congressman Price is being considered for the top role in this administration in charge of protecting the health of all Americans and, indeed, affecting the corporate situation of thousands of companies throughout this land that he may or may not have a financial interest in.  Now I have heard from hundreds of Rhode Islanders who have expressed these concerns to me, from his support for the efforts to repeal the ACA and cut Medicaid and Medicare to his questionable investments. I agree with them.  As such, I am unable to support Congressman Price's nomination for Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and I would urge others to look very carefully at the record, carefully at the advocacy for the elimination, basically, of Medicare as we know it, of block-granting Medicaid, which would harm children and seniors and put excruciating financial pressure on every State in this country, and his own behavior with respect to personal investments.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1198,topic-id,761,"Mr.President, I am reintroducing the PCAOB Enforcement Transparency Act along with Senator This bill permits the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, PCAOB, to make public the disciplinary proceedings it has brought against auditors and audit firms earlier in the process.  Over 10 years ago, our markets were victimized by a series of massive financial reporting frauds, including those involving Enron and In response to this crisis, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs conducted multiple hearings, which produced consensus on a number of underlying causes, including weak corporate governance, a lack of accountability, and inadequate oversight of accountants charged with auditing public companies' financial statements.  In order to address the gaps and structural weaknesses revealed by the investigation and hearings, the Senate passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a 99-to-0 vote. Among its many provisions, this law called for the creation of a strong, independent board, the PCAOB, responsible for overseeing auditors of public companies in order to protect investors who rely on independent audit reports on the financial statements of public companies.  To conduct its duties, the PCAOB, under the oversight of the U.Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, oversees more than 1,500 registered accounting firms, as well as the audit partners and staff who contribute to a firm's work on each audit. The board's ability to initiate proceedings to determine whether there have been violations of its auditing standards or rules of professional practice is an important component of its oversight.  However, unlike other oversight bodies, such as the SEC, the U.Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the U.Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and others, the Board's disciplinary proceedings are not allowed to be public without consent from the parties involved. Of course, parties subject to disciplinary proceedings have no incentive to consent to publicizing their alleged wrongdoing and thus these proceedings typically remain cloaked behind a veil of secrecy. In addition, the board's decisions in disciplinary proceedings are not allowed to be publicized until after the complete exhaustion of an appeals process, which can often take several years.  These PCAOB disciplinary proceedings create a lack of transparency that invites abuse and undermines the congressional intent behind the PCAOB, which was to shine a bright light on auditing firms and practices, and to bolster the accountability of auditors of public companies to the investing public.  Over the years, some bad actors have taken advantage of this loophole to shield themselves from public scrutiny and accountability. PCAOB Chairman James Doty has repeatedly stated in testimony provided to both the Senate and House of Representatives over the years that the secrecy of the proceedings ``has a variety of unfortunate consequences'' and that such secrecy is harmful to investors, the auditing profession, and the public at large.  For example, an accounting firm that was subject to a disciplinary proceeding continued to issue no fewer than 29 additional audit reports on public companies without any of those companies knowing about its PCAOB disciplinary proceedings. Disturbingly, investors and the public company clients of that audit firm were deprived of relevant information about the proceedings against the firm and the substance of any violations.  In addition to the reasons I have already provided, there are other reasons why the board's enforcement proceedings should be open and transparent.  First, the incentive to litigate cases in order to continue to shield conduct from public scrutiny as long as possible frustrates the process and requires the expenditure of needless resources by both litigants and the  Second, agencies such as the SEC have found open and transparent disciplinary proceedings to be valuable because they inform peer audit firms of the type of activity that may give rise to enforcement action by the regulator. In effect, transparent proceedings can serve as a deterrent to misconduct because of a perceived increase in the likelihood of ``getting caught.'' Accordingly, the audit industry as a whole would also benefit from timely, public, and nonsecret enforcement proceedings.  Our bill will make hearings by the PCAOB, and all related notices, orders, and motions, transparent and available to the public unless otherwise ordered by the This would more closely align the PCAOB's procedures with those of the SEC for analogous matters.

ESEA provides financial assistance to local educational agencies and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low-income families to help ensure that all children meet challenging State academic standards.  No regulation should be exempt from the review process, especially those regulations that impact low-income students across the country. It is imperative that we have smart, targeted, cost-effective regulations that actually help the people that need the help.  Imposing ineffective regulations on schools and educational agencies cost taxpayers money--this must be given the opportunity for oversight, as is given under the SCRUB Act--and overburden our already exhausted educators, and can cause more harm rather than good.  Why not take a look at these regulations and just consider whether they are working? And, if they are, then let's leave them alone. But if not, then, let's change them there.

All regulations need to be reviewed, and that is what this rule does.

1100,topic-id,2304,"Mr.President, I wanted to take a few moments today. I know we are in the middle of this debate about the health care law, about the nomination. On a topic I have been working on for a while, I was compelled to come to the floor at this late hour because it has now broken in the press. It is important to kind of give some clarity.  As my colleagues know, I have spent a significant amount of time over the last few years discussing the issues in the nation of Venezuela, which has a direct impact on my home State of Florida but ultimately on the country. It is a nation that faces some very significant challenges, primarily because its political leadership is a disaster. It is no longer truly a democracy. It is now a government run by a tyrant who has basically ignored the They have taken over the courts. The members of the judiciary in Venezuela are now basically under the complete control of their so-called President, Nicolas Maduro, and before that, They control the press. They have a national assembly that actually is controlled by the minority party or the opposition party to the government. But it is pretty shocking. My colleagues would be shocked by this. We all travel abroad often. Imagine if you lived in a country where the President denied you the ability to travel abroad. Well, that is what has happened.  One of the members of the National Assembly in the opposition, Luis Florido was trying to go to Peru to travel and was denied the ability to[[Page S1049]]leave the country. Imagine that. Imagine that one of our Democratic colleagues here in the Senate decided they wanted to take a trip next week overseas in the conduct of their office and were told that the President was not allowing them to travel abroad. That happened in Another one, Williams Davila, had his passport taken away by the President of So the country is a disaster because of their leadership. It is actually headed into a cataclysm.  In April of this year, Venezuela has to make a $6 billion payment on their debt. They will not be able to make that payment. The Government of Venezuela knows that. It is a terrible situation.  But in the midst of all of that, I have argued that the national security interests of the United States is at stake in what is happening in This is not just about the issue of democracy; it is also about the threat it potentially poses to the United That is what I come to the floor to speak about tonight.  My office has been engaged with a number of people over the last few months and year who have been coming to us with information. We have been working on some of this. Some of that has now broken into the press tonight in a CNN report that I am about to describe in a moment, but first, let me lay out the scene.  There have been about 8.5 million names added to Venezuela's immigration system since it was last independently audited in the year 2003. So 8.5 million people were added to their immigration system, the new names that have come about. Of the 8.5 million names that were added, 221,000 of those--over 221,000 of those are foreign nationals, and at least 173 of those 221,000 foreign nationals are from the following countries: Iran, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and So 173 people from these countries were provided government passports and national IDs between the year 2008 and 2012, which leads me to this: In November of 2015, a Venezuelan attache by the name of Misael Lopez Soto, who was assigned to the country's Embassy in Baghdad, became a whistleblower, and he began to reveal the identities of several of these 173 names.  Understand that this is important because there has been a 168-percent jump in U.asylum applications from Venezuela since October of 2015, now the third highest nation of origin for asylum applicants to the United The overwhelming majority of them are legitimate people fleeing all this craziness that is happening. But I lay the groundwork to understand the connection between Venezuela and the United  I now want to go into the story of Mr.Soto, who, as I said, used to work at the  Mr.Soto was assigned to work at the Embassy of Venezuela in As he began to work there, he noticed some irregularities, so he began to report what he says was a scheme to sell passports and visas for thousands of dollars out of that He was offered all kinds of money to do this, to get a cut of those thousands of dollars. He says he declined it.  CNN and CNN en Espanol have over the last year teamed up on a joint investigation, relying on much of the same information that I have had access to, looking into all of these allegations and what they uncovered. In the story that posted tonight was evidence of serious irregularities in the issuing of Venezuela passports and visas, including passports that were given to people with ties to terrorism.  According to CNN, one confidential intelligence document obtained by CNN--intelligence documents from nations in the Western Hemisphere, not from the United States--actually directly links Venezuela's now new Vice President, who is in line to potentially become the President when the current dictator is going to have to give up power here soon because of this cataclysm that they are facing--the name of that Vice President is Tareck El There are now links, according to CNN, to the current Vice President, Tareck El Aissami, and the 173 Venezuelan passports and IDs that were issued to individuals from the Middle East, including people connected to the terrorist group  It is important to understand--and the CNN article appropriately outlines this--if you have a passport from Venezuela, you are allowed to enter over 130 countries on this planet without a visa. That includes the 26 countries in the European So a Venezuelan passport is a valuable commodity for someone who is trying to travel around the world under an assumed name with a valid government document. That is why it is important.  Mr.Lopez, the whistleblower who once worked at the Embassy, is a lawyer. He used to be a police officer in He said, according to the article, that he thought that becoming a diplomat was a great career opportunity that would allow him to serve his country, so he moved to Baghdad and started his new life at the  He remembers what he calls an unwelcome surprise on his first day in July of 2013. His new boss was Venezuelan Ambassador Jonathan The Ambassador handed him a special envelope, he said.       ``He gave me an envelope full of visas and passports,''      Lopez recalled. ``He told me, `Get this, this is one million      U.dollars.' I thought it was like a joke. Then he told me      here people pay a lot of money to get a visa or a passport to      leave this country.''  Meaning  About a month later, Lopez said he realized it was no joke.  An Iraqi employee of the Embassy who was hired to be an interpreter told him that she, the interpreter, had made thousands of dollars selling Venezuelan passports and visas and that he could make a lot of money too. He says he told her it was wrong and he refused. The employee pressed the issue, telling him that there were thousands of dollars to be made, even discussing an offer to sell visas to 13 Syrians for $10,000 each.  Lopez said that he was stunned when he found the document inside the It was a list of 21 Arabic names with corresponding Venezuelan passport numbers and Venezuelan identification numbers. A Venezuelan immigration official told CNN that a crosscheck of the passport numbers indicated that the passports are valid and that those passports, given to these people with the 21 Arabic names--when he ran the crosscheck, they actually matched the names on the list Lopez found, meaning the people on the list could be able to travel using those Venezuelan passports.  But here is what is incredible: A publicly available database in Venezuela examined by CNN shows that 20 of the 21 identification numbers of the people with the Arabic names that match the passports are actually registered to people with Hispanic names, not the Arabic names listed on the passports.  So basically CNN has uncovered evidence that at least on 21 occasions, the Venezuelan Government--the Venezuelan Embassy has sold passports to someone from the Middle East but assigned them a Hispanic surname or a Hispanic name. People are traveling under assumed identities from the Middle We have a couple of those names we are going to share with you in a moment.  In April 2014, only 9 months after he started the job, he emailed a report about all this to the He said the Ambassador did nothing, and, in fact, the Ambassador, Velasco, threatened to fire him.  By 2015, he was so frustrated that no one would investigate it that he took what he found to Delcy Rodriguez, who was Venezuela's Foreign He emailed the report and said that there was fraudulent issuing of visas, birth certificates, and Venezuelan documents. He said nothing happened. With nowhere else to turn, Mr.Lopez said he contacted an FBI official at the U.Embassy in  By the end of 2015, the Venezuelan Government accused him of abandoning his post and removed him. A police official showed up at his home in Venezuela with a document that said he was under investigation for revealing confidential documents or secrets.  Now, this is not the first time this Congress hears about this. U.lawmakers heard reports about Venezuela's passport fraud during congressional hearings as far back as 2006. In fact, a congressional report warned that ``Venezuela is providing support, including identity documents that could prove useful to radical Islamic groups.''[[Page S1050]]  A State Department report at that time concluded that ``Venezuelan travel and identification documents are extremely easy to obtain by persons not entitled to them.''  Roger Noriega, the former U.Ambassador to the OAS, a former Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere, said in prepared remarks before Congress in 2012 that ``Venezuela has provided thousands of phony IDs, passports and visas to persons of Middle Eastern origin.''  In 2013, confidential intelligence reports from a group of Latin American countries obtained by CNN said that from 2008 to 2012--I already outlined this earlier--173 individuals from the Middle East were issued Venezuelan passports and Among them were people connected to the terrorist group The official who ordered the issuing of those passports, the report said, is Tareck El Aissami, who just a few months ago was appointed and is now the Vice President of Back then, he was the Minister in charge of immigration, as well as a He personally took charge of issuing granting visas and nationalizing citizens from different countries, especially Syrians, Lebanese, Jordanians, Iranians, and Iraqis, the report said.  So what we have now is an unbelievable situation in which a country in this hemisphere, according to both the whistleblower, independent reports, and now CNN's own investigation--Venezuela--has been providing passports to people from the Middle East under false pretenses, basically fraudulent documents that allow them to travel all over the world.  Among them, Hakim Mohamed Ali Diab Fattah, a Palestinian and suspected Hezbollah member, was given national ID 16.105.824, issued on July 12, 2012. He was deported from the United States in 2002 for his possible connection to the 9/11 hijackers via aviation school in the United He was detained and arrested by Jordanian authorities on May 3, 2015, for suspicion of financing terror. This individual has that national ID number from Venezuela and a passport that was allowing him to travel.  Here is another one: Ahmad Adnan Ali, an Iraqi, another suspected Hezbollah member. He is a convicted trafficker facing charges in France and Denmark, and he has documents under two aliases: Ahmed El Timmy Villalobos, with the number 29.645.898. That is the number on the ID that was issued on January 16, 2014. He has another alias and another document: Ahmad El Timmy His name is neither Villalobos nor Gomez, but he has these documents.  By the way, all of this, according to CNN, is no surprise to General Marco Ferreira, who was in charge of the immigration office in Venezuela in 2002. He now lives in He was granted political asylum. ``He told CNN that he personally witnessed corrupt senior officials ordering passports for people who were not citizens when he was running the department.'' He said it was ``very easy'' to assume someone else's identity. It was ``very, very easy to go and be a Venezuelan or pretend being born in Venezuela.''  I bring this up in the midst of all these other things because we now understand that what we are facing in Venezuela is not just a corrupt government and a tyranny but a nation that is under the corrupt leadership of its now Vice President and, of course, its President, a nation that is trafficking in selling passports and travel documents to individuals with links to terrorism. That poses a direct threat to the national security of the United I hope in the days to come, with this new information and with this report, that we can work with the Justice Department and the State Department to take appropriate measures to protect our Nation and the world from what is occurring at the hands of the Venezuelan Government under the tyrant Maduro and under its Vice President, who personally ran the department that was undertaking these corrupt activities.

If Mr.Trump had said: I want to prevent the American people from getting low-cost prescription drugs from Canada, and I want to continue to prohibit Medicare from negotiating for lower drug prices, Congressman Price would have been a great choice, but that is not what Donald Trump said during his campaign.  This is what President Trump said. During the campaign on May 7, 2015, Mr.Trump tweeted:       I was the first and only GOP candidate to state there will      be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and  On August 10, 2015, Mr.Trump said:       [I will] save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security      without cuts.  Without cuts.       [We] have to do it. . . . People have been paying in for      years, and now many of these candidates want to cut it.  On November 3, 2015, Mr.Trump said:       I'll save Social I'll save . . . People      love . . . I am not going to cut it.  On May 21, 2015, Mr.Trump tweeted:       I am going to save Social Security without any cuts. I know      where to get the money from. Nobody else does.  On January 24, 2015, Mr.Trump said:       I'm not a cutter. I'll probably be the only Republican that      doesn't want to cut Social  Mr.Trump did not make these statements in the middle of the night. It wasn't an ambush interview with some reporter who caught him off-guard. This was one of the centerpieces of his campaign for And I think whether you are a Republican or a Democrat or Independent or whatever you are, you will acknowledge that Mr.Trump said: I am not a conventional I am going to do it differently. Everybody else, all the Republicans, they want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and And he is absolutely right. They do. But he made a promise to the American people that he would be different, that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and  President Trump sends out tweets every single day, but the American people are waiting, are still waiting for that one tweet which says: I will keep my promise. I will not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and if Republicans give me legislation to do that, I will veto that legislation.  In fact, the President could save us all a whole lot of time if he would get on the phone now with the Republicans in the House and some here in the Senate and say: Hey, save your efforts. Don't waste your time because if you bring me legislation that will cut Social Security, cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, I am going to veto it.  If President Trump sent that tweet, it would save us all a whole lot of time but, more importantly, it would tell millions of seniors who today cannot make it on $13, $14, $15,000 a year in Social Security that he will not make their lives more difficult. He will tell seniors who are struggling with difficult, painful, costly illnesses that he is not going to devastate  He will tell low-income people who are trying to survive on minimum incomes that he will not take away the health insurance they have through Medicaid, and he will tell middle-class families and working-class families that, no, they do not have to worry that their parents can remain in nursing homes and have those bills paid by  What I think the American people are worried about is not just that Mr.Trump has not yet sent out that tweet. We did get a tweet about Arnold Schwarzenegger and how well he is doing on his TV show--we got several tweets about that--but we did not get the tweet that tells seniors and working people they do not have to worry about their future; that this President was not lying but was telling the truth when he said he will not cut Social Security, Medicare, and  The problem is, President Trump has nominated people like Congressman Price whose views are absolutely contradictory to what he campaigned on. So why would you appoint somebody whose views run exactly opposite to what you told the American people during your campaign?  The truth is, in the House of Representatives, Congressman Price has led the effort to end Medicare as we know it by giving seniors inadequate vouchers to purchase private health insurance.  In 2009, Congressman Price said, and I quote--and I hope people listen to this quote and try to ask yourselves: How could somebody who ran on a campaign of not cutting Medicare appoint this gentleman to be Secretary of Health and Human Services? This is what Congressman Price said:       Nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery      of health care than the Federal Government's intrusion into      medicine through . . . We will not rest until we      make certain that government-run health care is ended.  Now, how does that tally with Candidate Donald Trump saying: I will not cut Medicare and  We don't need an HHS Secretary who will end Medicare as we know it. We need an HHS Secretary who will protect and expand The idea of this voucher program, of ending Medicare as we know it, as a defined benefit plan and converting it into a voucher plan, not only contradicts what Candidate Donald Trump said, but it will be a disaster for millions of seniors.  Right now, if you are a senior and you are diagnosed with a serious and costly illness, you have the comfort of knowing that Medicare will be there throughout your illness. It will pay your bills.  The Republican plan, led by Congressman Paul Ryan, has a very different approach, and what that plan is about is a voucher plan which says that we will end Medicare as we know it. We will give seniors a voucher of an undetermined amount--the last number I heard was $8,000; it may go up, it may be lower--and give that check to a senior who then goes out into the private insurance market looking for the best policy that he or she can get.  I would like the American people to think for a moment what kind of policy an 80-year-old person who is struggling with cancer and who has a check for $8,000 can get. The answer is, when you go into a private insurance company.  Also, if the Republicans are successful in doing away with the Affordable Care Act and the patient protections within the Affordable Care Act, including a ban on the insurance companies' ability not to insure you if you have a preexisting condition--now let's assume they got rid of that.  Now you are 80 years old. You walk into an insurance company, and you say: I have been diagnosed with cancer, and here is my check for $8,000.  The insurance agent looks at you and says: Are you kidding? Don't be absurd. Why would we cover you? What do you think we are going to give you for $8,000 when you are about to run up some enormous health care costs related to cancer? You are going to be in the hospital. You are going to undergo all kinds of treatment. You are going to need expensive drugs, and you expect us to take you with an $8,000[[Page S1042]]check. How are we going to make any money out of you? Because that is what our job is. We are an insurance company. We don't care about health care. We care about making money. That is our function. We don't make money on $8,000 for taking care of somebody who is 80 years of age who has cancer. Furthermore, because the Republicans got rid of the law protecting people with preexisting conditions, we don't even have to take you. Or maybe we will take you, but you are going to have to add another $10,000 on top of that $8,000 because that is the only way we make money.  Oh, by the way, also, so there is no confusion, they want to raise the retirement age to make sure you keep working until 67 years of age.  So not only is that a disaster, but maybe in a deeper sense, if we take democracy seriously, if we think candidates should run for office based on what they really believe, all of that stuff is a direct contradiction to what Candidate Donald Trump talked about.  I have heard many Republicans say: Look, what he was talking about was really absurd. It was ridiculous. Of course we are not going to do that.  Well, then, that takes us to a whole other discussion: What does it mean if you have a candidate who runs for office who simply lies to the American people and really doesn't mean anything he says?  I have no problems getting up and debating or disagreeing with my colleagues who have a very conservative point of view. That is their point of view. This is a democracy, and we have different perspectives. And many of those candidates ran on positions. They were honest enough to say: Hey, if you elect me, I think we have to cut Social Security, and they gave their reasons. I think we have to cut Medicare; they gave their reasons. I think we have to cut Medicaid; they gave their reasons. I think we have to give huge tax breaks to billionaire; they gave their reasons.  Well, for some reason or another, the people in their State elected them. That is fine. It is called democracy.  But that is not what Donald Trump did as a candidate. So I rise in opposition to Congressman Price becoming Secretary of HHS because his appointment would go in diametrical opposition to what Candidate Donald Trump told the American people. I think that is a bad thing for democracy. If you run for office, keep your word, you know? Do what you told the American people you would do. The profound disgust so many millions of people feel for the American political process is not just of what we believe, it is that we don't keep our word, the promises we make to them, and this is exactly where Donald Trump is today.  Let me touch on another area where I think President Trump has not been clear with the American people, and that is, we pay today by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans between 18 and 65 cannot afford to fill the prescriptions that their doctors write for them. The numbers go down after 65 because of Medicare Part But can you imagine living in a nation where one out of five people cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write?  Mr.Trump campaigned on taking on the pharmaceutical industry. Well, the record of Congressman Price is very different from the rhetoric that Candidate Donald Trump used during his campaign.  So I eagerly await Mr.Trump's statement--he can do it through a tweet; that would be fine with me--that says he will support concrete legislation that some of us are going to be offering very shortly which does two fundamental things that will substantially lower prescription drug costs in America today.  1, at a time when you can buy many medicines for far less cost in Canada or in many other countries around the world, at a time when we have free trade agreements so that the lettuce and tomatoes you are having dinner can come from Mexico or Latin America or anyplace all over the world, the fish you eat can come from anyplace all over the world, we will introduce legislation that says that individuals, pharmacists, and prescription drug distributors will be able to purchase lower cost medicine in Canada and eventually in other countries around the world.  Mr.Trump--President Trump had talked during his campaign about taking on the pharmaceutical industry. I hope very much that he will at least keep his word on that issue and that he will join us in supporting legislation to allow for the reimportation of brand-name prescription drugs from Canada and many other countries around the world. If he is prepared to do that, we will pass it. We will pass it because there are a number of Republicans who support it, and the vast majority of Democrats support it. We have the votes to pass it, and if President Trump signs that bill, we will go a long way in ending the burden that so many elderly people and working people and people with chronic illnesses are facing today, and that is the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs.  By the way, this huge increase in prescription drug costs takes place at a time when, in 2015, the five largest pharmaceutical companies in this country made $50 billion in profit--$50 billion in profit in 2015--yet one out of five Americans under 65 cannot afford the medicine they need. The top 10 CEOs or executives in the pharmaceutical industry that year made over $300 million in salary.  Passing reimportation is one mechanism to lower the cost of prescription drugs, but it is not the only one. We have a totally insane prescription drug pricing system in America right now. If you are Kaiser Permanente, you will pay a certain amount for a drug. And by the way, of course, we don't know what that amount is that you are paying; that is secret. If you are Medicare, you will pay a different amount. If you are the Veterans' Administration, you will pay a different amount than And if you are Medicaid, you will pay a different amount than Medicare or the Veterans' We have a situation today where by law the Veterans' Administration is able to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry. Today we have a situation where Medicaid, by law, is guaranteed a significant rebate over list price. But in terms of Medicare, which spends over $4 billion a year for prescription drugs, a number of years ago Republicans insisted that Medicare would not be able to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry.  President Trump has indicated in vague language that perhaps he would support the ability of Medicare to negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry. Given all of the tweets he has sent out on so many subjects, I would hope that he has the time to send out a very simple tweet which says: If Congress passes legislation allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry, I will sign that bill. That tweet will have a profound impact on taxpayers because we can save very substantial sums of money, and it will also result in lowering the cost of prescription drugs.  Unfortunately, once again Congressman Price is coming from a different place than Candidate Trump came from--again, that contradiction of a President appointing somebody whose views are diametrically opposed to the views he raised during the campaign.  I think the American people are growing increasingly concerned about the contradictions in general, not just on health care, of what Candidate Trump said and what President Trump is doing. During the course of his campaign, not only did Candidate Trump say he would not cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid, he also said that he thought Wall Street was causing all kinds of problems and that you can't clean up the swamp by bringing people in who are a part of the swamp, in so many words. You can't bring people in to clean up the problem who have caused the problem in the first place. And you know what, he is exactly right. He is exactly right. You can't bring in people whose greed and recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street caused us the worst economic downturn in modern history of this country. You can't bring those people in and then say: We are going to solve the problem that Wall Street caused.  But in an exactly similar way to what he has done with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, he is bringing in top Wall Street executives. His main financial adviser comes from Goldman Sachs, one of the largest financial institutions in this country, a[[Page S1043]]financial institution that required a multibillion-dollar bailout from the taxpayers, an institution whose illegal behavior caused them to have to pay a $5 billion fine to the Federal Those are the people he is bringing in to regulate, to take on Wall He is bringing Wall Street executives who caused the worst financial crisis in modern history of this country to take on Wall Well, I don't think most Americans believe that.  So, Mr.President, let me close by saying that I hope that tonight the Senate stands up for the American people, demands that President Trump keep the campaign promises he made, and that we reject the nomination of Congressman Price to be the next Secretary of Health and Human  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1049,topic-id,331,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups or the HALOS  I was proud to have introduced this bill with Representative Chabot during the 113th Congress and have been pleased to see this commonsense legislation continue to gain bipartisan support. I want to thank Representatives Chabot and Sinema for continuing to advocate for this important legislation.  Small businesses and startup companies are tremendous assets and sources of economic growth for our country. Economists have shown that when the economy is healthy, startups and young, fast-growing firms are the fundamental drivers of job creation. But to succeed, innovative entrepreneurs with ideas need access to capital. These investments give new companies the resources to take their idea from concept to startup to success.  Congress should support this process and pass legislation that makes it easier for accredited investors to find creative, aspiring entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, certain legislation has had the unintended consequence of often making it more difficult for entrepreneurs and inventors to meet investors and access critical investment capital.  The JOBS Act of 2012 has placed additional restrictions on individuals who want to invest in startups. This has adversely affected programs where young companies demonstrate their products and meet potential investors and mentors, and the legislation has curtailed startups' access to individual or angel investors and angel groups.  During my more than two decades of business experience, I saw firsthand how angel investors often provide more than just funding for young companies. They offer wisdom, advice, and guidance as small businesses seek to grow. The HALOS Act would reopen the path for innovative individuals and young companies to more easily connect with angel investors, while still maintaining important investor protections.  This bill will help small businesses better access the resources they need to thrive and ultimately create jobs, ensuring the United States remains the best place in the world to start and grow a new business.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH259-2.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,10.0,January
876,topic-id,1161,"Mr.President, last week, I expressed my sincere hope that the majority leader and I could come to some agreement on the process of nominations. He has negotiated in good faith, and we have made some progress. I sincerely appreciate his willingness to work with us so far. I do want to clarify why Democrats are doing this.  Yesterday, my friend the majority leader went on television and suggested that we were raising concerns about the nominations out of pique or anger. He chalked up these ``little procedural complaints'' to ``sour grapes,'' and he suggested that Democrats ``grow up.''  We are not doing this for sport. Democrats feel very strongly that pushing for a thorough and thoughtful vetting process is the right thing to do. Here is why. The Democratic minority was and is concerned about the hearing schedule, which is so jammed right now that several high-importance hearings will fall on the same day, depriving Senators and the American people a chance to properly participate in the vetting process of these nominees.  Our caucus was and is concerned about the timely completion of the standard paperwork and ethics clearance for nominees before proceeding full steam ahead with confirmation hearings and votes. Bear in mind, President-Elect Trump's nominees pose particularly difficult ethics and conflict-of-interest challenges. Many of them come from enormous wealth. Many have vast holdings in stocks, and very few have experience in government so they have not been appropriately vetted for something like a Cabinet post before.  What had been standard practice for the vast majority of nominees--the completion of a preliminary ethics review before their nomination--was skipped over for the vast majority of President-Elect Trump's nominees. In fact, the independent Office of Government Ethics went so far as to send a letter warning that ``their [the Republicans] schedule has created undue pressure on OGE's staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews.''  The OGE office is nonpartisan. It has never been political so this has nothing to do with politics. ``I am not aware,'' wrote the Director, Walter Schaub, ``of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process.''  The very same majority leader, my friend Senator McConnell, who suggested that Democrats were raising concerns out of pique or resentment, in fact, raised the same concerns in 2009 when he was minority leader. In fact, then-Minority Leader McConnell sent then-Majority Leader Reid a letter laying out his prerequisites for time agreements on the floor for President Obama's nominees. They are almost exactly what Democrats requested.  I don't bring this up to play gotcha. I am doing it to show that our requests are eminently reasonable and, in fact,[[Page S126]]have been shared by leaders of both parties. I am going to read the letter because it is amazing how it mirrors our requests. It was sent to Harry Reid from Mitch McConnell in 2009, just as President Obama became       Dear Harry:       The Senate has the Constitutional duty to provide its      Advice and Consent on Presidential nominations, a duty which      we take seriously. In consultation with our Ranking Members,      we reaffirm our commitment to conduct the appropriate review      of these nominations, consistent with the long standing and      best practices of committees, regardless of which political      party is in the majority. These best practices serve the      Senate well, and we will insist on their fair and consistent      application.       Therefore, prior to considering any time agreements on the      floor on any nominee, we expect the following standards will      be met:       1. The FBI background check is complete and submitted to      the committee in time for review and prior to a hearing being      noticed.       2. The Office of Government Ethics letter is complete and      submitted in time for review and prior to a committee      hearing.       3.

All committee questionnaires are complete and have been      returned to the committee. A reasonable opportunity for      follow-up questions has been afforded committee members, and      nominees have answered, with sufficient time for review prior      to a committee vote.       5. The nominee is willing to have committee staff      interviews, where that has been the practice.       6. The nominee has had a hearing.       7. The nominee agrees to courtesy visits with members when      requested.       8. The nominee has committed to cooperate with the Ranking      Member on requests for information and transparency.

877,topic-id,494,"Mr.President, I plan to return the exact same letter to my friend, the majority leader, with the same requests. In 2009, the then-minority leader called these benchmarks ``common sense standards'' and ``long standing practices.''  I agree with him. These standards do not indicate a lack of maturity. They show an abundance of common sense, just as his letter said. I remind the majority that several, if not most, of the nominees have actually failed to meet the qualifications laid out by this letter given the hearing schedule.  The majority leader is fond of mentioning that many Obama nominees passed quickly in 2009 and he asks that we do the same, but there is a big difference between 2009 and today. President Obama's nominees met all the standards laid out in then-Minority Leader McConnell's letter. President-Elect Trump's nominees have not.  In 2009, every Obama Cabinet nominee had an ethics agreement in before their hearing. Every Obama Cabinet nominee underwent a full FBI background check before the Senate considered their nomination. President-Elect Trump's nominees are way behind that mark.  I only ask, respectfully, that the Republican majority follow the same set of standards they had in 2009 when the shoe was on the other foot, especially because these nominees raise particular concerns. The standards we have laid out as leaders of both parties address conflict of interest and security concerns.  Of course, those are prime concerns, but there is another concern as well. These nominees have, even collectively, very little experience or record in government. Many of them have taken positions quite different from the President-elect. They need to be thoroughly vetted, not just before the U.Senate but before the American people. If, for instance, Representative Price is for the privatization of Social Security, but President-Elect Trump said he is not, what position is nominee Price going to take? Jamming all these hearings into 1 or 2 days, making members run from committee to committee makes no sense. After all, these nominees are going to hold incredibly powerful positions for potentially the next 4 years. To spend an extra day or two on each nominee, even if it takes a few weeks to get through them all in order to carefully consider their nominations, is well worth it. It is only fair that they are given a thorough and thoughtful vetting and they abide by the ``long standing'' ethics practices that were established--and laid out quite clearly by the majority leader himself--to ensure Cabinet officials were in good standing to work on behalf of the American people.

1017,topic-id,499,"Mr.President, first, on the Republican healthcare bill, my good friend the Republican leader says that there should be amendments on the floor. On such an important matter, it would be astounding if we didn't have committee hearings and committee votes on such a bill. I know there is an attempt to rush it through, but if it is such a fine product, it ought to withstand the scrutiny of hearings and of markups in the various committees. To rush it through is an indication that the sponsors of the bill, the supporters of the bill, are not very proud of it, and that is a theme that has continued with the executive branch and the Speaker of the  As we know, CBO estimated that it would cause 24 million fewer Americans to have health insurance--I don't hear the Republican leader mention that, of course--while raising premiums in the short term and jacking up the price of healthcare for older  We have heard from the other side of the aisle that access is what is important. No, it isn't. Access doesn't get you healthcare. I have access to walk into a Lamborghini dealer and look at a Lamborghini, but I can't afford one. That is true of average Americans, and that is true of healthcare as well. Access doesn't get you healthcare, and it is a far cry from what people need.  Because the bill helps so many fewer Americans, because the bill seems to be a tax break for the wealthy above all, it is having its trouble, and nobody seems to really want to embrace it. That is why Republicans on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue don't want their name near any end of the bill.  As I said yesterday, Speaker Ryan doesn't want to call it RyanCare, even though he wrote the bill. President Trump doesn't want to call it If it is so good, why doesn't any Republican want to put their name on it? It is Abbott and Costello: You put your name on it; no, you put your name on it. That is not an indication that people are proud of this legislation, and it is particularly ironic with President President Trump slaps his name on buildings, ties, steaks, hotels, and golf clubs, but not on a bill that he supports in his daily tweets. He has spent 30 years of his business career trying to put his name on nearly everything, but not this healthcare bill, even though he is inviting wary Republicans to the White House to try and sell them on it.  Today his Vice President is here on the Hill lobbying recalcitrant He has dispatched HHS Secretary Price, the person he picked, to lobby for the bill. His own Press Secretary says the White House is in full sale mode. Make no mistake about it, this is the President's bill, and he should be straight with the American people about it.

1085,topic-id,771,"And I meant what I said: He doesn't need any help. He does it so well on his own. So I will regard this not as a quid pro quo--although he can get what he wants--but as an act of kindness and generosity.  Mr.President, I rise this evening to oppose the confirmation of Representative Tom Price to be Secretary of HHS and urge my colleagues to vote no on his nomination.  Representative Price might be the quintessence of President Trump's Cabinet: a creature of Washington, deeply conflicted, and far out of the mainstream when it comes to his views on health care.  Like other nominees, philosophically he seems completely opposed to the very purpose of his Department: the good governance of the health programs that cover tens of millions of  Candidate Trump promised he would not cut Medicare or Medicaid, but Congressman Price has spent his entire career trying to cut Medicare and Medicaid and dismantle the Affordable Care Just listen to these quotes:  The nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services has said, ``Nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.'' That one might have come out of the 1890s, if we had had Medicare then.  He said he expects lawmakers to push forward with an overhaul of Medicare, ``within the first six to eight months'' of this new administration. Does that sound like someone who doesn't want to cut Medicare and Medicaid? It doesn't to me. It doesn't to the American people. In fact, if you could pick someone who in either House of Congress was most likely to cut Medicare and Medicaid, you would pick Congressman It could not be more of a contradiction to what Candidate Trump promised in the campaign.  So here is what worries me: From what I know of the President, he will cede great authority to Cabinet officials, content to jump from one topic to the next, one tweet to the next. I would put much greater stock in Representative Price's record than anything the President promised during the campaign, and that is very bad news for seniors and the American people generally.  For that reason, every American who receives benefits from those programs--the millions of American seniors, women, families, and people with disabilities--should be gravely concerned about what the tenure of a Secretary Tom Price will mean for their health.  Make no mistake, in the dark hours of the early morning, with the confirmation of Secretary Price, the Republicans launch the first assault in their war on seniors. The war on seniors begins when we select Representative Price over our votes as Secretary of Health and Human  When it comes to the health care of older Americans, confirming Representative Price to be Secretary of HHS is akin to asking the fox to guard the henhouse. It has been revealed that in his time in the House, Representative Price engaged in a number of questionable practices related to the trading of stocks in issues that his legislation impacted. There are many instances.  There were reports late last year that Congressman Price had traded stocks in dozens of health care companies valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars during a time when he introduced, sponsored, or cosponsored several pieces of legislation that potentially impacted those companies. In one instance, Congressman Price bought shares in a medical device manufacturing company just days before introducing legislation in the House that would directly benefit that company.  These were far from isolated incidents. Just yesterday, USA Today reported that Congressman Price ``bought and sold health care company stocks often enough as a member of Congress to warrant probes by both federal securities regulators and the House ethics committee.''  These allegations alone might be enough to sink a nominee in another administration, but it seems this Cabinet is so rife with ethics challenges and conflicts of interest that Representative Price's conduct in the House doesn't place him too far outside this unethical norm. But that should be no excuse. When you are a Congressman or a Senator, you must endeavor to avoid even the hint of a conflict of interest, let alone a situation where you are actively trading stocks that may be impacted.  So this is a sad evening. The war on seniors by the Trump administration begins when we confirm Representative People will look back and say that the public war on seniors began at 2 a.m. Friday morning when the Senate, unfortunately, confirmed Representative  I urge my colleagues to vote no.

This permits startups to connect with business experts, potential future investors, and other entrepreneurs, all while maintaining existing accredited investor verification requirements and exemptions under Regulation D for the actual purchase or sale of securities.

889,topic-id,932,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank my colleague and friend from Georgia for yielding time to me.  Mr.Speaker, with this package of bills, the majority is taking a sledgehammer to civil litigation. I know that my colleague and I are not going to agree with that because I listened intently to what he had to say. But it is closing courthouse doors to ordinary people who are injured in the workplace and makes it harder for working people wronged by the rich and powerful to seek justice.  First, H.985 is really a solution in search of a problem. It uses the false notion of rampant fraud in the legal system to shield corporate wrongdoers and deny their victims relief.  Second, H.906 has the potential to further victimize asbestos victims.  Third, H.720 would roll back significant improvements to the Rules of Civil Procedure and repeat a failed experiment that led to a decade of problems in the courts. By requiring mandatory sanctions that tie judges' hands, we saw an avalanche of unnecessary litigation.  The majority is wasting time and taxpayer money to make changes that evidence and the experts tell us are not necessary and could actually cause more harm than good. It doesn't make sense.  But consider, Mr.Speaker, how the majority conducted itself on health care for a decade now. Almost immediately after President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, 13 Republican State attorneys general filed a Federal lawsuit opposing health reform. That was back in 2010. Since that time, the majority has voted over and over again--more than 60 times--to undermine the  CBS News has highlighted that it costs the taxpayers an estimated $24 million a week to run the House of Think how many millions of dollars of legislative time the majority wasted on these votes that never had any chance of becoming law under the previous They wasted taxpayers' dollars and they wasted precious time. The majority spoke again and again about repeal and replace, and all the while, they didn't have a thing in the world to replace the health care with.  Former Speaker John Boehner recently made that clear, and it wasn't until this week that the majority finally let Members of Congress and the American people see their latest effort--and it would be a catastrophe for families across the country. More and more groups and individuals are lining up against it.  People would be forced to pay more for worse coverage if they could afford any coverage at all. The bill would also defund Planned Parenthood, which more than 2.5 million people, men and women, rely on for lifesaving preventive care, like cancer screenings and STI testing, every single year.  It is truly astonishing that the majority is trying to rush through this bill without a Congressional Budget Office estimate about how much it would cost or what impact it would have on the insurance market.  Let me quote from a Washington Post story this morning written by the great Karen Tumulty:       While it is not uncommon for panels to consider legislation      without the Congressional Budget Office first weighing in,      veterans of the process say that doing so on bills as far-     reaching as the healthcare overhaul is rare and ill-advised.  We don't have any idea how many people would gain or lose coverage without the CBO estimate, but we do know that this bill would take us back to the days before the Affordable Care Act when American people were on their own to try and get health care without any real safeguards in place at all; when families were liable to go bankrupt from heavy healthcare costs in a year's time, and the ACA protects them from that by saying that once an insured person has spent $4,500 a year on health care, the insurance company will pay the rest, and for a family, $12,500 to insure them. That is something so rarely talked about that is in this bill that I think is of vast importance, and we would lose that.  Billionaires would get a tax break, but working families probably couldn't afford health care.  We are rushing through this healthcare bill without a proper understanding of its cost or its impacts. The majority completely skipped the hearing process and, therefore, hasn't heard from experts or doctors or people battling an illness--except, I guess, what is going on torturing people over in the Energy and Commerce Committee where they have been there since, what, over 24 hours now.  So we were encouraged yesterday when we learned at the Rules Committee that White House Secretary[[Page H1965]]Sean Spicer had said at a briefing yesterday:       Every Member of the House and the Senate will be able to      have their opportunity to have amendments offered through the      committee process and on the floor.  It looks like we are not going to have that opportunity. And I do not have enthusiasm for the notion that we will have an open rule since, under this Speaker we have not had any, and the Democrats long to be able to offer some amendments to this bill. I certainly hope that that might be the case.  Now, the only way that happens is through the open rule. As I said, we haven't seen one of those in Speaker Ryan's leadership. I hope the majority follows through with the White House's promise of an open rule because, more than anything on this, the American people deserve an open and transparent process as this bill moves forward.

890,topic-id,330,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would require a CBO cost estimate to be made publicly available for any legislation that amends or repeals the Affordable Care Act which may be considered in the Energy and Commerce or Ways and Means Committees or on the House floor.  The Committees on Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce are marking up repeal legislation today. Legislation this significant should not advance through the committee process, let alone the House, without first hearing from our nonpartisan budget experts at CBO on what the cost and overall impact would be.  Mr.Speaker, one of the most enduring symbols of fairness is Lady Justice, who is depicted holding the Scales of Justice that represent fairness in our courts. That central idea is embodied in the fact that justice in the United States of America is supposed to be delivered fairly, without any bias toward wealth or privilege.  It is no secret that sometimes we do struggle to live up to that ideal. We have seen evidence of that far too often recently.

That is why we have spent so much time and will continue to talk about the issues. This is not personal with the individual, this is about everyone in our country and how they are impacted by the ideas and the policies of this individual as well as the person who has nominated him.  This particular individual has a very clear record as to what he believes should happen as it relates to Medicare and Medicaid, and our entire health care system. More than 100 million people rely on programs like Medicare--seniors, people with disabilities on With Medicaid, the majority of money spent through the Medicaid health care system goes to seniors in nursing homes. That is where the majority of dollars go, long-term care for seniors. So Congressman Price's ideas, his proposals, the things he has pushed in the House matter because they show us what he believes should happen to Medicaid and to  We need to make sure the next Health and Human Services Secretary will fight for the health care of families in Michigan--at least I need to be sure. That is where my vote goes, based on what is best for families in That is what is best for our communities, rural communities, where the hospital, like where I grew up in Clare, was the largest employer in the community, greatly affected and impacted by what happens to Medicare and Medicaid funding. If the hospital is not there, chances are the doctors aren't there either or the nurses. Our larger communities are where, obviously, our hospitals are critically important as well.  So when we look at communities and hospitals and doctors, families, children, seniors, and the broad economy--and, by the way, one-sixth of the whole economy in our country is connected to health care. So who is in charge as Secretary of Health and Human Services is a big deal. That is why we have focused so much on this individual, his policies, his ideas, and his own background as well.  As we have gone through the confirmation process, it is clear to me that Congressman Price's policies do not--do not--have the best interests of the people I represent in Michigan at heart, which is why I will be voting no on his confirmation.  I have heard from thousands of people around I have heard from people who like our hospitals and live in the community, and businesspeople and nurses and doctors with great concerns. I have also heard from people around the country and have helped to lead a forum for people to come and speak, people who were not invited into the actual hearing for the confirmation hearing. I thought it was important, as did my Democratic colleagues, to have a forum where people could speak about the ideas, the bills, the policies that Congressman Price has passed in the House of  So we heard a lot of stories and, overwhelmingly, people were opposed to this nominee.  One of the people who shared her story was from I was very appreciative that she came in from Ann was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when she was 4 years old. It resulted in functional quadriplegia. She has limited use of her right arm and no use of her left arm. She was fortunate to have strong employee benefits and to be covered until she went on Medicare at 65. By the way, this nominee thinks the age should go up--66 or 67, I am not sure how far. But Ann made it to 65 and, like so many people I know, was holding her breath to get there so she could have comprehensive quality health care that she paid into her whole life called  Over the course of the last few decades, the price of her prescription drugs have skyrocketed and would cost her tens of thousands of dollars a year without Medicare and For her, the decision about our Health and Human Services Secretary makes an enormous impact on her life.  She told us: Without Medicare and Medicaid, things would have been very different for my family. I don't know how I could have cared for my mom on top of managing my own care. My family would have lost our home, all of our savings, trying to keep up with the bills. So many families are squeezed like ours, having to afford care for their aging parents and their own care, or childcare at the same time. But with support, we don't have to suffer to just be alive.  If these programs are cut, if we see the kinds of proposals on Medicare and Medicaid that Congressman Price has put forward in the House, in the Budget Committee, people will face more catastrophes than ever before.  Our new President campaigned on a promise not to cut Medicare and He said himself: ``I am not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I am not going to cut Medicare and Medicaid.'' But it doesn't square with the person he has nominated for this critical position, who will be making administrative decisions as well as leading his efforts on health care. So actions speak louder than words, at least that is what we say in  Just this fall, Congressman Price said he expects Medicare to be overhauled--overhauled within the first 6 to 8 months of Trump's administration. He also believes the age of eligibility needs to increase--his words--and that ``the better solution is premium support.'' What does that mean? That is another word for voucher. Some people say privatization. But basically instead of having an insurance card and a health care system where you can go to the doctor and know that you are covered with insurance, you get some kind of a voucher or an amount of money, and then you would be able to go find your own insurance, I guess, or figure out a way to pay for your insurance.  Before Medicare, seniors were trying to figure that out and couldn't find affordable insurance in the private market, which is why, in 1965, Medicare was created. There is no way in the world I will support going backward to that kind of approach.  As chair of the Budget Committee, Congressman Price proposed a budget that would have cut Medicare by nearly $500 million, not counting what he wants to do with Medicaid, the majority of which goes to fund senior citizens in nursing homes.  We need to have a Secretary who supports making it easier and more affordable for people to get care, not less.  Let's talk about health care for a moment in the broader sense. We know more and more people--some 30 million people--would be affected, their health insurance ripped away, if the repeal is passed that has begun--the process has begun by Republicans in the House and in the The Affordable Care Act has provided health care and the opportunity for people to get care for children to be able to see a doctor. There are parts of the country where we need more competition, where prices are too high. I want very much to work on that. I am committed to working to make that system better, and we can do that without ripping the entire system apart.  There is also another part of the Affordable Care Act that affects every single person with insurance--things that I know have made a tremendous difference to anybody with employer-based insurance; first of all, being allowed to have your child on your insurance until age 26; secondly, knowing that if you get sick, you can't get dropped by your insurance company, and if you have a chronic disease, something has happened to your health, you can't be blocked from getting insurance; and we also know things like making sure you can get all the cancer treatments your doctor says you need, not just those up to the cap that the insurance company will pay for. I had pediatric cancer physicians tell me they have been able to save children's lives who have cancer because there was no longer a cap on the amount of care.  Mental health and substance abuse services, where if they were covered at all before the Affordable Care Act, it always cost more money: higher copays, higher premiums. Now you can't do that. You have to have the same kinds of copays and the same kinds of premiums.  So many patient protections have basically said to insurance companies: You don't get, just based on profits, to decide what is going to happen; that when you buy insurance, you actually[[Page S1024]]get health care. And that is something true for everyone today.  So we have a Secretary nominee who supports doing away with all that, changing all that, who is not someone who is interested in having a basic set of services identified in health care, like maternity care. I talked with him, questioned him in the Finance This is an area I had championed when we passed the Affordable Care Act to make sure that basic services for women were viewed as basic services in health care, and it starts with prenatal care and maternity care. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, it was very hard to find private insurance that covered maternity care, unless you wanted to pay for--some 70 percent of the plans out in the private market require women to pay more. So I asked Congressman Price, did he believe maternity care was a basic service and should be covered under basic insurance. He said: Well, women can purchase that if they need it, which is exactly what happened before--which is, no, it is not basic care, but you can purchase it on top of your regular premium, if you need maternity care.  So right now the law says you can't discriminate and charge women more than men, and in fact being a woman is no longer a preexisting condition.  But the person whom the President has nominated for Health and Human Services would take us back there, and he would take us back there on a whole range of areas that create access for people to be able to have the care they need.  Here is an example from a doctor in west Michigan who wrote me regarding just basic medical care for someone in need. He said:       In December, a young man arrived in our emergency room with      a badly mangled hand from a machining accident. He knew the      hand was seriously injured and was willing to allow his      coworker to bring him into the hospital so that it could be      stitched up. When our physician studied the wound, they knew      he needed surgery to repair the bone and blood vessel damage.      The patient refused, thinking the only thing he could      possibly afford was stitches.  They then connected this man with a financial services specialist who took a few minutes to find out that he was eligible for Medicaid, working; now, because of the expansion, able to receive health care under He was then able to get the surgery he needed.  Beaumont physicians said that if the surgery hadn't happened, the man could have had an open wound for an indefinite amount of time, been prone to infection, and possibly lost his hand entirely, making him unable to ever work at his job or maybe any job again.  Expanding Medicaid health care to working people is a good idea, and millions of people have been impacted and have been able to get the care they need for themselves and for their children.  Access to health care saved this man's arm and possibly his life, and that is really what is at stake here, both with this nominee and the larger debate on where we are going to go in our great country on the whole issue of health care.  We all know that the advice of the Secretary of Health and Human Services will be a strong influence on the President's decision to promote, to sign, to veto legislation. We know he has the ability administratively to do a number of things--to cut off care, to cut off access to women's health care, to change the system that we have now, to destabilize it so that the Affordable Care Act will not work. I am extremely concerned that because of Congressman Price's record and his actual proposals and decisions and votes, he will be willing to actually do that. Whether it is cutting Medicare or Medicaid or removing some of the critical policies that keep people healthy and care affordable, I am deeply concerned about the decisions this nominee will make and the recommendations he will make to the President of the United  Again, we don't have to speculate about this. He has put these plans on paper. He has supported them. He has passed them. It is very clear. We don't have to guess where he wants to go: to dismantle Medicare as we know it, to gut Medicaid, most of which goes for seniors in nursing homes, and to unravel the entire health care system and the patient protections that every American who has insurance has right now that allow them to get the health care they are actually paying for.  I need to raise one other thing because this is very serious and goes to serious issues surrounding conflicts of interest and likely ethics violations that relate to this nominee.  There are a lot of unanswered questions and serious concerns related to Congressman Price's investments in health care and pharmaceutical companies. Frankly, he misled the Finance and the HELP Committees with answers to questions, and just the night before he was to have a confirmation hearing and vote, we learned from company officials that he got a privileged offer to buy stock at a discount. In other words, he got a special deal on health care stock. He told us he had not; they had paid fair market value, even though it was already an issue that he had purchased stock and then put legislation in related to similar companies or the same companies involved. But then we found out it was even worse because he got a special deal.  As Democrats, we asked for answers. We did not want to move forward without asking the Congressman to come back before us so we could ask questions about what he had said to the committee versus what the business that sold him the stock said afterwards. Unfortunately, that did not happen, requiring the Finance Committee to be in a situation where the rules ended up being broken and the nomination was forced through the committee without having bipartisan participation.  I have a number of concerns related to the ethics and possible legal violations of this nominee. On multiple occasions, he did purchase stock within days of introducing legislation that would have affected that company's bottom line and his investment. Despite multiple requests over several weeks, we still don't have the answers and, more importantly, the American people don't have the answers from the person who will oversee health insurance, oversee Medicare, Medicaid--the entire system. Someone who has invested and then helped the same companies indicated he didn't get a special deal, and now we have information that says otherwise. I think that is very concerning and should have been addressed before we were asked to vote on this particular nominee.  There are a number of reasons--policy, track record, questions that have been raised that I find extraordinary that they haven't been answered and shocking that folks haven't felt they should be answered at this point. But for many reasons, it is my intention to vote no on behalf of the people in Michigan who care deeply about a strong, effective Medicare system, about making sure Medicaid is there for our children as well as our seniors and nursing homes, and for everyone who believes that in this great country, all should have the ability to see a doctor and get the medical care you need for your child or yourself.

Furthermore,General Kelly did not provide sufficient assurance that he fully opposes the President's wasteful and misguided plan for aborder wall.  However, now that he has been confirmed, it is my hope that Secretary Kelly will be the voice of reason in thedeliberations to shape the Trump administration's homeland security policy and that many of the reckless ideas candidate Trumpespoused during the election will never become reality.  While I voted against General Kelly, I recognize and appreciate hislong and distinguished career in the marines. I believe this experience, particularly his final assignment as head of the U.S.Southern Command, will serve him well. In addition, I am encouraged by several statements General Kelly made during hisconfirmation hearing--statements that are at odds with the dangerous comments President Trump made during the campaign.  Atthe hearing, General Kelly spoke out against the use of torture and said the U.should always abide by the Geneva Conventions.He did state that building a wall along the southern border was not an effective way to secure the border, though he has notpromised to oppose such a plan. He agreed with the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was responsible for hackinginto our elections. He said that surveilling mosques and targeting Muslims as security threats was unacceptable. Finally, hesaid the sweeping collection of data on Americans violated the right to privacy and a much more focused effort is needed.  General Kelly has a reputation for speaking truth to power--I sincerely hope he does so as a member of the Cabinet, and Ihope the President will listen. New Mexico is a majority-minority border State with thousands of hard-working families nowliving in fear of President Trump's immigration plans.

1093,topic-id,2816,"Mr.President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of Congressman Tom Price to be Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  I oppose the nomination because Mr.Price wants to dismantle America's health care system--with no guarantee that Americans will continue to receive the health care coverage they now enjoy. He is part of the Trump ``repeal with no plan'' contingent.  In my view, any repeal of the Affordable Care Act must be coupled with a program that has rock solid guarantees to the American public, guarantees that Americans will not lose the health care benefits they now have.  Further, I oppose any vote on Mr.Price's nomination until there has been a full investigation and disclosure to the American public of his conflicts of interest. Mr.Price has invested in companies just prior to introducing legislation that would benefit those very companies. Before we vote on Mr.Price, the American public needs a full accounting whether his investments comply with Federal insider trading laws and ethical provisions.  The President's first order of business was an attack on Americans' health care. His Executive order gives Federal agencies broad authority to grant waivers, exemptions, and delays of provisions in the As Secretary of Health and Human Services, Mr.Price will be given rein not only to grant waivers but to not enforce key ACA provisions and to pass regulations that undercut ACA protections. For example, undermining the individual mandate--a key target of Mr.Price's--could lead to collapse of the individual health insurance market and drive up premiums for everyone.  The ACA has resulted in the broadest health care coverage Americans have ever known. Now over 91 percent of Americans have health insurance.  In my own State of New Mexico, the number of uninsured has dropped by over 50 percent. New Mexico is not a wealthy We had one of the highest rates of uninsured in the country before the ACA--19.6 percent. That's almost one in five people. Now, only 8.9 percent of New Mexicans do not have insurance. This is still too high, but it is a big improvement.  Americans strongly support ACA protections. Almost 70 percent of Americans think insurance companies should not be able to deny insurance because of a preexisting condition. Eighty-five percent of Americans want their young adult children to be able to get coverage on their insurance policies. Eighty-three percent think preventative services should be free.  The Republicans and Mr.Price have no plan to make sure Americans do not lose these rights and benefit.  Now, the ACA is not perfect. We all know this. It needs improvement. It needs work. But the solution is not to throw the health care system into chaos with no plan. The solution is to work together on a bipartisan basis and fix the ACA's problems.  Hundreds of my constituents have called and written asking me to protect the New Mexicans are scared--really scared--that their health care will be taken away. People are scared their health is in jeopardy. For some, they are scared their lives will be put at risk.[[Page S1033]]  I am angry that the President, Mr.Price, and the Republicans have created so much fear and worry among my constituents and around the None of them has to worry whether their children will get the health care they need. My constituents now do.  Kevin, from Albuquerque, now has to worry whether his 33-year-old daughter Amber will get the health care she needs. Amber has multiple sclerosis. That is a tough disease. I talked about Amber once before here, and her story bears retelling.  Amber's annual medical costs are high. Her medications alone are $60,000 a year. Her doctor visits and MRIs run into the thousands of dollars.  But Amber now has health insurance through the open market thanks to the And, thanks to the ACA, she is healthy. She works. She leads a productive life.  Without the ACA, Kevin worries his daughter will be kicked off her health insurance plan because her medical expenses are so high and that she will not be able to get new health insurance--because of her preexisting For Amber and Kevin, the ACA's protections mean everything.  There are literally hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans and millions of Americans like This one ACA provision--prohibiting discrimination based on preexisting illness--protects an estimated 861,000 New Mexicans and 134 million If we ourselves don't have a serious illness like Amber, we have a family member or friend who does.  Same with people who have high medical costs. These are the people who need medical care the most. The ACA provision--prohibiting lifetime benefit limits--protects an estimated 555,000 New Mexicans and 105 million  Why is there even any discussion about jeopardizing millions of Americans' health care?  The ACA saves lives. It saved Mike's life. Mike and his wife, Pam, are from Placitas, Before the ACA, they didn't have insurance. They couldn't afford it and probably couldn't get it for Pam because she had a preexisting illness.  As soon as they could, they signed up for an insurance plan under the Using their new preventive care services, they found out Mike had an aggressive form of cancer. Thankfully, they caught it early. Mike was treated at the University of New Mexico Cancer Center and is cured.  Pam says there is ``no question'' that the ACA saved her husband's life.  Hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans and millions of Americans benefit because the ACA requires health insurance companies to provide free preventatives services. It is well documented that such services prevent illness, save lives, and save money in the long run.  I am also concerned about the impact ACA repeal would have in Indian During his confirmation hearings, Congressman Price was asked specifically about the devastating consequences Medicaid expansion repeal would have on Indian health providers. These providers depend heavily on this Federal funding to provide lifesaving services to our Native communities. Any reduction in Federal funding to these facilities would be unconscionable.  But Congressman Price has a clear record of voting to support the elimination of the Medicaid expansion and, when asked directly, could offer no solution for making Indian Country whole if this funding were to be cut. Nothing in his hearing or written answers has assured me that Congressman Price intends to protect Native communities from the negative impact of ACA repeal.  And, finally, ACA repeal would be devastating to my State's economy. That is what a Ph.economist from New Mexico State University told the New Mexico Legislature last week. Jim Peach said ACA repeal would be ``devastating'' to our  As I said, New Mexico is not a wealthy We have one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, at 6.6 percent.  But the ACA has been an economic boon for us. Seven of the 10 fastest-growing job categories in New Mexico are in health care. In fact, boosts from health care and tourism actually led to positive job growth for the last 2 months. So health care jobs are of critical importance in New  But, if the ACA is repealed, it is estimated New Mexico could lose between 19,000 and 32,000 jobs. I can tell you right now New Mexico cannot take that kind of hit in its employment numbers.  And, the loss in spending in New Mexico would be astronomical.  ACA repeal would mean a loss of $93 million in Federal marketplace spending in 2019 in New Mexico and $1 billion between 2019 and 2028.  It would mean a loss of $2.2 billion in Federal Medicaid funding in 2019 and almost $27 billion between 2019 and 2028.  This hit to our economy would be immediate and would be sustained. Tax revenues would decrease. And the New Mexico legislature is struggling mightily now how to balance the State budget.  The fact is no State budget is ready to take on the extra load if the ACA is repealed and health care gets pushed back to the We will go back to the days of no care, uncompensated care, and use of taxpayer-subsidized ER services as a last resort.  But Mr.Price and the Republicans are not talking about any of the damage in human or fiscal terms if the ACA is repealed.  In fact, they are already moving to undermine the Affordable Care Act, roll back its protections, reduce assistance to families, create chaos in the insurance markets--by executive action alone.  President Trump's Executive order directed his government not to implement the Affordable Care Act wherever possible under existing law. And we cannot be confident they will not bend the law in pursuit of this Presidential decree.  I cannot support a nominee to head our health care system who is not firmly committed to maintaining the health care coverage Americans now have. And who will not push--and push hard--for the right of every American to have health care.  Finally, I cannot support holding a vote on Mr.Price until all financial conflicts of interest of his have been fully vetted and the American public knows there has been no violation of law or ethical responsibilities.  Mr.Price is a wealthy man, like so many of Mr.Trump's cabinet nominees. And he has tried to increase his wealth by investing in health-related companies. It is widely reported--in the Wall Street Journal and elsewhere--that Mr.Price has made over $300,000 worth of investments in health-related companies--companies that could benefit from his legislation.  We are all familiar with the STOCK It applies directly to us and prohibits us from using inside information that we obtain through our positions as Members of Congress for personal gain.  There are serious questions whether Mr.Price's investments ran afoul of the STOCK  I would like to refer to a February 7, 2017, column from the New York Times discussing Mr.Price's widely reported investments. So, a first example, in March of last year, Congressman Price announced opposition to a Medicare measure that would limit the money doctors could make from drugs they prescribe their patients. The proposal was meant to reduce doctors' financial incentives to prescribe expensive drugs.  Makes sense--we don't want doctors to prescribe more costly drugs because they would personally benefit.  But, just 1 week later, Mr.Price bought stock in six pharmaceutical companies that would benefit if this consumer protection measure were defeated.  And then, at the very same time, those very same companies were lobbying Congress to block the measure. And Big Pharma succeeded.  A second example--last year, he purchased shares in Zimmer Biomet, a company that makes hip and knee implants.  Six days later, he introduced a bill that would have directly helped His legislation sought to delay a Federal regulation that would have changed payment procedures for In fact, Zimmer was one of two companies that would have been hit the hardest by the regulation.  Mr.Price has said his broker bought the Zimmer stock. But these circumstances warrant investigation.[[Page S1034]]And, bottom line, Mr.Price is responsible for his investments.  A third example--last summer, Mr.Price was offered a special deal--to purchase shares at deeply discounted price from Innate Immunotherapeutics, an Australian drug company. He got in at 18 cents a share--at a time the stock value was increasing rapidly, rising to more than 90 cents a share. The value of his shares rose more than 400 percent.  At the same time, Innate Immuno needs Federal Drug Administration approval for one of its drugs.  This deal raises questions whether Mr.Price gained from an investment opportunity--unavailable to the public--from a company whose profits could be influenced by his political decisions.  A Cabinet nominee should not come into office under a cloud of conflicts. A vote on his nomination before there is full inquiry into his investments and ethical behavior is premature.  For these reasons, I will vote no on the nomination of Mr.Price as Secretary of Health and Human  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times column I referred to be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 7, 2017]                   Tom Price, Personal Enrichment                          (By David Leonhardt)       Each year, a publication called Medscape creates a portrait      of the medical profession. It surveys thousands of doctors      about their job satisfaction, salaries and the like and      breaks down the results by specialty, allowing for      comparisons between, say, dermatologists and oncologists.       As I read the most recent survey, I was struck by the      answers from orthopedic surgeons. They are the highest-paid      doctors, with an average salary of $443,000 in 2015--which,      coincidentally, was almost the exact cutoff for the famed top      1 percent of the income distribution.       Yet many orthopedists are not happy with their pay. Only 44      percent feel ``fairly compensated,'' a smaller share than in      almost every other specialty. A lot of orthopedists aren't      even happy being doctors. Just 49 percent say they would go      into medicine if they had to make the decision again,      compared with 64 percent of all doctors.       I know that many orthopedists have a very different view:      They take pride in helping patients and feel fortunate to      enjoy comfortable lives. But despite those doctors, it's      clear that orthopedics suffers from a professional culture      that does not live up to medicine's highest ideals. Too many      orthopedists are rich and think it's an injustice that      they're not richer.       This culture helped shape Tom Price, the orthopedic      surgeon and Georgia congressman who is Donald Trump's nominee      for secretary of health and human services.       Price had a thriving practice near Atlanta before being      elected to Congress in 2004. His estimated net worth of more      than $10 million (and possibly a lot more) makes him one of      the House's wealthier members.       Yet he hasn't been content to make money in the standard      ways. He has also pushed, and crossed, ethical boundaries.      Again and again, Price has mingled his power as a congressman      with his desire to make money.       So far, the nominee receiving the most attention is Betsy      DeVos, Trump's choice for education secretary, and she      definitely deserves scrutiny. Still, I think Democrats have      made a mistake focusing so much on her rather than on      He could do more damage--and his transgressions are worse      than those that have defeated prior nominees.       Last March, Price announced his opposition to a sensible      Medicare proposal to limit the money doctors could make from      drugs they prescribe their patients. The proposal was meant      to reduce doctors' financial incentives to prescribe      expensive drugs. (And, yes, if you're bothered that your      doctor has any stake in choosing one drug over another, you      should be.)       One week after Price came out against the proposal, he      bought stocks in six pharmaceutical companies that would      benefit from its defeat, as Time magazine reported. At the      time, those same companies were lobbying Congress to block      the change. They succeeded.       It's a pattern, too. Price has put the interests of drug      companies above those of taxpayers and patients--and invested      in those drug companies on the side.       Last year, he also bought shares in Zimmer Biomet, a maker      of hip and knee implants. Six days later, according to CNN,      he introduced a bill that would that have directly helped            In his defense, a spokesman for Price has said that his      broker bought the Zimmer stock and Price didn't find out      until later. That's certainly possible, but still not      acceptable. Members of Congress bear responsibility for their      personal stock transactions, period.       A third episode may be the worst. Price accepted a special      offer from an Australian drug company to buy discounted      shares, as The Wall Street Journal and Kaiser Health News      reported.       He told the Senate that the offer was open to all      investors, although fewer than 20 Americans actually received      an invitation to buy at the discounted price. The stock has      since jumped in value, and Price underreported the worth of      his investment in his nomination filings. It was a ``clerical      error,'' he says.       Even without any larger context, his actions are      disqualifying. He's repeatedly placed personal enrichment      above the credibility of The behavior is      substantially worse than giving money to an illegal immigrant      (which defeated a George Bush nominee) or failing to pay      nanny taxes (which scuffled a Bill Clinton nominee).       But of course there is a larger context. Price has devoted      much of his political career opposing expansion of health      insurance. His preferred replacement of Obamacare would      reduce health care benefits for sicker, poorer and older            His views have a long history within the medical      profession. For decades, doctors used their political clout      to help block universal health insurance. They offered many      rationales, but money was the main reason. Many doctors      feared that a less laissez-faire health care system would      reduce their pay.       It's to the great credit of today's doctors that they have      moved their lobbying groups away from that position and      helped extend insurance to some 20 million people. They      understand that some principles matter more than a paycheck.       Or at least many of them do.

1059,topic-id,558,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  When we think of a startup business, the early days of Apple or Google usually come to mind. Their stories are familiar--hardworking entrepreneurs who beat the odds. Like these companies, most successful startups have several common ingredients: a new product or service, a willingness to take risks, and leadership that can navigate the complexities of today's economy. And successful firms also have a way of securing capital to both get off the ground and to grow.  This last ingredient can present serious obstacles as startups face unique financing challenges. Many do not have positive cash flow, putting traditional bank loans out of reach. While some of these firms participate in incubator or accelerator programs that provide a small amount of seed capital, they must find new sources of funding when their initial capital runs out.  One avenue for securing additional capital is by participating in demo days or pitch days. At these events, entrepreneurs have an opportunity to showcase their companies and innovations to potential investors.  Today's bill will alter SEC rules to exempt the use of general solicitation for presentations made at demo days. In other words, demo day organizers will not have to comply with the usual procedures verifying that the investors they are attracting to the event are accredited.  Despite the well-intended goal of expanding the use of demo days to better meet startups' capital needs, it is easy to see how unscrupulous actors could exploit this exemption to deceive ordinary people that were drawn to the event by a public advertisement. My amendment makes improvements to ensure attendees at demo days have an opportunity to be informed about the nature of these presentations and the risks of investing in startups.                              {time}  1500  Typically, demo days are limited to select groups of potential investors. Let's be clear, these are not science fairs, but they are sophisticated business presentations designed to raise capital for the entrepreneurs and their startups.  However, the underlying bill allows colleges and universities and nonprofits to host these events and advertise them to the public. It is easy to see how some attendees might not know the true nature of the presentation.  My amendment will address this by requiring event sponsors to provide an SEC-created disclosure outlining the nature of the event and investment risks. By creating a uniform disclosure, the SEC can take the burden off the sponsors and issuers on what to disclose.  This amendment would also clarify that attendance at a demo day alone does not constitute a preexisting relationship and does not allow a stock issuer to sidestep their obligation to verify that an investor is accredited. Without this clarification, it is possible that issuers could defraud less-sophisticated retail investors.[[Page H265]]  Demo days are a great way for our Nation's entrepreneurs to raise capital, but they should be making presentations to the right investors, those that understand the risks of investing in risky startup businesses, not just anyone who saw an advertisement.  My amendment would both expand the ability of small businesses to raise capital by tapping into demo days while ensuring that the right kind of investors, those accredited and fully informed, are participating in the small business capital markets.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH259-2.txt,1184,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,10.0,March

Mr.Speaker, health care in this country has become simply unaffordable for far too many small businesses and working families. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has proved to be an utter failure for most people in the United It is snowballing out of control and rolling over working families and small businesses.  Ninety-five percent of small businesses have reported increased health insurance costs over the past 5 years. A 2015 study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that the cost of health insurance is the principal reason that small businesses do not offer coverage.  As a result, since 2008, 36 percent of small businesses with fewer than 10 employees have stopped offering healthcare coverage to their employees. It is not that they don't want to offer healthcare benefits. The truth of the matter is that small businesses have been hit especially hard by the government takeover of health care. Under ObamaCare, the working families I speak to in my district are paying more for less and finding they have fewer options for coverage.  H.1101 is a key part of the third phase of our efforts to reform our healthcare system so it works for all It aims to increase the negotiating power of small businesses so they can bring down health insurance costs for their employees.  Right now, small businesses are often on an unequal playing field with larger companies and unions. Because they have few employees, small businesses have limited bargaining power when it comes to negotiating for lower insurance costs for their workers.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Rogers of Kentucky). The time of the gentleman from Michigan has expired.

994,topic-id,80,"Mr.Speaker, this bill levels the playing field for small businesses, allowing them to band together through association health plans and negotiate the best deals to provide health care at a lower cost. It also represents an important step toward purchasing health insurance across State lines.  Today's vote is an immediate first step to help job creators provide affordable healthcare options to their employees and a transition toward a patient-centered healthcare system.

Just yesterday, Fiat Chrysler announced it would create 2,000 jobs and invest $1 billion to modernize manufacturing plants in Michigan and Last week, Ford scrapped plans for its facility in Mexico and instead promised to invest $700 million at the Flat Rock plant. This move will bring 700 new jobs to These are exciting developments for our State's economy and good paying jobs for our dedicated and talented workforce.

1095,topic-id,7723,"Mr.President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote against the nomination of Tom Price to be the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  The decisions made at HHS touch the lives of every family in The Secretary who runs this agency makes decisions about everything from safety of the food we eat to the drugs we take, to the health insurance we buy and the quality of nursing homes we live in. This is an extremely important job, and we should not hand over the keys to this agency unless we are certain that the person will put the American people first every minute of every day.  President Trump has nominated Congressman Tom Price to serve in this job. Unlike many of the President's other nominees who are stunningly inexperienced in areas where they will be setting policy, Congressman Price has a lot of experience in health care policy. Yes, he has experience, but it is the kind of experience that should horrify us if we care about Medicare, if we care about Medicaid, or if we care about our own insurance coverage.  Congressman Price's record is perfectly clear. He wants to destroy fundamental protections that millions of Americans depend on for their health and economic security, and, frankly, he isn't very subtle about it. He has described ACA's ban on discriminating against individuals with preexisting conditions as ``a terrible idea.'' He has voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood--voted 10 times against a group that provides lifesaving cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings to millions of patients a year. He has tried to privatize Medicare and raise the age of eligibility. Privatize Medicare; think about that. And he has been one of the chief boosters in Congress for gutting the Medicaid program--the Medicaid program, which provides health care for millions of kids, for people with disabilities, for families with parents in nursing homes--cut money to keep people in nursing homes.  Nonpartisan analyses of these plans are not pretty. Millions of people in this country, young and old, children and grandparents, poor and middle-class workers would be denied access to lifesaving care.  Congressman Price touts his own magic numbers that say differently, but make no mistake, this is the record of someone who wants to use his position at HHS to advance a radical, reckless agenda that puts rightwing, anti-government ideology ahead of the health and safety of the American people.  During his hearing before the HELP Committee, I asked Congressman Price some pretty simple questions. I asked him about more than $1 trillion in cuts that he has proposed to Medicare and I asked him if he would keep or undermine President Trump's campaign claim that he would protect these programs. I asked him to guarantee that not one dollar in cuts to Medicare would take place on his watch. I asked him to guarantee that not one dollar in cuts for Medicaid to help people living in nursing homes would happen on his watch. I asked him to guarantee that not one dollar in cuts for people with disabilities would happen on his watch.  I asked him three separate times to make this commitment, and three separate times he refused to do so. Think about that--cut Medicare for millions of seniors, cut help for people with disabilities, cut Medicaid for people living in nursing homes. This is the person Donald Trump wants to put in charge of those programs.  We have a lot of work we need to do on health care. We need to reduce the cost of insurance. We need to make sure insurance is available to small business owners, gig workers, and part-time workers. We need to make sure insurance continues to cover health care for women and people with preexisting conditions who otherwise are not going to be able to get insurance. What we don't need is to put someone in charge who is hell-bent on destroying health care in  For me, this is easy. When someone says he wants to cut Medicare, I am done with him. When someone says let's take away the money that people rely on to pay for nursing homes, this guy is finished. When someone says that protecting people with preexisting conditions is a bad idea, they don't get the job. This should be easy for everyone in This is a moment for Senator Republicans to step up and say no.  There is another reason to reject Congressman Price's nomination, a reason that has nothing to do with his terrible ideas, a reason that would disqualify him even if we agreed on every single issue. The reason is basic ethics.  During his time in Congress, Mr.Price has made money by trading hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock in healthcare-related companies at exactly the same time that he pushed legislation that could affect the value of these stocks. His formula has been pretty simple. First he buys the stock, then he pushes bills to help the company, which helps the stock price go up.  For example, Congressman Price bought stock in a company that makes hip and knee replacements, and then he introduced a bill to suspend a Federal rule affecting Medicare reimbursements for hip and knee replacements. Congressman Price bought stock in a bunch of pharmaceutical companies, then cosponsored a bill to suspend a Federal rule that would hold down drug prices for the drugs that these companies manufacture. Congressman Price bought stock in an Australian biotech company with an experimental drug to treat multiple sclerosis, and then he voted for a bill that would make it easier for the FDA to approve these drugs.  So what does Congressman Price have to say for himself? How does he explain this connection between buying stock, then supporting changes in the law that would boost the value of the stock he just bought? Well, he has his excuses lined up, and I have to say they are doozies.  He says he didn't know about the trades; his broker made them without asking him first. Oh, wait. He did know about the trades. He just happened to know about an obscure Australian biotech firm, and he just happened to decide to invest as much as $100,000 in it because it was a good investment. Then he hit his last excuse: It is all OK because he paid the same price as anyone else who bought the stock.  Wow, that is really a heaping, steaming pile of excuses, and the excuses stink. These are Congressman Price's stock trades, not anyone else's. He made those decisions to buy those stocks, and then he repeatedly pressed for rules that would increase the value of those stocks. In fact, with one of the deals, it isn't just a question of stinkiness; it is a question about whether he broke the law.  By his own account, Congressman Price found out about an Australian biotech company called Innate Immunotherapeutics from a fellow House Member who, it just so happens, sits on the company's board and holds the largest stake in the company. So when he decided to buy his latest batch of stock, Congressman Price got access to a private sweetheart deal, meaning he got a discount on the price of the shares the general public couldn't get.  This sequence of events might break the law. That is not good at all. And getting special access to a sweetheart deal doesn't help your claim that you are just an ordinary guy with a boring stock portfolio. So when Congressman Price appeared before the Finance and HELP Committees, he said he had not paid a lower price than had been available to other investors. That is just not true. The company itself pointed it out. In fact, Congressman Price got a[[Page S1037]]special discount that went to only 20 people in the country--20 special friends, including the Congressman who could help write the laws that would make the company even more valuable.  An outside watchdog has called for an SEC investigation into whether Congressman Price committed insider trading. Price lied to Congress about his trades, and that should be the end of it. No more nomination for Secretary of The Congressman should have the decency to withdraw his nomination. It should have happened weeks ago. And if he didn't go voluntarily, the President and his friends in Congress should have quietly but forcefully pushed him out, but that is not what happened either. Instead, Republicans barreled straight ahead, and they changed the rules to do it.  Since Congressman Price lied to the committee, Democrats wanted him back for another hearing to ask him about it. Republicans refused, and Democrats boycotted the Finance Committee to try to force Price to explain why he lied. So the Republican response was to just suspend the Senate rules so they can run around the Democrats and move forward Price's nomination anyway.  Do we do not care about basic ethics anymore? Is that just gone? A Congressman should not be buying stocks then pushing laws to help the company, and that Congressman sure shouldn't be lying to the United States Senate about it.  Because Congressman Price has no shame, it will take three Senate Republicans to reject his nomination. Where are the three Republicans who will say no to a man who bought stock and then tried to get the rules changed in Washington so the companies would be more profitable? Where are three Republicans who will say no to a man who got a special stock deal that went to only 20 people in the whole country? Where are three Republicans who will say no to a man who lied to a Senate committee? This has nothing to do with politics. It is about basic ethics. It is about potentially illegal behavior. Where are three Republicans who will say no to this man?  When Donald Trump selected Congressman Price for this job, he said Price was part of a ``dream team that will transform our healthcare system for the benefit of all Americans.'' Over the past few weeks, I have been trying to understand exactly what that dream looks like.  For families all over this country, the dream is pretty simple. They want to know that when they get sick, they can go to the doctor and not be hit with a surprise bill they can't pay. When they buy insurance, they want to be sure it covers birth control or cancer screenings and preexisting conditions. They want to be able to fight cancer and not lose their house or declare bankruptcy because their insurance company imposes a lifetime limit on benefits.  President Trump does not share this dream for health care in America, and neither does Congressman From his first day in office, President Trump has acted to undermine access to health care. Now he has nominated an HHS Secretary who will help him sabotage our Nation's health care system from inside the Department of Health and Human  Yes, we have our differences over health care, and, yes, there are fixes we need to make, but where are three Republicans who will say no to a man who wants to cut Medicare? Where are three Republicans who will say no to a man who wants to cut nursing home care? Where are three Republicans who will say no to a man who wants to cut insurance coverage? Democrats can't do this alone. Three Republicans need to put aside partisanship and stand up for the American people. We need you. The American people need you.  With my remaining time, I want to share some of the letters I have been getting from families in Massachusetts who have seen the reckless, radical plans that President Trump, Congressman Price, and Republicans in Congress have put forth for the Nation's health care system. These families know exactly what is at stake in this debate. Congressman Price didn't have an answer when I asked him to protect Medicare and Medicaid, but these letters are from constituents and they show just how important these programs are.  Lee from Holliston wrote to me, concerned about cuts to Medicare and I am just going to read an excerpt from his letter:       I am a 65 year old disabled woman who depends on the      generosity of MassHealth and Medicare to survive. I am      terrified that Medicare and Medicaid will be so drastically      cut that I will no longer be able to maintain my life. I live      in HUD housing, receive Medicare and MassHealth which covers      all of my healthcare and allows me to continue to live on my      own through senior services and the Personal Care Attendant      program.       I guess I am just feeling scared and hopeless as I realize      the potential for destroying the lives of seniors who live on      Social Security and nothing else. I wear an insulin pump,      have type 1 diabetes going on 53 years, and I have multiple      complications--including an amputation 11 years ago.       My healthcare costs are just unaffordable without all the      assistance. Medicare and MassHealth covers everything for me      so that the $1,050 per month I receive is doable for living      expenses.       I just need to know it is going to be  Lee, we need three Republicans to help out here. Congressman Price has made it clear that he wants more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, and that affects you. We have to find three Republicans to help out and to help stand up for you and the rest of  I also heard from Alan from South Shore, who is worried about his daughter Here is what he wrote:       My daughter Meg is 29. She was born with a condition called      neurofibromatosis. As a result of this, she has benign but      inoperable tumors on her spine. They cause her chronic pain      and problems walking. On some days, she cannot walk even one      step. On other days, she might begin walking with a walker,      then suddenly collapse on the floor.       Meg cannot hold down a job: She spent the last quarter of      2016 in and out of hospitals. She receives about $700/month      from Social Security She has no savings. She pays      for her Medicare prescription drug Part D supplement out of      her Social MassHealth is free for her, and it pays      for Meg's Medicare Part I am retired, so I can only help      her a bit.       If Trump's first idea about TrumpCare goes into law--where      he assumes you will buy your health insurance out of      savings--I fear Meg will live in her bed, watching repeats of      quiz shows on her television. And her network of care--     including emergency services, rehab physical therapy, chronic      disease management prescription drugs--will be reduced.  I understand why you are worried, I am worried, too, because I think that is exactly the path we are on with Congressman Price's nomination to head up That is why we are fighting back.  Boston Center for Independent Living also shared with me a story from a constituent named Jill who receives health care from the State's Medicaid Let me tell you a little bit about  Jill is 62 years old. She has a heart defect, a seizure disorder, and serious osteoporosis. She had a varied career as a manager of a women's clothing company a decade ago, and in the 1980s, she installed some of the first computer networks in public schools. In the past several years, Jill has had significant health problems: surgery for her heart condition and multiple broken bones due to her worsening osteoporosis.  MassHealth, the State's Medicaid Program, has covered hospital bills, appointments with specialists, rehab stays, and an affordable medication plan.  Jill is now hoping to use a personal care assistant to give her support with shopping, making meals, and basic housekeeping.  Jill said: ``For me, Medicaid is a lifeline--any cuts from Washington would be a disaster.''  I hear you on that, I just hope that Congressman Price, President Trump, and the Republicans hear you as well.  Medicaid helps a lot of people in Massachusetts, including the very youngest. I got a very powerful letter from Marika from Duxbury, who wrote to me about giving birth to her son Jack after just 28 weeks of pregnancy. I want to read parts of her letter:       I'm writing to you today because I am horrified about the      changes that may be happening to healthcare in the United            My husband and I welcomed our son, Jack, at 28 weeks in      July of 2015. I had a very normal, healthy pregnancy--until      suddenly it wasn't. I ended up with rapid onset of HELLP, a      rare and life-threatening syndrome, and an emergency C-     section saved both my life and Jack's.       Jack was 1 pound, 14 ounces when he was born. We were both      in the ICU for some time,[[Page S1038]]     my son Jack for 110 days. He had all the issues you'd imagine      at 28 weeks--cardiac, pulmonary, feeding.       Today, at 18 months old, Jack is a fighter--my hero      really--and despite still needing oxygen and a continuous      feeding tube that is surgically inserted into his intestines,      he is cruising, talking, and       He is alive, and quite frankly, I'm alive because of our      amazing healthcare. I have the benefit of an exceptional      employer plan from Harvard But Jack also      qualified (because of his birth weight) for And      our public health insurance has been an incredible resource:       Jack's hospital bills were in the millions after his 110      day stay in the This doesn't even include my own      hospital costs for my stay. Despite having excellent jobs and      resources, my husband and I would have been bankrupt, and      immediately so, without our private health insurance and      MassHealth benefits.       Since coming home from the NICU, Jack is still on a feeding      tube and oxygen, and he cannot be accepted into regular      daycare. He would go to a medical day care, but he has no      cognitive delays, and so placing him in such a facility would      not ensure that he gets the regular developmentally      appropriate engagement that he needs. And so MassHealth pays      for skilled nursing care in our home with no out of pocket      costs. This means that Jack gets the care that he needs, and      my husband and I can still work at the jobs that we love.       Jack participates in early intervention programs and      receives feeding therapy, physical therapy and occupational      therapy free of charge.       Jack's Synagis shots cost zero dollars. Synagis is a      prescription medication that is used to prevent a serious      lung disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, in      children at high risk for severe lung disease from The      average wholesale price is $780.15 for the 50 milligram      Synagis vial, and $1,416.48 for the 100 milligram vial. Jack      gets a 150 milliliter shot every month.       I cannot imagine this life without my son's public health      insurance. I recently enjoyed the NICU Family Advisory Board      at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Hospital in Boston (where      Jack and I were cared for) as a way to give back. Today, I      mentor other families who have unexpectedly found themselves      the parent to a tiny premature baby fighting for life. In      nearly every case, navigating the insurance system and fears      about money are top of mind.  I am glad to hear that Jack is doing well, but I understand why it is that you want to hang on to MassHealth and why it is that we cannot take the cuts Congressman Price has proposed.  Families in Massachusetts are also deeply worried about the future of the Affordable Care Jackie from Norwood wrote to me about how the ACA helped her get coverage for therapy after her mother was killed. She wrote:       My mother was murdered when I was 24. I was on her      healthcare, which kicked me off the day after she died. I had      recently accepted a new job and I was set to start that      Monday (she was killed on Saturday). I had already left my      previous full-time job the Friday before.       Due to having to move states after her death, I couldn't      start my new job. I didn't know when I'd have work again that      could provide insurance, nor did I have another parent whose      plan I could join. I also had no way of affording COBRA      payments.       So in the matter of one night, I was left helpless in so      many ways. Not having health insurance was one of many side      effect issues that no homicide victim's family should have to      worry about. Especially the next day and when planning a      funeral.       Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, I was able to get      covered almost immediately, which meant I could still afford      my current medications and I was able to get into needed      therapy right away. If it weren't for the ACA, I would have      been left struggling and sick as a result of something FAR      out of my control.  Very true,  Jackie goes on to say:       I ended up finding work within a couple of months, and I am      still in treatment for I was lucky enough to find      employment at Harvard University and no longer needed      coverage through the I have generous health benefits      provided to me. However, I never want a fellow citizen or      victim of homicide to be without medical care due to cost,      preexisting conditions, or other setbacks. I am happy my tax      dollars go to help programs like MassHealth and the We      all work hard, but that doesn't mean we are all as fortunate.       I am not the typical poster child for a homicide victim/     survivor. I am white and college educated. I work for an Ivy      League school. I still needed help when disaster struck, and      so many others less privileged than me need help finding      affordable health care.       Please continue fighting for me and other victims and      survivors of homicide.  That is what we are here for, That is what we are supposed to do. We just need three Republicans to help us out on this.  I also heard from Jennifer from Northampton, who is terrified for her family if the ACA is repealed. She says:       I suppose I can't say when our story starts. Maybe the day      I met my then-life partner (now wife) of 16 years. Maybe it      begins when she had to have emergency surgery in Maryland      when she wasn't covered under my insurance, because our union      wasn't legally recognized. Maybe it begins with the tens of      thousands of dollars of debt we incurred in uncovered medical      expenses when we tried to get pregnant with our son.       Or maybe it started two days ago when the unthinkable      happened. My wife got laid off. After seven years of      exemplary services to a large human services agency whose      mission is supporting individuals and families affected by      homelessness, my wife was given no warning, no severance and      no compassion in her sudden dismissal from the agency. For      any family this would be devastating. Now we come to the dire      part.       About a year ago, my younger sister, Stephanie, was      diagnosed with an aggressive form of Triple Negative Breast      Cancer at 35 years of age. But this story isn't about that.       Six months later, my mother got diagnosed with Stage 4      Metastatic Breast       I didn't have to be an over-educated lesbian to know that      there was something genetic going on in my family. I got      tested for the BRCA gene and was found positive for the      mutation that causes breast cancer, specifically Triple      Negative (like my sister had) and am currently looking at an      80% chance of developing Breast Cancer in my lifetime.       I need a double mastectomy and I need it soon. It's      scheduled, in fact, for March 6th, 2017. And now, my wife      doesn't have a job. I am a Behavior Analyst who specializes      in the treatment of children with Autism Spectrum I      have a small private practice and don't make enough money to      support our household. I also don't have access to health      insurance through any of my contracts.       That is why it's dire.       One laid-off spouse, one four year old son, one self-     employed wife with an 80% chance of developing breast cancer      and fear of the ACA being repealed. This is dire.       We are terrified, I am terrified.       This isn't a ``wait and see'' situation for my family. This      is us. This is now. And this is real.  Yes, Jennifer, and that is why we are here tonight, in the U.Senate, to debate whether or not Congressman Price--a man who wants to cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, repeal the Affordable Care Act--is going to be the next head of Health and Human That is why we are fighting. That is why we are looking for three Republicans to step up with the Democrats and turn him down. We must protect the Affordable Care  I also got a letter from Olivia, a college student from North Olivia wrote me about what the ACA means to her as someone living with multiple chronic illnesses. She wrote:       I am a twenty-two year old white woman from a middle-class      suburb of I attend the University of Massachusetts      Amherst and will be applying to graduate school next year. I      eat an anti-inflammatory diet, I exercise regularly, do not      smoke, and drink lots of water. I am on my parents'      insurance, which they receive through their employer. I am a      patient at some of the best hospitals in the world.       I am so fortunate to live in a state that protects my right      to affordable health care. I was also hopeful when I heard      that President Trump was considering modifying ObamaCare      rather than repealing it. However, I am still worried about      the actions that will be taken in 2017 by his administration      and by       If you met me you would see a ``young, vibrant, and      ambitious woman''--other people's words, not mine. Many      people and politicians in this country would meet me and not      assume that I rely on the I am not from a low-income      family, I don't live in an area that doesn't have adequate      medical facilities, and I appear well. I am, however, living      with multiple chronic illnesses. I suffer from asthma,      fibromyalgia, chronic urticaria, chronic migraines,      irritable bowel system, gastro-esophageal reflux disease,      and a rare-genetic kidney disorder.       I take multiple medications daily that keep me alive,      prevent further health complications, and that allow me to      take care of myself. I also seek other therapies to manage my      conditions, such as chiropractic care and physical therapy. I      currently have great health insurance, yet I still pay      hundreds of dollars a month just to give myself any quality      of life.       I read the Trump/Pence administration's health care plan      and I am aware of the efforts by the GOP to repeal Obamacare      and their readiness to do so now that President Trump has      taken office. I don't believe I have to explain to you why      this worries me.  No, you don't.       I won't go on a rant about why health care reform should be      about the people not the money (though I could). I will also      not talk about why we should have universal health care      (though I could). I am hoping that my story offers a slightly      different perspective on why certain aspects of the ACA      cannot be modified.       Please remind your fellow senators that millions of      Americans suffer from multiple chronic illnesses, many of      which are invisible, and that we are a minority that is often[[Page S1039]]     forgotten. Many people are just like me. We are college      students and new graduates who have to learn to manage our      medical conditions before going out into the real world.       To do this, we may have to stay on our parents' insurance      until we are twenty-six years old. We are people who can only      work part-time jobs and will need insurance to help keep our      medical costs down. We may require expensive prescriptions      and numerous doctor visits a year; we cannot have a cap on      our care because our conditions are chronic and      unpredictable. We are people who will have to apply for      insurance with pre-existing conditions which should not be      held against us. We are thankful for preventative care      because it prevents illnesses that would exacerbate our other      conditions.       Health care is a business that we need but that we didn't      ask to be a part of. It is a business we all take part in,      whether we plan to or not. We are NOT burned-down houses--we      are citizens who provide meaningful contributions to our      country.       I hope that Congress can work together to continue to give      people like me a fighting chance.  I am with you on that. I hope Congress can work together to give people like you a fighting chance.  I also got a letter from Christine in Canton, who wrote to me about her son. She writes:       My oldest child is a 21-year-old college student (soon to      turn 22 in February), who is also transgender. He suffers      from anxiety and depression. He's been working very hard to      complete college while also seeking treatment for his mental      health issues. He sees a therapist weekly and has also been      hospitalized twice for mental health issues since he's been      in college.       Luckily, due to the Affordable Care Act, he is able to      remain on our insurance, where the co-payments for both      therapy and hospitalization are at least manageable. If he      were not to have coverage through our insurance, I'm not sure      that we could afford to pay for his treatment--and as a      college student, he certainly could not afford to pay for it.      It frightens me to think of what will happen to him if he is      not able to receive treatment to keep him healthy.       Like so many others covered by the Affordable Care Act, it      is a life or death situation. I need to know that you will      fight by any means possible to keep the Affordable Care Act      from getting repealed.       I also have a 19-year old college freshman and a 17-year      old high school senior. While they do not have the same      health issues as their brother, we all know how that can      change in an instant. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act      will also have consequences for them down the line.  I guarantee, Christine, I will be here to fight for you, to fight for keeping the Affordable Care Act for you and for families like yours.  Denise from southeastern Massachusetts wrote to me about how her family is fighting cancer. Here is what she said:       We are family of four, with three cancer survivors. My      husband is a childhood cancer survivor who is now fighting a      blood disorder and is a patient at Dana I am a three-     time cancer survivor. Having been diagnosed with breast      cancer at age 42 (with no family history), I have since had      two recurrences.       I have had radiation, five years of tamoxifen therapy, a      bilateral mastectomy, and reconstruction. My reconstruction      has been difficult, with five surgeries within 18 months. I      have been postponing another surgery due to cost, since my      insurance has changed for the worse. At age 23, my daughter      was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and underwent surgery      and seven months of chemotherapy.       We are a family that has always been proactive and      responsible in receiving regular health care. Now, my husband      and I have been rejected for long-term care. My daughter, who      has two children, pays a higher premium for life insurance      and has been denied cancer insurance. We are in a position      where we cannot even succeed in our attempts to take      responsibility for ourselves.       This outreach to you is a further attempt to do just that;      to maybe give you one more example of reality in your fight      for us. We are not whining; we are fortunate to be a close,      loving family that has had the strength to rally every time      adversity has struck.       But we are tired from the fight and very afraid for the      future. It is shocking to us that, in the richest country in      the world, after years of working, planning and saving, that      we are at the point of fearing a possible bankruptcy in our      later years. We also fear financial destruction for our hard-     working children due to uncovered medical expenses or the      possible exorbitant premiums of a high-risk insurance pool.       Please, please never tire in the fight for access to      comprehensive affordable healthcare. Good medical care should      not be a privilege for the rich, but a fundamental right for      all.  Boy, I am with you on that one, It is a fundamental right for all, and that is what we will continue to fight for.  I also received a letter from Jenny in And I want to read you Jenny's entire letter because she really underlines what is at stake in this fight.       My husband and I have spent our entire careers in the arts.      I write music for the theater; my husband is a novelist,      playwright, and freelance medical writer. We have two      children. We own a home. We paid back every dime on our      student loans and we contribute regularly to our self-funded      retirement accounts. We have no consumer debt. In short, we      are hardworking, fiscally responsible people.       We recognize the trade-offs that come with being our own      bosses. We enjoy the freedoms of self-employment, and take      seriously the extra burden that society imposes on us,      including making our own Social Security payments,      contributing to Medicare, and buying health care on the      individual market, something we have done our entire adult      lives.       When the Affordable Care Act was passed, we were thrilled.      For the first time, we had adequate coverage for our family.      Our deductibles shrank. We lost the dreaded co-insurance      provision and began to think that we could prepare      financially should we face the worst.       Or so we believed.       Our difficulties began in late 2014, when I was diagnosed      with breast cancer. Over the weeks that followed, I endured 5      surgeries, including a unilateral mastectomy and      reconstruction. Almost immediately after, I began to      experience complications. Since then, I've come to learn that      I was having a reaction to the silicone implant used in my      reconstruction and that was just the early stage of a complex      autoimmune condition that still lacks a name.       Back then, all I knew was that I was wracked with constant,      severe pain. I lost the ability to walk. I could no longer      think straight and I lost sight in my right eye. Luckily, we      stumbled upon an article by a Dutch team that had examined a      cohort of women suffering from the same condition. After      consulting with the lead author of the paper, we decided that      my implant was to blame, and we determined to have it      removed.       Although I experienced some relief immediately after ex-     plantation, I have never fully recovered. The joint pain and      exhaustion persist. I have shed more than a third of my body      weight. The battery of medications I take do little more than      keep my pain at bay, permitting me to drive my son to school      or shop for groceries, but not much more.       As for my artistic life, it has been put on hold. I have      unfinished commissions from two theaters--Chicago Shakespeare      Theater and Playwrights Horizons, in New York City--and both      institutions have been incredibly patient. Yet the truth is      that I have been unable to work for more than two years.       Severe cognitive impairment is a hallmark of my condition,      and I have serious problems with my short-term memory.      Holding the thread of conversation is incredibly difficult,      and I experience blinding headaches if I write music for more      than a couple of hours. Frequently, it feels as though      someone has reorganized my brain but forgotten to leave me      the instructions. It is frustrating; it's terrifying.       Only one thing has made it possible for me to survive this      at all: the coverage I receive through the       The day I got my cancer diagnosis, I was in the process of      re-certifying through the Massachusetts Health I      was thrilled when my local Navigator told me that thanks to      my new diagnosis, I qualify for Massachusetts' Breast and      Cervical Cancer Treatment Program, a Medicaid-backed      initiative designed to cover middle and low-income women      through their treatments. Not only would I be covered, but      our two children would also be insured by MassHealth, our      state's Medicaid program. Though my husband continued to      purchase care through a separate plan, this single event      saved our family from financial ruin.       Now, all of that stands to change. With the repeal of the      life-saving provisions guaranteed by the ACA, we are faced      with the complete erosion of our savings. The Republican      Congress has already voted to eliminate the ban on denying      individuals coverage on the basis of previously existing      conditions, meaning that I will most likely be uninsurable.      What will happen then? Will we go bankrupt? Will we lose our      home? How will I cope without my medications when we can no      longer afford to pay for them?       The passage of the ACA did more to shore up our little      family than any other piece of legislation in my lifetime. It      has enabled me to face my grave illness without worrying      whether cost would be a factor in my treatment or whether I      could try the next medication my doctors prescribed to      relieve my pain.       In sharing our story on social media, I have been      overwhelmed by the outpouring of concern from our tiny      community of theater professionals. The President of the      Dramatists' Guild, a professional association for theatre      artists, called me to offer the assistance of their Emergency      Fund should we need it. And while it is heartwarming to      receive the support of my professional community, the hard      truth is that even the most doggedly determined not-for-     profits can't possibly replace the broad social safety net of      the Federal government--a safety net Republicans are      determined to shred.       In every industrialized country but ours, health care is      considered an inalienable human right. It is abhorrent to      claim that[[Page S1040]]     care is something Americans should have to ``shop for.''      Price-comparison shopping may seem like a wonderful market-     driven design, but in reality it forces us to confront the      terrifying arithmetic of balancing how much care we need      against what we can afford. The sicker one grows, the harder      it becomes to solve that equation.       We have no idea what the Republicans intend by way of a      replacement to the They refuse to specify, despite their      years of claiming that the ACA is a failure. They talk of      expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), though such      accounts represent nothing but a disingenuous transfer of the      cost to the consumer. Even if such an approach made sense,      how far would $6,750 (the current HSA limit) go in meeting      actual health care costs? That amount would be wiped out      after a single visit to the emergency room.       What's more, where do they expect sick Americans--those      fighting for their lives and unable to work precisely because      of their illnesses--to suddenly uncover $6,750 to sink into a      tax-sheltered HSA?       Clearly, this idea has been put forward by people who do      not depend on their health insurance for their very lives.      They pretend that this sort of thing will save ``our      system,'' but their proposal is like offering a patient an      Advil for an amputation--laughably inadequate at best; an      utter horror at worst.       What's more, efforts like the expansion of Medicaid under      the ACA have already saved us. Or many of us. Certainly me,      in any case. A Republican friend wrote me recently, venting      about the ``third-world'' coverage Medicaid provides. What he      had to say was ignorant and false. Medicaid isn't failing. To      the contrary, it has saved my life and the lives of many      others who have simply had the misfortune of falling ill. And      isn't that, after all, one of the primary functions of      government? To care for its citizens and return them to the      ranks of the healthy and productive?       We have no idea what the year ahead holds for us. It is      likely we will face health premiums of $24,000 or more for a      low-level plan. Our premiums will consume 30% of our income,      more than our mortgage. Despite MassHealth, we shelled out      nearly $15,000 for uncovered medical expenses in 2016, and we      are already on track to surpass that number this year. On top      of everything else, this is the year our daughter starts      college. I'm not the typical Medicaid patient that people      seem so fond of demonizing, nor am I some poster child of the      I am simply one of the countless individuals whose story      does not fit the narrative the Republicans are attempting to      feed us about the ACA and about what it means to be sick in      Medicaid is on the chopping block not because it is      failing, but because the people who benefit from it too often      fail to speak up on their own behalf. Their silence has      nothing do with a lack of will or words. They are simply too      busy struggling to survive.       Medicaid benefits our poorest, yet it also assists those      slightly higher on the income ladder--people like me who      would vastly prefer to be thriving without it. Many more      people than you suspect have turned to it in a time of need.      They aren't merely characters in some musical or play. Trust      me, I know. They are your friends and neighbors. They are      families whose lives have been unended by illness. This is      what happened to my family. And, with a single diagnosis, it      could be your family too.  Thank you. Thank you for writing. This is why we are here to fight.  I also heard from Kaitlyn, from Cambridge, who said the ACA has allowed her to continue pursuing her postdoctoral research. She says:       I am postdoctoral fellow at MIT, and I have a pre-existing      condition. In 2012, during my second year of grad school, I      started having debilitating pain in my abdomen. The pain was      so bad I couldn't eat or sleep, and I lost 30 pounds over two      months. The pain was so bad I couldn't wait the full 3 months      to see a specialist, and I went to the ER and finally got a      diagnosis for an autoimmune disease and began treatment.       However, my condition was so advanced that a little over a      year later I needed an emergency surgery while I was visiting      family out of state. I spent six nights in the hospital and      rang up a bill in excess of $50,000. Luckily, I was 25 and      still on my parent's insurance. Additionally, I was doubly      insured by the student health insurance from the University      of California, for which I was automatically enrolled through      my graduate program. Other than a $200 deductible, my      hospital bill was paid in full.       Now that I have a chronic illness, having quality      healthcare and regular checkups is vital to staying healthy      and productive. My medication, Humira, costs $5,000 a month      out-of-pocket, which was more than double my grad school      stipend. With insurance, I only pay $25 a month. Though      surgery helped me tame the inflation in my intestines, my      disease began to express itself as arthritis in my joints.      The pain was so bad that one Christmas I canceled my trip      home to see my family and spent the whole time alone on my      couch. I had a bad reaction to some of the medications and      became so severely anemic that I needed a blood transfusion.      Additionally, one of the medications I take causes severe      birth defects. So I needed an IUD to prevent pregnancy.       Easily, all these conditions could become overwhelmingly      expensive. But with my student health insurance through the      University of California, I could afford it. The premium was      $300 per month, part of which was covered by the university.      My medications cost $110 a month, and I had a yearly out-of-     pocket maximum of $2,000. While I didn't get my insurance      through the exchanges, the other conditions of the ACA which      determine the minimum quality of care made it possible for my      care to be affordable.       By having proper treatment and care, I can be a productive      member of society. I have received my PhD in Applied      Mathematics and my research contributes to the design of      medical devices that can be used for cancer screening. I am      able to mentor young girls and encourage them to study math      and science. And who knows--one of them may cure cancer one      day! Since I am no longer in pain and I am not in debt, I was      able to find a prestigious job after graduation. When a state      provides for the health of its people, they can thrive at      home and at work. It is not only the moral choice, but also a      good choice for the economy.  Kaitlyn, thanks for writing and thanks for being one of the big success stories under the Affordable Care This is what we are fighting for tonight.  I also heard from a young woman in Somerville named Here is what she wrote:       I've been dealing with severe mental health issues since I      was a kid. I am now 27. In that time, I have been through      numerous hospitalizations, residential treatment, day      treatment, intensive outpatient treatment, and outpatient      treatment.       When I was 18, I had to drop out of college and spent 3      months in residential treatment for my eating disorder. The      year prior, I spent 2 months in residential treatment and 6      months between day and intensive outpatient treatment, and I      had been in therapy for 4 years.       Due to Massachusetts law, I was still covered by my      parent's insurance, but the Massachusetts health care reform      didn't stop insurance companies from imposing lifetime      limits. At 18 years old, fighting for my life, I overheard my      parents discussing lifetime limits in regard to my health      care. I don't know how much all that treatment cost, or how      much of my lifetime limit I had consumed. For the next 7      years, I was in and out of treatment at various levels.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to extend my time by 10 minutes, if I might, to finish my stories.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson). Without objection, it is so ordered.

1096,topic-id,451,"Thank you.       In 2014, when I had my own health care, I had a bad      relapse. For the first time I was paying for my own      treatment. I had health insurance through my employer that      was really good, but even with that, for 1 month of      residential treatment, 1 month of day treatment, and 3 months      of intensive outpatient, plus therapy, a nutritionist, a      psychiatrist and medication--all crucial to my recovery--my      out-of-pocket health care costs reached almost $10,000.       These days, I am much more stable and have remained in      relatively good health, but all because of the continued      support I get from my therapist, psychiatrist, and doctor. I      can only imagine how much money has been spent and how close      I'd be to my lifetime limit if those were still in place. And      of course, all that adds up to being a ``pre-existing''      condition.       The simple fact is that I would most likely be dead today      were it were not for the protections provided by the ACA, and      if I lose those protections, if I have another relapse, I      will either end up dead or unemployed and mired in debt.

The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-09-pt1-PgS1017-2.txt,2182,HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT,2017.0,9.0,March
1078,topic-id,2521,"Mr.President, my distinguished friend, Senator Perdue, is actually right. There is something unprecedented going on around here with these nominations, but it is not the Democratic effort to try to make sure that those nominees get a fair hearing and some light on them before they get into office.  What is unprecedented around here with these nominees is, first of all, what a hash the Trump administration made of getting them ready. They were not ready to go. They were not prepared for the ethics reviews. They were dead in the water, and they have a lot of responsibility just in terms of the simple incompetence of getting a Cabinet ready to go.  That is not the Senate's fault. The Senate should not roll over in its advice and consent role because an executive branch can't prepare nominees. Then you get behind the incompetence of the executive branch in preparing nominees and you start looking at the nominees.  What else is unprecedented about them is the huge array of conflicts of interest they bring. We have never seen anything like this. We call it the ``swamp cabinet'' because it is, in fact, swampy with conflicts of interest. Many of these candidates have such massive financial complexities--because it is billionaire after billionaire after billionaire--that they have had to do all sorts of business contortions to try to get ready for their appointment.  That also is not our fault. That actually makes our responsibility greater so we can do our constitutional job in the Senate, as providing advice and consent, to look at potential conflicts of interest. It is part of why we have advice and consent, so we can screen for that. When we are not getting disclosure, we can't even do that.  There are still disclosure gaps for a lot of these nominees. The controversy and special interest connections of some of them are, frankly, appalling. So there are, indeed, nominees whom we would love to stop. If we could stop them, we would do it because we think they are going to do damage to the American people; damage to Medicare, which seniors rely on; damage to Medicaid, which so many sick kids rely on; damage to clean air, which I think everybody tends to rely on if they breathe; damage to clean water, which fishermen and sailors and people count on across the country. It is not a question here of doing the people's business, it is a question of trying to prevent these people from giving the people business because this looks like the special interest Cabinet of all time. If you go down one by one through the civilian Cabinet, you can more or less pick who the most influenced special interest is, the one who is most harmful to the American people in that particular area, and bingo, there is your nominee. So we should not slow down the advice and consent process just for the sake of slowing down the advice and consent process, but we should slow down the advice and consent process when we are not getting the basic information necessary to do our jobs, and we should slow down the advice and consent process when we are handing over agencies of government to big special interests. Those are two very good reasons to have the Senate's noble tradition of advice and consent followed scrupulously.  As to the nominee for HHS, Price, he is right in that list. He has conflicts of interest. He has real harm that he proposes to the American public.  I think Medicare is one of the great things the United States has done. It is one of our signal achievements. It has lifted seniors out of poverty in a way that very few other countries can match and that the United States had never seen before we did It is probably the most efficient health care delivery system in the United States of America, and our seniors count on it and love it.  That is not good enough for the good Price, though. He wants to voucherize What do you do if you are a Medicare patient who is elderly and infirm? How do you go shopping for health insurance? I can remember when I was quite capable as a fit lawyer, and I was given the H.forms by the U.attorney's office to make my choice. It is a complicated mess. And you expect some woman who may be in a hospital bed to sort through that? Great job giving her a voucher. It is just so unfair and so wrong.  Children across Rhode Island depend on If you are a family and you have a child with a significant illness, you are very likely to have that support for that child come through the Medicaid This is a man who wants to block-grant Medicare and projects trillion-dollar cuts--trillion-dollar cuts? Who is going to make up the trillion dollars if we are not taking care of these kids? Is it going to go back to the families or the care just isn't going to be there for the Medicaid children? That is just wrong.  These are ideological candidates who want ideological victories that will hurt real people like Henry, from A woman named Lisa wrote to me. She is a teacher and lifelong resident of Warwick, She has a son, Henry was just born last year, and before he was even 1 month old, Henry was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.  Cystic fibrosis, as I am sure we all know, is a genetic disorder. It affects more than 30,000 people in the United States, and it is one of the crueler diseases on the face of the planet. As cystic fibrosis progresses, it can cause infections, it causes difficulty breathing, and eventually it renders the child unable to breathe and respiratory failure results. There have been important advances and treatment for this disease, but there is no cure.  So Henry needs regular tests and treatment. He will need them for the rest of his life as doctors fight to extend his life as long as they can in hopes that a cure will arise. His parents are extremely grateful for the wonderful work of our doctors at Hasbro Children's Hospital who take care of But Lisa and her husband are also worried about their health insurance, and Henry's, because[[Page S1022]]Henry has a preexisting condition. If Secretary Price were to have his way, the Affordable Care Act would be repealed, and without it there would be no protection for people like Henry--a child like Henry with a preexisting condition. Either he would face outrageous health care premiums or be denied coverage altogether. Since then, having to face the scrutiny of confirmation, he has said: Oh, no, that part we are going to try to save. But when you go through the parts that my Republican friends are going to try to save, you end up with pretty much the whole bill. If you are going to try to save every part of the bill, why bother repealing it? Why not make it better and move on?  How irresponsible it was to say, ``Repeal,'' when all these points were in it. When repeal was the great mantra, nobody said: ``Oh, but not that.'' ``Oh, but let's protect the seniors from the doughnut hole.'' No, it was just ``Repeal Repeal ObamaCare.'' Frankly, chanting ``Repeal ObamaCare'' I think is about as disqualifying to lead Medicare and Medicaid as chanting ``Lock her up'' would be to be Attorney General of the United  Catherine is a constituent of mine who lives in She is a breast cancer survivor. She owns a small family business. Her family had health insurance before the Affordable Care Act, but their insurance company decided that their little company had too few employees to qualify as a small business, and it dropped them from their coverage. So it was thanks to the Affordable Care Act that Catherine and her husband could get affordable and quality health insurance through our exchange that we call With this coverage, they go on about their business. They don't have to worry about whether their insurance company is going to change the rules and pitch them out again. Catherine and her husband tell me they don't understand how anyone could say they support small business and want to repeal the Affordable Care  Timothy wrote to me. He is a freelance writer in Rumford, He has affordable health care for the first time in his life. There is no big company to help you if you are a freelance writer; you are on your own. But the Affordable Care Act has been there for He has multiple chronic health conditions that require medication. Before he had coverage under the Affordable Care Act, Timothy was hospitalized for a heart problem. He couldn't afford the resulting hospital bills. Without health insurance, he couldn't pay for his prescriptions. Having health insurance, Timothy told me, has changed his life. He feels dignity, he feels peace, he feels assurance, and a lot of that is simply the reassurance that you can afford the medications you need to stay healthy. His chances of having to be hospitalized in the future are down. If the ACA is repealed, Timothy may be forced to forgo care that he needs, endangering his health, and potentially, by the way, costing the system a lot more.  Martha, who lives in Cranston, RI, knows well the dangers of being uninsured. Before the Affordable Care Act, Martha went several years without health insurance, gambling that she could get away with it because she couldn't afford it. A gall bladder infection required emergency surgery. She was taken to the hospital, the surgery was performed. It went well, but she was left with a $60,000 hospital bill. Unable to pay the bill, she declared bankruptcy.  Now she can have coverage, and by the way, when the hospital has to do the surgery, it gets paid with her insurance. That is why the American Hospital Association and the Hospital Association of Rhode Island are saying: Don't repeal That would be reckless.  Martha and her husband and her 24-year-old son have all been able to purchase insurance through the Rhode Island exchange. By the way, our exchange is doing great. People may complain about exchanges in other We are seeing costs steady; we are seeing costs going down. One of our major insurers, Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, is advertising on Our rates are going down, and their coverage is fine, and Rhode Island is a success story under the Affordable Care The $283 per month that Martha and her family now pay in total for insurance certainly beats the $500 a month that she and her husband each faced for individual coverage before the  Paula wrote to me from Cranston about how the Affordable Care Act has helped her and her husband bridge the gap until they get to the safe haven, finally, of Paula is 63 years old. She works part time. Her husband who is 64 years old and retired has health insurance through our exchange, Paula has beaten breast cancer once, but she is at high risk of recurrence.  If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, Paula would be at risk to lose her health insurance and the ability to have tests that would help her catch a recurrence of cancer in time. Paula and her husband worked hard and saved well, but as Martha's story shows, one illness can wipe you out if you don't have health insurance, and they are so content and comforted knowing they have a good health insurance plan through our exchange.  Travis is a social worker in He provides psychotherapy and counseling to recovering addicts who are receiving medication and assisted treatment. This is a particularly touching point in Rhode Island because we lost 239 Rhode Islanders to opioid-related overdoses last year. That is 239 fatalities in Rhode Island last year.  The Affordable Care Act, Travis believes, is the reason that many of his patients are actually able to get care and stay away from the risk of overdose. He wrote of his patients, many of them never accessed methadone treatment prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, let alone sought treatment for their psychiatric conditions which may underlie the substance abuse disorders. By the way, a recent report came out that said if you repeal the Affordable Care Act and its coverage requirements for mental health and substance abuse, you pull about $5.5 billion worth of coverage out from American families. Is that really what this Congress wants to be responsible for doing? I certainly hope not, not after all the fine statements we heard about the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the funding for it.  Let me make one last point because I see the Senator from Michigan here and I know she wants to add her thoughts. You can talk about the personal stories, and it shows how poignant and important having the Affordable Care Act around is in the lives of real actual people, but we also have to deal with budget issues in Washington, and I just want to show this chart.  This chart shows the spending projections for Federal health care spending. The red line on the top was the projection in 2010 done by the CBO, the Congressional Budget In 2010, they said: Here is how we think our spending is going to be in Federal health care. They predicted that. Then they came back and they did another prediction in 2017.  One thing that happened is that after the passage of the Affordable Care Act back here, we came in well below predicted expense for Federal health care. We saved a lot of money in that period. Then when they rebooted the prediction in 2017, they started off actual and they did a new prediction right here. The difference in this 10-year period in Federal health care costs between what they expected to have happen in that 10-year period before the Affordable Care Act came along and what experience and the new projections show the savings are since the Affordable Care Act are $3.3 trillion--$3.3 trillion--and we have this person who wants to be the Secretary who wants to cut the program? We are saving money in the program under this. It doesn't make any sense fiscally, and it is cruel to the individuals and families who have found comfort and peace and security from the Affordable Care  So I will leave us with that, but if we are going to be responsible about doing something about our outyear health care costs, find me something else that shows $3.3 trillion in savings during the period of 2017 to 2027, over 10 years. For these costs, we sometimes look out 30 years, and that number would grow even greater. We have saved trillions of dollars as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and CBO shows it.  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.[[Page S1023]]  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Young).

1044,topic-id,271,"Mr.Chair, I rise today not only in strong support of the[[Page H262]]HALOS Act but for the entrepreneurs everywhere in this country.  The facts are simple. Angel investors provide vital, often necessary capital for startup companies. Unfortunately, after the passage of the JOBS Act, the SEC made this more difficult, placing unnecessary burdens on companies who are just starting out.  Mr.Speaker, the positive impact these startups often have on a community are staggering. In the City of Austin, which I am proud to represent, startup companies provide more than just new technologies. They provide jobs, they generate taxes, and they give back to their local community. In 2015 alone, tech companies in Austin were able to raise almost a billion dollars in new capital. With our economy still on the mend from the financial collapse in 2007, it is time to give businesses, both large and small, the resources they need to compete in an often competitive environment.  H.79 rightly amends the SEC Act of 1933 to formally define an angel investor group and exempts them from having to comply with burdensome, third-party verification rules. The HALOS Act provides essential protection for trade associations that often facilitate such meetings between investors and fund managers, continuing to cultivate small business capital formation relationships. This change may be small, but the impact will be great.  Mr.Speaker, I will end my remarks by saying this: If the 115th Congress is serious about jobs, serious about turning our economy around, and serious about real change, passing bills like the HALOS Act will be paramount to our success.  I urge all Members to support Chairman Chabot's bill.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH259-2.txt,2165,HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT,2017.0,10.0,February
1103,topic-id,1549,"Mr.President, before Senator King leaves the floor, let me just say, as one who ran the legal services for the elderly program in Oregon, that the Senator makes all of us in legal services proud tonight. Senator King has really put a face on what is at stake here in the way he has focused on the opioid scourge that is hammering areas from coast to coast. Rural health care--without rural health care, we can't have rural life. It is just that simple. Certainly when we get to the closing here in perhaps an hour and a half or so, we are going to get to the bottom line, as the Senator did. I think these changes take America back to the day where health care was for the healthy and wealthy.  So I thank the Senator for his passion and his commitment to his citizens, but also to the people of this country. Anybody in legal services tonight will be very proud, as I am, because what it is all about is standing up for people, and the Senator has said it very well.  Mr.President, we will be having our closing remarks here in perhaps an hour and a half or thereabouts. We have several Members of the Senate who are on their way for their remarks, and several Members of the Senate have discussed various elements of the serious and unanswered ethics questions surrounding Congressman Price's nomination. It is my view that these are issues that have set off loud ethical alarm bells.  I want to take a little bit more time to lay out the full story here.  The stock trades Congressman Price made while working on health care policy do, in fact, raise serious ethical and legal questions. None of Congressman Price's stock trades raise more questions than the hundreds of thousands of shares he bought in the obscure Australian biotech company known as His stock in this company is by far his largest of holdings, both in terms of the hundreds of thousands of shares he owns and the value of those shares, and that exceeds a quarter of a million dollars.  Congressman Price told the Finance Committee that he did not get a special deal. He told the Health, Education, Labor Committee that he did not get a special deal. But the fact is, Congressman Price paid bargain-basement prices for Innate stock in a private sale last The private stock sale was limited to a small group of well-connected American investors.  Congressman Price's participation has been described as a ``sweetheart deal'' by Kaiser Health News and a ``privileged, discounted offer'' by the Wall Street  As I said during his nomination hearing, Congressman Price's participation in the private stock sale showed bad judgment at best. At worst, it raised serious questions about whether he violated the STOCK Act or other security laws. I will take a minute to read section 3 of the STOCK It says: ``Members of Congress . . . may not use nonpublic information derived from such person's position . . . or gained from the performance of such person's official responsibilities as a means for making a private profit.''  It is well known that Congressman Price learned about Innate from a House colleague, Congressman Chris Collins of New Collins is not just a casual reader of the Australian business pages; he is actually a member of the company's board and its largest shareholder.  This raises additional questions: Did Congressman Price have access to nonpublic information about Innate or its private stock because of his position as a Member of Congress? Did he get special access to the discounted private sale because of his position? Does he stand to profit because of the information or access he may have received?[[Page S1056]]Finally, did Congressman Price tell the Finance Committee the truth about how he learned about the private stock sales and the ability of typical investors to participate?  Congressman Price would have us believe that he decided to make these investments based on his own research into the company. That is what he told the Finance  Let me quote from the Wall Street Journal's article published January 30:       Mr.Price wasn't in line to buy shares in the last private      placement because he hadn't previously participated in      private fundraising rounds. . . . Mr.Price first invested in      the company a year ago, buying shares through the open market      on the Australian exchange. He learned about the company from      Mr.Collins, who holds a 17 percent stake in it. Mr.Collins      said Mr.Price is ``one of my friends'' and that he sits      ``next to him'' on the House floor. . . . Mr.Price got it on      the discounted sale after Mr.Collins filled him in on the      company's drug trial, according to Mr. The fact is, you don't just get in on a private stock offering by accident. As the Wall Street Journal explained, Congressman Price didn't originally even meet the criteria for participating in the 2016 private offering because he hadn't participated in any previous offerings. Yet he was able to buy over 400,000 shares of stock with Congressman Collins' help.  My view and the view of my Democratic colleagues is that Congressman Price failed to come clean with the Senate Finance Committee on the details of the special discounted deal. He has assured the committee he followed the law, but straightforward questions have been met with dodging, weaving, and obfuscation. Details of his purchase continue to emerge, and the public's understanding of his involvement continues to evolve.  Meanwhile, as scrutiny of the deal continues to mount, Innate's top executives are defending Congressman Price at the behest of his colleague Congressman Collins, who sits on the company's board of directors.  After the Wall Street Journal story was published, the company and Congressman Price went into spin control. The public knows this only because Congressman Collins made a mistake that everybody who uses email for work has seen made at least once: He mistakenly hit ``reply all'' when responding to an email from the company's CEO, Simon Instead of a private note to Mr.Wilkinson, the note wound up going to a CNN reporter covering the story.  In the email, Congressman Collins, the company's top shareholder, said the Wall Street Journal was ``yellow journalism,'' and he thanked Innate's chief executive, Mr.Wilkinson, for defending Congressman Price and the company. According to CNN, Congressman Collins acknowledged the email to be authentic.  The Finance Committee's own experience with Innate only adds to the sense that there is a coverup as Republicans seek to race Congressman Price across the confirmation finish line.  The day after the Wall Street Journal story ran, I wrote my own letter to Innate's CEO, Mr.I asked the company to respond to the article and the inconsistencies in Mr.Price's explanations and for documentation of details of the private stock sales. The company refused to answer my letter.  This looks to me like a coverup, and it ought to shake this body's confidence in Congressman Price's nomination. This situation, in my view, demands that further questions be asked and answered. Instead of taking time to explore these issues, Republicans took the unprecedented step of suspending the Finance Committee's rules to rush this nomination to the floor before any more questions could be asked, let alone answered.  In years past, as with the nominations of Senator Daschle, Secretary Geithner, and Ambassador Kirk, the Finance Committee left no stone unturned in the vetting process. Not this time. The majority party, in my view, is on its way to an ethical double standard to cut off the vetting process. That leaves me with a question for Congressman Price and my Republican colleagues in the Senate: What is there to hide?  Mr.President, before I continue, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter that I sent to Simon Wilkinson, chief executive of Innate, on January 31, 2017.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             United States Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2017.     Mr.Simon Wilkinson,     Chief Executive Officer,     Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited,     Sydney,       Dear Mr.Wilkinson: As part of the U.Senate's      constitutional duty to confirm presidential appointments, I      have been reviewing the record of U.Representative Thomas      Edmunds Price, who has been nominated to be the Secretary of      the U.Department of Health and Human       To that end, I am writing to you seeking prompt assistance      in providing information and documents related to Congressman      Price's investment in Please provide the requested      information and documents:       1. The New York Times reported that ``Mr.Wilkinson and      Michael Quinn, Innate's chairman, said they had never heard      of many of the company's more prominent investors, and said      they first learned that Mr.Price had invested in the company      from an article in The Wall Street Journal [published online      December 22, 2016], which first reported his investment.''

In addition, the Wall      Street Journal reported that ``Mr.Collins said he told ",CREC-2017-02-09-pt1-PgS1017-2.txt,1247,SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH FAIRNESS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,9.0,March
1104,topic-id,1247,"I would also refer my colleagues to the following news articles: ``Trump's HHS Nominee Got A Sweetheart Deal from A Foreign Biotech Firm,'' a story published by Kaiser Health News on January 13, 2017; ``Representative Tom Price Got Privileged, Discounted Offer on Biomedical Stock, Company Says,'' a story published by the Wall Street Journal on January 30, 2017; and ``In accidental `reply all' to reporter, Collins thanks CEO for defending HHS nominee,'' a story published by CNN on January 31, 2017.  Mr.President, I wish to now discuss what is known about the facts and timing of Congressman Price's investment in This is a timeline that is based on public documents, press reports, and information the nominee provided the Finance  If you have never heard of Innate until the last few weeks, you would be forgiven. The New York Times described it as a ``tiny pharmaceutical company from Australia that has no approved drugs and no backing from flashy venture capital firms.'' Innate has fewer than a dozen full-time employees. The company's stock was first listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2013, and until recently its market capitalization was well below $100 million. Innate has never generated revenue from drug sales. It has repeatedly teetered on the brink of running out of cash. It has just 2,500 shareholders. By way of comparison, a major American pharmaceutical company could have hundreds of thousands of shareholders.  Innate is planning to submit an investigational drug application to the Food and Drug Administration, and its ultimate goal is to one day sell itself to a large pharmaceutical manufacturer, which would take its early-stage experimental therapy to market.  What I am describing is, this company is the poster child for obscure companies. It is so small and so obscure, it doesn't even have a Wikipedia page. So the question is, How did Congressman Price come to learn about this company, and how did he decide to make it the single largest investment in his sprawling portfolio of health care stocks? The answer is, the Congressman learned about Innate in 2014 during a conversation with his colleague, Congressman Collins of New As I indicated, Congressman Collins sits on Innate's board of directors. Congressman Collins is also the company's largest shareholder, holding 38 million shares. Congressman Collins' adult children, his chief of staff, and many of his political backers are also heavily invested in the company. I am going to touch on those issues in a few minutes.  According to disclosures with the House Ethics Committee, Congressman Price bought some 61,000 shares of Innate stock in 3 separate purchases during January of 2015. At the time, the stock was trading at roughly 10 cents a share. Congressman Price testified to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that he directed his broker to make the January 2015 purchases.  Fast-forward to August 2016. Congressman Price bought another 400,000 shares of Innate as part of a private stock sale for U.investors. When the private sale took place, Innate's shares were trading on the Australian Stock Exchange for the equivalent of 31 American cents. Participants in the private sale got the shares at a deep discount.  In written testimony to the Finance Committee, Congressman Price said he paid 84,000 American dollars to buy the 400,000 shares. He bought 250,000 of those shares for 18 American cents per share in one private stock placement. He bought another 150,000 shares for 26 American cents each in a second private stock placement. Congressman Price's House Ethics Committee disclosures showed that he acquired the stock on August 31. On that day, Innate's stock was trading for the U.equivalent of 31 cents a share on the Australian Stock In my book, that is a special deal.  The bottom line is that Congressman Price bought these shares for $40,000 less than an average investor would have paid to buy the same amount of stock off the open market. That is nearly 33 percent off the price on the Australian Stock Exchange at the time. Since that time, Innate's stock has more than doubled. These facts are not in dispute.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Congressman Price's written testimony in response to my questions for the record as part of his nomination hearings.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        Questions for the Record``the honorable thomas e. price nomination hearing for hhs secretary''                      hearing date: january 24, 2017         questions for the record from ranking member ron wyden                  Innate Immunotherapeutics purchases       5. The nominee owns 461,238 shares of Innate      Immunotherapeutics (``Innate''), a small Australian      biopharmaceutical firm developing a multiple sclerosis      therapy. The nominee acquired the stock in four separate      purchases on January 8, 9 and 23 of 2015 (``2015 tranche''),      and in a pair of private stock placements on August 31, 2016      (``2016 tranche''). Regarding Innate:       a. Question: Please describe how and when the nominee first      learned about       Answer: I previously answered this question for the I      learned about Innate during the course of a conversation in      the fall of 2014 with Representative Chris Collins regarding      their respective personal backgrounds. I cannot recall the      specific date of that conversation. During that exchange,      Representative Collins told me that he sat on a number of      public company boards including Innate, which was developing      a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS),       b.

Question: Please describe any communication between the      nominee and Congressman Collins regarding Innate      Immunotherapy, including the date, subject, place and form.       Answer: I previously answered this question for the       I had a conversation with Representative Collins in the      fall of 2014 that brought Innate, as a company, to my      attention. The nature of that conversation did not, however,      influence my decision to invest in the company in either 2015      or 2016.       I believe I had subsequent general communications with      Representative Collins regarding I do not have a      specific recollection of when those conversations occurred or      their substance. Any such communications did not impact my      investment decisions, however, because my purchases of Innate      stock were based solely on my own research.       d.

What remains unresolved are major inconsistencies between Congressman Price's testimony to the Finance Committee, statements by Congressman Collins, and statements by Innate's CEO Simon Wilkinson published last week in the Wall Street  Simply put, Innate's chief executive and Congressman Collins, the company's top shareholder, provided one version of events to one of the world's most respected newspapers. Congressman Price provided a different version of events to the Finance Committee and the Health committee. These inconsistencies are among the reasons that Democrats boycotted last week's Finance Committee markup. The Senate has an obligation to know the truth about these transactions in order to protect the integrity of this body and its constitutional duty to consider executive branch nominees.  Now, with respect to exclusivity of the sale, Congressman Price told the Finance Committee that the August sale was available to all Innate shareholders, which contradicts what Innate's management told the Wall Street Congressman Price was definitive in his response to my question during the hearing.  Reading back the transcript, I said: ``Well, you purchased stock in an Australian company through private offerings at discounts not available to the public.''  Here is Congressman Price's response: ``Well, if I may, those--they were available to every single individual that was an investor at the time.''  That is not what Innate executives told the Wall Street Here is an extended passage from the Wall Street Journal:       Tom Price got a privileged offer to buy a biomedical      stock at a discount, the company's officials said, contrary      to his congressional testimony this month. . . .

1106,topic-id,1004,"I also refer my colleagues to the following documents: an announcement by Innate on June 10, 2016, entitled ``Private Placements and[[Page S1061]]Rights Issue to Raise Additional Working Capital,'' and the Public Financial Disclosure Report signed by Congressman Price on December 15, 2016, that was filed with the Office of Government  I want to take a minute to return to the Innate company itself. I noted earlier that the company has put on a full court press to defend Congressman Price in recent weeks, as details of his special deal have come to light.  I am going to describe why that might be. Innate's executives have sought to portray the company as being a small firm from Down Under that has been inadvertently caught in political crossfire on the other side of the world. But the fact is that Innate has longstanding connections to Congressman Collins and his inner circle, a circle that includes Congressman As the Australian City Newspaper wrote this week, ``Mr.Collins, his children and his `intimate political allies' and donors controlled at least 27.25 percent'' of Innate's voting shares.  Then there is the baffling assertion mailed by Mr.Wilkinson, the CEO, that he only recently learned of Congressman Price's existence through news articles. This is a stretch to believe and flies in the face of Congressman Price's own testimony.  On January 13, the New York Times reported:       Mr.Wilkinson and Michael Quinn, Innate's chairman, said      they had never heard of many of the company's more prominent      investors, and said they first learned that Mr.Price had      invested in the company from an article in the Wall Street      Journal, which first reported his investment.  On February 5, Mr.Wilkinson, the CEO of Innate, told the Buffalo News, ``I think the first time I heard that a gentleman named Tom Price had invested was after the U.media started reporting it.''  But Congressman Price was quite clear that he had communicated with In written testimony, responding to questions for the record, he said: I also communicated with Simon Wilkinson of Innate regarding my interest in participating in the 2016 private placement of company stock. According to Innate's Web site, Mr.Wilkinson is currently the managing director and CEO of the company.  Congressman Price's name was also listed twice in the documents of the company, which reported the private stock sale participants to the Australian stock exchange last summer. Congressman Price also appeared to have bought nearly 5 percent of the discounted shares made available in the private stock sale. Given all that, it seems difficult to believe Mr.Wilkinson's story that he had no idea who Congressman Price was.  Finally, The Australian, the Sydney paper I just mentioned, reported on Monday that Innate and Congressman Collins are facing questions about possible violations of Australia corporation law with regard to his holdings in the company. So why does this matter? It matters because a nominee to be a Cabinet Secretary, Congressman Price, was brought into this web of questionable stock transactions and obfuscations about just how special the special deal he really got was by a company insider, his friend, Congressman  As I get ready to close, I refer my colleagues to the following articles and documents: ``Congressman Collins under fire for `suspicious' stock trades,'' published in the Buffalo News on January 17 of this year; ``Collins shared biotech stock news with big Buffalo names,'' again from the Buffalo News on January 19; ``Collins' controversial stock venture could be boom or bust,'' from the Buffalo News on February 5 of this year; the Notice of Innate's 2016 Annual Meeting and Explanatory Statement filed on July 29 of 2016; documents filed by Innate on September 12, 2016, and September 26, 2016, reporting results of the 2016 private stock placement.  As we close, I want to return to section 3 of the STOCK It says:       Members of Congress . . . may not use nonpublic information      derived from such person's position . . . or gained from the      performance of such person's official responsibilities as a      means for making a private profit.  So did Congressman Price have access to nonpublic information about Innate or its private stock sale because of his position as a Member of Congress? I believe the answer is yes.  Did he get special access to the discounted private sale because of his position? I believe the answer is yes.  Does he stand to profit because of the information or access he may have received? I believe the answer is yes.  Finally, did Congressman Price tell the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee the truth about how he learned about the private stock sale and the ability of average investors to participate? Congressman Price told the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee that the special stock deal he got in on was open to everyone.  According to the Wall Street Journal and company documents, that is not true. The deal he got was clearly different than what was offered to everyday investors. According to the Journal, his previous purchase of Innate stock did not qualify him to participate in the private placement without being a specially invited friends and family guest. This arrangement allowed Congressman Price to buy more shares than other investors were allowed to buy.  Congressman Price told the Finance Committee that his conversations with Congressman Collins, again, a director of the company, its largest shareholder, had no influence on his investment decisions. According to the Journal, this is not true. The Journal report made clear that Congressman Collins told him about the upcoming drug trial, alerted him to the private stock sale, and arranged to ensure he could participate.  Now the majority party has shut down the vetting process, allowing Congressman Price's nomination to reach the floor before all the facts have come into view. I believe the Senate can do better. It needs to do better. The American people are owed better.  I thank my colleagues, particularly Senator Reed, for his patience and his courtesy.  I yield the floor.

1111,topic-id,3522,"Mr.President, the debate on Congressman Price's nomination, in my view, is a referendum on the future of health care in  On this side of the aisle, we think it is worth spending 30 hours talking about a subject this important to our people. My view is that this is about whether the United States is going to go back to the dark days when health care worked only for the healthy and the wealthy.  Based on the public record, Medicare is a program Congressman Price does not believe in, and it offers a guarantee of services he doesn't believe seniors should have.  On the Affordable Care Act, he is the architect of repeal and run. He wrote the bill himself. He proposed weakening protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. He would shred the health care safety net--Medicaid--for the least fortunate among us. He would take away health care choices for women, particularly the opportunity to go to the physician that they trust.  As we wrap up and get ready to vote, think about the common thread among these proposals: They take away coverage from our people, make health care coverage more expensive for millions of people, or both. That is what Congressman Price stands for when it comes to health care. Every Senator who casts a vote for Congressman Price has to stand by that agenda.  Beyond what this means for the future of American health care policy, there is the lingering spectre, as I have discussed tonight in detail, of serious legal and ethical issues. Congressman Price got special access to a special deal on stock in an Australian biomedical company. He claimed multiple times before Senate committees that the deal he got on discounted company stock was open to all shareholders. All the evidence--all the evidence--says that this is untrue.  First, he had to go through the back door to get access to the discounted price. He got a special friends-and-family invite from his colleague in the House, Congressman Chris Collins, the company's top shareholder and a member of its board.  Second, rules that apply to other investors didn't apply to Congressman Other shareholders were bound by a limit. They were able to buy one discounted share for every nine they already owned. That would have allowed Congressman Price to buy just 7,000 discounted shares. He bought 400,000 discounted shares. In my view, he can't get around that. That is the definition of a special stock deal.  The Congressman introduced legislation that would have lowered the tax bills of three major pharmaceutical companies in which he owns stock. He invested $15,000 in a medical equipment company and then introduced legislation to increase the amount Medicare pays for that type of equipment. Parts of his bill went on to become law. He bought thousands of dollars' worth of stock in a company called Zimmer Biomet less than a week before introducing legislation that had the potential to drive up the value of those shares. Now he has argued that he didn't purchase the stocks; his broker did. But at the very least, he would have known about those deals within days of the purchase when he filed the periodic transaction reports in the Under his brokerage agreement, he could have quickly resold the stock, but he did not. Furthermore, he didn't consult with the Ethics Committee regarding any of the trades I have spoken about as directed by the House Ethics  As I wrap up, I want to put a human face on why so many Senators on this side of the aisle have come to the Senate floor to speak so passionately about their grave concerns with this nomination. Nothing sums up our concerns more clearly than a line from an op-ed Congressman Price wrote in 2009 that discusses His quote speaks volumes about his perspective on this program.  It is a lifeline. I first became acquainted with it back in the days when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers, ran the legal aid program for older people. I saw then that seniors were walking on an economic tightrope, balancing their food bill against their fuel bill, their fuel bill against the rent bill. They saw Medicare as one of the great achievements in American policymaking.  Here is what the Congressman wrote--his words, not mine: ``Nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.'' When I read that, I was reflecting on my Gray Panther days, and I think a lot of other Senators go back working with community organizations. We just heard a wonderful presentation from Senator King, who was also a legal services advocate.  Before Medicare, before this program that Congressman Price thinks is such a negative intrusion into medicine, a lot of older people were warehoused in poor farms. I am absolutely certain that Congressman Price doesn't want to go back to those days, but when he speaks about the involvement of Medicare in American health care as though a plague has descended on the land, we just have to question his commitment to a program that has become a lifeline to millions of older people.  The fact is, Medicare has always been a promise. That is what we said back in the early days with the senior citizens. Medicare was a promise. It was a promise of guaranteed benefits. Again, based on the public record, Medicare is a program Congressman Price doesn't believe in, and it offers a guarantee of services he doesn't think seniors ought to have.  He has said he wants to voucherize the program within the first 6 to 8 months of the administration. What we are talking about when you want to do that is you are breaking the promise of You are breaking the promise of guaranteed benefits, and you are going to sort of hand people a piece of paper and say here is your voucher, I[[Page S1066]]hope it works for you. If your medical expenses are greater than your vouchers, that is the way it goes, tough luck.  The price budget cut Medicare by nearly $1 million. By the way, that is exactly the opposite of the Trump pledge, not to cut Medicare that the American people heard on the campaign trail. There is a big gap between what President Trump said about Medicare and the bills and legislative efforts of Congressman Price in the other body--big gap. That is why it sure looks to me like the promise of Medicare is one that Congressman Price would break.  By the way, we all ought to understand that if confirmed, Congressman Price would be the captain of the Trump health care team. What he says matters, and what he offered--legislatively, his positions and his votes. He voted again and again to repeal the Affordable Care  It really matters what his past record is. If past is prologue, it is certainly relevant. It really matters. He was the architect of what amounted to repeal and run. He wrote legislation creating loopholes in the protection for those with preexisting conditions, and the big beneficiary there was clearly the major insurance companies.  Women would find it much harder to make the health care choices they want and see the doctors they trust if the price proposals were lost. Medicaid pays 65 percent of the nursing home bill in And on this side of the aisle, we are going to fight Congressman Price's block grant proposals that are going to put seniors at risk.  I am going to close with this. I always hope I am wrong when I raise the prospects of real threats to the welfare of the American people because the reason public service was important to me was because of those first days with the Gray I never thought I would have that kind of wonderful opportunity; that I would have had this opportunity for public service. For me and so many on this side of the aisle--I see my colleagues who have been active in their communities--this has always been about the welfare of the American people. That is what it is about--all those faces we see when we are home, having community meetings and getting out with our people.  The public record in this case indicates that as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Congressman Price would, in fact, be an extraordinary threat to seniors on Medicare, vulnerable older people who need Medicaid for access to nursing homes, millions of kids for whom Medicaid is the key to a healthy future, and women across the country who have a right to see the doctors they trust.  I am going to oppose this nomination. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition.  Mr.President, I wish to take a few minutes to address Congressman Price's stock purchases. At best, this is behavior that cuts ethical corners. At worst it is dangerously close to outright insider trading. Congressman Price has a lot of questionable trading activity. He introduced legislation that would lower the tax bills of three major pharmaceutical companies he owned significant amounts of stock in. He invested $15,000 dollars in a medical equipment company then introduced legislation to increase the amount Medicare pays for that type of equipment. Parts of his bill went on to become law.  But let's look at one investment in particular, Congressman Price's investment in Zimmer Zimmer is a medical device company that specializes in joint replacements, including knee, hip, shoulder, and foot and ankle replacements.  Hip and knee replacements are high cost procedures, and they are two of the most common procedures performed on Medicare patients. According to CMS, more than 400,000 hip and knee replacement procedures were performed in 2014, costing more than $7 billion for the hospitalizations alone. Despite the high frequency of these surgeries, costs vary widely across geographic areas, and complications like infections or implant failures after surgery can be three times higher at some facilities.  In November 2015, in an attempt to incentivize higher quality procedures for Medicare recipients and control the cost of these replacements, CMS finalized a new pricing model slated to be implemented in April 2016. This new pricing model was a cost-bundling payment model; instead of Medicare paying for each individual service, Medicare reimburses hospitals with a single lump-sum payment, allowing hospitals to coordinate overall care for the patient.  These changes were designed to incentivize improved care for patients, lowering costs and improving quality. However, according to independent analysts, medical device companies, especially those who specialize in orthopedic implants, could face ``material headwinds'' from the new pricing model since hospitals facing reimbursement pressures are likely to pass some of that burden onto those device companies.  In September 2015, Congressman Price led an effort to send a letter from members of the House of Representatives to CMS challenging many of the features of the CMS proposal. A copy of the letter, dated September 21, 2015, is available on the Congressman's website.  This is where Zimmer Biomet comes in. Zimmer is a medical device manufactrurer with significant exposure to the new pricing model. According to analysts, over 60 percent of Zimmer's revenues come from hip and knee devices, and the CMS guidelines had the potential to significantly affect the company's profits.  On March 17, 2016, a few weeks before the CMS model was set to go into effect, Congressman Price bought thousands of dollars worth of Zimmer Biomet stock through his brokerage account. On March 23, 2016, less than a week later, Congressman Price introduced H.4848, the ``HIP Act,'' which would have delayed the implementation of CMS regulations for Medicare coverage of joint replacements.  Let's pause right here. In 2016, Congressman Price had a financial stake in one of the companies that stood to benefit most from the legislation he was promoting. Those basic facts are not in dispute. Congressman Price introduced legislation that had the potential to add to his personal fortune.  Now, various arguments have been made, by Congressman Price and others, to defend this activity. First is the argument that there wasn't much money at stake, just a few thousand dollars. But the truth is a few thousand dollars is a lot of money to a lot of An unexpected medical bill that size could have a serious effect on many Americans and the person in charge of our health care system should take that amount of money just as seriously.  Second, there is the argument that he didn't purchase the stock; his stockbroker purchased it. I am going to return to that issue in more detail in a moment, but one thing is clear. That is the fact that Congressman Price knew this stock had been purchased in his name, in his account, within a matter of days.  On April 15, 2016, Congressman Price filed what is called a Periodic Transaction Report which Members of Congress are required to do within 30 days of reportable stock purchase. Not only did Congressman Price file a report that he had purchased Zimmer Biomet along with dozens of other stocks, he initialed the entry for Zimmer Biomet in order to correct a mistake on the document; a correction making it clear that the Zimmer Biomet transaction was a stock purchase.  There is also the question of whether this activity violated House Ethics rules. Congressman Price also said, in answer to written questions, that ``no conflict existed and no consultation was necessary.'' He also said, ``Throughout my time as a Member of the [House], I have abided by and adhered to all ethics and conflict of interest rules applicable to me.''  He gave the same answer regarding three other bills that appear to conflict with investments he held: H.4185, the Protecting Access through Competitive-pricing Transition Act of 2015, the PACT Act; H.5400, a bill pertaining to tax rates in Puerto Rico, which would have likely impacted drug manufacturers he owned Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Amgen; H.5210, the Patient Access to Durable Medical Equipment (PADME) Act of 2016.  Let's go through that in some detail.  It is true that the House Ethics rules, like the Senate Ethics rules, allow a[[Page S1067]]member to cast a vote on a matter relating to a company in which he or she owns stock. However, that standard only applies to casting votes. If you do more, and become an active advocate of a bill that could benefit a company that you own stock in, a different standard applies.  On page 237 of the House Ethics Manual, it says that before undertaking active advocacy of legislation that will benefit a company in which a member owns stock, such as before introducing a bill, ``the Member should first contact the [Ethics] Committee for guidance.''  The Ethics Manual is crystal clear. If you go beyond voting, and you are actively pushing a bill that would benefit a company in which you own stock, you should consult with the Ethics  Congressman Price did not consult with the Ethics Committee regarding any of these trades.  In a written question, I asked Congressman Price about this. I asked whether, in light of the House Ethics Manual's recommendation, he had consulted with the Ethics Committee regarding his purchase of Zimmer Biomet and other stocks. He did not answer the question. Instead, he resorted to the same talking point--that the Zimmer Biomet stock was purchased by his broker and that there was not need to consult because there was no conflict.  By my reading, this interpretation is flat wrong. Under the House Manual, he should have consulted with the Ethics  To be clear, the Ethics Committee might have concluded that it was a relatively small purchase, and that Congressman Price's advocacy was consistent with his longstanding position, and therefore that it was fine for him to go ahead and purchase the stock and then introduce the bill. On the other hand, the Ethics Committee might have reached a very different conclusion. It might have advised him to refrain from purchasing the stock.  The public will never know, because he didn't ask. Despite the clear guidance in the House Ethics Manual, he didn't even ask. And now the majority party is carrying his nomination toward the finish line.  Apart from conforming with House Ethics rules, there is also the question of whether Congressman Price's activity violated insider trading laws. Lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have a duty of public trust. The STOCK Act, which Congressman Price and I both voted for in 2012, and longstanding SEC rules denote that Members of Congress have a fiduciary duty to the American people. What that means is that we will use the public power we've been granted to benefit the interests of all The SEC's Rule 10b5, in particular, prohibits the purchase or sale of stock on the basis of material nonpublic information.  As a threshold matter, Congressman Price claims that insider trading laws don't apply to him because the Zimmer Biomet stock was purchased by his broker without his knowledge. But as I've discussed at length, this argument is a red herring because Congressman Price did have knowledge of these trades. He submitted signed records of the trades shortly after they were made. Furthermore, the laws related to insider trading give clear guidance on how to trade through a broker without violating insider trading laws. And just as with the House Ethics rules, when faced with clear guidance on how to manage conflicts of interest, Congressman Price chose not to follow it.  Whether those stocks were purchased directly or through a broker is not, by itself, a defense to insider trading. According to SEC rules, Congressman Price and his broker needed to agree to a ``written plan for trading securities'' that does not ``permit the person to exercise subsequent influence over when, how, or whether to effect purchases or sales of securities.'' So, if Congressman Price had, in writing, given his broker complete control over his portfolio we wouldn't be discussing this issue today. But he did not do so.  Congressman Price returned to the ``my broker did it'' defense for weeks before finally providing the Finance Committee with an excerpt of his brokerage agreement.  Here's what it says:       In the Portfolio Management (``PM'') program, a Financial      Advisor(s) who meets the program certification requirements      manages your assets on a discretionary basis. In other words,      your Financial Advisor, and not you, has the discretion to      decide what securities to buy and sell in your account. This      discretion is subject to the parameters described below and      your ability to direct a sale of any security for tax or      other reasons.  In the course of our investigation, committee staff spoke with experts, and they confirmed what seems obvious from the plain language of the text. This agreement does not hand over complete control of Congressman Price's portfolio to his broker. His agreement with his broker simply does not shield him from insider trading laws, no matter how many times he tries to say it does.  This isn't a question of whether Congressman Price followed the technical letter of the law, he didn't follow it in spirit either. Congressman Price could direct his broker to make trades when he wanted to, and he did. Case in point, when Congressman Price wanted to act on a stock tip from Congressman Collins, he called up his broker and had her buy shares of an Australian biomedical firm called Innate  Another question raised by Congressman Price's conflicts of interest is whether they go beyond a violation of the public's trust and constitute an outright violation of insider trading laws. That question cannot be answered today. We have seen that time and time again that Congressman Price purchased stocks then turned around and promoted legislation that would help those companies, and his investments in them. What is not clear is whether the introduction of this legislation meets the legal standards of being ``material'' and ``nonpublic.'' Neither case history, nor the legislative history of the STOCK Act provide clear guidance on when pending legislation is material and nonpublic.  The bottom line is that Congressman Price's activities are in uncharted waters. That is why the public and members of this body ought to be outraged that the majority party has cut off the vetting process and rushed this nomination toward completion.  In my view, because of how this nomination was handled, the Senate Finance Committee has set a double standard. If you look to the recent past at the nominations of Senator Tom Daschle, Secretary Tim Geithner and Ambassador Ron Kirk at the outset of the Obama administration, the vetting process was extremely thorough and bipartisan. The committee turned over every stone, peered around every corner and followed every lead to its conclusion. Now, when a glaring issue comes up that undeniably deserves investigation, the party in power has shut down the vetting process. The Finance Committee and the Senate ought to do better.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
