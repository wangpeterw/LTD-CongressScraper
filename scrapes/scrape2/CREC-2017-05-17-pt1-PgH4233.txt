                                 PRAYER

  Rabbi Thomas A. Louchheim, Congregation Or Chadash, Tucson, Arizona, 
offered the following prayer:
  Loving God, each day raise up these good women and men who are 
serving our country with honor. Renew in them the faith, hope, and love 
that brought them to this vital work. Rekindle in them the passion that 
first called them to serve.
  May you, our elected Representatives from every State in our great 
Nation, be granted today the courage of your convictions; and may your 
eyes, your ears, and your hearts be open to the possibilities not yet 
imagined.
  Compassionate God, may our fellow Americans remember that these, Your 
servants, are each made in the divine image. They are our brothers and 
sisters in a family bridging all philosophical lines. May we treat them 
with respect, for we know not the hard battles they must fight.
  May Your blessings be on our military and diplomats serving overseas. 
Keep them safe from harm. Keep their souls strong, and strengthen them 
to serve with honor and courage.
  May our prayers for kindness, justice, freedom, and peace, be 
answered in our own day.
  Amen.
