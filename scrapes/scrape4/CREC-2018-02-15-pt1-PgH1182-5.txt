    LOS HERNANDEZ TAMALES HONORED WITH JAMES BEARD FOUNDATION AWARD

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Los Hernandez 
Tamales in Union Gap, Washington, for winning the James Beard 
Foundation's 2018 America's Classics Award.
  Felipe and June Hernandez, as well as their daughter and son-in-law, 
Rachel and Dion Wilburn, have operated the tamale eatery in the Yakima 
Valley for the last three decades. Felipe came to America from Mexico 
to work in agriculture and opened Los Hernandez Tamales in 1990. This 
family-owned establishment is well known for its pork, chicken, and 
seasonal asparagus tamales and, until now, remained a relatively secret 
spot among us locals.
  The James Beard Foundation America's Classics Award honors locally 
owned restaurants that are cherished for quality food that reflects the 
character of their community, and Los Hernandez Tamales is the first 
restaurant in central Washington to be recognized by the foundation.

  I, my family, my friends, and my staff can all attest that this award 
is well deserved, and it is an honor to recognize the Hernandezes for 
their hard work and accomplishments.
