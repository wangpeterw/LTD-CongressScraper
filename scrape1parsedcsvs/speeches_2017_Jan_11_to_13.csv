Mr.Speaker, Americans are hurting right now with their health care. ObamaCare supporters are quick to point out someAmericans who have actually been helped by After spending over $1 trillion of borrowed money, I would certainly hopethat there are at least some people who have been helped by this terrible law that was forced on us over 6 years ago by theDemocrats and without one single Republican vote.  Thousands of my constituents are demanding to be rescued from They have shared their individual stories with meabout how it has hurt them--higher premiums, excessive deductibles--how it has disrupted cancer treatments, forced them to changedoctors, and how it has even cost many their jobs.  Here is what real people are saying--my constituents. This is what they are telling me:  A young couple with three children, living in Tyler County, Texas, shared how their premiums have gone up year after year.They began with a $900 monthly premium and with a $2,500 deductible. The very next year, the premium went to $1,100, and thedeductible went up to $5,000. Then, in 2015, they were forced from a PPO into an HMO at $1,000 a month with a $6,600 deductible.These are individual deductibles. That is $33,000, plus the $12,000-per-year premium. That is an extraordinary burden on a youngfamily. This family tells me about their problem every time they see me, and they see me a lot because this is my daughter andmy son-in-law and my three grandchildren.  Gale in Deer Park, Texas, and Alisa from Crosby, Texas, wrote to tell me how their ObamaCare mandates have forced theiremployers to cut their work hours. They are losing hundreds of dollars in income each and every month. This 30-hour mandatemeans that this college student has lost out on hundreds of dollars in pay that she could have earned over the recent  Tim in Baytown, along with several others, wrote to share with me that it cost him his job. Paul from Harris County andFrank in Jasper shared how they have been significantly experiencing higher costs and a decrease in coverage. Roy in Pasadenasays that his deductible is now over $12,000. Ben and Carol, like thousands of others in southeast Texas, have had theirhealthcare plans canceled.  This calamitous unaffordability and poor coverage have inundated folks everywhere, like Linda in Vidor, who have to choosebetween their medications and food; like folks in El Lago--David and Sheryl--and Brian in It continues to tragicallyaffect folks every single day. Sharell from Jasper County has faced a doubling of her premiums, and Carol in Baytown shared howshe has seen substantial increases in her premiums and her deductibles.  Retirees who have worked their entire lives, like Jack from Orange and Glenda from Hardin County, wrote to tell me how theyare finding it difficult to afford their healthcare costs. Let's not forget that ObamaCare cut hundreds of billions of dollarsand services from Medicare, hurting the elderly.  Many who are sick have reached out to me, such as Randal of Harris County, who had their medical treatments disrupted byI hear all the time the firsthand accounts of hardworking folks who are at their wits' end under this monstrosity.

Perhaps Paul in Deer Park sums it up the best:       It made it worse for me. It increased thecosts, and it      decreased my coverage.  That is the story I have heard for 6 long years, and it is why this failed program must be repealed and replaced with a planthat restores healthcare freedom to all Americans--health plans that are affordable and that meet their families' needs--a planthat they choose, not the Federal Americans need relief now.

224,topic-id,1171,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from North Carolina, for his leadership not only of the RepublicanStudy Committee as the new chairman--and I welcome you as the new chairman of the Republican Study Committee--but for hisleadership on issues related to the importance of repealing this disastrous law that is making life harder on the Americanpeople; and not just repealing it, but replacing it with policy ideas that put power back in the hands of patients, theirfamilies, and their doctors instead of driving up costs, forcing people to lose their healthcare plans, forcing the governmentto ration health care. We need a better way.  I am proud to say that we are supporting not just repealing ObamaCare here tonight, but bringing to the American people someconstructive, positive ideas that will make life easier for them and improve their lives through better patient-centered healthcare.  Mr.Speaker, Kentucky was once portrayed by President Obama, a red State, as a model of the implementation of ObamaCare.Yet, every day in Kentucky, in my district in central and eastern Kentucky, I hear stories from families and small businessesand individuals who have been hurt by this disastrous law.  Now, over the next few weeks, as President-elect Trump comes into office and as this Congress revisits the issue ofhealthcare reform, I expect we will hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle, arguments like ``Don't repealWe have 20 million new Americans who have insurance.''  But that statistic needs to be scrutinized because the truth of the matter is ObamaCare forced people to lose their healthcare. In many cases, and in Kentucky as an example, many of my constituents lost high-quality, private, commercial healthinsurance through their workplace, and millions of Americans received cancellation notices in the mail. Their small employerstold them that they were going to have to change their health plans because of this law.  So not only do we see now skyrocketing costs for those who currently have health insurance, but many Americans who ourfriends on the other side of the aisle say now are insured or covered, these are folks who lost their health insurance before.  What happened?  They lost high-quality, job-based health insurance, and so they were forced into these exchanges. In Kentucky it was calledIn many cases, they went to the cheapest plan available, which happened to be Well, my fellow Americans,access to a waiting line is not access to health care. Unfortunately, Medicaid is oftentimes access to a waiting line, and it isnot access to true health care.  President Obama's promise that his healthcare law would help people has not turned out to be the case. In terms of cost,remember, this is called the Affordable Care Act, but it is anything but affordable because even though he promised thatpremiums would decline[[Page H375]]by $2,500 a year for the average family, premiums have actually increased for hardworkingPremiums have increased for 11 million people, according to a report by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.Millions of Americans, as I said before, lost previous coverage or had to change doctors due to this disastrous law.  Take, for example, Laura in my congressional district in Laura is a young mother who had a baby girl, Catherine.Catherine was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect, ventricular septal defect at birth, which is basically a hole in thewall of the heart. They needed high-quality pediatric cardiology to help So they got a specialist at BostonChildren's Of course, a long way away from Kentucky, but they wanted the best, of course, for their daughter. WhenObamaCare went into effect, unfortunately they lost their job-based health insurance that allowed them to access thesespecialists up in Boston for The result was, they lost their doctor.  What do you think a young mother and a young father are going to do in that situation?  Guess what, they had to find a very expensive policy to cover a Boston surgeon out of network out of State, and so theircosts skyrocketed.  This is the kind of thing that was happening to millions of Americans as a result of  Look, ObamaCare obviously reduced choice and competition. There are now only three plans participating in the ObamaCareexchange in Kentucky, one of which covers a full 78 percent of the State's individual marketplace enrollees. In many Statesthere is only one plan on the exchange. This has left too many families with no choice but to purchase high-deductible, high-premium coverage. In Kentucky, insurance plans have been forced to raise premiums by 23 percent in 2017 alone.  There is a better way, and the better way is healthcare reform that is focused on the patient, not putting bureaucrats incharge, not taking away choices, not driving up costs, not creating narrow networks for people, not forcing people out of theirhigh-quality private health insurance into government-run health care, but, instead, empowering patients to access moreaffordable private coverage.  And one of the ways we can lower the cost of health care, make it more affordable for people to access high-quality privatehealth insurance, is medical malpractice reform.  Frivolous lawsuits, junk lawsuits, have driven up the cost of health care in this country significantly. One of the fatalflaws of ObamaCare is that it never addressed this cost of healthcare inflation.  Over the course of their careers, it is estimated that 75 percent of all physicians will face a malpractice claim. Now, tobe sure, some of those cases of medical negligence are legitimate. And, of course, those plaintiffs should be able to fullyrecover damages for those cases of genuine actual malpractice. But for these frivolous lawsuits, that is driving up the cost ofcare. The fact that ObamaCare never even dealt with that issue is a fundamental flaw in the previous efforts to reform ourhealthcare system.  So I am a proud cosponsor of the Republican Study Committee's America Health Care Reform In the American Health CareReform Act is legislation that I introduced with Senator Barrasso called the Saving Lives, Saving Costs This doesn'tcap damages for cases of actual malpractice, but if there is a frivolous claim, if the liability climate is producing frivolouslawsuits, what we say is this: If you are a hospital or a doctor or a nurse and you practice in accordance with peer reviewed,evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, that there should be a higher standard of proof for that plaintiff to get to a jurytrial.  We want a safe harbor for our outstanding medical professionals who practice in accordance with the latest state-of-the-artguidelines on how to take care of patients.  So this does two things. Number one, it raises the standard of care. We are helping people access better, higher-qualitymedicine in this country with this legislation; and we are cutting out frivolous lawsuits, this litigation lottery that isdriving up the cost of health care for all  This is the kind of reform that, if enacted, would replace ObamaCare with reforms that would actually lower the cost ofhealth care without growing government.  I applaud the efforts of the Republican Study Committee for offering real solutions that will put patients and doctors incharge again and not Washington, D.

They donot pay the full cost and will not feel the brunt of these increases.  Number two, these increases are uneven. Yes, Arizona is up, but Rhode Island will decrease 14 percent.

But most importantly, number three, most people are unaffected because most people get their insurance through theiremployer, Medicare, Medicaid, or the Only a small fraction of Americans actually buy insurance on the individual market.Premiums, for the average single person through the employer market last year, were exactly the same as those for families; onlyup 3 percent.

If you ask me, itis strong evidence that the American people are tired of paying more and getting less.  Of course, the destruction that ObamaCare has caused extends beyond discouraging individuals to purchase coverage. It hasbeen a direct attack on those who had insurance already.  In my home State of Tennessee, 28,000 people lost coverage on a single day when the CoverTN program lapsed after the Obamaadministration decreed that it ran afoul of the Federal Government's top-down requirements. Now premiums in our State are risingby an average of 63 percent, and three-quarters of our counties only have one coverage option to choose from on the  In five other States around the country--Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming--patients only have oneinsurer in the marketplace to choose from. That makes it pretty difficult for someone to find a plan that meets their uniqueneeds or that of their family.  President Obama promised that this law would lower premiums by $2,500 per year for the average family. The exact oppositehas happened. Average family premiums have gone up by $4,300, and deductibles have gone up by 60 percent. This is hittinghardworking Americans, many of whom are already struggling to make ends meet.

Those are remarks bythe President at the annual conference of the American Medical Association back on June 15, 2009.  Here is another one: ``I will sign a universal health care bill into law by the end of my first term as president that willcover every American and cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year.'' This was in a speech on June 23,2007.  Here is another: ``You should know that once we have fully implemented, you're going to be able to buy insurance through apool so that you can get the same good rates as a group that if you're an employee at a big company you can get right now--whichmeans your premiums will go down.'' Which we know has absolutely not happened. These were remarks that were made by thePresident at a campaign event on July 16, 2012.  Here is another one, remarks made by the President after a meeting with the Senate Democrats on December 15, 2009:``Whatever ideas exist in terms of bending the cost curve and starting to reduce costs for families, businesses, and government,those elements are in this bill.'' As we know today, those elements have not come to fruition.  Another: ``So this law means more choice, more competition, lower costs for millions of Americans.'' These were remarks bythe President on the Affordable Care Act and the government shutdown on October 1, 2013.  Another: ``In my mind the Affordable Care Act has been a huge success, but it's got real problems.'' This came from JonathanChait, ``Five Days That Shaped a Presidency,'' on October 2, 2016.

Congress must repeal the ``Cadillac'' tax, the      healthinsurance tax, the medical device tax, the employer      responsibility penalties, and other harmful taxes of the      Affordable Care Actthat have increased health care costs for      millions of As committees begin consideration of      reconciliationlegislation, the Chamber will continue to      advocate strongly for those and other issues.       Furthermore, this proposal providesfor modifications to      enacted FY 2017 discretionary spending levels to bring them      into alignment with the AppropriationsCommittee's existing      allocation as part of the deeming resolution required by the      Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. These levelsare consistent      with the statutory limits established by the Budget Control      Act and amended by the Bipartisan Budget Thislegislation      would also make changes to mandatory spending to reflect $2      billion in mandatory savings--the same amount establishedin      the reconciliation instructions.       The FY 2017 Appropriations bills include many Chamber      policy priorities. The Chamberstrongly supports completing      work on those bills and hopes that passage of this budget      resolution will provide the framework fortheir quick      consideration, including beginning the important work on      fiscal year 2018 bills.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: I write to      share the support of the National Retail Federation(NRF) for      3, the fiscal year 2017 budget resolution.      Please note that NRF may consider votes on 3      andrelated procedural motions as Opportunity Index Votes for      our annual voting scorecard.       The Affordable Care Act (ACA) remainsa great concern for      NRF and the greater retail community. The ACA adversely      influences staffing patterns, discourages full-timeemployment      and adds to the cost of goods in retail stores. NRF opposed      enactment of the ACA in 2010 but has also workedsteadfastly      to change the law since its enactment. We have supported      reasonable bipartisan efforts to reduce the ACA's costburdens      and ease compliance concerns. The ACA remains a heavy burden      for the retail community despite all of our efforts to fixand      adjust to the law.       This budget resolution is the first step toward the      eventual repeal of the We support this firststep but      will be closely watching the ensuing reconciliation      legislation to help keep employment-based coverage as stable      andpredictable as possible. We strongly urge that the process      of replacing the ACA be both bipartisan as well as      deliberate.Consensus reform will build on the employment      based system, which covers 178 million Americans, but not      threaten this coveragein the effort to help others.       For all of these reasons, NRF supports 3 and      ask for your vote insupport.           Sincerely,                                                     David French,                      Senior Vice President, Government Relations.[[Page H509]]                                       ____                                           National Association of                                      Wholesaler-Distributors,                                  Washington, DC, January 12,2017.

It has become painfully apparent that the ACA has not and      will not achievethe affordability, competition and choice      goals promised by its sponsors. Looking forward, NAW members      are deeply concernedabout the ACA's potential to do harm to      the employment-based health insurance system through which      some 170 million Americansacquire their health coverage,      particularly as two ill-advised ACA financing components--the      excise tax on high-cost health plans(the ``Cadillac Tax'')      and the annual fee on health insurance providers (the      ``Health Insurance Tax'' or ``HIT'')--takehold.       NAW looks forward to working with Members of both houses of      Congress on both sides of the aisle in what we hope will bea      collaborative effort to find common legislative ground on      marketplace-driven, patient-centered ways to achieve shared      access,cost-containment, and quality goals.

Dear Representatives: The National Association of      Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in      theUnited States, representing manufacturers in every      industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to support      3the Obamacare Repeal       The Budget Resolution takes the first step towards      repealing the mandates and taxesresulting from the Patient      Protection and Affordable Care Act that are driving up the      costs of healthcare for manufacturers.Manufacturers believe      that repeal of the 40 percent excise tax on high cost plans,      the Health Insurance Tax, the Medical DeviceTax, and other      fees and taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act will      help employers contain rising health carecosts.       Manufacturers historically have led the business community      in providing health benefits to their employees and      arecommitted to continuing this tradition in the future. At      the same time, providing health coverage in an environment      where costsare consistently rising represents a major      challenge for the industry.

U.House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: You will soon have the opportunity to      vote on 3, a budget resolution that will      beginthe long-awaited process of repealing the Patient      Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as      On behalfof the more than one million members and      supporters of the Council for Citizens Against Government      Waste (CCAGW), I urge you tosupport this important      legislation.       Obamacare, which has been a disaster for patients and      taxpayers since it was passed in2010, cannot be fixed.      Premiums have dramatically increased, co-ops and state      exchanges have failed, and medical costs continueto      skyrocket. Conservative estimates suggest that, by its sixth      birthday in early 2016, Obamacare had wasted $55 billion,      whileits onerous regulations and taxes have stifled economic      growth and job creation.       Over the past year, more co-ops havecollapsed; health      insurers have abandoned numerous exchanges; and premiums have      increased an average of 25 percent for 2017.Even worse,      Obamacare has allowed overzealous Washington bureaucrats to      meddle in Americans' most personal and private      decisionsconcerning their health. At the same time, patients      are getting less care for their plans due to fewer healthcare      options andincreasing medical costs; some counties have only      one or even no healthcare insurance options (and have to pay      a fine, as aresult).       Obamacare must be repealed before it further damages      consumers and the slow-growing economy. Passage of      the``Obamacare repeal resolution'' is the first step to      accomplishing that critical objective. All votes on      3 will beamong those considered for CCAGW's 2017      Congressional           Sincerely,                                                       Tom Schatz,                                      ____                        Americans for Tax Reform       Congress is expected to soon vote on 3, a      budget resolutionproviding for repeal of The      ``repeal resolution'' is step one in undoing the legacy of      broken promises under theBarack Obama presidency which have      led to higher healthcare costs, cancelled plans, lost      doctors, and more than $1 trillion intax increases which hit      millions of middle class families.       All members of the House and Senate should vote ``yes'' on      therepeal resolution. The record of Obamacare is one of      broken promises and failed policies. Poll after poll has      shown the law isunpopular with the American people.      Republicans campaigned on repealing Obamacare and this      resolution will allow them to fulfillthat promise       Members of the Senate should also vote ``no'' on the      numerous amendments expected to be offered      duringconsideration of the repeal resolution. The purpose of      this budget resolution is to allow for an expedited process      to repealObamacare through budget reconciliation. These      amendments will slow down the process and are largely an      attempt for members toplay political games.       Passing the repeal resolution will allow members of      Congress to pass the first of many tax cuts overthe next four      years by repealing the more than $1 trillion in higher taxes      over a decade. Obamacare's tax hikes directly hitmiddle class      families, in violation of President Obama's ``firm pledge''      not to raise any tax on any family earning less than$250,000      per year. Passing the repeal resolution will allow members of      Congress the opportunity to pass the first of many taxcuts      over the next four years by repealing these taxes.       The Obamacare law imposed taxes on Health Savings Accounts      andFlexible Spending Accounts and imposed an income tax      increase on Americans with high medical bills. Obamacare      levied a new taxon health insurance, a tax on medical      devices, a tax on employer provided care, a steep ``indoor      tanning tax'' and even a taxfor not buying ``qualifying''      government-mandated insurance.       Passing the repeal resolution will also allow Congress to      undo along list of wasteful subsidies including the risk      corridor and reinsurance programs as well as the Prevention      and Public Healthslush fund. Each of these programs and      agencies have seen billions in taxpayer dollars wasted on      partisan activities at a timewhen the federal government      already spends far too much. Support for 3 is      the first step toward enacting aconservative, patient-     centered, fiscally responsible healthcare system and      eliminating the broken promises, wasteful spending,and higher      taxes of the Obama years.                        Americans for Prosperity       For years, our lawmakers inCongress have vowed to get rid      of Now, they have their best chance yet to make      good on their word.       Barack Obama'ssignature health-care law has failed to      deliver on its promises, and continues to leave Americans      with cancelled insuranceplans, reduced access to doctors, and      premium increases in the double digits--or worse.       Using a process called budgetreconciliation, Obamacare's      opponents in our new Senate can repeal large portions of the      law with a simple majority, whileleaving no possibility of a      filibuster by lawmakers who want to keep it. Then, the      resolution would just need to be passed inthe House of      Representatives and signed by President Trump after he takes      office.       We can't let our lawmakers pass up thisopportunity to turn      back years of terrible policy and free Americans from      Obamacare's burdensome mandates and costs.

It ignores the 20 million Americans who have either paid theObamaCare penalty or sought an exemption from it because the cost of complying with the law is either too costly or not worththeir trouble.  This amendment tells those families who have seen their premiums go up dramatically--many, who are paying more and gettingless--that there is no relief in sight for you.

Because of public outcry, within minutes after the late-night closed meetings, the Republican plan to gut the independentOffice of Congressional Ethics was reversed. In response to outrage about jeopardizing health care for millions of Americans,some Republicans now admit that repealing the Affordable Care Act is not quite so simple and maybe they should come up with areplacement, even if they don't yet know how to do it. Senate Republicans even delayed some of the Cabinet confirmation hearingsto allow a more orderly review and scrutiny.  Your voice does matter.

558,topic-id,643,"Mr.Speaker, it is heartening that a few of our Republican colleagues are urging caution on the recklessapproach to repeal the Affordable Care They are acknowledging that the only reasonable way to proceed--if that is theobjective--is to, at the same time that they repeal, provide the American people with a replacement, a replacement that meetstheir criteria.  One reason they have not done so is that Republicans don't really agree, don't really know how to do that. The new Presidentpromises that a repeal-and-replace program will be better. It will have lower costs and better coverage--a tall order--and we haveseen no details.  The troubling fact for the Republicans bent on repealing the Affordable Care Act is that the ACA is working, and most of themajor provisions are wildly popular: no lifetime limits on health care; no denial for preexisting conditions to almost 130million Americans who would otherwise have their health care at risk; allowing children to stay on their parents' healthinsurance until they are age 25; not charging women higher premiums than men simply because of their chromosomes.  These elements are absolutely essential going forward, and the American public wants this to continue. Sadly, even if theydo slow down and try to do it right, there is much damage that is being done with the uncertainty in the air. They haveunsettled 18 percent of our economy--over $3 trillion of annual expenses--disrupting the 6 years of progress in making the systemwork better.  I have been talking to people in my community, finding out about some of the damage that is being done, their concerns andapprehensions. The largest employer in the city of Portland is Oregon Health & Science They already have feltcompelled to implant a hiring freeze, dial back some of their programming, trying to reconfigure, preparing for the worst.  The local government, partnering with the private sector to treat the poor and the elderly, people with mental healthissues, are having their important reforms put at risk, and they are scrambling to try and figure out how to do it.  The State of Oregon, not unlike many States around the country, is facing some budget challenges, and there is a $1.7billion question dealing with the uncertainty going forward with  Rural hospitals are especially vulnerable, and they will explain it to any Congressman who chooses to ask. Most importantfor many of them is the fact that this approach that is being pursued on Capitol Hill with this question mark puts at risk oneof the greatest achievements of the Affordable Care The vast amounts of money spent on uncompensated care, charity care,has been dramatically reduced. People are getting their health care earlier, and it is being paid for. And those uncompensatedcare levels are falling dramatically. They are getting better care, more timely.  The health providers in my community are concerned they are still going to have to provide the care, but it will be donelater in an emergency room, not in a clinic setting, and they are left holding the bag financially. It is not hard to find outhow damaging this approach has been.  Certainly, the Affordable Care Act could use refinement and improvement. We have been trying to do that for the last 6years. The local medical associations, community clinics, hospitals, health plans are all willing to say how that could be done;but at the same time, they will explain what is at risk and why we owe it to them and the people we serve to understand thedamage that is being done and try and minimize it.  The course that is being followed will make America sick again, and that is not the way to start a new administration, a newWe should do what we should have been doing for the last 6 years: working together, cooperatively, to build upon,refine, and improve the Affordable Care Act and give the American public the health care they deserve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH394.txt,99,83,2017.0,12.0,January
1009,topic-id,201,"Mr.Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.McGovern). I was in the middle ofhundreds of hours of discussion and debate in committee, on the floor. It is amazing to think of all the time and energy thatwent into it.  Was it a perfect bill? Absolutely not. It would have been much better if the legislative process hadn't collapsed in theSenate and forced reconciliation as the vehicle.  The offer to somehow become bipartisan and work together to solve the problems ring hollow. I have been on the Ways andMeans Committee for the last 6 years when Republicans were in charge with constant efforts to repeal ObamaCare, but they refusedto work with us to fine-tune the legislation when we could move forward and build on this foundation and not be in a situationwhere we are going to unsettle healthcare markets, leave people doubting about where they are, and having no clue about whatcomes forward.  There is a reason, after 6 years, the Republicans do not have an alternative to offer now. It is because their wildlycontradictory promises cannot be met.

914,topic-id,1899,"Mr.President, the Senate is holding hearings on each ofPresident-Elect Trump's nominees to his Traditionally, Presidents are accorded a very high level of deference onassembling their own team, in part because these nominees are directly accountable to the But they are accountable tothe American people too.  No Cabinet member is more powerful or has more impact on the day-to-day lives of Americans than theAttorney General of the United  The Attorney General is, indeed, a general, in command of an army of thousands oflawyers whose words carry enormous weight and power. It is the weight and power of the people of the United He speaksfor us. He charges defendants in our name. He has sweeping authority to bring criminal charges in all Federal offenses, enormousunreviewable discretion in cases ranging from minor misdemeanors to the most serious felonies. In every sense, as capitalpenalties can be sought for some of these crimes, he wields the power of life and death.  The Attorney General's authority isnot only sweeping, it is uniquely independent of the President's His decisions must supersede partisan politics. Inmost cases, there is no recourse to overrule his decisions unless there is political interference. He is not just anothergovernment lawyer or even just another member of the President's He is the Nation's lawyer, and he must be the Nation'slegal counsel and conscience.  The job of U.Attorney General at stake here is one that I know pretty well. Like some of mycolleagues in this body, I served as U.attorney, the chief Federal prosecutor in  I reported to the U.S.Attorney For years afterward as a private litigator and then as attorney general of the State of Connecticut for 20years, I fought alongside and sometimes against the U.Attorney General and the legal forces at his disposal. I have seen hispower, or hers, firsthand. The power of this Attorney General is awesome, as is that of any Attorney  In the best ofcases, they are inspiring too. Even as he protects the public from vicious and violent criminal offenders, his role is also toprotect the innocent from unfounded charges that could shatter their lives even if they are acquitted. As Justice RobertJackson, a former Attorney General himself, once said: His job is not to convict, but to assure justice is done.  So this jobrequires a singular level of intellect and integrity and nonpartisan but passionate devotion to the rule of law and anextraordinary sense of conscience. That is because he is responsible for so much more than prosecuting and preventing crime andensuring public safety. He is responsible for aggressively upholding our Nation's sacred constitutional commitment to protectingindividual rights and liberties and preventing infringement on them, even by the government itself, maybe especially by thegovernment.[[Page S300]]  This responsibility for safeguarding equal justice under the law is particularly important today, at atime when those civil rights and freedoms are so much in peril. This historic moment demands a personwhose life work, professional career, and record shows that he will make the guarantee under our Constitution of equal justiceunder law a core mandate of his tenure.  Having reviewed the full record and recent testimony, regrettably and respectfully,I cannot support the President-elect's nominee, our colleague and friend Jeff Sessions, for this job.  At hisconfirmation hearing, Senator Sessions simply said he would follow the law and he would obey it, but the Attorney Generalof the United States must be more than a follower. He must be a leader in protecting the essential constitutional rights andliberties. He must be a champion, a zealous advocate. He must actively pursue justice, not just passively follow or obey thelaw.  Senator Sessions' record reflects a hostility and antipathy--in fact, downright opposition--to civil rights andvoting rights, women's health care and privacy rights, antidiscrimination measures, and religious freedom safeguards. He hasprided himself on his vociferous opposition to immigration reform legislation, a measure that passed this body with 68bipartisan votes, and a criminal justice reform bill that has attracted a group of 25 cosponsors, Democrats and Heeven split with the majority of his own party to vote against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women He opposed hatecrime prohibitions. Senator Sessions' views and positions on these issues and others, which are critical to protecting andchampioning rights and liberties under our Constitution, are simply out of the mainstream. There is nothing in SenatorSessions' record, including his testimony before the Judiciary Committee this week, that indicates he will be theconstitutional champion the Nation needs at this point in its history.  Equally important, the Attorney General must speaktruth to power. He must be ready, willing, and able to say no to the President of the United States and ensure that thePresident is never above the law. Senator Sessions' record and testimony give me no confidence that he will fulfill thiscore task.  When I asked him about enforcement of cases against illegal conflicts of interest involving the President and hisfamily, such as violations of the emoluments clause or the STOCK Act, he equivocated. When I asked him about appointing aspecial counsel to investigate criminal wrongdoing at Deutsche Bank, owed more than $300 million by Donald Trump, heequivocated. When I asked him about abstaining from voting on other Presidential nominees while he is in the Senate, heequivocated. Those answers give me no confidence that he will be the independent, nonpolitical law enforcer against conflicts ofinterest and official self-enrichment that the Nation needs now more than ever--at a moment when the incoming administrationfaces ethical and legal controversies that are unprecedented in scope and scale.  SenatorSessions' record over many years and his recent testimony fail to demonstrate the core commitments and convictionsnecessary in our next Attorney  Back in 1986, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Senator Sessions'nomination to a Federal judgeship due to remarks he made and actions he took in a position of public trust as U.attorney inHowever, my position on his nomination is primarily based on his record since those hearings and less on what wasconsidered at that time.  On voting rights, Senator Sessions has often condoned barriers to Americans exercising theirfranchise. He has been a leading opponent of provisions in the Voting Rights Act designed to ensure that African Americans canvote in places, such as his home State of Alabama, which have a unique history of racial segregation. He has advocated forneedlessly restrictive and draconian voter ID laws, citing utterly debunked threats of rampant voter fraud as an excuse forcurtailing the real and legitimate rights of entire groups of voters.  On privacy--very important--Senator Sessions haspassionately opposed this longstanding American right, which is enshrined in five decades of Supreme Court precedent. Itprotects women's health care and personal decisions involving reproductive rights. At a time when these rights are facing anunprecedented assault, he has continued to condemn Roe v. Wade and the many court decisions upholding that case.  He is alsosupported by extremist groups like Operation Rescue that defend the murder of doctors and the vilification and criminalizationof women. With him as Attorney General, American women would understandably feel less secure about those rights.  Onreligious freedom, Senator Sessions has advocated for using a religious test to determine which immigrants can enter thiscountry. When this issue arose in committee, Senator Sessions was the only Senator--the only Senator--to argue forcefully forreligious tests and against principles of religious liberty that have animated our Republic since its founding. With SenatorSessions as Attorney General, a Trump administration would enjoy a permanent green light for any racially or religiouslydiscriminatory immigration policy that might appeal to him.  On citizenship, Senator Sessions has called for abolishinga time-honored tradition that dates back to reconstruction. Birthright citizenship is the distinctly American concept thatanyone born on our soil is a citizen of our country. We do not exclude people from citizenship based on the nationality of theirparents or grandparents. Senator Sessions disagrees, a position that most other Republicans think is extreme.  WithSenator Sessions as Attorney General, the Trump administration would be encouraged in attempting to deport Americancitizens--who have raised families and spent their entire lives here--from the only country they have ever known.  SenatorSessions declined my invitation at his nomination hearing to exercise moral and legal leadership and demonstrate hisresolve to serve as the Nation's legal conscience. He refused to reject the possibility of using information voluntarilyprovided by DACA applicants to deport them and their families. As a matter of fundamental fairness and due process, when aDREAMer has provided information to our government after being invited to come out of the shadows, this information should neverbe used to deport that person. With Senator Sessions as Attorney General, that sense of legal conscience would be lacking.  On issues of discrimination and equal protection, Senator Sessions has publicly opposed marriage equality, claiming it``weakens marriage'' and even tried to eliminate protections for LGBT Americans contained in the Runaway and Homeless Youth andTrafficking Prevention He has repeatedly voted against steps to enhance enforcement against hate crimes--violent assaultsinvolving bigotry or bias based on race, religion, and sexual orientation. He even defended President-Elect Trump's shockingadmission on video of his pattern of engaging in sexual assault.  Senator Sessions himself has said that publicofficials can be fairly judged by assessing who their supporters are. Senator Sessions is backed by groups with ties toWhite supremacists.  He has even accepted an award and repeated campaign donations from groups whose founder openly promotesthe goal of maintaining a ``European American majority'' in our society. Neither award, nor many other important parts ofSenator Sessions' record, was reported on the questionnaire he prepared for the Judiciary  I gave SenatorSessions an opportunity at the hearing earlier this week to repudiate these hate groups and racist individuals who haveendorsed his nomination and supported him in the past. In fact, instead he doubled down, saying that a man who has accusedAfrican Americans of excessive criminality and American Muslims of extensive ties to terrorism was ``a most brilliantindividual.''  So I reach my decision to oppose this nomination with regret because Jeff Sessions is a colleague and afriend to all of us. Indeed, he and I have a rapport. I have come to like and respect[[Page S301]]him through a number of sharedexperiences in this building, traveling abroad, and outside.  We have common causes. He and I both support law enforcementprofessionals who serve our communities and the Nation with dedication and courage. They are never given sufficient thanks andappreciation.  He and I both believe that individual corporate criminal culpability should be pursued more vigorously.Individual corporate executives should be held accountable for the wrongdoing of corporations when they are criminally involved.  This job, this decision, this responsibility is different. Here, my disagreements stem from bedrock constitutionalprinciples. While I could envision deferring to Presidential authority and supporting him for other positions, my objections tohis nomination here relate specifically to this particular, essential, all-powerful job.  At this historic moment, there mustbe no doubt about the ironclad commitment of the Attorney General of the United States to the bedrock principle of equal justiceunder law, his resolve to be an independent voice, assuring that the President is never above the law, his determination to be achampion for all people of America and our constitutional principles that protect all people, and to be a legal conscience forthe  Reviewing his record, I cannot assure the people of Connecticut or the country that Jeff Sessions would bea vigorous champion of these rights and liberties.

Why would we want to move backward instead ofbuilding on that 95 percent?  Amendment 86 creates a budget point of order against any legislation that would decreasecoverage, reduce benefits, or raise costs when it comes to children's health insurance. Rather than ripping away coverage fromchildren, we should be building on that 95 percent number; we should build on that progress; we should work to get 100 percentof our Nation's children covered.

618,topic-id,164,"Mr.Speaker, as a medical provider, I understand how critical and necessary patient choice and input is to theoverall quality of our healthcare system. Put simply, patients are better off when they are equipped to make their owndecisions.  Unfortunately, ObamaCare limits patient choice, as outlined in this chart. In fact, in the ObamaCare marketplace, patientsin two-thirds of our country are limited to a choice of one or two insurers. Across five entire States, patients have only oneoption. To me, the marketplace looks more like a government-created monopoly under a system where every American is required bylaw to purchase the product.  To make matters worse, the onerous mandates in the law have led to restricted physician networks. So not only do patientshave little choice regarding their insurers, they are also limited to what physicians they can see.  It turns out we can't keep our doctors even if we like them. That is why we are offering a Better Way plan that expandschoice and empowers patients.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH403.txt,2018,LET'S WORK TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTHCARE PLAN,2017.0,12.0,January
734,topic-id,229,"Mr.Chairman, the debate over financial regulation is not just about more versus less. It is also about the ideathat financial liberty and personal liberty are connected, and they have been for most of history.  This goes back to the Middle Ages, when widespread use of a bill of exchange--basically, a check--made it much more difficultfor government to wrongly take people's wealth. That development was one of the first building blocks of limited government.  Now, today, we see a similar principle at work in global capital. Like the bill of exchange placing gold or silver out ofthe reach of government, the connected global economy allows capital to flow away from harsh regulation. Countries that get itright are the ones that win.  There are a number of statistics that suggest that we are getting the short end of the stick in this arena. We are losingour financial competitiveness. For example, nearly 10 percent of foreign companies left the New York Stock Exchange this year,almost double the historic average. Finally, from 2010 to 2016, the United States slipped from 6th to 11th in the Index ofEconomic  While this problem has a number of causes, the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulatory Accountability Act will helpimprove our economic competitiveness by requiring that the SEC put its regulations through a strong cost-benefit analysis andreview regulations that are just plain outdated.

770,topic-id,723,"Mr.Speaker, this final amendment says plainly that the Securities and Exchange Commission should take intoaccount whether any proposed rule will have an impact on outsourcing American jobs.  Many of us, especially those of us in the industrial heartland, represent regions that have experienced serious job lossesbecause of companies sending jobs overseas. I will tell you a little bit about mine.  I have the honor of serving Illinois' 17th Congressional Most of my district is rural. It spans 7,000 squaremiles, 14 counties, and covers the entire northwestern region of the State of We are the world headquarters for You have probably seen the tractors or the combines out there on the farmland.  We are also the world headquarters for Caterpillar, and, as you have traveled around our country and around our world, youhave probably also seen the yellow, big, earth-moving equipment. That comes from my congressional district.  But like many parts of our heartland, our region has seen far too many manufacturing jobs shipped overseas. I am going togive you a couple of examples.  In a town called Galesburg, Illinois, we had a Maytag plant that made refrigerators. Overnight, every last one of those jobswas shipped to A dozen years later, the wages there still have not recovered because of that outsourcing.  We have a town called Hanover, Illinois, a little, bitty town in northwestern There was a plant called Robertshaw.They made little valves that go inside of washing machines and dishwashers that measured the water that would flow through.There was nearly a zero percent defect rate on what was produced out of that plant, and the company was profitable. And yet,every last one of those jobs went to  And then we had a company called They made auto part sensors, and it was bought out by a company called You might know a little bit about this company called Bain And they shipped every one of those jobs over to I have made friends with a lot of the workers there, one of whom is named Dot She had worked there for 40-plusyears, started right out of high school. And she had the indignity of--the last function that she had to do at that plant was toscrape the tape off the floor that laid the area for where the machinery had been; that was what she had to do.  So I am here to tell you those stories, but also to say that this is happening to way too many workers. Men and women likeDot Turner understand the dignity that comes with having a good job and putting in a good, hard day's work. They understand thata good career is a pathway to a better future for themselves and for their families. But too many people like Dot have been leftbehind.  So what are we going to do? What is ahead?  In just 9 days, President-elect Trump will take the oath of office after running on a platform of making America greatagain. He said he would do that by bringing home jobs that had been sent overseas.  Well, many my colleagues on this side of the aisle have been fighting to protect American jobs for years. In fact, we haveput forth real solutions to spur growth in the manufacturing sector and get our middle class back to work. We have introducedmore than 80 bills in our Make It In America agenda, but we have been blocked at so many turns.  So what kind of legislation is making it to the House floor instead? Bills like the one we are going to be voting on soon;bills that would make it more difficult for the Securities and Exchange Commission to protect investors and consumers, wouldmake it more difficult for that to happen, and bills that would gamble the retirement savings of everyday Americans as if wewere a Trump casino.  Working families deserve more than a bumper sticker slogan. They know that talk can be cheap in a place like Washington,D.C., and they are tired of politicians putting billionaires over the little guy. That is why this motion would ensure that ourfocus is on bringing back outsourced jobs.  Working families need to know that we here in Washington are fighting for them. Please join me, and let's show the Americanpeople that we are serious about this issue.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

The National Security Act of 1947, U.S.Title 10 Section 113(a), stipulates that anindividual ``may not be appointed as Secretary of Defense within seven years after relief from active duty as a commissionedofficer of a regular component of an armed force.'' President-Elect Donald Trump's choice of retired U.Marine Corps GeneralJames Mattis violates that provision since he has only been out of the uniform for 3 years; thus, Congress will need to passa waiver so that he can serve if confirmed.  I have considered this issue carefully, and I have listened to Mattis'stestimony earlier today before the Senate Armed Services I believe Mattis is committed to the principle ofcivilian control of the military. I was reassured by his testimony this morning, and I will vote to grant the waiver.

306,topic-id,1834,"Mr.President, I come to the floor witha lot of other folks to talk about the health care in this country. I think one of the goals we all share--and maybe we are notsure how to get there--is how to make sure that everybody who needs access to health care has it, that it is affordable, and thatthey get reasonably good quality, whoever they are and wherever they come from.  When I was a naval flight officer, we usedto fly a lot of missions out of Japan during the Cold I have a special interest in Japan, and I like the folks there. Theyare pretty remarkable in what they have achieved over the years. One of the things they have achieved over the years isproviding pretty good health care for a fairly modest amount of money.  We started working on the Affordable Care Act 7 or 8years ago. One of the things I learned about Japan was that they were spending 8 percent of their gross domestic product forhealth care in their country. We were spending 18 percent. As it turns out, they were getting better results. They had lowerrates of infant mortality and higher rates of longevity. People lived longer. Newborns died less frequently than we did. On topof all that, in Japan they covered everybody. Everybody was covered for health care. We had about 40 million people--over 40million people at the time--whose health care coverage was to get into an emergency room of a hospital, try to get in line, andget someone's attention.  I know how smart the Japanese are, but I don't think they can be that smart and we can be thatdumb. That is sort of where we were 6, 7 years ago. So we said: What are we going to do about it?  I think almost everyPresident--maybe since Truman--had a goal of making sure everybody in this country had access to health care. A lot of folkstalked about it and maybe tried to do something. The first time we had a serious effort to do that was during the Clintonadministration, not led by President Bill Clinton but led by First Lady Hillary What she came up with and worked on wassomething called  The Republicans came up with an alternative to HillaryCare introduced by the RepublicanSenator from Rhode Island, John Chafee--a really good guy, a very able guy. I actually served with his son Lincoln in the Senate.But in 1993, 1994, when most people focused on HillaryCare, John Chafee introduced legislation with 20 or so A couple of them are still here, I think. Senator Orrin Hatch was one of them, and Senator Chuck Grassleyof Iowa was one of them--maybe a couple of Democrats, as well. But 20 to 25 Senators, mostly Republican, cosponsored the  This chart mentions the Chafee bill and what was included in the Chafee legislation. One of the things includedwas the individual mandate--basically, that everybody had to get coverage.  Second was the employer mandate, which basicallysaid that employers had to provide health care coverage for their employees--maybe not for everyone, maybe not for the smallestbusinesses--but getting employers to meet what Senator Chafee and other Senators thought were the employers' obligations, theirresponsibilities.  In the Chafee legislation there was a ban on preexisting conditions.  In the Chafee legislation therewere subsidies for purchasing insurance. Purchasing it where? Purchasing it in State exchanges. The idea of creating largepurchasing pools--there were folks who didn't have health care coverage who could get their health care coverage in a largepurchasing pool. If their income was low or relatively low, they would be eligible for tax credits to buy down the cost of theirhealth care coverage. They would get theirs from the exchanges and the purchasing pools.  Those were all ideas in SenatorChafee's legislation in 1993. Do you know what? I am a Democrat and probably shouldn't say this, but I thought they all madesense.  The legislation didn't go anywhere. In the end, HillaryCare didn't go anywhere. But long before we had serious debateon the Affordable Care Act, people were talking about the same thing.  You go over here--RomneyCare in 2006. Individualmandate: Got it. Employer mandate: Got it. Ban on preexisting conditions? Subsidies for purchasing insurance? Yes.Establish State purchasing groups? Those are all in  I have always given Governor Romney credit for the ideaof the individual mandate, but apparently that was wrong. It was in Senator Chafee's legislation as well. Governor Romney tookthe handoff, if you will, from Senator John Chafee and introduced what they call RomneyCare in It was introduced in 2006.  When it first was introduced, they had real good success in getting people covered. Itwas successful in terms of getting people covered. Where they were not so successful initially was affordability. They had towork on affordability. Part of the problem there was it took a while for the healthier, younger people who did not think theyneeded health care coverage because they were young and invincible. It took a while for them to start.  They said: The finekeeps going up year after year after year. Maybe I should get some health care coverage and not pay the fine. Ultimately, Ithink RomneyCare did a much better job on affordability.  If you take those five key provisions, the individual mandate,employer mandate, ban on preexisting conditions, subsidies for purchasing insurance, and establishing the State exchanges--keyprovisions in the Chafee bill--they are in Believe it or not, they are in the Affordable Care  I know some ofour Republican friends think that nobody listened to them when we wrote the Affordable Care Actually, these are your ideas.These are your ideas. Some of the provisions or aspects of the Affordable Care Act that our friends across the aisle have beenmost critical of are things that were originally their idea--originally their idea.  Then we changed this thing. SenatorSanders who has joined us on the floor. We added to that. We expanded We said to States--we didn't make themexpand Medicaid, but we said: If you do, the Federal Government will pay the lion's share of the increased costs in Ithink initially maybe 24 States signed up and said: We will do that, including the District of Later on, another sevenor so, eight States--I think Indiana is one of those that decided, under then-Governor Pence, to expand Medicaid up to aboutroughly 135 percent of poverty from maybe closer to 100 percent of poverty for most  That is a little bit of a goodhistory lesson. I think we have another chart we can look at. It is a pie chart. Sylvia Matthews Burwell came by--the Secretaryof Health and Human Services came by a month or two ago and talked to our Democratic Senate caucus. One of the things she saidto us that I thought was especially informative was she talked about this pie chart.  What she said is: Think of this piechart. It includes about 300 million Americans who get health care, at least those who get some kind of health care other thanemergency room. She told us that roughly half of the people, a little bit more than half of the 300 million people among theAmericans who are getting health care--a little over half, 57 percent--get their coverage through employer coverage. The employersprovide that as a condition of employment. Another roughly 22 percent--that is this area, sort of the brown area--is Medicaid and[[Page S237]]the S-CHIP program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, a bipartisan idea. Bill Roth worked on that, the Clintons,and others. I even worked on it as About 15 percent--this area right here, the green--is Then down here youhave the individual markets, the marketplaces, and so forth.  There are roughly 5 or 6 percent down here where people aregetting their coverage. A lot of the attention, a lot of the criticism of the delivery of health care in the last 6 or 7 yearsby our friends on the other side has been down here with the marketplaces, the exchanges. Those were their ideas.  One of thenice things the Affordable Care Act has done--not many people know this--but the Medicare trust fund, which is in danger ofrunning out of money, the life of that trust fund has been extended by 12 years because of the Affordable Care The Medicaidpieces have been--the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Matthews Burwell, has negotiated with a number of Governorsto try to give them the opportunity to sort of customize their Medicaid programs.  I think maybe in Indiana they wanted tohave a small copay for the people who participated in That is what they got. So it is not all one size fits all, butthere is some differentiation between Now we have roughly two-thirds of the States that have signed up for  So that is just a little visual. Do we have another chart here? The question is, Who gets hurt by repealing theAffordable Care Act? If we just repeal the Affordable Care Act, and we don't replace it at the same time we repeal it or changeit, a lot of people will get hurt, including a lot of people who are in the exchanges and getting health care coverage maybe forthe first time in a long time, and actually folks who are not in the exchanges, people who get their health care coverage in allkinds of ways, including employer provided, Medicare, and Medicaid, or privately purchased.  We don't need the kind ofuncertainty, the lack of predictability that would be created by repeal without having a very clear picture of what we are goingto replace it with at the same time--not a year from now, not 2 years, not 3 years, not 4 years from now but at the same time.That is what we ought to do.  I will close with this. I note one of my colleagues from a big State up to the northeast of ushas a few things he wants to say. I welcome hearing him.  My dad used to say to my sister and me when we were kids growingup, a little younger than our pages--we would do some bone-headed stunt, and he would say to my sister and me: Just use somecommon sense. That is what he would say. Just use some common sense. He said it a lot. We must not have had much.  Well, justrepealing the Affordable Care Act and not having something to replace it with immediately that provides coverage just asgood--affordable, comprehensive coverage--that would not be very good common sense. We can do better than that. We can do better.  I hope our Republican friends, with this rush to judgment to repeal and replace 2 or 3 or 4 years down the line, can comearound and say: No, that does not make much sense. I hope they will listen to some of their colleagues and some of the rest ofus who say: If we are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, let's know what we are going to replace it with, and make sure wedo that on day one.

309,topic-id,1213,"Mr.President, as we continue to debate health care, there are some things that arekind of being debated that I call monkey dust. When two gorillas fight, they try to confuse each other by throwing dust up inthe air. It has nothing to do with the substance of the fight but rather is only meant to distract the other side. That is partof what this kerfuffle, if you will--people raise per-beneficiary payments as if that is something pernicious, something thatshould be avoided, something which is bad.  First, we are setting this kind of in the perspective of  Let mespeak about per-beneficiary payments. For those who are in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the Federal Governmentmakes a per-beneficiary payment to the insurance company to cover that Federal employee. For those States which have a Medicaidmanaged care company contract, the State makes a per-beneficiary payment to the Medicaid managed care company. That is a per-beneficiary payment. The reason I like this is because, inherently, the dollar follows the patient.  Now we are speakingabout this in the context of a Medicaid reform program. Why should Medicaid be reformed? That is the question. Let's speak aboutour current Medicaid system. It is bankrupting States and the Federal Government.[[Page S239]]  In 2009, for the first time, theamount of money spent by States on Medicaid exceeded what they spent on education. Ever since then, Medicaid's expenditures aregoing up, and education expenditures are going down. Despite all this money, we get poor outcomes. Medicaid typically paysphysicians below their cost of seeing a patient.  I pointed out in my speech yesterday that the week ObamaCare passed theHouse of Representatives, Robert Pear, the New York Times journalist, wrote an article in the New York Times following cancerpatients on Medicaid in What Mr.Pear found was an oncologist who had so many Medicaid patients she was goingbankrupt. Indeed, she had to begin to discharge those patients from her practice because she could not pay her bills. We trackeddown one of those patients who was featured, and she died 2 weeks after being discharged from the practice.  Medicaid pays sopoorly that physicians cannot afford to see large numbers.  That said, it isn't just an anecdote from this New York There is a study out of MIT for the National Bureau of Economic Research, I believe it is, that found that with all themoney spent on Medicaid, the beneficiary only receives 20 to 40 percent. The rest goes to institutions.  If we speak about aper-beneficiary payment, substantially all of that money goes to the patient. Under the current scenario, out of an MIT study,only 20 to 40 percent does.  Go back to the oncologist who couldn't afford to see the patients because her reimbursementswere so low. What if the rest of that money, which was not being attributed to the patient, instead could go to pay her doctor,then the patient would have never been discharged.  By the way, on average, States spend 17 percent of their State dollars onIn my own State of Louisiana, it is 19 percent, and in my State this has increased, nearly doubling from the year2000.  Let's go back to the per-beneficiary payment, where the dollar follows the patient, as in, by the way, the insuranceplans that people have under ObamaCare on the exchanges. There is a subsidy that goes to the insurance company that thenprovides for the patient. The dollar follows the patient. So the per-beneficiary continues to do that.  Folks say: Well,there is not enough money in Medicaid; therefore, we have to somehow do things differently. The models we use in privateinsurance will not work in the Medicaid population.  We looked up the SEC report for a Medicaid managed care company, and theMedicaid expansion population, they get $6,000 per enrollee. I just met today with an insurance company that was discussing therates they are going to give on the exchanges next year. It is going to be roughly $5,500 per enrollee will be a year's premium.  So think about this. Those in the Medicaid expansion population have more Federal dollars going to support them than thosecitizens, those fellow Americans who are receiving their insurance on the ObamaCare exchanges. Yet we continue to hear from theMedicaid patients that they have problems accessing specialists.  There is more money in Medicaid than in the privateinsurance market, but the Medicaid patient can't see a specialist because the patient's specialist is being paid below cost andcannot afford to see the patient. There is something incredibly wrong here.  By the way, I should also point out that inStates in which Medicaid is expanded, another MIT study found that 60 percent of those who go on the Medicaid expansion droppedprivate insurance--dropped private insurance--which means they go from kind of paying their own way to the taxpayer paying forthem.  My own State of Louisiana recently expanded It might not have been 60 percent of those on the Medicaidexpansion dropped their insurance, but I am told by the chief insurance company that I think about 70 to 80,000 people droppedprivate insurance to go on Medicaid; 60 or 70 or 80,000 people stopped paying for themselves and asked taxpayers to pay forthem.  That is OK if you are the person going on You no longer have a deductible or a copay. I understand ObamaCareexchanges have $6,000 deductibles, and maybe that is what they had to do, but if we are going to come up with a sustainablesystem, that is not an answer.  What I do is encourage that there be a per-beneficiary payment, that the money follow thepatient. Again, for those who say it is some terrible thing to have a per-beneficiary payment, they are ignoring all theevidence of how it is good. Think of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Probably if somebody is watching onC-SPAN, their spouse or their own policy they get through their employer, the employer pays the insurance company a certainamount of money per employee and per employee family member.  We could also do what Indiana has done. In their HealthyIndiana Plan 2.0, they made per-beneficiary payments, if you will, to Medicaid enrollees, giving them a health savings accountand covering their catastrophic expenses. They found that the Hoosiers who enrolled in this used 40 percent less charity carethan those with traditional insurance. These are all Medicaid patients.  Folks say: Oh, my gosh. Health savings accounts per-beneficiary payments can never work for the poor.  In this case, 70 percent of those enrolled in this program were below theFederal poverty level. Yet, nonetheless, they contributed to their own They continued making those contributions andaltered their behavior to become more cost-conscious, better consumers of health care.  I always say don't underestimatepatients. In my own practice, for 30 years, I worked in a hospital caring for the uninsured, and although the uninsured don'thave some of the advantages in life that others have, they can take care of themselves. They know what is right and what iswrong in terms of their own interests.  So let's make those per-beneficiary payments. Let's not be distracted by those whosomehow make this a bad thing. Let's believe in the American people, that they can handle their own health care and that theydon't need a Washington bureaucrat to tell them how to live their health care lives.

105,topic-id,498,"I thank the chairman for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.5, the Regulatory Accountability  In response to the previous gentleman's comments, I would just note that none of the regulations that we are consideringtoday--the legislation--is going to do away with regulations altogether or even significantly, especially, regulations that haveto do with people's safety. We are not trying to do anything that is going to affect the safety of the American people. We arejust trying to make sure the regulations are smarter, and that is what this is all about.  I am also pleased that title III of H.5 is a bill that I sponsored last term and in this Congress--the Small BusinessRegulatory Flexibility Improvements The Committee on Small Business, which I happen to chair, and the Committee on theJudiciary have crafted this bill with bipartisan input over many years.  I thank Chairman Goodlatte for working with us on this important legislation, and I thank him for his leadership.  Small businesses are found in every congressional district and in every industry. They provide livelihoods for millions ofworkers and for their families. Small businesses employ nearly half of the private sector workforce and generate two out ofevery three new jobs in the private sector today. The Federal Government should be doing everything it can to encourage thesesmall but mighty job creators. Unfortunately, oppressive red tape has had the opposite effect of discouraging investment,expansion, and job growth. I am not saying that all regulations are bad, but there are too many rules. For too long, agencieshave ignored their true effect, their true impact, on small businesses. Small businesses are at a real disadvantage because theyhave fewer resources and rarely have in-house counsel, the regulatory compliance staff that would be necessary to guide themthrough this maze. Generally, small businesses just don't have that.  So shouldn't regulators, at the very least, examine the effects of new rules on small businesses and consider ways to reduceexcessive burdens?  Of course they should. There is a law, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or the RFA, which requires agencies to conduct thiscommonsense assessment when they regulate. Even though the law has been on the books for over 36 years, agencies too frequentlyjust ignore its requirements.                              {time}  1430  The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, which is title III in this bill, eliminates loopholes thatagencies like the Internal Revenue Service have used to avoid compliance with the It also forces agencies to analyze notonly the direct, but also the indirect effects of rules on small businesses, just as agencies are required to do whenpromulgating major rules affecting, for example, the environment. It gives small businesses additional opportunities for earlyinput on proposed rules and regulations and strengthens the RFA's requirements for agencies to periodically review old rules.  Nothing in our legislation today takes away an agency's ability to issue a rule or a regulation, but it will force therulemakers to think carefully before they act. It is great legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,186,PROVIDING FOR ANEXCEPTION TO A LIMITATION AGAINST APPOINTMENT OF,2017.0,11.0,January

138,topic-id,412,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I offer this amendment to address a longstanding problem: agencies not fully analyzing the effects of regulations on smallbusinesses.  Under the current Regulatory Flexibility Act, an agency may certify a rule if it expects that the rule will not have--and Iam quoting the current law here--``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''  When an agency certifies a rule, it does not need to perform a full regulatory flexibility analysis. This provision makessense because not every rule affects small businesses.  Unfortunately, agencies appear to be abusing this provision. According to a recent study, agencies only prepared analysesfor approximately 8 percent of rules finalized between 1996 and 2012.  A recent example of this occurred with the controversial waters of United States rule. The Environmental Protection Agencyand Army Corps of Engineers certified that rule despite the significant and direct consequences for farmers, ranchers, and homebuilders. Most of those are small businesses.  Although the Small Business Administration Chief Counsel for Advocacy sent a letter to the agencies stating that thecertification was improper and urging them to withdraw the rule, the agencies ignored the Chief Counsel and proceeded tofinalize it anyway.                              {time}  1530  This amendment addresses this problem by requiring agencies to include--and I am quoting my amendment--``an economicassessment or a summary thereof that is sufficiently detailed to support the agency's certification.'' This will be published inthe Federal Register as part of the detailed statement and certification for the proposed rule.  This approach mirrors the one used in the National Environmental Policy When an agency finds a project to have nosignificant impacts on the environment, it is required to provide an environmental assessment or a summary of it. Since agenciesare required to provide a threshold analysis when they issue a finding of no significant impact for actions that could affectthe environment, it just makes sense to extend the same type of requirement to rules that could affect small businesses. Smallbusinesses, after all, are the folks that are responsible for creating two-thirds, or about 70 percent, of the new jobs creatednowadays. So anything that burdens these small businesses is something that is, by definition, bad for the economy and bad forjob creation.  This particular amendment, I think, improves the underlying legislation. It makes sense. I urge my colleagues to supportthis amendment, which will further strengthen the RFA and ensure that agencies' decisions are supported by data.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

We will seeif that is going to work out or not.  I would also note that there is nobody on this side of the aisle who thinks we need no government at all, we need noregulations, we need no rules; but we don't want to overregulate the job creators in this country so that they can't createjobs. Those jobs[[Page H362]]that people don't get, those are real people; or people who get knocked out of that employment are realpeople, and they have families. We ought to be supporting them. Overregulation kills those jobs.  I would finally note, relative to climate change, what we are saying is that if we are going to do something, let's do it ina smart manner.

It requires the administration to provide meaningful information aboutupcoming regulations online before those are actually issued. Early online disclosure will create the need for transparency sothe public can see what is on the horizon.  Each month, Federal agencies will be required to list all regulations expected to be proposed or finalized within thefollowing year. For each regulation on the list, the issuing agency is required to provide basic information to the public aboutthat regulation. This includes the objectives of the regulation, the legal basis for the regulation, and where it stands in therulemaking process.  If the agency expects to finalize the regulation within the following year, the agency is also required to provideinformation about the impact of the regulation. This includes estimates on the costs, the completion date, and the economiceffects of the regulation, including the net effect on jobs--something that doesn't happen now but seems to be just common sense.  In this 21st century, Federal agencies should have to show their work online so the public can engage. That is why I likewhat Mr.Ratcliffe has championed since he has become a Member of this Let's also understand and remember that,by the administration's own estimates, Federal regulations promulgated over the last 10 years have imposed the cost of at least$100 billion annually on the American taxpayers.

161,topic-id,546,"Mr.Chairman, the bill before us today promises to update the ways that agencies make and enforce their rulesand regulations. But in many ways, it is a solution in search of a problem. When issuing a rule, Federal agencies must alreadyadhere to rigorous analytical process of considering alternatives, justifying the cost of a rule, and considering input fromstakeholders.  Within this framework, agencies have been granted the necessary latitude to react quickly to urgent crises in consumersafety. It has preserved the safety of our food and our drinking water and has protected our families from defects in theproducts that we rely upon every day. However, the passage of this bill would put that safety and that protection at risk.  With H.5, we are getting six reform bills rolled into one. This sweeping regulatory bill would cumulatively add 60 newprocedural and analytical requirements to the agency rulemaking process, invite frivolous litigation against agencies, empowerspecial interests, and emphasize cost-saving over public protection.  If enacted, H.5 will needlessly create such an enormous burden on the rulemaking process that it threatens to hamstringagencies and discourage them from pursuing new rules at all. In its present form, this bill endangers our Nation'senvironmental, public health, workplace safety, and consumer financial security protections.  My amendment would offer critical protection by exempting rules pertaining to the prevention of the transmission offoodborne illness or assistance to food facilities to meet preventive-control requirements for safety.  Protecting consumers from dangerous food contamination is a worthy goal in and of itself. And this amendment would go evenfurther by protecting jobs and businesses. For example, in 2015, Blue Bell Creameries suffered a deadly listeria contaminationcrisis and had to recall 8 million gallons of ice cream. After the company shut down most of its production, Blue Bell wasforced to lay off 1,450 employees from their jobs, or 37 percent of their workforce, and an additional 1,400 employees werefurloughed.  Chipotle is also still reeling from various outbreaks of coli, salmonella, and norovirus over 2015 and 2016, which causedwidespread panic among customers and the company's shareholders. Despite marketing efforts to repair its reputation, Chipotle'ssales have steadily declined, and it plans to open fewer stores in 2017. This, in turn, had a domino effect on Chipotle's paperbowl supplier who laid off 5 percent of its employees because of decreased demand from  Afterward, both Blue Bell and Chipotle took aggressive remedial steps, such as conducting deep cleansing of equipment andfacilities, changing food preparation procedures, hiring food safety consultants, training employees, and temporarily suspendingoperations. The FDA responded by proposing proactive rules, such as having manufacturers come up with a plan to identifypotential food safety problems and how to respond to them. The FDA also proposed a rule to establish standards for growing,harvesting, packing, and handling produce.  Both these rules could greatly assist businesses in minimizing future food contamination and having to deal with theeconomic aftermath of an outbreak. However, under H.5 in its current form, similar such FDA rules could be delayed by yearsor halted entirely. We can't afford to put consumer safety and our economy at risk while Congress entangles any real possibilityfor immediate and preventative action.  I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment to ensure that we protect the public and health and safety of ourconstituents.  I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Chairman, these bills are a group of bills that have been considered for many years and have passed on partisan votes inthe What you do when you repeal regulations or make it harder to have regulations is you make it better for business,better for the Chamber crowd, better for the manufacturing folk.  But there is always a cost for everything. I think it was Isaac Newton who said: ``For every action, there is an equal andopposite reaction.'' You take these regulations off, increase business, and make it easier; but there is an equal and oppositeeffect in that Newtonian law as the consumer of the products.  Whether it is food and food safety, whether it is water safety and purity, whether it is air safety, whether it is toys andmanufacturers' defects or automobiles and safety in transportation--it could be airplane transportation--there is always a sidethat loses; and the side that loses is that of the consumers and the folks who will be injured and/or killed because of lack ofregulations.

What they don'ttell you is that it is for the insurance companies.  They say it leaves it patient-centered and for the people to deal with it, not the government--because the people will haveto deal with the insurance companies in the future. The people don't want to have to deal with insurance companies when theirclaims are denied, when they won't pay them, when they won't allow them to have certain procedures. That is what the Americanpeople are against.  The Affordable Care Act was insurance reform on steroids. And you can't have all of the insurance reform on steroids withoutgovernment action looking out for the people versus the insurance companies.[[Page H520]]  They also don't tell you about rich people, who the other side is always concerned about, who could use tax credits and geta lot more money for their tax credits because they are at a higher tax rate than others.

We were the only industrialized country in the world without a nationalhealthcare policy, and the Republicans never wanted a national healthcare policy until now.

Teddy Roosevelt cared about it in their party. Richard Nixon cared about it in their party. Mitt Romney cared about it intheir party. But they were mute. They didn't say a word about it.

997,topic-id,824,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind words and for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. As has been made clear, we are actually talkingabout two different pieces of legislation here today.  The waiver for Secretary-designee James Mattis is, quite frankly, a no-brainer. The Senate voted 81-17 in favor of thatwaiver. I would suspect there will be similar bipartisan support here.  My friend is correct, of course; this is a serious matter whenever we grant exceptions to the law. But General Mattis isjust uniformly and universally respected across the lines for his distinguished work in defense of this country, so I hope wemove ahead on that.  The budget resolution that comes before us is another matter, and there will be a great deal of contention. Frankly, theresolution itself is not, as my good friend from California pointed out, and should not be seen as, a traditional budgetaryitem. It is, frankly, a projection of what will happen if we do absolutely nothing over the next decade and leave the currentset of policies in place.  It is a sobering document to read in that regard because it shows rising deficits every single year for a decade, beginningat over $580 billion and then moving well north of $1 trillion. Frankly, in my view, it is something that we ought to look atand come to the realization that we are going to need to do entitlement reform in the next decade, something that people on bothsides of the aisle seem to want to ignore. Absent that, we will, indeed, have extraordinarybudget deficits, and they will be large enough to undercut and undermine our economy.  The budget resolution is also a vehicle, a tool, to begin to repeal the Affordable Care This is necessary for, really,one simple reason. The Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare as it is popularly known, is a failing system. It is unpopular. It hasnever been popular, never hit 50 percent of popularity. Frankly, in my view, it has cost our friends their majority in theHouse, then cost them their majority in the Senate, and may well have cost them the Presidency of the United TheAmerican people have spoken pretty emphatically: We don't like this product. And it is collapsing financially right now. This isnot a system that is an operation that is really doing well.  Let me just talk about my own We have about 197,000 people that have gotten insurance under This year,they will have exactly one choice as to what company they want to choose to provide them, and their rates will go up by 69percent. Now, nationally, I think the average is over 25 percent.  Clearly, this is not a system that is working very well. Politically, the easy thing to do would be what our friends want usto do--let's just leave it alone. It will fall under its own weight, and it will be very clear who is responsible for thatcollapse: the current administration and my friends on the other side. But that also would be the irresponsible thing to do, andthat would be, in itself, an abdication of leadership and, ultimately, unfair to the American people.  Instead, we are going to repeal the system and begin to replace it with something that will work better. Now, my friend'spoint is a fair one. There is not a single plan out there, but there are plenty of plans. I know I cosponsor a couple myself. Ithink we will be able to work through this relatively easily.  There has been a lot of discussion and a lot of diagnosis about what the failures of ObamaCare are, but there has been verylittle in the way of actual legislative remedy. We have a unique opportunity to do that. Frankly, I am proud of our Speaker, andI am proud of our conference that they are going to seize that and begin this process because I don't think there is anythingmore important facing us.  So I would urge the passage of the rule and then the passage, obviously, of the underlying legislation, particularly thebudget resolution that allows us to begin the necessary work in repealing and replacing ObamaCare, and, obviously, the waiverthat would allow us to have a distinguished Secretary of Defense, General  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to point out a couple of things.  First of all, according to the Brookings Institution, without the ACA, insurance premiums would be 44 percent higher.  And the other fact I point out for my colleagues is that healthcare costs are growing at the slowest rate in the last 50years. Families are spending over $3,500 a year less than they would have because of the I would say to my colleagues,yeah, we want to do better, but let's work to address some of the shortcomings of the ACA rather than repeal it and put indanger all these healthcare protections that people have.[[Page H480]]  I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH477-2.txt,2259,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,13.0,January
393,topic-id,513,"Mr.President, one of my toppriorities as a Senator has been to expand access to affordable health care for all I have always believed that thekey to achieving this goal is to bring down the cost of health care, so more Americans can afford to purchase the healthinsurance that they need. During debate over the Affordable Care Act, I raised the concern that the bill's cumbersome ``one sizefits all'' approach would do more harm than good and would result in an even more expensive, broken, and unsustainable healthcare system.  Unfortunately, my fears are now reality. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums for employer-sponsored family health plans now top $18,000 per year, up nearly $5000 since 2009. Deductibles have also been rising: in 2009,only one in five workers enrolled in single-coverage employer plans faced a deductible over $1000. Today more than halfdo.  In Maine, premiums on the Exchange will rise an average of 22 percent this year, and many States are seeing even higherpremium hikes. Meanwhile, fewer insurers are willing to write policies, leaving few choices for consumers who are looking forinsurance.  Some of the ACA's provisions--especially its consumer protections--enjoy bipartisan support and should be retained;however, its Washington-centric approach must be changed if we are ever to truly reform our broken health care system.Nevertheless, this task must be undertaken with care.  There is growing understanding that we cannot simply repeal theAffordable Care Act now and then wait 2 or 3 years to put reforms in place. Doing that would risk harming consumers who relyupon the current system for their insurance and would exacerbate the turmoil in the insurance markets. If we want a smoothtransition from a broken and unaffordable system to a system that finally delivers on the promise of reform, we must carefullyplan how we intend to get from where we are today, to where we need to be tomorrow.  Thus, we are called to act quickly, butnot in haste.

917,topic-id,957,"Mr.President, today I wish to support the legislative waiver required forretired General James Mattis to become the next Secretary of  The principle of civilian control of the military hasbeen fundamental to the concept of American Government since the inception of our It was the Continental Congress thatgranted General George Washington his commission, and General Washington reported to that legislative body throughout the entirewar.[[Page S302]]  At the conclusion of the war, General Washington was the most popular and important figure in He easilycould have positioned himself as the leader of the American government and, in fact, was urged to do so by many. Instead,General Washington famously resigned his commission on December 23, 1783, thus firmly establishing the principle that, in thisnew country, ultimate authority over the Armed Forces would rest with democratically elected civilians. General Washington'snoble act was the foundation of such an important tenet of our democracy that the scene is depicted in a magnificent painting byJohn Trumbull, which occupies a prominent position in the rotunda of the United States  The principle of civiliancontrol of the military was at the center of the debate when the structure of our Armed Forces was dramatically reorganizedafter World War A congressional consensus emerged from the military readiness failures of Pearl Harbor that the modern worldrequired a more significant standing military force with a more centralized command structure. But harkening back to theprecedent established by George Washington, it was imperative that this new structure have civilian leadership. This wasespecially concerning at the time, given the number of remarkable generals who had deservedly attained heroic status in the eyesof the American public and the free world. Thus, in 1947, Congress passed section 202 of the National Security Act, whichprovided that the Secretary of Defense needed to have at least a 10-year gap, later reduced to 7, from any militaryservice.  Since that time, 16 of the past 24 Defense Secretaries have had some prior military service. If approved, however,Mattis would only be the second Defense Secretary to receive a congressional waiver of the law--the other being GeneralGeorge Marshall in 1950.  In order to examine this important history and review the wisdom of granting a waiver for Gen.Mattis, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing exploring the issue of civilian control of the Armed Aftercarefully reviewing the testimony from those hearings, I do support making an additional, one-time exception to the law in thespecific case of James  In 1950, the world was a tumultuous place, with a hot war in Korea coupled with theextraordinary risks associated with a growing cold war in the nuclear age. President Truman turned to General Marshall to serveas Secretary of Defense because his noted character and competence, combined with his experience and ability, made him an idealfit for the unique challenges presented at that time.  Today the world is again a tumultuous place. The combination of thethreat from terrorist organizations like ISIS and al Qaeda, as well as the threats emanating from countries such as Iran, NorthKorea, Russia, and China, has heightened tensions around the globe. And all our international challenges today take placeagainst the backdrop of the knowledge that the world has a large and aging nuclear arsenal that could quickly create chaos inthe wrong hands.  As was the case with Marshall, Mattis, with his exceptional character and competence and hisremarkable skills and ability, is a fit for these dangerous times.  Over the course of his 44-year career in the Marine Corps,Mattis has earned a reputation as a warrior and commander who is beloved by soldiers and veterans alike. The ``warriormonk,'' as he is known in military circles, is a voracious reader and a student of history. He has served as a militarycommander at all levels and all over the world. His assignments have included a combat deployment during the Persian Gulf Warsand difficult leadership posts in both Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom, where Mattiscommanded the 1St Marine Division in the city of  His work over the past decade has demonstrated a deep appreciationfor the challenges our country faces today. In 2006, Mattis coauthored the military's counterinsurgency manual with then-ArmyGeneral David As an expert in counterinsurgency, Mattis understands the crucial role military power plays inconjunction with other civil instruments of national power, including diplomatic and economic efforts.  Between 2007 and 2010,while serving as commander of the now disestablished U.Joint Forces Command, Mattis gained experience in broad DOD policy andmanagement at an organization focused on the transformation of U.military capabilities.  In 2010, I supported Mattis'snomination to serve as commander of U.Central Command, where he oversaw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was responsiblefor an area which includes Syria, Iran, and His experience at CENTCOM is a tremendous asset in developing a coherentstrategy to address the threats posed by state actors and terrorist networks in the region and elsewhere around the world.  In2015, he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the United States' global challenges and offered insight to thecommittee on crafting a coherent, bipartisan national security strategy with an eye towards international diplomacy andalliances, defense budgeting, and military force size and capabilities.  Last year, he coedited a book on civil-militaryrelations that explored the growing cultural gap between civilian society and the military, as well as the impact this lack ofunderstanding may have on the civilian-military relationship.  Finally,I would note that Mattis has the support of threevery capable and successful former Secretaries of Defense whose careers were either largely or entirely in the civilianworkforce. Secretaries Cohen, Panetta, and Gates know as well as anyone what it takes to succeed in that position and theimportance of civilian leadership of the military. Their unqualified support of Mattis carries considerable weight with meand further convinces me that, in this particular circumstance, a waiver is warranted.

I ran a 14-month campaign for Congress not simply to have a prestigious title ahead of my name or to simply come toWashington to point fingers at the other political party and blame everybody else for our Nation's many problems. Rather, I ranfor Congress so I could come here and work to solve our Nation's many challenges.  The First Congressional District of Kentucky stretches from the foothills of Appalachia all the way to the western mostcounties along the Mississippi It is a conservative, rural district comprised of 35 unique counties with the mainindustries being agriculture, coal, and manufacturing.  My constituents feel like Washington has forgotten them. Unfair trade agreements have cost us good-paying manufacturingjobs. The EPA's war on coal has devastated the coal economy and its massive economic spin-off. Overburdensome regulations likewaters of the U.threaten the viability of our family farmers, and an unsustainable government takeover of our healthcaresystem, better known as ObamaCare, has significantly increased healthcare premiums on my small businesses and working middle-class families.  Mr.Speaker, as I stand here today, there is a great sense of hope in My district voted overwhelmingly for DonaldTrump and voted out of office six incumbent Democrat State representatives. My people expressed their displeasure at the polls,and for once they feel like their voices were heard and their votes mattered.  I have heard my people's cries. As a farmer, small-business owner, and parent of three small children, I have also felttheir pain.  Mr.Speaker, I pledge here today to work with my fellow freshmen colleagues, the incoming Trump administration, and theleadership in Congress to make America great again. I am proud that in the first 2 weeks of this Congress we have passed billsto undo the regulatory damage that the Obama administration has done to our businesses. In the coming weeks, I look forward torepealing the failing ObamaCare healthcare system and replacing it with a market-driven healthcare fix. I am confident that Ican play a role in working with the new administration to renegotiate our main trade deals to ensure that American workers areon a level playing field.  There is a better way to run The assault on the private sector must end. The disregard and disrespect forconservative, pro-family values must end. The bloated Federal Government must shrink and Congress must regain control of ourFederal Government away from unelected bureaucrats. That is the will of the people of Kentucky  The voters spoke loudly on November 8. I look forward to working with my fellow freshmen colleagues to ensure that weimprove our economy, abide by the Constitution, and restore the confidence of the American people.

I appreciate the committee's time, attention, and interest in the work of the  I am especially gratified by their support of my push to authorize all of the unauthorized agencies and programs under ourcommittee's jurisdiction. Last Congress, we came very close, but we fell one agency short. The Commodities Future TradingCommission ended the year as it began it, unauthorized.  The Commission, in fact, has not been reauthorized since October 2013. And since that time, the House of Representativeshave voted twice to fix that problem. The most recent effort was in June of 2015. Tomorrow, if we pass H.238, will be thethird time this House has done its work on this oversight business. Under this rule, we have the opportunity to pick up where weleft off and resume the House's debate on the Commodity End-User Relief  The text of H.238 is identical to the legislation passed by this House last Congress, except for four changes:  First, we included a specific annual spending authorization level, and it is set at the same level as last year'sappropriations. This ensures compliance with the majority leader's floor protocols on both specific authorization levels anddiscretionary  Next, two sections were removed because they were already signed into law.  Finally, we removed a section that required the Commission to report to Congress on the status of a pending Board of Traderegistration application. That application has been approved, so there is no longer a reason for the Commission to comply withthat language.  Other than those four changes, the text of H.238 includes every word passed by this House last Congress, includingamendments offered by Mr.Gallego to encourage diversity in the Office of the Chief Economist, as well as Mr.Takai toidentify information security vulnerabilities.  This bill does not just reauthorize the It also makes important process reforms and targeted changes to help MainStreet businesses continue to access the risk management tools that they need to serve their customers.  Over the past 4\1/2\ years, the House Committee on Agriculture has held almost two dozen hearings examining the Commissionand investigating the impacts that the Dodd-Frank Act has had on derivatives markets. What we have found is that some of therules have had unintended consequences for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and other businesses who use these markets toprotect themselves from uncertainty.  Our witnesses, many of whom were market participants struggling to comply with burdensome rules and ambiguous portions ofunderlying statute, were consistent in their call for relief. To address their concerns, H.238 makes reforms that fall intothree broad categories: customer protections, commission reforms, and end-user relief.  The Commodity End-User Relief Act does not roll back any of the key reforms made under Dodd-What it does, however, isallow Congress to keep its promise to Main Street America: Main Street did not cause the financial crisis, so Main Street shouldnot have to pay for it. They shouldn't have to pay for it with new fees. They shouldn't have to pay for it in new complianceobligations. They shouldn't have to pay for it in higher transactions costs. And they shouldn't have to pay for it in lostopportunities to manage their business risks.  I would like to close by thanking Chairman Austin Scott and Ranking Member David Scott for doing much of the heavylifting on the committee's issues. The two of them got deep into the weeds of financial reform.  I would also like to thank Mr.Lucas, who is a sponsor emeritus of this bill. We have been working on this issue sincehe was chairman, and much of the bipartisan work he did remains in this bill.

628,topic-id,3830,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.238, the Commodity End-User Relief  The Commodity End-User Relief Act is a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to makemuch-needed regulatory reforms, and, most importantly, to make statutory changes to protect end users and give them access tothe tools they need to manage their risks.  Over the past 4 years, the House Committee on Agriculture has held almost two dozen hearings that have examined theCommission and have investigated the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act on derivatives markets. Our witnesses, many of whom weremarket participants who were struggling to comply with burdensome rules and ambiguous portions of the underlying statute, wereconsistent in their call for relief. To address their concerns, H.238 makes reforms that fall into three broad categories:customer protections, Commission reforms, and end-user relief.  Title I of the bill protects customers and the margin funds they deposit at their Futures Commission Merchants by codifyingcritical changes made during the collapse and bankruptcies of MF Global and Peregrine Financial  Title II makes meaningful reforms to the operations of the Commission to improve the agency's deliberative process. In doingso, it also requires the Commission to conduct more thorough and robust cost-benefit analysis to help get future rulemakingsright the first time. While the CFTC is already required to consider costs and benefits of the rules it proposes, its work hasbeen called into question by the CFTC's inspector general, who reported the Commission staff seemed to view the process as moreof a legal one than an economic one.  End users are the businesses that provide Americans with food, clothing, transportation, electricity, heat, and much more.Companies that produce, consume, and transport the commodities that make modern life possible use futures and swaps markets toreduce the uncertainty that their businesses face. Farmers hedge their crops in the spring so they know what they will get paidin the fall. Utilities hedge the price of energy so they can charge customers at a steady rate. Manufacturers hedge the cost ofsteel, energy, and other inputs to lock in prices as they work to fill orders.  The fact is that no end user played any part in the financial crisis, and no end user currently poses a systemic risk toU.derivative markets. Yet, as the Agriculture Committee heard in countless hours of testimony, today it is more difficult andmore expensive for them to manage their risks than it was for them 5 years ago. Some of these challenges are the result ofambiguities and oversights in the text of the Commodity Exchange Act, and some of them result from overzealous rulemakings bythe Commission itself.  Today's legislation fixes statutory problems, like section 304, which amends the definition of ``financial entity'' toensure that some end users don't lose their clearing exemption simply because a hedging strategy makes up for losses in aphysical transaction; or like section 315, which makes small changes to the swaps' core principles to align them withconventions in the swaps industry, rather than the futures industry, easing compliance burdens for these newly regulatedentities.  It also fixes problems that have grown out of the CFTC's own rulemakings. For example, section 308 sets aside a Commissionrule that would automatically lower the transaction threshold triggering registration as a swap dealer. This costly, complexregistration process was intended for large financial institutions, but because this registration threshold was set arbitrarily,it has swept up some commodity firms as well.  If the limits fall by 60 percent next year, it could sweep up to 100 more firms into the reach of Dodd-H.238 wouldfix the level at its current $8 billion unless the Commission proposes a new rule with evidence of a needed reduction.Similarly, section 313 exempts religious pension plans and university endowments from a new rule that requires them to registeras commodity pool operators simply because they use standardized hedging products.  What H.238 does not do is roll back a single core tenet of title VII of Dodd-It does not change the execution,clearing, margining, capital, or reporting frameworks set up by that                              {time}  1245  In fact, not a single witness who appeared before the House Committee on Agriculture ever asked us to fundamentally upendthese principles. These are concepts that have been part of the swaps markets long before the financial reform happened. TheCommittee, the Commission, and the industry will continue to grapple with the details of these core tenets, seeking to providethe right mix of flexibility and oversight.  Before I close, I would like to thank members of the Agriculture Committee who sat through all these hearings and all themarkups on this issue. Chairman Austin Scott and Ranking Member David Scott, two of my cosponsors on this legislation,have led most of the Committee's hearings on these issues, and they have done great work.  Together, we have put forward a bipartisan bill that makes narrowly targeted changes to provide relief from regulatoryburdens on American businesses. The Commodity End-User Relief Act offers meaningful improvements for market participants withoutundermining the basic goals of title VII of Dodd-Frank, and it does so by providing the right relief to the right people.  I urge support of the Commodity End-User Relief Act with all its amendments, and I include for the Record letters ofsupport from over 30 groups.

Mike Conaway,     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,     House of Representatives, Washington,      Dear Chairman Conaway: The American Gas Association (AGA)      supports the Commodity End-UserRelief Act (H.238), a bill      to reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) that would      improve Commodity Future TradingCommission (CFTC) operations      and provide much-needed marketplace certainty and regulatory      relief for natural gas utilities andthe American homes and      businesses to which they deliver natural gas.       The American Gas Association (AGA), founded in      1918,represents more than 200 local energy companies that      deliver clean natural gas throughout the United There      are more than72 million residential, commercial and      industrial natural gas customers in the U.S., of which 95      percent--just under 69 millioncustomers--receive their gas      from AGA members. AGA is an advocate for natural gas utility      companies and their customers andprovides a broad range of      programs and services for member natural gas pipelines,      marketers, gatherers, international naturalgas companies and      industry associates. Today, natural gas meets more than one-     fourth of the United States' energy needs.       H.R.238 will benefit our industry by exempting end-user      physical contracts from ``swaps'' and ``options'' regulation      more applicableto sophisticated financial derivative      transactions. Specifically, HR 238 would clarify that      contracts containing delivery termswith volumetric      optionality, but intended to result in the physical delivery      of natural gas, will not be treated by the CFTC asswaps.      Currently, the CFTC has provided some guidance on how      physical natural gas contracts with volumetric optionality      are tobe reviewed for regulatory treatment, but considerable      confusion and uncertainty still exists. This uncertainty has      causedconcern regarding the impact on the willingness of gas      suppliers to offer flexible delivery volume terms, leaving      gas utilitieswith fewer delivery options and more expensive      contracts--costs ultimately passed to the consumer. HR 238      provides neededregulatory certainty to the physical natural      gas marketplace, as requested by AGA and other industry      stakeholders for severalyears.       H.238 will also help the CFTC become a more responsive      and well-equipped regulator by subjecting its rulemakings      toadministrative process reforms and judicial review. Current      CFTC administrative rulemaking procedures are vague and      provideinsufficient avenues for the public to participate in      and seek guidance on rulemakings. This bill would require the      CFTC tocomply with the Administrative Procedures Act to      ensure public notice-and-comment on rules or guidance that      have legally-bindingeffects.       Finally, H.238 would allow the federal appellate courts      to directly review CFTC[[Page H407]]     rules, replacing theprotracted and expensive trial court      process currently in effect as the default rule for judicial      review. This change will notincrease litigation nor will it      disrupt the Rather, it will incentivize the CFTC to      write better rules and avoid challengealtogether. Also, any      inevitable legal challenges will be more swiftly decided by      appellate courts, benefitting the regulatorand the regulated      community. All of the key federal rulemaking agencies are      subject to direct appellate review--including theSecurities      Exchange Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory      There is no logical justification to treat the            Congress certainly did not intend to provide the CFTC a      large new regulatory mandate without giving it thenecessary      guidance and authority to do its job. Furthermore, Congress      did not intend for the CEA to constrain liquidity in      thephysical natural gas marketplace, create business-changing      impacts on regulated natural gas utilities, or increase the      costs ofreliable service for natural gas consumers. As such,      AGA supports the Commodity End-User Relief Act because it      provides the CFTCwith the tools necessary to be a responsive      regulator and restores the regulatory confidence that natural      gas utilities rely onto procure natural gas supplies at the      lowest reasonable cost for the benefit of America's natural      gasconsumers.

Michael Conaway,     Collin Peterson,     Committee on Agriculture, House ofRepresentatives,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson: On      behalf ofthe American Public Power Association (APPA), I am      writing in support of H.238, the Commodity End-User Relief      Act (CERA) of2017. The legislation includes important relief      for public power utilities and other end-users seeking to use      swaps to hedgecommercial-operations risks.       Community-owned, not-for-profit public power utilities      power homes and businesses in 2,000communities --from small      towns to large cities. They safely provide reliable, low-cost      electricity to more than 49 millionAmericans, while      protecting the environment. These utilities generate or buy      electricity from diverse sources. They employ93,000 people      and earn $58 billion in revenue each year. Public power      supports local commerce and jobs and invests back into      thecommunity.       Public power utilities use swaps, options, forward      contracts and other tools to manage commercial      operationsrisks. As not-for-profit entities, their goal is to      provide affordable and reliable power to customers. APPA      supports the marketclarity and oversight provided by the      Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), and supports appropriately      funding the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission (CFTC). To      date, however, implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act      amendments to the CEA shows clear short-comings.       CERA would address these concerns, for example, by      codifying CFTC rules allowing public power utilities to      enterswaps with the full array of counterparties to swaps      needed to hedge their commercial operations risks. CERA would      also addressissues related to the definition of ``bona fide      hedging,'' swap reporting in illiquid markets, and forward      contracts withvolumetric optionality. These provisions would      help public power utilities and other commercial end users.       On the whole, webelieve these provisions will ensure that      public power utilities can continue to make full use of      financial tools necessary tokeep electric power prices stable      and affordable to our customers.       Thank for your time andconsideration.           Sincerely,                                                   Susan Kelly,     President &                                  ____                                        Chamber of Commerce of The                                      United States ofAmerica,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.       To the Members of the U.House of Representatives:The      U.Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.238, the      ``Commodity End-User Relief Act.'' H.238 would reauthorize      theCommodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and enact      a number of important reforms to provide regulatory relief      for endusers of the derivatives market. It would also promote      accountability at the CFTC and protect Main Street businesses      fromonerous and unintended consequences of derivatives      regulation.       The Chamber supports several amendments being offered to      H.R.238. Specifically, the Chamber supports Congressman      Lucas' amendment to provide relief to Main Street businesses      by clarifyingthe treatment of interaffiliate swaps. The      amendment would drive down the cost of using derivatives by      end-users and help MainStreet businesses employ safe and      effective risk management strategies on a more cost-effective      basis.       The Chamber alsosupports the amendment sponsored by      Congressman Duffy and Congressman Scott to clarify that the      CFTC shall not have theauthority to access proprietary source      code without a subpoena. Their amendment would protect highly      sensitive intellectualproperty, which would respect      established due process rights and ensure that proprietary      source code does not fall into thewrong hands as a result of      a cyberattack or wrongdoing.       Finally, as the bill moves forward, the Chamber urges      considerationof how best to address the cross-border      regulation of derivatives. We strongly believe that H.238      should appropriatelyreflect the potential impact of punitive      or excessive cross-border rules on Main Street businesses      seeking to prudently hedgetheir commercial and market risks,      both in the U.and abroad. We look forward to continuing to      work with the sponsors of H.R.238 on this issue as the bill      moves forward.       The Chamber commends the House of Representatives for      prioritizing regulatoryreform in the 115th Congress and urges      the House to approve H.238 and the amendments listed above      as expeditiously aspossible.           Sincerely,     Jack                                  ____                                               ChurchAlliance,                                                  January 9, 2017.                                             Michael Conaway,     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,     House of Representatives,Washington,       Dear Chairman Conaway: On behalf of the Church Alliance, I      write to thank you foryour leadership on H.238, the      ``Commodity End-User Relief Act.''       The Church Alliance is a coalition of the chief      executiveofficers of 37 church benefit programs. It includes      mainline Protestant denominations, two branches of Judaism,      and Catholicdioceses, schools and institutions. The benefit      programs (``church plans'') provide retirement and health      benefits to more than1 million clergy, lay workers, and their      family members.       H.238 contains a provision expanding the church plan      exemptionfrom the commodity pool operator (``CPO'') and      commodity trading advisor (``CTA'') rules under the Commodity      Exchange Act(``CEA'') to include church plan-related      accounts, such as endowments or foundations of churches and      church-controllednonprofits. The provision was included by a      bipartisan, broadly-supported amendment during the House      Agriculture Committee'sconsideration of CFTC reauthorization      legislation in the 114th       Under current law, church plans are generally exemptfrom      the CPO and CTA requirements; however, the exemption does not      include church plan-related accounts. Church benefits      boardsoften use investment managers or advisers that engage      in commodities transactions for the purposes of      diversification andhedging. Church benefits boards also have      the ability to pool plan assets with other church-related      funds purely for investmentmanagement purposes for the      benefit of the church. This reduces investment fees for      church-related entities, as well as benefitplan participants      by providing economies of scale.       In contrast to the CEA and implementing regulations, the      securities lawscontain necessary exemptions for church plans      and church plan-related accounts for the same reason noted      above. Under theselaws, church plans are not required to      register or report as investment companies, register      securities held, or discloseinformation about the securities      they hold.       H.238 similarly exempts church plans and church plan-     related accounts from thecommodity pool definition and from      CTA registration requirements. The exemptions would provide      parity between securities andcommodities laws concerning      church plans and church plan-related accounts. Additionally,      the exemptions would reduce the cost tochurch plans and would      ensure they have the full benefit of commodities investments      that provide diversification, opportunitiesto hedge, and      returns. The ultimate benefit would be to clergy and church      lay worker participants in the retirement and welfareplans,      who have devoted their lives to the work of the church.       We respectfully urge the enactment of CFTC      reauthorizationlegislation which includes much-needed relief      for church plans and church-plan related accounts from the      CPO and CTArequirements, along the lines of H.238, as soon      as possible. Thank you for your leadership and support on      this importantissue.           Sincerely yours,     Barbara                                  ____                                     Commodity MarketsCouncil,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.

When discussing how to ensure robust markets, consumer protections, and relief for end users,H.238 truly represents a true agreement. After all, the end users are our customers. They are the whole reason for thislegislation and this entity to begin with.

While wemay vote differently on this bill, he and I generally work well together on a myriad of issues that face not only productionagriculture, but rural America as well, and I thank him for his work, even though we may not vote exactly the same way today.  Over the past 4 years, the Committee on Agriculture heard dozens of witnesses about the upheaval end users have been facingwhile trying to use derivative markets in the wake of the post-crisis financial reforms. While this Congress took affirmativesteps in Dodd-Frank to protect end users from harm, today it is clear that there is still work to be done. have been facing while trying to use derivative markets in the wake of the post-crisis financial reforms. While thisCongress took affirmative steps in Dodd-Frank to protect end users from harm, today it is clear that there is still work to bedone.  It isn't enough to simply raise these issues and hope that the CFTC will take care of them for us--for one, sometimes theycannot. There are numerous small oversights in the statute that have big implications for end users that we must correct in thislegislation.  Currently, the CEA defines some utility companies as financial entities, stripping them of their status as end users. TheCommission can't fix this.  The core principles for SEFs, which were added to the CEA by Dodd-Frank, were lifted almost word for word from the coreprinciples for futures exchanges, even though swaps exchanges and futures exchanges operate completely differently and SEFscannot perform many of the functions of a futures exchange. The Commission cannot fix this.  Certainly, the Commission can and has tried to paper over these problems, issuing staff letters explaining how it will dealwith incongruities in the law. But that isn't good enough. We know the problems. We should fix them, and fix them now.  Sometimes, though, the problem isn't the statute. There are a number of end-user issues that we have heard testimony aboutwhich the CFTC will not fix, because the Commission simply disagrees with Congress about how to apply the law. We know theseproblems also.  The Commission has promulgated a rule that reduces the transaction threshold to be considered a swap dealer from $8 billionto $3 billion, a 60 percent decline, while it is still studying the matter. We should require that the CFTC complete the studyand have a public vote on that matter.  The Commission has proposed a new method of granting bona fide hedge exemptions that is significantly narrower than thecurrent method, upending longstanding hedging conventions for market participants. This proposal has the added disadvantage ofbeing dramatically more labor intensive for the We should insist that historic hedging practices be protected.  The Commission has issued a new rule on ownership, control, and reporting that it knows isn't working. They have delayed itsimplementation for over 3 years by continuing to parcel out temporary reprieves. We should insist the Commission amend the ruleso that market participants know definitively what their compliance obligations are.  The definition of swap does not exclude transactions that are wholly contained within a single company and not marketfacing. Regulators have used this leeway to require businesses and financial institutions to follow rules that are, quitefrankly, inappropriate for risk management purposes and costly for the companies to use them. We should amend the statute, tomake it clear that inter-affiliate transactions should not be regulated the same way as publicly transacted swaps.  The challenges facing businesses who hedge their risks in derivatives markets are real. Today we have an opportunity to fixsome of those problems. Every dollar that a business can save by better managing its risk is a dollar available to grow thatbusiness, pay higher wages, and lower costs to consumers or protect investors.  Over the past week, over 30 organizations representing thousands of American businesses have voiced their support for theimportant reforms in the Commodity End-User Relief Businesses from farm country to major manufacturers, to public utilitiesneed every tool available to manage their businesses and reduce the uncertainties they face each day in today's global economy.

Notably, this      legislation reauthorizes the CommodityFutures Trading      Commission (CFTC), which has been without statutory      authorization for almost four years. In addition      toreauthorizing the CFTC, Congress has historically taken the      opportunity of reauthorization to periodically review and      enhancethe CFTC's authorities. This is essential in a      regulatory environment where the marketplace is extremely      dynamic. Given theconstantly evolving structure to which      these regulatory authorities apply, it is prudent for      Congress to consider updating thestatute in response to      market changes. We commend the House Committee on Agriculture      for efforts to build upon previous work andadvance this      legislation.       H.238 contains prudent internal risk controls to      safeguard market data and improved customerprotections sought      by the market participants who rely on derivatives to manage      their risks. These are examples of policyenhancements that      have garnered tremendous favor in recent years as evidenced      by the bi-partisan support they have received inprevious      Congressional sessions.       As noted above, the constant evolution of the markets      regulated by the CFTC has advancedeven since the last time      the House of Representatives passed similar legislation,      which warrants the introduction of newstatutory updates      expected to be offered as floor amendments. In particular,      FIA would like to lend our support to the bi-partisan Duffy/     Scott amendment protecting critical intellectual property      that is key to the innovative culture in the      Additionally, we commend Congresswoman Hartzler for her      amendment recognizing the need to improve the quality      ofinformation submitted for the Commission's surveillance and      large trader reporting programs.       We look forward to seeing thiseffort advance to the Senate      where we expect to have continued dialogue on refinements.           Sincerely,     President and                                 ____         International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2015.

These members comprise      a broad range ofderivatives market participants, including      corporations, investment managers, government and      supranational entities, insurancecompanies, energy and      commodities firms, and international and regional banks.

Information about ISDA and its activities      isavailable on the Association's web site: www.isda.org.       H.238 would codify new regulatory customer protections      and enhanceoversight of the Commodity Futures Trading      The Commodity End-User Relief Act would also ease      the regulatory burdensplaced on end-users. These are measures      that ISDA supports.       Please also note that, while ISDA appreciates and supports      theCommodity End-User Relief Act, we look forward to working      with Congress to ensure that the cross-border provisions of      the billare further addressed during the course of the      legislative process.       ISDA urges you to vote for H.238. Thank you for      yourconsideration of our views. If you have any questions,      please do not hesitate to contact our Head of US Public      PolicyChristopher           Sincerely,                                                    Scott O'Malia,     Chief Executive                                  ____                                          The Jewish Federations,                                             of North America,                                  Washington DC, January 11, 2017.     MichaelConaway,     Chairman, House Agriculture Committee, Washington,       Dear Chairman Conaway: TheJewish Federations of North      America (JFNA) is writing to express our support for H.     238, the ``Commodity End-User ReliefAct.'' We are      particularly supportive of section 313 of the bill which      provides for the exemption of qualified      charitableorganizations from designation and regulation as      commodity pool operators.       JFNA is the national organization that representsand serves      149 Jewish Federations across the United States and North      In their communities, Jewish Federations andrelated      Jewish community foundations serve as the central address for      fundraising and support for an extensive network of      Jewishhealth, education and social services in their area.      Part of the charitable mission of Jewish federations and      Jewish communityfoundations is to help grow the endowment      assets of their organizations as well as those of related      Jewish agencies andsynagogues who have entrusted their      endowment funds with them. This is accomplished through      pooling investment assets tomaximize financial return,      minimize cost and risk, and take advantage of investment      expertise and economies of scale. Increasedendowment dollars      translate into more current support of essential program      activities as well as helping to assure the long-     termviability of Jewish organizations and institutions. The      enactment of H.238 will harmonize the registration      exemptions betweensecurities and commodities laws and      regulations and exempt qualified charities from registering      their pooled funds as commoditypools or as commodity pool      operators. This exemption will eliminate confusion, spare      needless legal costs, and ensure that suchorganizations as      Jewish federations and foundations can continue to invest in      widely diversified instruments in order tomaximize returns to      their beneficiaries who use such investment income to provide      additional social services to the most needyamong us.       Thank you again for efforts to ensure the enactment of the      Commodity End-User Relief JFNA and the federationsystem      stand ready to help you in any way to achieve this important      goal. If you have any questions regarding JFNA and      itsinvolvement in this issue I urge you to contact Steven      Woolf, JFNA Senior Tax Policy           Sincerely,                                             William C.Daroff,                         Senior Vice President for Public Policy &     Director, of the Washington                                  ____                                                        NRECA,                                   Arlington, VA,January 10, 2017.     Mike Conaway,     Chairman, House Committee on Agriculture, Washington,     CollinPeterson,     Ranking Member, House Committee on Agriculture, Washington,                Dear Chairman Conawayand Ranking Member Peterson: The      National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA)      supports the Commodity End UserRelief Act (H.238),      legislation to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading      Commission (CFTC) to be considered on the Housefloor this      week.       NRECA is the national service organization representing      over 900 not-for-profit, member-owned, ruralelectric      cooperative systems, which serve 42 million customers in 47      states. NRECA estimates that cooperatives own and maintain2.5      million miles or 42 percent of the nation's electric      distribution lines covering three-quarters of the nation's      landmass.Cooperatives serve approximately 18 million      businesses, homes, farms, schools and other establishments in      2,500 of the nation's3,141 counties.       Electric cooperatives are commercial end-users and not      financial entities. NRECA believes that      Congressionaloversight is essential to help ensure that the      CFTC is implementing the Dodd-Frank Act as Congress intended.      To that end, NRECAsupports H.238 as a means to ensure that      resources at the CFTC are prioritized to protect against      systemic risk to ourfinancial system, and to regulate swap      dealers and large traders, and not fruitlessly focused on the      everyday commoditytransactions with which end-users hedge      commercial risks arising from ongoing business operations.       Importantly, H.238amends the Commodity Exchange Act      (CEA) in a very narrow but critical way: to clarify      Congressional intent that the CFTC shallnot regulate as      ``swaps'' nonfinancial commodity contracts that are intended      to be physically settled, whether those contractsare forward      contracts or commodity trade options. Our members use these      physical contracts to manage supply and demand forenergy      resources, and to keep the lights on for American businesses      and consumers. NRECA is also particularly interested in      H.R.238 language that reduces onerous recordkeeping      requirements, as well as a codified resolution to the utility      special entityrequirement that would otherwise negatively      impact such utilities and their customers.       NRECA appreciates the Committee'scontinued work on CFTC      reauthorization legislation this Congress, and urges Members      of Congress to support H.238 when it isconsidered by the      House of           Sincerely,                                                     Jim Matheson,                                                        CEO,NRECA.[[Page H414]]                                       ____                                                       SIFMA,                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2017.

Further, SIFMA appreciates efforts to establish a workable      framework for cross-border regulation ofderivatives      transactions. We look forward to continuing to work with the      Committee in an effort to consider this importantissue. SIFMA      urges you to vote for H.238.

673,topic-id,594,"Mr.Chairman, the amendment I offer today will clarify amendments made to the Commodity Exchange Act by Dodd-Frank and require the CFTC to actually determine that position limits will, in fact, help reduce excessive speculation beforethey implement those new rules.  This past fall, my colleagues and I all ran for reelection promising to reduce government regulation and eliminate rulesthat needlessly burden the economy. As we consider the CFTC's ongoing work, we should look no further than the position limitsrulemaking to begin that task.  Position limits are a tool that have merit and purpose in regulating the commodities market. Today, designated contractmarkets core principle V requires every U.exchange to impose, as is necessary and appropriate, position limits or positionaccountability levels on the contracts they offer.  Further, there are several agricultural contracts that have long-established and well understood federally mandated positionlimits. My amendment will not change any of those existing position limits regime.  Prior to Dodd-Frank, the law was clear: if the Commission wanted to impose position limits, it first had to make adetermination that such limits would diminish, eliminate, or prevent the burdens of excessive speculation. Post-Dodd-Frank, thecourts have ruled that additions to the statute have rendered it ambiguous.  Chairman Massad and I have disagreed for the past 3 years about how to read the statute. So today, my amendment fixes theambiguity by affirmatively requiring the Commission to determine that position limits will serve to reduce the burdens ofexcessive speculation before they put them in place.  It is important that the Commission affirmatively determines the need for position limits because limits are an unmistakableburden on market participants.  The current position limits proposal will cost market participants substantially in time and money to comply with. Mostimportantly, it fundamentally changes the way hedgers can seek relief from the rules.  Agricultural producers and processors, power companies, and other commercial hedgers may have fewer bona fide hedges. Whatis more, they might get a hedge exemption, only to get a call from Washington telling them their hedge is invalid and they mustliquidate their position.  The proposal also imposes new recordkeeping and reporting obligations on Futures Commission Merchants, exchanges, and marketparticipants. Less well understood, but no less important, is the impact that position limits in later months might have onmarket liquidity.  Position limits do not have anything to do with the long-term price of commodities. The price of oil, no matter how high itclimbs or how low it falls, is driven by supply and demand.  Congress itself recognized this when it characterized the burdens of excessive speculation as the sudden or unreasonablefluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price of a commodity. There is nothing sudden about a year's-long run-up or a year's-long decline in commodity prices.  That said, I agree there is a role for position limits to play in the management of our commodity markets, especially inmanaging the convergence of prices at the expiration of a contract. But limits are a regulatory tool to promote orderly markets,not a silver bullet to lower commodity prices for consumers.  As a tool, they need to be calibrated to the unique characteristics and historical patterns of each commodity. We cannotimpose them in blind faith that more regulation automatically improves markets.  My amendment is agnostic about the merits of position limits, but it is clear about the need for the government to justifyits rules that restrict economic activity.  As this Congress sets about reducing regulatory burdens, it is important that we start by requiring the CFTC to make adetermination about the need for further regulations before they act.

The CFTC found there are no reputable economic studies which fully endorsethis view of how the commodity futures markets work.

153,topic-id,360,"Mr.Chair, I rise today in opposition to this amendment and in strong opposition to the RegulatoryAccountability  This bill is another thinly veiled mechanism for the majority to attack agency rulemaking with which they disagree.  This amendment would prevent agencies from publicly disclosing information that, quote, ``directly advocates, in support ofor against the proposed rule, for the submission of information to form part of the record of review for the proposed rule.''  I am concerned that the way this language is written it could restrict agencies from providing information about thebenefits of a rule and soliciting public feedback.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to solicit public comments on proposed rules except in narrowcircumstances. We should be encouraging agencies to solicit public comments in order to provide businesses, consumer groups, andother members of the public with the opportunity to make suggestions to the agency for improving the proposed rule.  Agency employees are already barred under appropriations bills from engaging in publicity or propaganda.  Agency employees are specifically barred from engaging in ``substantial `grassroots' lobbying campaigns'' when thosecampaigns are aimed at encouraging members of the public ``to pressure Members of Congress to support Administration orDepartment legislative or appropriations proposals.''  While transparency is always helpful in the regulatory process, a requirement that agencies report to Congress everycommunication to the public--including every oral communication from an agency official--would be unnecessarily burdensome andwould not be feasible for agencies.  The GAO has already defined covert communications, self-aggrandizement, and purely partisan activities as categories ofagency communications that are often restricted by these appropriations riders.  Agencies are authorized to regulate by Congress, but this amendment would further handicap federal agencies from fulfillingtheir critical missions.  Under the guise of ``accountability'' this amendment is not even a thinly disguised attempt to muzzle commonsense regulationby suppressing even the ability to explain the proposed rule in the first place.

93,topic-id,4174,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in opposition, of course, to H.5, the so-called Regulatory Accountability  Under the guise of improving the regulatory process, H.5 will, in truth, undermine that process and jeopardize theability of government agencies to safeguard public health and safety, the environment, workplace safety, and consumer financialprotections.  It is not a pleasant picture. The ways in which this legislation accomplishes this result are almost too numerous to listhere, but, of course, I will mention a few.  For example, title I of the bill would impose more than 70 new analytical requirements that will add years to the rulemakingprocess.  Is that what we want to do? I don't think so.  Worse yet, many of these new requirements are intended to facilitate the ability of regulated entities--such as well-fundedcorporate interests--to intervene and derail regulatory protections they oppose. And it would function as a ``super-mandate,''overriding critical laws that Congress specifically intended to prohibit agencies from considering costs when American lives areat stake.  Additionally, the bill creates numerous procedural hurdles in the rulemaking process, further endangering American livesthrough years of delay and increasing the likelihood of regulatory capture.                              {time}  1400  For example, H.5 dramatically expands the use of formal rulemaking, a time- and resource-intensive process, requiringformal, trial-like hearings for certain rules. Formal rulemaking has long been roundly rejected for good cause as beingexcessively costly and ill-suited for complex policy issues.  The administrative section of the American Bar Association noted that ``these provisions run directly contrary to a virtualconsensus in the administrative law community that the Administrative Procedure Act formal rulemaking procedure is obsolete.''  I am also concerned that H.5 would impose an arbitrary, one-size-fits-all, 6-month delay on virtually every new rule.Specifically, title V of the bill will prohibit agency rules from becoming effective until the information required by the billhas been available online for 6 months with only limited exception.  Clearly, H.5 fails to take into account a vast array of time-sensitive rules ranging from the mundane, such as thefrequent United States Coast Guard bridge closings regulations, to those that protect public health and safety, such asforthcoming updates to the Lead and Copper Rule by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the lead in public drinkingwater.  Finally, title II of H.5 would eliminate judicial deference to agencies and require Federal courts to review all agencyrulemakings and interpretations of statutes on a de novo basis. The unfortunate result of this requirement is that the billwould empower a generalist court to override the determinations of agency experts, regardless of the judge's technical knowledgeand understanding of the underlying subject matter.  By eliminating any deference to agencies, H.5 would force agencies to adopt even more detailed factual records andexplanations, which would further delay the finalization of critical lifesaving regulatory protections.  The Supreme Court has recognized that Federal courts simply lack the subject-matter expertise of agencies, are politicallyunaccountable, and should not engage in making substantive determinations from the bench. It is ironic that those who have longdecried judicial activism now support facilitating a greater role for the judiciary in agency rulemaking.  These are only a few of the many serious concerns presented by H.5, and, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to stronglyoppose this dangerous legislation.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                                       AFL-CIO                                            Legislative Alert,                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2017.       DearRepresentative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing      to express our strong opposition to H.5, the      RegulatoryAccountability Act of 2017. This sweeping bill,      which packages six anti-regulatory measures passed by the      House in the lastCongress, would upend 40 years of labor,      health, safety and environmental laws, threaten new needed      protections leaving workersand the public in danger. The AFL-     CIO urges you to oppose this harmful legislation.       The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA)is drafted as an      amendment to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), but it      goes far beyond establishing procedures forrulemaking. The      RAA acts as a ``super mandate'' overriding the requirements      of landmark legislation such as the OccupationalSafety and      Health Act and Mine Safety and Health The bill would      require agencies to adopt the least costly rule, instead      ofthe most protective rule as is now required by the OSH Act      and MSH It would make protecting workers and the      publicsecondary to limiting costs and impacts on businesses      and corporations.       The RAA will not improve the regulatory process; itwill      cripple it. The bill adds dozens of new analytical and      procedural requirements to the rulemaking process, adding      years toan already slow process. The development of major      workplace safety rules already takes 8--10 years or more,      even for rules wherethere is broad agreement between      employers and unions on the measures that are needed to      improve protections. OSHA's silicastandard to protect workers      from deadly silica dust took nearly 19 years and the      beryllium standard 15 years. The RAA willfurther delay needed      rules and cost workers their lives.       The RAA substitutes formal rulemaking for the current      procedures forpublic participation for high impact rules and      other major rules upon request. These formal rulemaking      procedures will make itmore difficult for workers and members      of the public to participate, and give greater access and      influence to business groupsthat have the resources to hire      lawyers and lobbyists to participate in this complex process.      For agencies that already providefor public hearings, such as      OSHA and MSHA, the bill would substitute formal rulemaking      for the development of all new rules,overriding the effective      public participation processes conducted by these agencies.       H.5 would subject allagencies--including independent      agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the      National Labor Relations Board (NLRB),Consumer Product Safety      Commission (CPSC), and the Consumer Financial Protection      Bureau (CFPB) to these new analytical andprocedural      requirements. It would be much more difficult for agencies to      develop and issue new financial reform rules andconsumer      protection rules required under recently enacted legislation.       This radical legislation doesn't just apply toregulations;      it would also require agencies to analyze the costs and      benefits of major guidance documents, even though      thesedocuments are non-binding and have no legal force.      Guidance documents are an important tool for agencies to      disseminateinformation on significant issues and hazards      quickly in order to protect the public and workers. For      example, in response tothe Ebola virus threat, the Centers      for Disease Control (CDC) issued critical guidance documents      in order to prevent the spreadof disease, including      recommendations for infection control and protections for      healthcare workers and emergency responders.Similar guidance      was issued was issued to prevent transmission of the Zika      virus. Under the RAA's provisions, CDC would berequired to      assess the costs and benefits of these major guidance      documents, making it virtually impossible to      provideinformation and recommendations in a timely manner.       H.5 also includes a grab bag of other harmful anti-     regulatory measuresthat thwart, weaken and undermine      protections. The Separation of Powers Restoration Act      abolishes judicial deference toagencies' statutory      interpretations in rulemaking requiring a court to decide all      relevant questions of law de novo, allowingcourts to      substitute their own policy judgements for the agencies'      expert policy determinations. The Small Business      RegulatoryFlexibility Improvements Act (SBRFIA) imposes      numerous unnecessary new analytical and procedural      requirements on all agencies.It gives the Chief Counsel of      the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Advocacy,      which in practice operates largelyas a mouthpiece for large      business interests, new broad powers to second guess and      challenge agency rules. The RequireEvaluation before      Implementing Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act) would      automatically stay the implementation of any rule withan      estimated annual cost of $1 billion that has been challenged,      precluding courts from making this decision, and      delayingprotections. Other titles add even more unnecessary      requirements to the rulemaking process.       The Regulatory Accountability Actwould gut the nation's      safety, health and environmental laws, stripping away      protections[[Page H326]]     from workers and the public. Itwould tilt the regulatory      process solidly in favor of business groups and others who      want to stop regulations and make itvirtually impossible for      the government to issue needed safeguards. The AFL-CIO      strongly opposes H.5 and urges you to voteagainst this      dangerous legislation.

House of Representatives,     Washington,      Dear Representative: Consumer Reports and its policy and      mobilization arm, Consumers Union,urge you to vote no on H.     5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. This dangerous      proposal would do severe damage toprotections consumers      depend on for health, safety, and honest treatment.       Congress has charged federal agencies withprotecting the      public from threats such as tainted food, hazardous products,      dirty air and water, and predatory financialschemes. It      established these agencies, such as the Food and Drug      Administration, Consumer Product Safety      Commission,Environmental Protection Agency, and Consumer      Financial Protection Bureau, so that public protections could      be overseen byprofessional civil servants with specific      technical and scientific expertise. In developing      regulations, agencies must act inaccordance with the statute      and with established rulemaking procedures that require      transparency and full opportunity for publicinput, including      input from the industry that will be subject to the      regulation.       We agree that the regulatory process cancertainly be      improved. We stand ready to support constructive efforts to      reduce delays and costs while preserving      importantprotections.       However, rather than streamlining and improving the      regulatory process, the Regulatory Accountability Act of2017      would make current problems even worse. Under H.5,      agencies would be required to undertake numerous costly      andunnecessary additional analyses for each rulemalcing,      which could grind proposed rules to a halt while wasting      agencies'resources. Collectively, these measures would create      significant regulatory and legal uncertainty for businesses,      increase coststo taxpayers and businesses alike, and prevent      the executive branch from keeping regulations up to date with      the rapidlychanging modern economy.       One of the most damaging effects of H.5 is that it      would, with only limited exceptions, requirefederal agencies      to identify and adopt the ``least costly'' alternative of a      rule it is considering. Currently, landmark lawslike the      Clean Air Act, Consumer Product Safety Act, and Securities      Exchange Act require implementing agencies to put toppriority      on the public interest. H.5 would reverse this priority by      requiring agencies to value the bottom-line profits ofthe      regulated industry over their mission to protect consumers      and a fair, well-functioning marketplace.       H.5 also includesseveral other damaging measures that      have not been included previously as part of the Regulatory      Accountability Thesemeasures would add unjustifiable      costs and uncertainty to the rulemalcing process, and greatly      impair regulatory agencies'work.       Contrary to its name, the ``Separation of Powers      Restoration Act'' (Title II of H.5) would disrupt the      carefullydeveloped constitutional balance between the      legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Courts giving      appropriate deferenceto reasonable agency interpretations of      their own statutes, as reflected in Chevron U.S.A., Inc., v.      NRDC, 467 U.837 (1984),is a well-settled approach that      promotes sound and efficient agency enforcement, with      effective judicial review. Under theChevron doctrine, courts      retain full judicial power to review agency legal      interpretations, but do not simply substitute theirown      judgment for an agency's. Chevron recognizes that agencies      accumulate uniquely valuable expertise in the laws      theyadminister, which makes deference from reviewing courts--     which do not have that expertise--appropriate.       Overturning thisapproach would lead to disaster. It would      severely hamper effective regulatory agency enforcement of      critical protections onwhich consumers depend. As the Supreme      Court stated in City of Arlington, v. F.C.C., 133      1863, 1874 (2013):``Thirteen Courts of Appeals applying a      totality-of-the-circumstances test would render the binding      effect of agency rulesunpredictable and destroy the whole      stabilizing purpose of The excessive agency power      that the dissent fears would bereplaced by chaos.'' Such a      move also would needlessly force the courts to repeatedly      second-guess agency decisions that thecourts have already      concluded the agency is in the best position to make.       The REVIEW Act and the ALERT Act (Titles IV and Vof H.5)      would cause additional needless and damaging delays to public      protections. The REVIEW Act--which would block ``high-     impact'' rules until every industry legal challenge has run      its full course--would tie up agencies in court      indefinitely,potentially making it impossible to address      pressing national problems. The ALERT Act would subject most      new rules to a delay ofat least six months, and require      agencies to waste resources complying with repetitive      reporting requirements.       Like thebill's proponents, we believe regulations should be      smart, clear, and cost-effective. However, H.5 does not      accomplish thisobjective. Instead of improving the regulatory      process, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 would make      it dramaticallyslower, more costly to the nation, and far      less effective at protecting health, safety, and other      essential consumerpriorities.       We strongly urge you to stand up for critical public      protections and vote no on H.5.           Sincerely,     LauraMacCleery,       Vice President, Consumer Policy and Mobilization, Consumer          George Slover,       Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers     William C.Wallace,       Policy Analyst, Consumers                                  ____                               Consumer Federation of America,                                                 January 10, 2017.     Re Oppose legislation on House Floor to undermine          crucialconsumer protections: H.5.       Dear Representative: The Regulatory Accountability Act of      2017(H.5) would handcuff all federal agencies in their      efforts to protect consumers. H.5 is a vastly expanded      version ofprevious versions of the Regulatory Accountability      Act (RAA). H.5 not only significantly and problematically      amends theAdministrative Procedures Act (APA) which has      guided federal agencies for many decades but also now      incorporates five additionalbills that thwart the regulatory      process: the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility      Improvement Act; the Require Evaluationbefore Implementing      Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act); the All Economic      Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT Act); theSeparation of      Powers Restoration Act; and the Providing Accountability      Through Transparency These titles make an      alreadydamaging bill even worse.       Specifically, the RAA would require all agencies,      regardless of their statutorily mandatedmissions, to adopt      the least costly rule, without consideration of the impact on      public health and safety or the impact on ourfinancial      marketplace. As such, the RAA would override important      bipartisan laws that have been in effect for years, as well      asmore recently enacted laws to protect consumers from unfair      and deceptive financial services, unsafe food and unsafe      consumerproducts.       For example, the RAA would likely have prevented the      Federal Reserve from adopting popular credit card rules      underthe Truth in Lending Act in 2008 that prevented card      companies from unjustifiably increasing interest rates and      fees onconsumers. This is because these far-reaching changes      to abusive practices that were widespread in the marketplace      were not the``least costly'' options that were considered,      although they were arguably the most cost-effective.       The RAA would have achilling impact on the continued      promulgation of important consumer protections. Had it been      in effect, for example, the RAAwould have severely hampered      the implementation of essential and long-standing food safety      regulations, such as those requiringcompanies to prevent      contamination of meat and poultry products with deadly      foodborne pathogens. In fact, the Centers forDisease Control      and Prevention has credited the implementation of regulations      prohibiting contamination of ground beef with E.coli O157:H7      as one of the factors contributing to the recent success in      reducing coli illnesses among U.consumers.' Butsuch      benefits are impossible to quantify before a rule is enacted.       Further, had the RAA been in effect the necessary      childsafety protections required by the Consumer Product      Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) may have never been      implemented. Forexample, between 2007 and 2011 the Consumer      Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalled 11 million      dangerous cribs. These recallsfol owed 3,584 reports of crib      incidents, which resulted in 1,703 injuries and 153 deaths.      As a direct result of the CPSIA, CPSCpromulgated an effective      mandatory crib standard that requires stronger mattress      supports, more durable hardware, rigoroussafety testing, and      stopped the manufacture and sale of drop-side cribs. If the      RAA were implemented, such a life saving rulecould have been      delayed for years or never promulgated at all, at countless      human and financial cost.       The RAA also would adddozens of additional substantive and      procedural analyses, as well as judicial review to the      rulemaking process for every majorrule. It would: expand the      kind of rules that must go through a formal rulemaking      process; require agencies to determine``indirect costs''      without defining the term; require an impossible-to-conduct      estimation of a rule's impact on jobs, economicgrowth, and      innovation while ignoring public health and safety benefits;      and expand the powers of the White House's Office      ofManagement and Budget's Office of Information and      Regulatory Affairs to throw up numerous rulemaking      roadblocks, includingrequiring them to establish guidelines      for conducting cost-benefit analysis. This would further      delay or prevent thepromulgation of much needed consumer      protections.       The new titles of H.5 also add numerous roadblocks to      the promulgationof necessary consumer protections. The      Separation of Powers Restoration Act (Title II) eliminates[[Page H327]]     judicial deference thatagencies are granted when rules are      challenged in court. This allows judicial activism and      political considerations to trumpagency expertise. The Small      Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvement Act (Title III)      would increase regulatory delays andcreate new opportunities      for court challenge to regulations. The Require Evaluation      before Implementing Executive Wishlists Act(REVIEW Act)      (Title IV) would encourage frivolous legal challenges and      infuse the regulatory process with years of delay byrequiring      courts reviewing ``high-impact'' regulations to automatically      ``stay'' or block the enforcement of such regulationsuntil      all litigation is resolved. The All Economic Regulations are      Transparent Act (ALERT Act) (Title V) would also blatantlyand      purposefully lengthen the regulatory process by requiring a      six-month delay in the development of regulations.       We urgeyou to oppose this significant threat to consumer      protection, a fair marketplace, health, and safety posed by      H.5. Ifadopted, this proposal would waste federal      resources, minimize the ability of federal agencies to do      their jobs, grind theregulatory process to a halt, and infuse      the regulatory process with roadblocks preventing the      protection of the public andultimately putting American      consumers at risk.       We strongly urge you to oppose this harmful bill.           Sincerely,                                                  RachelWeintraub,     Legislative Director and General                                  ____                             Coalition forSensible Safeguards,                                                 January 10, 2017.     Re Floor vote of H.5, the Regulatory Accountability Act          of2017.       Dear Representative: The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards      (CSS), an alliance of over150 labor, scientific, research,      good government, faith, community, health, environmental, and      public interest groups, stronglyopposes 5, the      Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (RAA), which will be      voted on this week.       H.5 is a compilationof radical and harmful legislative      proposals that will permanently cripple the government's      ability to protect the public byrigging the regulatory      process against new regulatory safeguards in favor of      deregulation or regulatory inaction. The bill isjust as      dangerous and extreme as the REINS Act (H.26) and the      Midnight Rules Relief Act (H.21).       All of these bills aredesigned to make it as difficult as      possible for federal agencies to implement existing or new      laws that ensure our access toclean air and water, safe      workplaces, untainted food and drugs, safe toys and consumer      goods, and a stable financial system freeof Wall Street      recklessness. On the other hand, deregulatory actions that      repeal existing rules are exempt by virtue of      thelegislation's myopic focus on ``costs'' to corporate      special interests instead of ``benefits'' to the public. In      short, thelegislation will create a double standard in our      regulatory system that systematically favors deregulation      over new publicprotections and ``fast-tracks'' the repeal of      rules while paralyzing the creation of new ones.       The new version of the RAA,introduced in this Congress,      takes the previous RAA legislation and folds in several      destructive pieces of other so-calledregulatory reform bills      including: the misleadingly named Small Business Regulatory      Flexibility Improvements Act, the RequireEvaluation before      Implementing Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act), the All      Economic Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERTAct), the      Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the Providing      Accountability Through Transparency These pieces of      otherbills seek to worsen an already destructive bill and add      several more corrosive layers intending to dismantle our      publicprotections.       The current rulemaking process is already plagued with      lengthy delays, undue influence by regulated industries,and      convoluted court challenges. If passed, Title I of this bill      would make each of these problems substantially worse and      wouldundermine our public protections and jeopardize public      health by threatening the safeguards that ensure our access      to clean airand water, safe workplaces, untainted food and      drugs, and safe toys and consumer goods.       Rather than enhancing protections, itdoes the exact      opposite. It adds 80 new analytical requirements to the      Administrative Procedure Act and requires federalagencies to      conduct estimates of all the ``indirect''costs and benefits      of proposed rules and all potential alternatives      withoutproviding any definition of what constitutes, or more      importantly, does not constitute an indirect cost. The      legislation wouldsignificantly increase the demands on      already constrained agency resources to produce the analyses      and findings that would berequired to finalize any new rule.      Thus, the RAA is designed to further obstruct and delay      rulemaldng rather than improve theregulatory process.       This legislation creates even more hoops for ``major'' or      ``high-impact'' rules i.e., rules that providesociety with      the largest health and safety benefits. It would allow any      interested person to petition the agency to hold apublic      hearing on any ``genuinely disputed'' scientific or factual      conclusions underlying the proposed rule. This provisionwould      give regulated industries multiple opportunities to challenge      agency data and science and thus further stretch out      thealready lengthy rulemaking process.       H.5 would also create a restrictive mandate of a ``one-     size-fits-all'' directive thatevery federal agency adopt the      ``least costly'' alternative. This is a profound change and      effectively creates a ``super-mandate'' for all major      regulatory actions of executive and independent agencies      which overrides twenty-five existing statutes,including the      Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety      and Health Act, and the Consumer Product SafetyImprovement      These laws prioritize public health, safety, and      economic security, not the cost concerns of      regulatedentities.       Title II of H.5 is the Separation of Powers Restoration      Act piece which seeks to destroy the Chevron      deferenceprincipal. It would remove the judicial deference      that agencies are granted when their regulations are      challenged in court. Thiswould be a radical change that      upends one of the fundamental principles in administrative      law, namely that courts should notsecond-guess scientific and      technical expertise at federal agencies. Overly intrusive      judicial review is one of the primaryreasons for regulatory      delay and paralysis and this legislation would make those      problems much worse.       The misleadingly namedSmall Business Regulatory Flexibility      Improvements Act (Title III) is a Trojan horse that would      expand the reach and scope ofregulatory review panels,      increase unnecessary regulatory delays, increase undue      influence by regulated industries and encourageconvoluted      court challenges all in the name of helping ``small      business,'' but so expansively applied that mostly big      businesseswould benefit. Because the bill mandates that these      panels look at 'indirect costs,' which are defined very      broadly, it could beapplied to virtually any agency action to      develop public protections.       The REVIEW Act (Title IV) would make our system      ofregulatory safeguards weaker by requiring courts reviewing      ``high-impact'' regulations to automatically ``stay'' or      block theenforcement of such regulations until all litigation      is resolved, a process that takes many years to complete. It      would addseveral years of delay to an already glacially slow      rulemaking process, invite more rather than less litigation,      and rob theAmerican people of many critical upgrades to      science-based public protections, especially those that      ensure clean air and water,safe food and consumer products,      safe workplaces, and a stable, prosperous economy.       The ALERT Act (Title V) is designed toimpede the      government's ability to implement critical new public health      and safety protections by adding a six-month delay.      Thisamounts to a six-month regulatory moratorium, even after      the often lengthy period required for developing and      finalizing theseregulations. Such delays could extend well      beyond that initial six-month period should the OIRA      Administrator fail to post therequired information in a      timely manner.       This new version of the RAA would override and threaten      decades of publicprotections. The innocuous-sounding act is,      in reality, the biggest threat to public health standards,      workplace safety rules,environmental safeguards, and      financial reform regulations to appear in decades. It acts as      a ``super-mandate,'' rewriting therequirements of landmark      legislation such as the Clean Air Act and the Occupational      Safety and Health Act and distorting theirprotective focus to      instead prioritize compliance costs.       We strongly urge opposition to H.5, the Regulatory      AccountabilityAct of 2017.           Sincerely,                                              Robert Weissman,                                  President, Public Citizen Chair,     Coalition for                                  ____                                                           AFSCME,                                       We Make America Happen,                                   Washington, DC, January 9,2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million working      and retired members of theAmerican Federation of State,      County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge      you to oppose the RegulatoryAccountability Act of 2017 (H.     5). This reckless legislation would severely undermine the      nation's ability to ensure thatworkers are safe on the job      and in the marketplace. If enacted, H.5 would effectively      end the federal government's ability toenact new protections      on behalf of the American people. Instead, the Regulatory      Accountability Act looks to protect businessesfrom people as      a platform for policymaking.       The Regulatory Accountability Act would upset the      constitutional balance betweenbranches of the government and      impose new burdens on an already cumbersome regulatory      process. In rulemaking, federal agenciesmust adhere to the      requirements of the statue being implemented, and are often      given a roadmap from From there,federal agencies      must also follow the robust procedural and analytical      requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act,      theRegulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform      Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional      ReviewAct,       The Regulatory Accountability Act adds more than 70 steps      to the regulatory process while giving corporate      interestsmore opportunities to influence and weaken      standards. It would require unnecessary Advance Notices for a      large number of rules,and impose unnecessary new evidentiary      standards as a condition of rulemaking. It would subject the      regulatory process tounneeded rounds of litigation.[[Page H328]]       The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 will prevent      agencies from growing andaddressing new issues for      environmental, public health, workplace safety and consumer      financial security protections.

Mr.Chairman, in closing, this has been an enlightening discussion because we have determined that H.5 is based on thefaulty premise that environmental and public safety protections kill jobs, result in economically stifling costs, and promoteuncertainty.  In fact, regulatory protections that ensure the safety of American-made products unquestionably foster job creation andprotect the competitiveness of our business and global marketplace. This explains why so many organizations--more than150--strongly oppose this legislation.  Mr.Chairman, our constituents and the American citizens deserve something better than H.5. We need legislation thatcreates middle class financial security and opportunity. We need sensible regulations that protect American families fromeconomic ruin, that bring predatory financial practices to an end.  We need workplace safety protections that ensure hardworking Americans can go to work each day without having to risk theirlives as a result of hazardous work environments.

Today Medicare covers over 55 million Americans and is a staple for senior care. But let's go back in time and remember whatpeople were saying about Medicare in 1965. The American Medical Association said Medicare is an ``invasion of the voluntaryrelationship between the patient and the physician.''  The then-Republican leadership said the bill will cost too much. It will never cover enough seniors. It will make taxes toohigh, and we will be broke within 2 years.  Those are some of the quotes from The New York Times in 1965.  Today, 52 years later, Medicare is one of the most efficient healthcare systems in our country. Why? Because we gave it achance to flourish.  Mr.Speaker, when we come together on behalf of the American people, we get things done.

24,topic-id,737,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak about the water conditions facing California as I have for many times over thelast 6 years.  Today, obviously, we have recent storms that we welcome in Over the past several days, my district has receivedabove-average rainfall and snow in the mountains; and we welcome that. But also that presents flood conditions.  After over 5 years of record-breaking drought conditions, of course, we welcome the rain and snow; but there is[[Page H311]]alsodestructive flooding that is occurring as a result of that.  Regrettably, to reduce this potential flooding, we are having to let this water go out to the ocean. This precious watercould be extremely beneficial to farmers, farmworkers, and farm communities in the dry years. But, of course, we can't store itbecause the storage is not there.  This water could be used to replenish groundwater aquifers that were depleted during these drought conditions and could becarried over for ground storage for use in dry years. This water could help ensure that farming communities would not continueto deal with double-digit unemployment levels that we have had to face over the last 6 years.  It is why we need to invest more in the water storage projects in California, both surface storage and groundwater recharge,like raising the gates at Exchequer Dam, building Sites Reservoir and Temperance Flat  The WIIN Act that we passed last month was enacted in December, and it provides funding for water storage authorization andfor groundwater banking projects. And just in the last several weeks, we have determined that over 130,000 acre-feet of water isavailable today for use in our farm communities that otherwise would not be available.  It is my sincere hope that those projects and others like this, like the Los Banos Creek Reservoir and raising San LuisReservoir, are advanced as rapidly as possible in the next administration so that we can begin to capture the much-needed waterthat comes from these storms as we have had in the last 10 days.  Fixing California's broken water system requires a multiprong approach, as I have said many times on this floor, andfocusing on how we improve the water infrastructure and storage capacity will be imperative as we work together to updateCalifornia's water system, both here in Congress with the new administration and with the administration in Sacramento that isalso trying to create a water system that serves California's needs in the 21st century.  After 5 years of devastating drought conditions, we are now witnessing these large storm events which have created floods incertain regions of It is either feast or famine in California; and with the climate change impacts, we know thatwill only continue in the future.  So as we reflect on the last 5 years and we look at the progress we made last month with the WIIN Act that was part of WRDAlegislation, as time goes on, it is important that in the future, during the dry years that we will face more intensive droughtconditions, that we plan and provide for those drought conditions by creating the necessary surface storage and groundwaterstorage projects so that when we have wet years--we have wet times, as we witnessed in the last 10 days, when we see greaterrainfall amounts, increased flooding, and snow pack--that we have the water storage capabilities to meet the captured waterduring the wet years so we can use it during the dry ones. Common sense tells us that.                              {time}  1115  I urge my colleagues in Congress and the people of California to continue to work together on a bipartisan basis because itis the only way we ever get anything done. So for the new administration, for my colleagues in the new Congress, and for myfriends back in California, we must work together. If California, one of the most prosperous States in the Nation, the seventhor eighth largest economic power in the world, cannot fix the water challenges that we face in the 21st century, God help therest of the world.  This is all about sustainability--sustainability of our food supply, sustainability of our Food is a nationalsecurity item. We don't look at it that way, but it truly is.  Mr.Speaker, I look forward to the new Congress and the new administration to build on the progress we made last month sothat we can fix California's broken water system by using all of the water tools in our water toolbox, and we can only do thaton a bipartisan basis.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH310-2.txt,1774,"CONCURRENTRESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,11.0,January
311,topic-id,426,"Mr.President, my home State of Arkansas lost one of its great statesmen last week with the passing offormer State Senator Stanley  Stanley was a man of the soil. Born in Conway, he grew up on a dairy farm just outsidethe city. He went through the public school system and earned a degree in agriculture from the University of Althoughhe spent the bulk of his career in the life insurance business, over the years he continued to raise cattle. Even when he was anold man, you could find him clearing brush on the road to his house. That is how we thought of him--always keeping busy, alwaysworking, and always in touch with the needs of the land and its people.  As a veteran, I have to say that one of the things Imost admired about Stanley Russ was his military service. He served in the Army for 2 years, completed Officer Candidate School,and became an instructor in artillery. After being discharged, he served as a company commander in the Arkansas National Guardfor several years. In 1995, Stanley was inducted into the U.Field Artillery OCS Hall of Fame at Sill,  His truecalling in life was public service. Stanley represented Conway for 26 years in the Arkansas State More impressive thanhis lengthy tenure was his unimpeachable integrity. Stanley Russ was universally known as good, sturdy stock. The story is oftentold that during his first campaign, one of his opponents had some of his poll watchers thrown in jail. But Stanley won the raceanyway and went on to pass legislation protecting the rights of all poll watchers. He served in the senate with distinction,championing quality education for all of Arkansas' students and eventually rising to the office of president pro tempore.[[Page S242]]  Stanley Russ was a model for all of us in public service. I got to know Stanley well in my first campaign. He remaineda friend and trusted source of advice and support until he passed away.  I have heard Stanley died peacefully, surrounded byhis loving family as his granddaughter sang the hymn, ``Great is Thy Faithfulness.'' In his words, he considered himself``greatly blessed, highly favored, imperfect, but a forgiven child of the King.''  But perhaps the best summing up was givenby the man who now holds his seat, State Senator Jason As Senator Rapert put it, Stanley Russ was ``the kind of man thatGod made only one time.''

676,topic-id,795,"Mr.Chairman, I thank Mr.Peterson and Mr.Conaway, with whom I did serve on the AgricultureCommittee with for a number of years, and I recall well some of the discussion and debate as Chairman Gensler appeared beforethe committee on article 7 of the Dodd-Frank  Although, I didn't author that position, former-Senator Dodd is a constituent of mine. So I guess that is close enough tothe work that was done creating this section.  Again, let's be very clear about what this amendment does. It is not about clarifying anything. It is about stripping fromthe law article 7 of Dodd-Frank, which was a congressional mandate to establish position limits for speculative trading.  Again, this was not done in a vacuum. It was done because there has been an explosion of speculative trading that is takingplace in commodities markets. We had testimony in the Congress back in 2010 that it had grown from 22 percent to 67 percentspeculation on Wall Goldman Sachs--when, again, we were dealing with close to $4 a gallon for gas--had a report which saidthat 27 percent of that price was due to speculation. So, Congress appropriately instructed CFTC to come back with a regulatoryplan to limit speculative positions in a reasonable way.  Again, no one quarrels with the fact that end users, whether it is farms, ranchers, airlines, or businesses of all sorts,should be able to exercise options in market swaps.                              {time}  1345  In those instances, these are firms and businesses which actually take physical possession and control of the commodity.Again, what Goldman Sachs and other analysts had demonstrated is that what has been a burgeoning trend is that firms werebeginning to take dominant position in markets that, again, were not even close or remotely involved in the actual production,processing, or use of the commodities that were in question.  So again, CFTC has begun an arduous, painful process of trying to craft a rule. In fact, just a few weeks ago, on December5, the CFTC voted unanimously to again move that process along and come up with a draft of a balanced, reasonable rule, so it isnot a dead-end situation.  As has been reported, what they basically were looking at was a fundamental or a basic limit of roughly about 25 percent ofa commodity could not be controlled by one firm. The end users that I spoke to, as this rule has been making its way, actuallythink that the CFTC is being too generous in terms of allowing an individual firm to control up to 25 percent of a market. Ithink a lot of Americans would understand that that kind of position really would provide for an opportunity to manipulatemarket prices.  In fact, there are some end users who think the rule should be very simple, that you have to take actual physical possessionof the commodity in order to be able to hedge a position or engage in a future option. Again, the CFTC did not go to thatradical extreme. Again, they tried to listen to the thousands of comments--Chairman Gensler, Chairman Massad--to try to fashion arule that allowed a healthy market but did not allow situations which were occurring during high gas and oil prices.  In Connecticut, we had home heating oil suppliers who were describing situations where the price of the heating oil by thetime the truck left the garage and came back was going up 10, 15 cents just during that short period of time for no reason atall. There wasn't like a refinery explosion or some incident that was happening overseas. It was, again, the movement on WallStreet of people who were profiting not from use of the commodity but, in fact, just from the movement on the price. That isreally what CFTC has been hard at work doing.  This amendment will basically shut that down. It is not a clarification. It basically takes away what was Congress'instruction to  Again, I respectfully oppose this amendment. I think we should allow the Commission, which is going to have a RepublicanChairman in a few weeks, to continue to work on this issue and to provide protection for the true end users, the people whoactually use the commodities, as well as consumers. Whether it is those who get their home heating oil tank full, their gas tankfull, whether it is farmers and ranchers who are dealing with things like feed costs, we should have a healthy system of makingsure that individuals or firms cannot have a dominant position in terms of controlling commodities.  This is not an arcane, esoteric issue for This affects bread-and-butter issues in terms of how much they pay foressential goods and commodities for them and their families. I would strongly urge the Members to not accept this amendment. Iurge a ``no'' vote.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

632,topic-id,333,"Mr.Chairman, 5 years of bipartisan committee work has contributed to the drafting of H.238, the CommodityEnd-User Relief It is time we passed it for the sake of businesses across the United States who need greater certainty inmanaging their risk.  In advance of writing this legislation to reauthorize the CFTC, the House Committee on Agriculture held 22 hearings on thefuture of the Commission and the state of the derivatives industry. I mention the number 22 to highlight how extensive the datacollection and deliberation has been.  To make this reauthorization as complete and thorough as possible, those 22 hearings collected feedback and testimony fromevery segment of the futures and swaps markets, from end users to regulators. We have used the testimony to draft legislationthat will make derivatives markets work better for those who need them most: businesses trying to manage their risk.  But not only is this reauthorization language exhaustively researched, it has also already been approved by this Chambermultiple times, starting in the 113th  In the 113th Congress, the Committee completed H.4413, which passed the House with strong bipartisan support. In the114th Congress, we put forward the Commodity End-User Relief Act of 2015, which was very similar to H.4413, and also passedthe House with support from both parties. Now, not only is H.238 virtually identical to the reauthorization bill, whichpassed the House last Congress, H.238 also includes the amendments that were adopted on the House floor during debate.  I will turn my focus toward the people that this tested and proven language will help, largely end users. Although end usersare not investors, speculators, or risk takers, they have borne the brunt of many of the consequences of new regulations.  Derivatives are used by a huge swath of businesses for risk management purposes, including manufacturers, farmers, ranchers,and other businesses that buy or sell products overseas, pension funds, insurance companies, and others who face risks that theprices for their business inputs and outputs frequently fluctuate.

I thank ChairmanGoodlatte and Congressman Graves for working in a bipartisan way.  Mr.Chairman, this amendment is common sense. It calls on the government to bring transparency to the major rules.  Once an agency finalizes a major rule, that is the end of it. They are not required to review the benefits or the economicimpacts. This amendment, however, holds the agency accountable by requiring that it look back and assess the costs and benefitsof that rule after it has taken effect. Should the cost of the regulation exceed the proposed costs under the rule, then, underthis amendment, this agency will report back the increase to the This amendment would facilitate a dialogue betweenthe agency and the stakeholders. If the costs have gone up, then the agency must open up a comment period to hear thestakeholders and consider possible modifications or alternatives to reduce the cost and increase the benefits. We do that inEvery time we pass a piece of legislation, we go back and fine tune the legislation, and I think we need to do thesame thing here.  Again, we must not allow regulations to run out of control. We should hold agencies accountable.

99,topic-id,400,"I thank the gentleman.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.5.  Before I go into that, let me be clear. After listening to the leader a minute ago, I thank all of the Federal employees whowork so hard and give so much and who are so often unseen, unnoticed, unappreciated, and unapplauded.  I oppose this unnecessary and potentially dangerous legislation in its entirety. However, I will focus my remarks on title Vof this bill, which is in the jurisdiction of the Oversight and Government Reform Title V, also known as the ALERTAct, is an attack on agency rulemaking, like the rest of this bill.  This title would prohibit the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs from taking into account benefits when providingestimating costs of proposed and final rules. That is not transparency. It is one side of the story.  This bill would also prevent a rule from taking effect until certain information is posted online for 6 months by theAdministrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory The only exceptions to this requirement would be if an agencyexempts the rule from the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act or if the President issues anexecutive order.  That is a 6-month delay in putting any rule in place no matter how big or how small. Right now, there are rules pending toprotect the public from pipeline accidents involving hazardous liquids--those are our constituents, by the way--and to protect theprivacy of patients' records. Again, those are our constituents. This bill would put an arbitrary 6-month moratorium on ruleslike these.  The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, which is a coalition of over 150 labor, scientific, health and good governmentgroups, sent a letter on January 10, 2017, opposing H.5 to all Members of the House of  That letter read in part:       The ALERT Act is designed to impede the government's      ability toimplement critical new public health and safety      protections by adding a 6-month delay. This amounts to a 6-     month regulatorymoratorium even after the often lengthy      period required for developing and finalizing these      regulations. Such delays couldextend well beyond that initial      6-month period should the OIRA Administrator fail to post the      required information in a timelymanner.  The other titles of this bill are not any better and would impose so many requirements on agencies that issuing regulationsto protect health and safety would be almost impossible.

321,topic-id,1228,"Mr.President, today is the daywhen we will begin to repeal and replace Repealing and replacing this disastrous law is one of the top jobs thatcitizens elected us to get done. In many ways, it is why Donald Trump will be sworn in next week as the 45th President of theUnited  I think what is most helpful is to recap why repealing ObamaCare is so important to so many Montanans were promised that with this bill you could keep the health plans that you liked. That was wrong andmillions of Americans lost their plans.  Montanans were assured that coverage under ObamaCare would be affordable. Formillions of Americans, for thousands of Montanans, nothing could be further from the truth. Montanans were guaranteed thatObamaCare would lower health care[[Page S247]]costs. We witnessed premiums skyrocket since ObamaCare's implementation.  Finally,Montanans were assured that ObamaCare would create more competition in the marketplace, but now Americans in one-third--one-third--of the counties across our entire country have but one plan to choose from. Let's not forget, supporters of ObamaCare paidfor these failed programs by raiding Medicare of over $700 billion. Seniors and people with disabilities in Montana and acrossour country deserve much better.  Over the past several years, I have heard from countless Montanans about how ObamaCare hasfailed them. Take, for example, Terry from Choteau, MT, who wrote:       We just got a letter fromPacific Source that our premium is      going up $260 per month and our deductible is going up to      $1000. This is $1025 per month anda $7500 deductible for 2      healthy adults [with] (no preexisting conditions). For a      ranch family this is a huge hit, especially inthese times      with low commodity prices. Something needs to change.  Jeff from Kalispell, MT, said this:       I am married with 5 children. I live in I bought      Blue Cross Blue Shield of MT PPO Goldinsurance plan #104 for      the 2016 year. My premium was $1,477.28 per month. In early      November 2016 [2 months ago] I receivednotice that my same      plan would increase to $2,820.00 per month. That is a 91%      increase. . . . If keeping the same rate hikes, myinsurance      will be $5,500 in 2018, then $10,000 per month in 2019.  That was from Jeff in Kalispell,  I haveAnthony from That is my hometown. I went to college in A fellow Bozemanite writes this to me. He says:       I have never been able to afford Obamacare insurance. With      quotes of over $400 a month for asingle healthy male I found      it easier to pay the penalty. So now not only can I not      afford to have medical insurance but I amgetting fined for      not making enough money to pay all of my bills and give a 20%      tithe to the medical insurance industry.  Here is another Bozemanite, He writes this:       For 2014 we had med insurance fromPacific Source for my      wife which was adequate and filled our needs. For 2015      Pacific Source canceled that policy, citingObamacare rules,      and best alternative was 150 percent more expensive.       We did it for 6 months and then canceled; it just tooktoo      much from our budget. The IRS fined us $584 for missing      insurance for 6 months. We are doing without coverage for      2016 againbecause of the outrageous costs for this high-     deductible policy. Our IRS fine will probably be about $1500.  The list andthe heartfelt stories go on. They all share one common theme: ObamaCare is not working. This ObamaCare hardship did not justimpact Terry, Jeff, Anthony or Montanans, on average, face premium increases between 27 and 58 percent just this lastyear. This is year-over-year numbers.  Last evening, I had a telephone tele-townhall meeting where thousands of Montanansjoined me, thousands across the entire Every corner of our State was on the call last night. I asked a simple question. Iasked: How many of you would want to repeal ObamaCare? An overwhelming 82 percent said they support the repeal of  The reason why is quite simple. They did not get what was promised to them on this very floor of this Chamber back in 2010.ObamaCare is failing because it is a massive intrusion by the Federal It is centered on raising taxes, huge spendingincreases, and heavy regulations from Washington, It is straight from the BigGovernment, Washington-knows-best playbook, and that is what happens when Congress doesn't listen to the American people.  You know, Montanans have very good horse sense. They know when somebody from Washington, DC, shows up and says: We have this2,700-page bill from Washington, DC, led by Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and President Obama--Montanans know better. They knowthey should run for cover.  And that is exactly what ObamaCare is and what is happening now to the American people.  ObamaCare can't be tweaked. It has to be repealed. It needs to be replaced with better reforms. And we need to make surethat we do as much as we can as soon as we can so folks aren't having to deal with ObamaCare for much longer. People arehurting. It is time to replace it.  I urge my Democratic colleagues to work with us. Don't use scare tactics.  Unlike2009, we are focused on a path forward that conveys practical benefits, not hopeless ideology. I ask them to accept the realitythat ObamaCare is irreversibly flawed, it must be repealed, and it must be replaced with effective policies.  I know thereare comments out there about a plan and what is next. Well, for me, it is not that complicated. It is getting the costs down.You have heard the stories. The American people are asking for relief.  For the generation of Americans just now entering theworkforce--and that would be my kids; they are just entering the workforce--health care costs have increased by 77 percent. Thisis outrageous. It is unacceptable. These are supposed to be the easiest people to insure, yet ObamaCare seems intent on placinghealth care out of their reach.  I believe there are policies that are fundamental to any health care system, and it will beworking and fighting for provisions that provide access to affordable insurance, that protect people with preexistingconditions, that allow young adults to stay on their parents' coverage until age 26, that return decisionmaking authority backto the States, that will eliminate these harmful Washington regulations and mandates, that will empower the American people withgreater access to health savings accounts.  That was part of the health care system that was actually working pre-ObamaCare,and ObamaCare moved in and slashed health care savings accounts.  We need to make it easier to purchase health insuranceacross State lines, encourage and incentivize work among able-bodied Americans, and uphold fiscal responsibility by preservingand protecting Medicare for our seniors.  I very much look forward to working with the nominee for the U.Department ofHealth and Human Services, Tom I served with Price in the There is not a better leader at thispoint in time in our Nation's history to assume the leadership of the Department of Health and Human He is a doctor,has served in Congress, and will be able and ready to lead from day one.

958,topic-id,1485,"Mr.President, in 2005, theFederal Government enacted the REAL ID Act, imposing Federal standards established by the Department of Homeland Security to theprocess and production of the issuance of States' driver's licenses and identification cards.  This law was an underfunded,top down, Federal mandate, infringing on personal privacy, increasing the personal information susceptible to cyber-attacks, andundermining State sovereignty. Furthermore, a REAL ID compliant State ID will be required for all ``official federal purposes,''including boarding commercial aircraft, impeding the movement of American citizens.  Montana led opposition to this In 2007, Montana enacted a law, after both chambers of the State legislature unanimously passing legislation, refusingto comply.

Consistent with the Montana State legislature, this legislation willrepeal the REAL ID Act of 2005.

1117,topic-id,383,"Mr.Chair, we all know that hard-edged partisan politics has not only eroded the confidence that the Americanpeople have in our government, but it has caused government to function to a very low standard.  In my 4 years that I have been in this Congress, I have never seen a better example of that than what we have here today.Because today, we are considering a budget that is not only fiscally irresponsible, it doubles our deficits across 10 years,increases the national debt by $10 trillion, but its sole purpose is to repeal the Affordable Care  The purpose of today's budget is not to amend the Affordable Care Act to preserve its strengths and tackle it weaknesses,nor is the purpose of today's budget to repeal the Affordable Care Act and put something in place that has been well thoughtthrough and shared with the American public. The purpose of today's bill is to repeal the Affordable Care Act in a cold, hardway and let the chips fall where they fall. And this is not being done because it is good policy.  Anyone who is serious about healthcare policy--even people who oppose the Affordable Care Act--who has looked at this issue,has concluded, by any measure, the Affordable Care Act should not be repealed without a replacement. It is being done forpolitical reasons because my colleagues, unfortunately, for years, have told their supporters that they would repeal this billat all cost, without having the courage or convictions to explain to them the consequences of repeal without replacement; norwithout the determination to do the work to come up with an alternative.  The Affordable Care Act was passed 8 years ago. It was passed on a straight party-line basis, which was unfortunate. It hadthree important goals, which it has achieved: to expand health care in over 20 million people; to lower the overall cost ofhealth care in this country, which is the most important number in our fiscal health; and to improve the quality of health care.  Is it perfect? Are we addressing its problems today? Are we repealing it without any replacement? By anymeasure, will that be bad for the public health and potentially cause a public health crisis in the United States of America?The answer to that is yes.  I urge my colleagues to reject the budget proposal.  ",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH490.txt,2133,SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,2017.0,13.0,January

If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr.Speaker, throughout my 27 years of law enforcement experience, I protected and served my community, and I stand heretoday to protect the most vulnerable of seniors in central Florida, and seniors all around this  We have a responsibility to see that seniors are not put in a position where they will have to choose between buying food orbuying their medication, which was the case before the Affordable Care We must resist all efforts to reopen the Medicarepart D prescription drug coverage doughnut hole. This doughnut hole required seniors to pay full price for their prescriptiondrugs after they reach their catastrophic threshold.  Research found, because of this doughnut hole, seniors would put their health at risk because they could not afford to paythe prescriptions, which ultimately lead to higher healthcare costs. Because of the Affordable Care Act, this doughnut hole isbeing completely phased out of the Medicare part D prescription drug program by the year 2020.  Since the ACA passed in 2010, closing the doughnut hole has saved our seniors more than $23.5 billion on their prescriptiondrugs. We know this is working. Florida seniors enrolled in the program are now saving an average of $987 a year because ofclosing the loophole.                              {time}  1830  We know what $987 means to the average senior on We also know that if these coverage gap discounts disappeared,part D enrollees would have to pay $3,725 for the time period they are in the doughnut hole. This $3,725 represents nearly 15percent of a Medicare enrollee's income.  With too many Floridians and seniors across the Nation struggling to make ends meet, I strongly believe that Congress can domore to make sure we do not go backwards and reopen this doughnut hole. No one should ever have to choose between food ormedicine.

681,topic-id,361,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate the support of the gentleman from Texas and his insight in this amendment. I was aprosecutor in a former life, and we care a lot about due process, making sure that the government can't take something from aprivate individual just because they want to take it.  As an American, I know that protecting intellectual property is a cornerstone of our free enterprise system. That is why Iam concerned about the CFTC's rule on automated trading,[[Page H425]]which takes the unprecedented step of requiring a wide array ofmarket participants engaged in algorithmic trading to maintain a source code repository and make it available for inspection bythe CFTC or the Department of Justice without a subpoena.  Now, this is highly sensitive source code. This is intellectual property that helps the functionality of our marketplace,and to think that this kind of sensitive data can be taken by the Federal Government without a subpoena should shock ourconscience. There are times when the government should get this information; but if they should have it, they should be able touse a subpoena and lay out the cause and the case for why they need to have it.  That is not just my only concern. But the CFTC is potentially going to be taking this source code from all different marketplayers and holding it in a warehouse or a repository, and so we have a concern for hacking. It has been a big conversation asof late. But instead of a foreign entity hacking in to individual companies, they just have to hack the CFTC and they get allthe source code. Just think of the malicious things that can happen if you have the source code of market players, how you candisrupt it, how you can take it down. It is absolutely frightening.  So I think we should have great pause, take a little time to reflect on our Constitution, and continue to respect andsupport due process, which means, if the government wants this information, they should have a subpoena, lay out their case, andthat is the avenue by which they get it, not just because they want it.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH404-6.txt,1805,83,2017.0,12.0,January

Again, if our government wants information from the private sector, we all believe they should have a subpoena forit, number one.

DETERMINATION OF PREDOMINANT       Section 2(h)(7)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.     2(h)(7)(C)), as amended by section 314 of this Act, is      amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(v) In determining whether aperson is predominantly      engaged in a business or activity for purposes of clause      (i)(VIII), there shall be excluded revenues andassets that      are, or result from, any transaction that is entered into      solely for purposes of hedging or mitigating commercialrisk      (as defined by the Commission for purposes of subparagraph      (A)(ii)).''.  The Pursuant to House Resolution 40, the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa) and a Member opposed each willcontrol 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Mr.Mr.Chairman, my amendment is a simple, straightforward one, bringing clarity to the law and relief,again, to the end users, such as farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers that use swaps to hedge commercial risks associated withtheir business, including volatile markets and price fluctuations on a day-to-day basis. This critical financial tool allowsthem to do their jobs and provide products in an affordable and accessible manner, keeping consumer costs low.  Discussing Dodd-Frank, Congress always intended that these end users should not have to clear the swaps entered to hedgethese commercial risks and provide the end-user exemption to that end.  The Commodity Exchange Act defines as a financial entity a person predominantly engaged in certain financial activities. TheFed's rulemaking when defining financial activities repeatedly states the rule is for the purpose of title I; therefore,bringing it in to title VII was something they did not have in mind when issuing their definitions of predominantly engaged forfinancial entities. Therefore, financial entities cannot rely on this end-user exception.  However, because of a catchall in the definition of financial entities, end users who engage in successful hedging programscould be regarded as financial entities, thereby creating barriers and unnecessary restrictions to their business operations.This completely turns the concept of being an end user in title VII on its head.  My amendment today ensures end users will not lose their ability to rely on the end-user exception, which is a clearingrequirement due simply to the position performance of a transaction entered into solely to mitigate commercial risk.

297,topic-id,1313,"Madam President, apparently anumber of our colleagues here are having second thoughts about the strategy on the floor. We have before us a budget resolution.It is setting the stage for a budget process called reconciliation. To put it in layman's terms, we are going to be moving fromthis budget resolution vote to a vote at a time to be announced later, possibly in the next 2 weeks, to repeal  There has been a lot of speculation about what the impact will be if we don't replace the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare,with something very quickly--for obvious reasons. We have seen 30 million Americans who now have health insurance because of thecreation of the Affordable Care  We have changed health insurance policies across the United States so that if you havesomeone in your family with a preexisting condition, you can't be discriminated against when you buy insurance.  Back in theold days, before ObamaCare became the law of the land, health insurance companies could just refuse to insure your family orcharge you a premium that was beyond reach. We also eliminated the caps that were built in--the limits that were built into thesehealth insurance policies. People were buying policies which covered up to $100,000 in expenses. Then, God forbid, there is adiagnosis of cancer or some serious illness, and $100,000 evaporates over a weekend.  So those limits are no longer allowedin health insurance policies. We said women should be treated the same as men when it comes to premiums. We also went on to saythat, when it comes to these health insurance companies, they have to be focused on keeping premium costs in control, and theyhave to justify any profits that go way beyond the reasonable.  Then we said: If you are a mother or father with a son ordaughter coming out of college and they are looking for a job, they are doing an internship, and they don't have healthinsurance, they can stay on your family policy until age 26.  That is pretty important for a lot of families. My family hasbeen through that with our kids. To know and have peace of mind that your daughter or son can continue to be covered by yourfamily plan--these things are all built into the Affordable Care Now, simply repealing that, even saying it will happen at alater date, throws into question, if not chaos, our health care system in  A lot of people are finally thinkingabout that. It is not just a protest vote about a President who is going to be leaving office in 9 days. It is a life-and-deathdecision for health care for millions of Now many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are starting towake up to that reality.  Senator Cotton of Arkansas said: ``It would not be the right path for us to repeal ObamaCarewithout laying out a path forward.''  Yesterday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that Republicans want to repeal ObamaCare``concurrently'' with a replacement--``concurrently.''  Senator Lamar Alexander, my friend and colleague from Tennessee,who chairs the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, responded by saying: ``To me, `simultaneously' and`concurrently' mean ObamaCare should be finally repealed only when there are concrete, practical reforms in place that giveAmericans access to truly affordable health care''--Senator  Newt Gingrich, the former Republican Speaker ofthe House, said: ``I don't think Republicans want to leave 23 million people out there worried that they are going to lose theirinsurance.''  So you go through the long list of Republican dissenters to this notion of repeal and we will get back to youlater: Senators Corker, Portman, Collins, Cassidy, They have come up with an amendment to this budgetresolution, and they have said: Let's postpone this whole effort until we have had time to put some work into it and come upwith an alternative to answer some of the basic questions about what a new version of the Affordable Care Act would look like.  But the problem with that approach is that they have had 7 years--7 years--to prepare something, and they have nothing. Sowhat are we going to do in the meantime?  We did the responsible thing, I hope. Let's find a way to make the Affordable CareAct even stronger, better, fairer. Sign me up. Make it a bipartisan effort. Don't repeal it. Sit down and rewrite it in a waythat is fair and makes it stronger and better.  The basic things we want to make sure of are that people can have the samebasic protection if they wish it in health insurance. Ensure that no one loses their current benefits, whether it is maternitycare, mental health care, or substance abuse treatment, which is now required to be covered by health insurance plans. Ensurethat no one's premiums or out-of-pocket expenses get out of line. Protect people with preexisting conditions and don't justsimply shift the cost to States--my State included--that could not afford to take this on. Keep drug prices down for seniors.  You see, that is a part I did not mention. Medicare is affected by the Affordable Care Under Medicare, the 60 millionAmericans under Medicare used to have something called a doughnut hole. It was on odd invention when this bill was written intolaw. It said that Medicare for seniors would cover the front end of their prescription costs, if they are high, and, then, theyhave to take the middle part out of their savings, and, then, late in the year, Medicare kicked back in.  It was costingseniors $1,000, $2,000 a year. We eliminated it with the Affordable Care Now, if you repeal that, what happens to seniorsand their prescription drug costs? Those are legitimate questions which need to be answered before we go blindly into repealingthe Affordable Care  Let's work together--Democrats and Republicans--to make this a better law. I have said it before andI will say it again. The only perfect law that I am aware of was carried down a mountain by ``Senator Moses'' on clay tablets.The rest of the efforts that we put into this are always subject to review, amendment, and improvement. The Affordable Care ActI would put in that category.  If there is a good-faith effort on the Republican side to join with Democrats, I want to bepart of it. I also want to salute my colleague, Senator Debbie Stabenow, who will be on the floor in a couple of hours totalk about the mental health protections and substance abuse treatment protections in the Affordable Care We used to havethis debate on the Senate floor about whether health insurance policies should cover mental illness. We debated that. For thelongest time, they did not. People with those problems and challenges have long-term care, in some cases.  But because of thebipartisan effort of Mr.Paul Wellstone, the late Senator[[Page S226]]from Minnesota, and Mr.Pete Domenici, the retired Senator fromNew Mexico--Democrat and Republican--we have included it in there. Senator Stabenow wants to make sure that whatever we writein the future is going to cover mental illness and substance abuse treatment.  Facing mental illness challenges acrossAmerica, facing an opioid and heroin epidemic, we can do no less. Let me tell you a story about Lori Myers in Freeport, Shesent me a letter. Here is what she said:       I am writing to ask you to fight to preserve the ACA . .      .it has literally saved our daughter       Brianne has been insured through the ACA since its      inception. . . .

314,topic-id,974,"Madam President,the most popular dictionary defines an act of war as an act of aggression by a country against another with which it isnominally at peace. Let me repeat, an act of aggression by another country against another with which it is nominally at peace.  On Friday, America's intelligence community issued a damning, detailed assessment concluding that Russian strongmanPresident Vladimir Putin ordered an attack on our Nation's electoral system to sow mistrust and favor one candidate overanother. The evidence was sweeping, overwhelming, and troubling.  The key findings, quoted directly from the public versionof this report from the intelligence agencies, said as follows:       Russian efforts to influence the2016 U.presidential      election represent the most recent expression of Moscow's      longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-ledliberal      Democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a      significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and      scopeof effort compared to previous operations.       We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an      influence campaign in 2016aimed at the U.presidential      election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in      the U.Democratic process, denigrateSecretary Clinton, harm      her electability and potential presidency. We further assess      that Putin and the Russian Governmentdeveloped a clear      preference for President-elect       We also assess Putin and the Russian government aspired to      helpPresident-elect Trump's election chances when possible by      discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting      herunfavorably to him.  They go on to talk about the types of influence Moscow inspired.  I am not going to stand hereand argue that if the Russian efforts had not taken place, there would have been a different outcome in the election. No onewill ever know that. And when asked directly, the intelligence agencies, despite these strong statements, say there is noevidence of direct vote tampering or tampering with election equipment, thank goodness. That isn't the point.  The point is,Vladimir Putin and the Russians did what they could to influence our election. Americans should stand up and listen because whatis at stake is the sovereignty of our Nation and the reliability and integrity of our election process.  What the Russiansdid was truly staggering and momentous--a foreign adversary intentionally manipulating America's democracy and election. I don'tknow if it is an act of war by classic definition. It is an attack on our Nation by any definition. It should not go unanswered.  For those who have been following Vladimir Putin's bullying actions over the last several years, this is no surprise.Instead of building a modern global economy based on the great talents of the Russian people, he and his closest neighbors havecreated false enemies in the West, sadly and dangerously creating a narrative that domestic Russian problems are really theresult of NATO, the United States, and the  He has tried to discredit the West and its Democratic free marketinstitutions. He has used manufactured enemies of Russia to rally domestic support for his tactics and leadership.  It is,ultimately, a tired narrative that when combined with domestic political repression and manipulation, helps keep Putin in power.  Let's not be fooled into thinking his actions are merely annoying. The threats are real and dangerous, and they go directlynot just at the United States but many of our strongest allies.

This is our adversary. This is the man who is trying to undermine the American electoral system. We cannot take it lightly.  Twenty years ago, when I was elected to the Senate, I was a member of the Government Affairs The first hearing wehad was a lengthy investigative hearing. What was the basis of it? We had just concluded a Presidential campaign, andallegations were made that the Chinese Government 20 years ago was trying to insert itself into the Presidential campaign of theUnited States, specifically in support of the Clinton-Gore ticket.  Fred Thompson was chairman of that committee, a prettywell-known man who has since passed, but he was a pretty outstanding lawyer in addition to being a pretty famous actor. He wasmy chairman. He spent months in public hearings investigating whether the Chinese tried to insert themselves in any way, shape,or form in the election of Clinton-They found virtually no evidence, other than a handful of Buddhist nuns writing checksto the campaign, which nobody ever really explained. But there was no evidence that the Chinese Government was involved in thisin any specific way. We spent months on that theory in open hearings, and then published reports--conflicting reports onconclusions from that committee. We took it that seriously 20 years ago.  What are we doing about this? Well, SenatorMcConnell, the Republican leader, said that we will do the regular order; we will let the regular committees go about theirbusiness and figure out what might have happened in the course of that. That is not good enough. Regular order may put thisinvestigation in the Intelligence Do you know what that means? It means you are not going to see their hearing. Youare not going to be able to see their witnesses and listen to their testimony, and much of the evidence that is going to bepresented will never be shared with the public.  I understand the need to protect classified material. We must do that. Iinsist on that. But at the same time, we need to answer some basic questions about what Russia tried to do in this last electionand to make it clear to them and to the world that the United States is not going to be a sucker. We are not going to allowanyone who can hack into our systems to try to undermine the electoral system of the United We are proud Wewill handle our own elections, thank you. Keep your hackers out of business in the United  Recently, we have hadallegations--and I underline the word ``allegations''--of other involvement of the Russians with the Trump campaign and thepreparation of certain documents, which have not been collaborated as of this date. They may lead to nothing, but they certainlydeserve investigation so that we know what the facts may be.  Yesterday at the Senate Judiciary Committee, I asked SenatorJeff Sessions of Alabama, a man who is aspiring to be Donald Trump's Attorney General, if he could recuse himself frominvestigations into Russian connections with the Trump campaign. He had just said earlier he was going to recuse himself frominvestigations involving Hillary Senator Sessions said, ``I would review it and try to do the right thing as towhether or not it should stay within the jurisdiction of the attorney general or not.''  I hope that Senator Sessions,if he in fact becomes the Attorney General, will have some second thoughts. It is far better to consider a special counsel inthe Department of Justice in light of the political circumstances of these allegations.  Secondly, we need to have a selectcommittee--not the Intelligence Committee--of either the House or the Senate that will meet and consider this information andinvestigate it in a responsible way. In fact, I think it is of such gravity that we ought to consider a public-privatecommission--a commission of elected officials, as well as private citizens, whom we respect. I think of the names of GeneralColin Powell and former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as chairs and cochairs of that effort, people ofunquestionable integrity who will make the right findings for America and not for any political reasons, as far as I amconcerned.  Today, I asked Michael Mukasey, former Attorney General under President George Bush, whether the AttorneyGeneral has the authority to shut down an FBI investigation, and he answered very simply, ``yes.'' So we need more information.We need to make sure that this is taken seriously and that we address it in a serious manner because it is a serious issue.  What, in fact, has been the response from the other side of the aisle? With a few notable exceptions, that party of RonaldReagan, the 40th President--who really understood the old Soviet regime--has greeted this information with near silence. That isright. Except for a few voices--my colleagues Senators Graham and McCain in particular--there has been near silence.  How in the world did an attack ordered by a former Soviet KGB official on our Nation become a partisan issue that is largelyignored by a majority of one of our Nation's two great political parties? How did the Republican Party, which now controls bothChambers of Congress, decide that repealing health care insurance for millions of Americans was the most urgent, first priorityto deal with amid this sweeping evidence of a Russian attack on our democracy? Ronald Reagan must be rolling in his grave.  Does anyone remember his clarity about standing up against attacks on the West and its allies when the Soviets shot down acivilian Korean airliner in 1983? This is what President Reagan said:       And make no mistake about it,this attack was not just      against ourselves or the Republic of This was the      Soviet Union against the world and the moralprecepts which      guide human relations among people everywhere. It was an act      of barbarism born of a society which wantonlydisregards      individual rights and the value of human life and seeks      constantly to expand and dominate other nations.  There was a time in this town when national security issues were truly bipartisan, when security meantpatriotically putting aside partisan agendas. Can anyone here imagine for a second--just one second--the debate we would be havinghere now if the situation were reversed? The House alone spent millions of dollars on countless and ultimately fruitlessinvestigations into the tragic events of Here we are, with overwhelming evidence of an actual attack on our Nation,and the majority party is largely silent. That is incredible. It is quite simply an abdication of political responsibility notto address a verified national security threat to our  With the release of Friday's report, I urge my colleagues toread both the public and classified reports. The classified version contains the same damning and sweeping conclusions Imentioned here today from the public document, but it goes into detail. As such, I urge this body to come up with an appropriateresponse to this attack. I have joined in bipartisan Russian sanctions legislation with Senators Cardin, McCain, Menendez,Graham, Shaheen Rubio, Klobuchar, Sasse, and We urge that we quickly advance as an urgent priority Russiansanctions to make it clear that what they have done is reprehensible, unacceptable, and will not be tolerated.  This Congresscan also do what many tried to do in the past and failed--which is certainly timely--and that is pass meaningful cyber securitylegislation.  We have to maintain our strong NATO Alliance, stand firm against Russian meddling or attacks, and tell ourfriends in the Baltics and Poland, in particular, that we stand by their side, that nothing has changed, and that our friends inUkraine can trust that we will be with them as they establish democratic sovereignty. We must work with the new administrationto fully accept and counter this[[Page S245]]Russian threat. We must work to undermine any such future attacks at home and against ourallies. We should get to the bottom of the extremely troubling allegations that have been made recently.  Yes, ultimately wemust work with Russia where those efforts serve our global interests--and I think there will be some common areas--but we must notdo so from a position of weakness. We will never be taken seriously by Putin or our adversaries otherwise.  Madam President,I yield the floor.

909,topic-id,1107,"Mr.President, in 8 days, just a short distance from this Senate Chamber, Donald Trump will be sworn in asthe 45th President of the United On that date, January 20, 2017, the fate of more than 750,000 young American immigrantswill hang in the balance. They will be waiting to learn if they have a place in America's future or whether they will lose theirlegal status to stay in the United For many of them, it is a period of the highest anxiety, wondering what is going tohappen next.  It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President I had introduced the DREAM Act, which said that ifyou were brought to America as a child, an infant, or an adolescent, lived here all your life, went to school and did well, andhad no criminal record of any consequences, we would give you a chance to stay. Over a period of time, you would be able tobecome legal in America--a citizen in Sixteen years ago, I introduced it, and we passed it once in the Senate, once inthe House, and never, ever made it the law of the land.  I wrote to President Obama, with Senator Dick Lugar, Republican ofIndiana, and said: Find some way, if you can, as President, to protect these young DREAMers, as we call them. And he did. It iscalled DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood  What it basically said is that if you qualify under the DREAM Act, youcould pay a filing fee of almost $500, go through a criminal background check and interview, and, then, if you qualify, you willbe given a 2-year temporary protection from deportation and the ability to work. So far, over 750,000 young people have comeforward. They have made such a difference in their own lives, in the lives of their families, and even in our country.  Ihave come over 100 times to tell their stories, and I will tell another one today. But I want to also announce that today wehave a significant bipartisan breakthrough for this Congress: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ihave introduced the BRIDGE The BRIDGE Act, which has bipartisan sponsorship, would say that even if we eliminated PresidentObama's Executive order, we would protect these young people from deportation and allow them to continue to work and study.  I want to thank Senator He has been a terrific partner.  This is an issue whichweighs heavily on my mind and conscience. We believe this is a reasonable way to extend this protection and to say to Congressin the meantime: Get to work. Roll up your sleeves. Pass a comprehensive immigration bill. Work with the new President, workwith both sides, Democrats and Republicans, and come up with an approach.  I thank Senator Graham for joining me in theintroduction of this BRIDGE  For the young people across America, I can tell you, I understand your fears. I understandyour anxiety. There are many of us who are dedicated to making certain that this ends well for you and for your family.  There are pretty amazing young people who are in that category I have addressed. One of them is Jose At the age of2, Jose Espinoza was brought here from He grew up in the northwest suburbs of Chicago and became an excellent student.In high school, he was a member of the National Honor Society, and he graduated in the top 3 percent of his class. He waselected to the student council every year in high school, the treasurer, vice president, editor of the high school yearbook,mentored and taught physical education to a freshman class of 40 students. He was also captain of the varsity track and fieldteam and a member of the soccer team and the school orchestra.  In his spare time, if there was any, Jose volunteered withthe United Way, and as a result of his academic record and volunteer service, he received a college scholarship from the  Incidentally, DREAMers--undocumented--don't qualify for any Federal[[Page S299]]assistance for their education, so they have tofind it in other places. His work with the United Way helped to pay his way at the college. He went to the University ofIllinois at Urbana-Champaign and received multiple academic awards and continued his volunteer service with Alpha Phi Omega, anational service fraternity. He received the Distinguished Service Key, the fraternity's highest award. He graduated with abachelor of science in kinesiology and then went on to earn a master's degree in public health at the University of  In his last semester of graduate school, President Obama announced the DACA Program, which I described earlier. He applied,signed up, and became part of that DACA  What is he doing today with his master's degree, with his opportunity towork in fields of public health and such? He signed up for Teach For We know Teach For America is a national nonprofitorganization that places talented recent college graduates in urban and rural schools that have a shortage of teachers. Jose iscurrently a high school physics and public health teacher in the city of  He wrote me a letter, and he said:       DACA changed my life in more ways than I can ever explain.      It has given me the power to helpothers, the freedom to      travel, and the right to legally work without fear of      deportation. Simply put, without DACA, I wouldn'texist for my      students and my community.  If DACA is eliminated, what will happen to Jose? The day after DACA, he won't beable to teach. He could be deported back to Mexico, where he hasn't lived since he was a 2-year-old toddler. That would be atragedy, not just for Jose and his family but for this This is a fine young man who, against great odds, undocumented,has written this amazing record in his young life. He is a giving person. He could be making a lot more money than his pay withTeach For America in an inner city school.  Do we need Jose Espinoza in America's future? I think we do. That is why I amhappy that this BRIDGE Act would give him a chance and Congress a chance to address this issue of I hope President-Elect Trump will understand this and continue the DACA If he decides to end the DACA Program, I hope his administrationwill work closely and rapidly with Congress to pass the BRIDGE Act into law.

That is why we introduced an amendment that would ensure theBudget Resolution we are voting on today or any future bill can't be used to cut benefits from Social Security, Medicare orMedicaid, increase the retirement age for these benefits, or privatize Social  But, the majority is not allowing debate or a vote on our amendment.  This sends a clear message: Congressional Republicans are willing to put the lives and futures of millions of children,seniors and working families at risk.  It also puts them on the wrong side of history. Cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security is not what the Americanpeople want.  President-elect Trump has promised several times that he will not support cuts to these important programs that helpmillions of Americans make ends meet.  This leaves Congressional Republicans in a tough spot. Whose side are they on?  Will they commit to protecting hard-working Americans? Will they protect America's children? Seniors? What about people withdisabilities?  Or, will they yet again cut the benefits of working people so they can give tax breaks to big corporations?  The Congressional Progressive Caucus and House Democrats will not back down. We will oppose any cuts to Medicare, Medicaid,and Social  I urge my colleagues to vote no and defeat the previous question so we can bring up the CPC amendment to block the House GOPfrom cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social  Will House Republicans stand with us?  Today, 55 million older people and people with disabilities have health care because of  82 percent of Americans--including 74 percent of Republicans, 88 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of independents--agree itis critical to preserve Social Security for future generations even if it means increasing Social Security taxes paid by working In 2015, 11 million Americans became newly eligible for Medicaid thanks to Medicaid expansion.  If Republicans repeal the ACA, at least 11 million people's Medicaid coverage will be at risk.  The House Republican budget plan far fiscal year 2017 would have cut federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion--or nearly 25percent--over ten years. That is in addition to ending Medicaid expansion.  The Urban Institute estimated that the 2012 Ryan proposal would lead states to drop between 14.3 million and 20.5 millionpeople from Medicaid by the tenth year, in addition to the effects of repealing health reform's Medicaid expansion.

POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT WOULD                    BREAKDONALD TRUMP'S PROMISE NOT TO CUT SOCIAL                    SECURITY, MEDICARE, OR       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in orderin the House      of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint      resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between theHouses,      or conference report that would--       (1) result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits scheduled      under title II of theSocial Security Act (42 U.S.401 et      seq.);       (2) increase either the early or full retirement age for      the benefits describedin paragraph (1);       (3) privatize Social Security;       (4) result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits for      individuals entitledto, or enrolled for, benefits under the      Medicare program under title XVIII of 18 such Act (42 U.S.     1395 et seq.); or       (5)result in a reduction of benefits or eligibility for      individuals enrolled in, or eligible to receive medical      assistance through,a State Medicaid plan or waiver under      title XIX of such Act (42 U.S.1396 5 et seq.).       (b) Waiver and Appeal in theSenate.--Subsection (a) may be      waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote      of three-fifths of the Members,duly chosen and sworn. An      affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the      Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall berequired to sustain an      appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised      under subsection (a).       (c) Waiver inthe House.--It shall not be in order in the      House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that      waives the applicationof subsection (a). As disposition of a      point of order under this subsection, the Chair shall put the      question of considerationwith respect to the rule or order,      as applicable. The question of consideration shall be      debatable for 10 minutes by the Memberinitiating the point of      order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall otherwise      be decided without intervening motionexcept one that the      House adjourn.         The Vote on the Previous Question: What it ReallyMeans       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      Avote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democraticminority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedentsof the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to director      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the      previousquestion is to give the opposition a chance to decide      the subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's      ruling of January13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal      of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question      passes the control ofthe resolution to the opposition'' in      order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of      the majority party offered arule resolution. The House      defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition      rose to a parliamentary inquiry, askingwho was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, thegentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the      firstrecognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed toan      immediate vote on adopting the resolution .  .  . [and] has      no substantive legislative or policy implications      whatsoever.'' Butthat is not what they have always said.      Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative      Process in the UnitedStates House of Representatives, (6th      edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the      previous question vote intheir own manual: ``Although it is      generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority      Member controlling the timewill not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question onthe rule .  .  .  . When      the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of      the time passes to the Member who led theopposition to      ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then      controls the time, may offer an amendment to therule, or      yield for the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchaptertitled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reportedfrom the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules,control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and      whocontrols the time for debate thereon.''[[Page H489]]       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantivepolicy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allowsthose with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

Healthcare costs have been growing at the slowest rate in more than 50 years. Seniors in the so-called Medicare doughnuthole have saved more than $23 billion on their prescription drugs. Every American woman can rest easier knowing that women areno longer charged more than men for the same coverage. And 137 million Americans with private insurance now receive freepreventive services.  Despite this remarkable progress, the majority has made it their mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act, no matter thecost, and those costs would extend far beyond the healthcare system.  A recent report found that repeal would cause just New York to lose more than 130,000 jobs in 2019 alone.  The Affordable Care Act has reduced the burden of healthcare costs for hardworking families not only in New York, but acrossthe Nation; and it is those Americans for whom repeal would be so devastating.

Actually, any amendment can be turned in until we finish voting.

At the end of those 2 minutes, we will vote. The first vote is supposed to take 15 minutes. TheSenate is seldom held to 15 minutes. After that, we often go to 10-minute votes, which in the Senate usually only takes about 30minutes.  That is the way we do it here. We make sure everybody gets their chance to vote. We hope people will be around sothey can get here punctually and cast their vote.

526,topic-id,1053,"Mr.President, the repeal resolution we have been debating in the Senate this week will complete the firststep toward reducing the Federal Government's role that has prevented Americans from pursuing affordable and accessible healthcare that meets their needs without emptying their wallets. After we complete our repeal work, the Senate can then vigorouslypursue putting the Nation on a more responsible and sustainable fiscal path and address government's out-of-control spending anda mammoth national debt when we begin our work on the fiscal year 2018 budget.  I thank my colleagues for their considerationand cooperation for bringing us to this point, and I thank Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his leadership in pushingthe Senate to take the first steps to repair the Nation's broken health care system and to remove Washington from the equationin order to put control of health care back where it belongs: with the patients and their families and their doctors.  Thiscommitment to an open, honest, and transparent legislative process is crucial to helping Congress restore the trust of theAmerican people.  Thanks, as well, are due to many Members on this side who came and spoke on the resolution's behalf, whoworked with us and each other to move through the resolution, the debate, the amendments, the votes, the whole process.  Ihave enjoyed my partnership with Senator Sanders as we took on new roles as the top Republican and Democrat on the SenateBudget Committee last We have known each other a long time, and we have served on some of the same Senate committees.I believe he and my colleagues across the aisle share the same goal of establishing a robust and affordable health care systemfor hard-working families. I truly hope that they will work with us to find common ground that delivers more choices and lowercosts in the weeks and months ahead.  Also, I would like to focus for a moment on some of the staff who helped lead us here.  I thank the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee, including my acting staff director, DanKowalski; the director of the budget review and acting deputy staff director, Matt Giroux; the chief counsel, George Everly;senior budget analysts Peter Warren and Steve Robinson; budget analysts Greg D'Angelo, Tom Bork, Becky Cole, David Ditch andSusan Eckerly; and assistant counsels Clint Brown and Thomas Fuller; outreach director Jim Neill; editor Elizabeth Keys; policyassistant Kelsie Wendelberger; and communications director Joe  As well, thanks are due to my personal officestaff, especially my chief of staff, Tara Shaw; my legislative director, Landon Stropko; my health care policy staff, ElizabethSchwartz, Alec Hinojosa, and Chris Lydon; as well as the entire Wyoming team.  I want to pay specific attention to thankingTara Shaw, who is my chief[[Page S273]]of staff. She has been filling a dual role for some time. She was my legislative director. Wehave filled that position now. But she has been acting as the assistant here on the floor as well and done a tremendous job ofmanipulating and coordinating both centers of action.  Now, we have also been supported by the great work of our leadership,floor, and cloakroom staff. I thank them for their continued good work and dedication to this institution and the country as awhole. In particular, I want to thank Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall, Jane Lee, and Scott Raab in the leader's office, andMonica Popp, John Caphuis, and Emily Kirlin in the whip's office, and very especially Laura Dove and Robert Duncan in thecloakroom.  These folks, as well as my budget team, worked hours over the holiday break to ensure our success. Without alltheir work, we would not be here this evening standing on the verge of passing the Senate's repeal resolution that will set thestage for true legislative relief from ObamaCare that Americans have long demanded, while ensuring a stable transition in whichthose with insurance will not lose access to health care coverage.  This will allow us to move step by step on a new set ofreforms, listening carefully to the advice of the millions of Americans who are affected, a step we left out when we did itpreviously. Or, as Senator Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and PensionsCommittee put it, the ObamaCare bridge is collapsing, and we are sending in a rescue team. Then we will build several newbridges to get better health care. Finally, when those bridges are finished, we will close the old bridge.  After 5 days ofconsideration, many hours of debate, and numerous amendments reviewed and voted on, this part of the process can now beconcluded. With that, I ask for the continued support and discussion on this valuable issue. If people have ideas for what oughtto be included, I hope they will talk to us about them. I hope the American people will talk to us about the ideas they thinkneed to be included.  There has been a lot of fearmongering, a lot of supposition about what will happen at the next stage.There were amendments that were put in about the next stage. Those, of course, wound up being nongermane. But we have our workcut out for us. We do have to come through now with a system that will solve the problems for the American people.  Imentioned before that when we started the whole debate on ObamaCare, there were 30 million people uninsured. Today, there are 28million people uninsured. I think that the 30 million people was probably closer to 28 million at that time. One of thedifferences is some people who could not get insurance have insurance, and a bunch of people who had insurance can't affordtheir insurance, and a bunch of people who have insurance can't afford their insurance, as you heard through the debate.  Wewant all the people who want insurance to be covered, and to be covered in such a way that they can actually get the treatment.If you have a $12,000 or $10,000 or $6,000 deductible, that may not happen.  But I thank all of the people who have worked toget us to this point. Our work is now cut out for us even more so.  I know that we can have a spirit of cooperation and workthrough this, or we can use the reconciliation process and do it with 51 votes. But it is far better if we can find commonground and common solutions and get the work done.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgS272-2.txt,1542,"CONCURRENTRESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,11.0,January

1207,topic-id,879,"Mr.Speaker, I stood in the well of this House some days ago, when I was sworn in, and basically said that I amnot naive.  Today, I rise in support of the Affordable Care Act and oppose any effort to repeal it, which just took place. Since the ACAwas enacted in 2010, the uninsured rate in Pennsylvania has fallen by 37 percent. Additionally, millions more Pennsylvanians,who would otherwise be uninsured, have coverage with an employer, Medicaid, individual market, or Medicare coverage as a resultof the new protections provided by the law.  No matter what lens you look through, Pennsylvanians and individuals throughout our Nation have better health coverage andcare today as a result of the Let us keep moving forward and help our communities have healthcare access, quality, andaffordability.  Recently, our Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Wolf, sent a letter to Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to underscore theimportance of furthering access to care, keeping prices affordable and spending in check, and improving health care for those inour home State of  Just in Pennsylvania alone, we have had over 670,000 individuals who have enrolled in HealthChoices, Pennsylvania'smandatory managed care Medicaid program. That is 670,000 individuals who previously did not have access to quality of care.  We do not need the rhetoric of repeal and replace.                                      Commonwealthof Pennsylvania,                                       Office of the Governor,                                Harrisburg, PA, December 20, 2016.     Kevin McCarthy,     House ofRepresentatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman McCarthy: Thank you for the opportunity      toweigh in on the critically important conversation about the      future of health care in our country. As Governor of      theCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, I am immensely proud of the      work we have done to further access to care, keep prices      affordableand spending in check, and improve health outcomes      since my administration began tackling health care as a top      priority.       Oneof my first decisions as Governor was to expand Medicaid      to individuals up to 138 percent of Federal Poverty Level      (FPL). Sincethat decision was made in February 2015, more      than 670,000 individuals have enrolled in HealthChoices,      Pennsylvania's mandatorymanaged care Medicaid program. That's      670,000 Pennsylvanians that previously did not have access to      quality care, if they hadaccess to care at all. Total program      enrollment now tops 2.8 million U.Census      data shows that thecommonwealth's uninsured rate has dropped      from 10.2 percent in 2010 to 6.4 percent in 2015, and state      General Fund costs havebeen reduced by more than $500 million      as a result of Medicaid expansion.       Even before the passage of the Affordable Care Act,Medicaid      was the largest single payer in the United States for      behavioral health services, including mental health and      substanceuse services. In the midst of an exploding heroin      use and opioid abuse epidemic that is gripping Pennsylvania      and the nation,the role that Medicaid pays in addressing this      epidemic cannot be understated. More than 3,500      Pennsylvanians died from heroinand opioid-related overdoses      last year and that number is expected to rise again in 2016.      However, in the first year ofPennsylvania's Medicaid      expansion, almost 63,000 newly eligible Medicaid enrollees      accessed drug and alcohol treatment. Demandson the treatment      system are growing by the day but Medicaid expansion has      opened the door to treatment that otherwise would notbe      available, much less affordable, to those without insurance.       Of course, the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)      arenot limited to those with The ACA has had far-     reaching positive impacts on every community in Pennsylvania      In 2016,more than 439,000 people had selected health coverage      through the       Seventy six percent of those Pennsylvaniansreceived      subsidies to make those plans more affordable. In 2016, 60      percent of those enrollees could obtain coverage for $100      orless after tax credits. For a family, that may be the      difference between choosing to pay for food for dinner or      having stablehealth insurance. In addition, several pieces of      the ACA, including the provision that allows children to      remain on theirparents' insurance until age 26 and the      provision that requires coverage of pre-existing conditions,      have made the benefits ofhealth insurance coverage more      enticing than ever before.       Nonprofits that have historically served as the safety nets      of ourhealth care system saw some relief with the passage of      the For many, this meant they could finally bill for      some of theservices that they've typically provided for free      for individuals who are uninsured. To shift the burden back      on to theseproviders to serve an enormous influx of people      who would lose access to insurance under an ACA repeal is      doing a disservice toour nonprofit partners and our      communities. The upheaval would be instant and real and would      devastate families that havefinally been able to set aside      health coverage from their list of daily worries.       I respectfully ask that you carefullyconsider the needs of      the people as you move forward with discussions about the      future of the All too often we get swept upin the      politics and financial impacts to large businesses and big      political donors and forget that these are real people,      whosuffer from real diseases and every day maladies.      Americans need real, meaningful health care coverage.

They needleadership and compassion and      solutions--and together, we can provide them with all of      those things.       I look forward to futureconversations.

26,topic-id,463,"Mr.Speaker, this year, Texas has the great honor of hosting the Super In just a couple of weeks,Houston will host the largest event of the year in the United States with approximately 100,000 people expected to attend andmore than 100 million expected to tune in on television.  The Department of Homeland Security calls the Super Bowl the most attractive target for those who want to commit harm.Thanks to partnerships between local, state, and Federal officials, K9s will be deployed for bomb detections, officers on thelookout for suspicious activity, and air security will be ramped up, to name just a few of the precautions.  Law enforcement is doing a great job of reminding everyone who plans to attend: if you see something, say something. Sinceit is January and it is Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I want to remind everyone that ``see something, say something''doesn't just apply to unattended backpacks.  During a recent meeting on Capitol Hill, DHS reminded all of us that events such as the Super Bowl bring the good, the bad,and the ugly. While a majority of the attendees are coming to have a good time and with good intentions, the few who do not candisrupt and ruin many lives.  So I ask those who attend to help us in keeping Texas one of the safest and best States in the country by reporting anythingto law enforcement they may believe to be suspicious and allow trained officers to investigate. This includes suspected humantrafficking.  According to the Polaris Project, warning signs of someone being a victim of human trafficking include not being allowed toleave or come and go as they wish; appearing malnourished; not being in control of his or her own identification documents; notbeing allowed to speak for themselves; and showing signs of physical abuse, torture, or physical restraint.  While law enforcement will be ramping up efforts to reach out to victims and give them the resources they need to get help,it lies on each and every one of us to be aware of our surroundings and help when someone is in trouble or something is notright.  It is important to remember that human trafficking doesn't just happen during large sporting events. It happens every day,often going unseen. While events like the Super Bowl help bring it to our attention, it is important to remember that, when theevent is over, men and women, boys and girls are still being victimized each and every day.  UNICEF has estimated there were 1.5 million victims of human trafficking in the United States alone in 2014, and that numbersoars to 27 million worldwide. This is a problem that is going to continue to need our attention 365 days a year. We have got towork together to end this form of human slavery.

Americans like my constituent Dotty Legg from Victoria, Texas, wrote to my office with a desperate plea to get relief fromthe effects of In 2012, Dotty's coverage was around $400 a month with a $2,500 deductible. In 2014, it went up toalmost $600. In 2015, $700 a month, and that is coverage for just one person.  Well, in 2016, Dotty's carrier told her they could no longer cover her, so she had to go somewhere else. She went to anothercarrier and they only had an option that was almost $700 a month, and her deductible skyrocketed to $6,500. That is prettyunaffordable for something called the Affordable Care  I have got to tell you, back before ObamaCare, back before the Affordable Care Act, a policy with a $6,500 deductible wouldhave been one of the least expensive policies you could have bought. It would have been a catastrophic policy. We have got tofix this.  It gets even worse. We don't see what goes on in 2017. The company is pulling out. Dotty can't find coverage at all.  The Affordable Care Act is not affordable, and it is full of broken promises. Most of the promises made were broken withIf you like your doctor, you can keep them. She hasn't been able to keep her doctor. Prices are going to go down? If you like your policy, you are going to keep it. Didn't happen.  We have got to fix this, and Republicans have a plan.

They often movefar from home and family to be with their spouse on military orders, but they give up their friends, the comfort of home, andeven some of their Second Amendment rights.  The Gun Control Act of 1968 limits citizens' rights to purchase a handgun by requiring that it only be bought in the Statewhere they are considered residents. Exceptions were made for Active-Duty military members but not their spouses; and that iswhy I have introduced H.256, the Protect Our Military Families' Second Amendment Rights Act, which allows spouses of Active-Duty servicemembers to purchase firearms in the State where they live under their spouse's military orders.  Military spouses should not be denied their Second Amendment rights because they choose to live with their husband or wifewhile they are deployed. Spouses have the right to defend themselves and their families, just like everyone else.

I saw what happened when badWashington policies almost destroyed my hometown by creating the environment for manufacturing jobs to go overseas. I watchedFederal programs that were failing to meet the needs of my friends and neighbors try to take the place of good jobs.  The Federal programs weren't fixing the underlying programs in my hometown. They were simply catching people in the cycle ofpoverty, and we surely didn't want a handout. We wanted jobs.  I was faced with a choice of whether or not to move my dental practice and my family away from my hometown to a moreprofitable community or get involved and be part of the solution. I chose to get involved and work to better the lives of myneighbors and my hometown.  Instead of being satisfied with one-size-fits-all government programs that simply perpetuated the existing problems, weworked to bring manufacturing jobs back to West Point, Georgia, by making targeted investments in economic development andinfrastructure.  We attracted a Kia Motors manufacturing plant, and the automotive industry brought with it suppliers and other relatedbusinesses that produced over 15,000 jobs in just a few years.                              {time}  1815  The city of West Point and the surrounding area today is revitalized not because of Federal Government programs orregulations, but because we worked at the local level to find solutions to meet the needs of our area.  I ran for Congress so that I could apply these lessons at the Federal level. We need policies that make America the mostcompetitive place in the world to do business instead of creating policies that incentivize companies to take their jobsoverseas. We need policies that help get people out of poverty instead of trapping them in a multigenerational cycle ofproperty.  I know firsthand that more government programs do not make communities, schools, or individuals great. In fact, I have livedthrough and governed out of the dependence created by bad D.policy and government programs that continue to trap people inpoverty.

Unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, we as a nation have strayed from that vision.  Today too many Americans feel left out.

Mr.Speaker, this does not have to be the fate of this It does not. The 115th Congress can be remembered as theone that buried party labels for good and focused on fixing the system.

1210,topic-id,782,"Mr.Speaker, given that last week I took the oath of[[Page H536]]office as a Member of the new 115th Congress ofthe United States and given that next week we will watch President-elect Trump also take the oath of office, I want to share afew thoughts on the deep importance of this constitutional duty that we share.  Mr.Speaker, as you are aware, last week on Capitol Hill was marked by a day of celebration. It was a day of renewal offriendships, even between people who have deep, deep disagreements in this body. Families and guests all gathered to share inthe moment's excitement and meaning, and Members of Congress congratulated one another on their recent victories. We all took areprieve from the intensity of the policy debate for just a moment. But amidst all of that swirl of activity, the day was setapart by the oath of office.  Mr.Speaker, the oath lays down a clear marker of the serious obligations ahead for all of us. In our day and time, we nolonger are deeply connected to this concept of oath. We see it in the courtroom when somebody is required to tell the truth. Wewill see it again next week when President-elect Trump is sworn in. But we rarely take the time to reflect on its deepermeaning.  We see it more like an old tradition, a nostalgic option that we exercise out of deference to our history. However, the oathis much, much more. It is a solemn declaration. It is a pause, the start of sacred duty.  By taking an oath, you effectively hold your very self at ransom. You commit, at the deepest levels, that you will performthe tasks ahead of you to the best of your ability.  The oath is the ultimate test and measure of integrity. If you violate it, you tear at the center of your being, to thedetriment of not only yourself but to the community, to those you are sworn to serve. This is a very high bar, indeed, Mr. I am reminded of the words of Sir Thomas More, who was the Lord High Chancellor of England during the 16th century. Hestrove to live a life worthy of excellence in public service. But in the end, he was put to death by the very state that hesought to so nobly serve.  In an earlier reflection on the idea of oath, Sir Thomas More had this to say:  ``When a man takes an oath, he's holding his own self in his own hands like water, and if he opens his fingers then, heneedn't hope to find himself again.''  Mr.Speaker, throughout that wonderful day last week of our swearing in here in the body, I was reflecting personally on asingular word. That word is replenishment.  Our American system of governance has an extraordinary capacity to replenish itself with new ideas, new people, andrefreshed perspectives. Our political system starts with the belief that political power is derived from each person's dignity.  By voting, citizens invest that very power in the Representatives that are sent here to make judgments on their behalf. But,of course, to earn that right in the first place, the Representative must make his case to the people. In spite of the drama, inspite of the raucous nature of elections--and we have just come through one--the fact that America goes through this cycle ofconstant replenishment is truly an extraordinary gift.  Mr.Speaker, as I stood in the center aisle right here last week, I raised my right hand. I raised it right along witheveryone else who is a Member of this new 115th Congress, and I took that oath of office.  Mr.Speaker, I just think it is worthwhile to read these powerful words:  ``I do solemnly swear, or affirm, that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without anymental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I amabout to enter, so help me God.''  Mr.Speaker, indeed, this is a very high bar. This is a sacred duty. This is a solemn task. It sets this body and our systemof governance apart by forcing each of us who have been given this extraordinary privilege of taking on the heavy mantel andweighty responsibility of making decisions on behalf of this great country, and to do so to the best of our ability, having putour very self, the integrity of what it means to be a person, on the line to uphold that commitment.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH535-4.txt,1793,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,13.0,January

Wehave all heard from constituents and families who are struggling to get by as they suffer the consequences of the fatally flawedhealthcare law.  In my home State of North Carolina, the average ObamaCare premium has increased by a staggering 40 percent. Terry fromAdvance, North Carolina, is a 70-year-old retiree, but now he is working part time just to help pay for his wife's healthcarepremiums, which jumped from $300 a month to more than $887 a month.  On top of higher premiums, deductibles have skyrocketed, too. Patricia from Kernersville now has a whopping $6,550deductible, and her premiums increased by 80 percent this year. Like so many Americans, Patricia is paying more for lesscoverage.  Despite being promised, ``if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it,'' millions of Americans have been kicked offtheir plans. Scott from Hickory has had his health insurance canceled three times now; disrupting his continuity of care.  We have also heard from countless small-business owners who can no longer afford coverage for their employees because oflimited resources and soaring costs. Facing similar challenges, school leaders and college administrators have spoken out abouthow ObamaCare is exacerbating tight budgets--hurting teachers, faculty members, and, ultimately, the students they serve.  The current situation is not sustainable; so Republicans are here on a rescue mission by providing the American peoplerelief. It is time to repeal President Obama's government takeover of health care. It is time to advance patient-centeredreforms that lower costs, provide more choices, and put working families--not government bureaucrats--in control of their healthcare.  I urge my colleagues to support this budget resolution because it will move us one step closer to the patient-centeredhealth care the American people desperately want and need.

What commands my respect, why I rise today, and what I believe binds[[Page H527]]Jim so closely to the hearts of everyone who hasever worn the uniform is his humility. General Mattis understands not only how to wield military power decisively but also itslimits.

Mr.Speaker, it is with sadness that I rise this evening to oppose legislation that would allow General Mattis to serve asour 26th Secretary of This might seem contradictory. It might appear partisan or unpatriotic. In fact, the opposite istrue.  My position is entirely straightforward, Mr.When it comes to something as basic as civilian control of themilitary, I believe exceptions should be granted for extraordinary circumstances, not extraordinary people.  For more than half a century, recently retired military leaders have been barred from assuming the top post at the Pentagon.The Members of Congress who enshrined this prohibition in law had fresh memories of the Second World They are wary of adecorated general slipping off his uniform and immediately stepping into a civilian role. They were apprehensive aboutinstalling a Secretary of Defense who could be perceived as partial to one service over others. They are also worried aboutwhether the reputation of our military as a nonpartisan institution would suffer if its most respected leaders could transitiondirectly into political positions.  The last time a recently retired military man, the great George Marshall, was permitted to lead the Pentagon, America wasfacing the prospect of a humiliating defeat in the Korean war. Even then, congressional leaders specified that his waiver was aone-time exception to the rule.  While our country must confront an array of threats today, none of our national security challenges remotely compares to amassive ground war in the Far  Mr.Speaker, I understand that many of my colleagues are eager to grant this waiver because they greeted the announcement ofMattis' appointment with a sigh of relief, a sigh of relief because it meant Donald Trump had picked someone who is known to becompetent and patriotic, and someone who doesn't have a cozy relationship with the Russian  That is an understandable reaction, and we are all extremely confident that General Mattis will do a much better job thanGeneral Flynn or some of the other alternatives.  We shouldn't let Trump's bad behavior and poor judgment compel Congress to lower the bar. If anything, we should raise thebar for Trump, not make exceptions just because we are glad he didn't go with someone like  Mr.Speaker, a simple set of rules and norms form the fabric of American democracy. Since the founding of the Republic,leaders of every party and political persuasion have upheld this basic framework. For generations, American leaders have placedprinciple before party.  With remarkably few exceptions, Presidents from George Washington to Barack Obama have valued our institutions and ourdemocracy more than private gain or personal advancement. Now, Mr.Speaker, we have a President-elect who doesn't think therules should apply to him. We have a President-elect who is brazenly breaking norms left and right. We have a President-electwho promises to make America great again, but is dividing the country as never before.  Here in the United States, we believe every American is entitled to equal justice under the law. But Donald Trump believesthat a different set of rules should apply to him than apply to President Obama or President Bush or any of the other men whohave held our highest office.  Unlike his predecessors, Donald Trump has stubbornly refused to release his tax returns. Unlike his predecessors, DonaldTrump has irresponsibly meddled in our foreign relations throughout the transition. Unlike his predecessors, Trump has donenothing to diminish massive conflicts of interest stemming from his complex business dealings overseas.  Yet, instead of applying a check on this pattern of reckless behavior, House Republicans have rolled over time and timeagain.  Mr.Speaker, the Republicans won't stand up to a President entering office with just a 37 percent approval rating because itis precisely that 37 percent of the public that scares them. In fact, that 37 percent has terrified them for 8 long years. Itscared them into turning a blind eye to the racist birther conspiracy theories. It scared them into shutting down the That 37 percent even scared them into risking a debt limit default which would have immediately triggered anunprecedented economic meltdown.  Mr.Speaker, we need a President like Barack Obama who looks out for 100 percent of the American people. We need a Presidentlike Barack Obama who abides by 100 percent of the rules. We need a House majority that is willing to uphold its constitutionalobligations 100 percent of the time.  Moving forward in this Congress, the power to check Donald Trump is in Republican hands and depends on Republican votes, butthey have been too scared, too cowed, and too unwilling to do what these tough times demand.  If we, the Members of this great body, won't stand up for the norms that have sustained this Republic for 238 years, thenwho will?  General Mattis is a patriot, but now is the time for all of us in this Chamber to reiterate a basic truth in ademocracy--rules matter. They shouldn't be discarded at the first sign of difficulty. They shouldn't be undercut by waivers.Important precedents must be upheld in good times and bad.

304,topic-id,5441,"Mr.President, I come to thefloor today to discuss the continued broken promises of ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--that passed in the most partisan offashions several years ago, and to discuss the process by which we are putting together a repeal-and-replace package and thepieces we will be voting on tonight and over the next several weeks and months.  ObamaCare's failures are simple. Thepromises that have been broken are clear. While partisan supporters of the administration's plan continue to promote the successof this poorly conceived law, Coloradans know far better.  Time and again, hundreds of thousands of Coloradans have felt theconsequences of the Affordable Care Act in their pocketbooks, in their workplaces, in their doctor's offices, and in the choicesthey have for health care. The past 6 years have been marred by higher costs, fewer choices, and less competition in Coloradoand across the  It is now time that we stand up for the American people to restore reliable and stable health care,as well as health care markets and insurance markets, and to undo the damage done to our health care by the failed law known as Let's just review the broken promises we have seen--not just a broken promise that the President himself made tothe American people but broken promises echoed by the partisan supporters of President Obama assured the Americanpeople over 35 times: Don't worry about ObamaCare because if you like your plan, then you can keep it, period. It is on video.It is on YouTube, and you can probably find it on It is available to find, this first broken promise.  AsColoradans began to receive cancellation notices, they quickly learned that this promise was far from the truth. In late 2013,nearly 335,000 small group and individual policies in Colorado were canceled due to requirements in the Affordable Care Act.These cancellations also included my family's cancellation, because we had chosen to stay in the private market in Butin August of 2013, we received the letter that 335,000 others received in Colorado saying that our policy had been canceledthanks to  But, unfortunately, those cancellations--those 330,000-plus cancellations in August of 2013--were justthe beginning, because in January of 2014, the Colorado Division of Insurance canceled an additional nearly 250,000 plans forthe same reason.  Again in 2015, Coloradans were made abruptly aware of the failures of ObamaCare when another 190,000 moreplans on the individual and small group market were canceled. In total, according to the Congressional Research Service, over750,000 health insurance plans were canceled in Colorado between 2013 and 2015.  The promise that if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it was so bad--that promise was so broken--that the fact-checking organization PolitiFact named it the``Lie of the Year'' for 2013. PolitiFact didn't really need to name it the ``Lie of the Year,'' becauseover 750,000 people in Colorado got a letter in the mail telling them it was a lie.  Broken promise 2 from ObamaCare:Americans were told that the Affordable Care Act would reduce costs for families, businesses, and our government. In fact,President Obama said that under his new health care law, a typical family would save up to $2,500 a year on premiums by the endof his first term. Look it up on video, on However, hit with the rising costs, Coloradans became acutely aware this toowas yet another broken promise. Statewide, premiums in Colorado will rise by 20.4 percent on average for plan year 2017 on theindividual market. That number is even higher in some of the more rural areas, like the Western Slope of Where is theWestern Slope? That is what most people think of when they think of Colorado, an area with mountains, forests, and great beauty.That area has been harder hit than many areas across the country with higher premium increases.  A year prior to this nextplan year, in 2016, the Colorado Division of Insurance found that premiums on the individual market rose a whopping 25 percenton the Western Slope, plus the higher than 20 percent premium increases.  One woman living in Colorado on the Western Slopesaw her premium rise from just a little over $300 a month to $1,828 per month, or nearly $22,000 a year. Here is her quote:       It's actually like another mortgage payment. I have friends      who are uninsured right now becausethey can't afford it.      Insurance is hard up here.  That is the Western Slope of Colorado, where people have seen mortgage-payment-size health insurance bills being added to them because of a bill that the President promised would lower their healthcare costs.  An increase of nearly 26 percent is devastating for most families, but in 2014 an Americans for Prosperity studyshowed that nearly 150,000 Coloradans saw their health insurance become 77 percent more expensive. These sharp increases inprices and coverage have left Coloradans reeling, and we have a duty--a duty--to make sure we provide them with the financialrelief they deserve and the health care we know we can put together.  Broken promise 3 of the Affordable Care Act was themenu of options that was promised--the choices that the Affordable Care Act would bring to the marketplace. President Obamapromised Americans that a greater choice and a menu of options to choose from would be right around the corner as a result ofthe Affordable Care Act, but Coloradans again found out that wasn't true. Of the 64 counties in Colorado, 14 counties have onlyone carrier to choose from and 29 counties have only two plans for the year 2017 on the individual market. We can see the plansright here. That is the western part of Colorado that I was talking about seeing such high premiums--77 percent and a higherpercentage next year. Here, we can see counties with only two carriers to choose from, and 14 counties only have one to choosefrom.  So the President's signature health care law failed in this respect to create the menu of options, but it did succeedin creating monopolies.  President Obama also insisted that competition would increase through consumer-run coops. TheFederal Government spent a great deal of money to prop up the consumer coops and to make sure they had the marketing in place.Over 80,000 Coloradans felt the impacts of this broken promise when the Colorado health coop was declared to be insolvent byColorado insurance commissioner Marguerite Eighty thousand people had their insurance coops declared insolvent becauseof the poor Affordable Care Act law.  Not only did the failure of this promise leave 80,000 people scrambling to findcoverage, but it forced the coop to default on its Federal startup loan, valued at an estimated $72 million. So 80,000 peoplewere out of coverage because of the failure of the Affordable Care Act, and $72 million went out of the American taxpayers'pockets because of the Affordable Care Act--money the American taxpayers will never see again. What is more, it cost taxpayersnearly $40 million to shut the coop down. Of the 23 original coops, only 6 are remaining and 17 consumer-run coops as a resulthave failed. The 23 startup insurers received a total of roughly $2.5 billion in loans under the Affordable Care Act, and only 6remain. That means that even more money the American people gave to this government to be good stewards of--through their hard-earned tax dollars, through their premium taxes--will never be seen again. This is an unacceptable and egregious use of taxpayerdollars.  But the careless spending under ObamaCare doesn't just stop there. An audit was released 2 weeks ago by the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, and it found that Connect for Health Colorado, Colorado'sState exchange,[[Page S233]]misspent and mishandled nearly $9.7 million in grants to establish its marketplace. The audit concluded byrecommending that the marketplace be required to repay the $9.7 million identified by the Federal The audit foundthat Connect for Health Colorado did not adequately document $4.4 million, improperly transferred costs totaling nearly$300,000, and made $164,000 in overpayments to subgrantees without identifying a reason.  Furthermore, Connect for HealthColorado spent more than $211,000 on bonuses to executives without providing performance evaluations. The kicker on the $211,000in bonuses--the largest of which was $18,500 for the CEO--back in 2013, when the exchange was trying to get started, was that thethen-CEO of Connect for Health Colorado wanted a raise even though the exchange had enrolled far fewer than half the people itwas supposed to. So we have an executive asking for a raise in an exchange that hadn't even met the lowest of the lowpredictions for what it would do. Here we are, with a new audit from the Office of Inspector General saying that $9.7 millionwas fraudulently spent. To quote a member of the board at the time:       Given the poor performance forthe first two months of      enrollments, I think it's incredibly audacious for the      executive director to request a salary increase.       I think most people would feel like if you're a CEO and you      are significantly underperforming the goals you helped set,      thenyou layer on that the money comes from public funds, I      think it is highly inappropriate.  I have heard colleagues in theHouse and the Senate talk about how CEOs are overpaid for the work they do. If the stock prices are low or dividends aren'tthere, then they shouldn't be as highly compensated as they are. But here we are, a government-funded program from the Coloradohealth exchange and others around the country using Federal dollars to give bonuses to people who haven't even met the basicprojections they were supposed to. It is an unacceptable use of funds.  But the problem is that it is not just funds wastedsomewhere else. It is funds wasted that came from the American people's pockets--hard-earned dollars that are being misspent.  The Affordable Care Act has had a negative impact on business owners and individuals. Let's talk about some of the effectson businesses. I will share a letter given to me, from a small business owner to his customers, letting them know how theAffordable Care Act impacted his prices.       Dear Valued Customer,       There is never a good time toannounce a price increase but      we have to. Effective February 1, 2017 we will have a 2%      across the board increase for a reasonbeyond our control.       We've had many challenges over the years but none like      this. 100% of this price increase is due to onething only,      the Affordable Care       The Affordable Care Act has caused our health insurance      premiums to skyrocket by 42%and our choices of insurance      providers to dwindle down to one.       Some of you may be faced with a similar challenge. It      seemsto be a problem all over the U. So now we have the double whammy on the American consumer. Not only are they requiredby law to buy insurance they can't afford, but they then go buy consumer goods whose prices have increased as a result of theAffordable Care So they are squeezed at home because they have to pay higher insurance premiums--thanks to the brokenpromises of ObamaCare, thanks to the lack of choice they have with Now they have to pay higher prices at the grocerystore or the implement dealership--wherever it is--because they have had to increase their prices--the people who make those goods,the people who manufacture those goods, the foundries, the equipment dealers. They have to pay for their insurance premiums thatthey are required, under a broken law, to search and find.  But it is important that we talk more than just about thebusiness impact of the Affordable Care Act, because, day after day, I hear stories from Coloradans who have felt the brunt ofObamaCare's failures. Whether it is letters or emails to the office or whether it is town meetings across Colorado, I hearstories, and I wish to take this opportunity to share some of these from my constituents that demonstrate the impacts of A letter I received from an individual residing in Aurora, CO, said:       Cory--As abusiness owner who pays for my own insurance,      ObamaCare is not working. Last year, my premium went up 20%      for less insurancewith a higher deductible and less coverage.       This year we just got a cancelation notice that our      insurance plan will nolonger be offered and we must start      looking for a new plan yet again.       I read that moreand more insurance companies are pulling      out of the Colorado marketplace.       The system is broken, it has only cost us more andmore      money for lower quality health care.       Please--do everything you can to stop this failed program.  That is from aColoradan who has struggled under the burdens and broken promises of  Let's talk about a letter we received from afamily living in Lafayette,       I have a ``Bronze'' HSA plan covering myself, my wife and      my twodaughters.       I just received my renewal notice from [the] insurer      informing me that my premium for 2017 will increase by38.9%.       To put that in perspective our family went from $1,200 per      month or $14,400 per year to $1,667 or $20,000 per year.       While the premium is increasing, the benefits are reduced      as annual deductibles for individual and family plans      areincreasing to $5,000 and $10,000 respectively. This is      unconscionable!       The cost of my health insurance coverage has morethan      doubled in the last three years and benefits have reduced      with each successive premium increase.       The ACA needs to berepealed immediately!  That is a letter from a family of four who saw a dramatic increase in price, both from the amountthey pay every month to nearly $20,000 a year, to a deductible that has gone from $5,000 to $10,000.  Here is another storyfrom a young woman residing in Colorado Springs, CO:       This is the third time since 2010 that I willbe losing my      health insurance plan because of  This is the third time. Do remember the promise that if youlike your plan, you can keep your plan?  This woman from Colorado Springs already has had her plan canceled three times.       Now I am losing the option of being in the plan I want to      be in.  There is the secondpromise--that if you like your plan, you can keep your plan; you get the choice of keeping your doctor--broken promises.       I must settle for being in an HMO, and still pay 400% what      I was paying for premiums in 2010.       Ialso just learned that my carrier is raising rates by 25%      next year on the individual market.       My premiums are already fourtimes higher than they were      before the Affordable Care My deductible and out of      pocket amounts are also much higher.       Obamacare is nothing but a heavy tax for us. Our income      doesn't qualify us for an Obamacare credit.       Since our premiumshave quadrupled I figure we are now      paying for the insurance for three or four other families      when we pay for our premiums.       I am very disappointed in Congress for letting this go on      and on and on.       Year after year now my premiums skyrocket and Ihave fewer      choices in plans. Pretty soon there will be no incentive left      to work hard and earn money in this country.  The government will take it from you and give it to people [to spend irresponsibly in Washington, DC].  To this youngwoman in Colorado Springs, we are doing something--finally. Last year, we put on the President's desk a repeal of ObamaCare, andof course it was vetoed. But this week, we will be able to start the process to repeal and replace ObamaCare, signed into law bya President who will indeed sign it.  Another story I would share from a family in Fort Lupton, CO:       It is impossible to afford health care for us.       We are right above the Medicaid limit by $400, and my      husband has gonewithout health care for 2 years. They keep      taxing him.       Soon we will be a family of 4 with no health insurance. We      will bepaying so much to afford health insurance we will      struggle to buy food. We need help and we don't know where to      find it.  These stories demonstrate what Americans are experiencing as a result of ObamaCare and its broken promises. No familyshould have to decide between purchasing health coverage and putting food on the table. We owe it to these strugglingfamilies--stories we just heard, about anyone who is sick or might get sick--to roll up our sleeves[[Page S234]]and provide realsolutions and to recognize that the Affordable Care Act was a failure, it caused calamity, and it continues to destroy and crushour health care market.  ObamaCare was a poorly designed law that was rushed through Congress on the most partisan of votes. Its nearly 20,000 pages of regulations have had a devastating impact on many hard-working Thatis why I will continue to work hard to find solutions that will relieve the financial burden this law has imposed on Coloradansand Americans throughout the country.  We need a health care system that promotes competition, increases flexibility,encourages innovation, and puts Americans back in control of their health care--one that gets ``Congress'' out of thepicture, one that safeguards the doctor-patient relationship, preserves Medicare for our seniors, and one that protects the mostvulnerable among us.  I will continue to fight for all of those in Colorado and across the country who are looking for realhealth care reform, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to do so.  We have a chance this week toact, and I look forward to replacing ObamaCare with something that actually fixes and makes this system work again.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cotton). The majority whip.  Mr.Mr.President, soon the Senate will vote to repeal This is for at least two reasons. One is that ObamaCarehas been an abysmal failure when you look at the promises that were made to sell it and actually what has been delivered interms of higher premiums, higher deductibles, and more challenges for ordinary Many Americans now find that theirdeductible is so high that they are effectively self-insured.  I remember like it was yesterday--actually, it was some 6 yearsago--that President Obama said: If you like what you have, you can keep it, in terms of your health coverage. He said: If youlike your doctor, you can keep your doctor. He said: The average family of four would see their premiums go down by $2,500.  None of that has proven to be true. ObamaCare was sold under false claims, false promises. We know that many headlines todaydemonstrate that premiums are higher than people can afford. They can't keep the insurance plan they had and they liked, andthey have to go find another doctor, sometimes as often as each year because the insurance coverage they have is no longer beingwritten because insurance companies simply can't survive in this marketplace. In many instances, they end up having to leaverural parts of the country, particularly rural parts of places like rural  A lot of this has to do with redtape. A lotof this has to do with the companies that have been forced to pass along higher costs to consumers or leave, and that is exactlythe sort of thing that happens when the government intervenes in the marketplace, unintended consequences occur.  I mentionedincreased rural access to health care. That was actually supposed to be one of the selling points of ObamaCare, and now it isjust another example of how this law has truly failed. Even so, even having acknowledged some of the failures of ObamaCarethemselves, our Senate Democratic colleagues are refusing to acknowledge the catastrophe they created because this law waspassed on a purely partisan basis, without any votes on the other side of the aisle, and signed by President Obama into lawwithout any participation by Now, having created this mess--creating this crisis really--they made clear they want nopart of fixing the problem. Apparently, they would rather ignore the harmful effects brought about by ObamaCare and try to thenassign blame to those who are trying to rescue the American people from the failure known as  We are confident theAmerican people know the truth. They know President Obama made promise after promise to get ObamaCare passed. They know thereality is a lot different, and it is a lot dimmer than the picture he painted. In my mind, such widespread public deceptionamounts to nothing more and nothing less than a simple case or, actually, I should say a colossal case of consumer fraud.  Inmy former job as attorney general of the State of Texas, we had a consumer protection bureau that went after scam artists andothers who deceived the American consumer, Texas consumer, and promised them one thing and delivered another. That is nothingmore or nothing less than what happened here where President Obama promised the American people the Moon when it came to healthcare, and they found out that those promises were hollow indeed.  That is why the American people want ObamaCare to become athing of the past. One recent poll showed that about 8 out of every 10 Americans wanted to change the law in significant ways orsee it replaced altogether. The truth is, ObamaCare is a terrible law that continues to hurt many American families trying toget by.  Americans all around the country are asking for help, asking for relief from this terrible law, and demanding abetter health care system that actually delivers results, not just empty promises. We can't get to that replacement until weactually repeal ObamaCare, which will start with the budget resolution we will pass this evening or late tonight.  This isnot a rushed or hurried response; it is merely the first step in a deliberative process that Republicans in both Chambers ofCongress have been working on for years. The only difference is now we will soon have a President in office who understands thatpeople are hurting, asking for change, and are in need of promises that are actually delivered.  It is not too late for ourDemocratic colleagues to work with us to get this job done and move forward with a solid plan that helps all Iunderstand the temptation, after creating this legislation, this health care debacle known as ObamaCare, to now say it is yourbaby, you deal with it and then try to assign blame if things don't work out exactly the way we hope. The fact is, we always dobetter here, and the American people are always better served when we try to work together in a bipartisan way, on a step-by-step basis, to deliver on the promises we made.  This budget resolution that we will be voting on tonight is not aboutIt is not about cutting health care for millions of people. Rather, the opposite is true. We are actually going to tryto save the American consumer from falling through the cracks or finding out that the promises that have been made to them aresimply not true or that they are burdened with health care policies that they simply can't afford.  What we are about isgetting rid of a failed policy that now 6 years in is still making life harder for millions of I am eager to makesure we keep our promise. That is the second part of this. We promised the American people that if they gave us an opportunityby electing a new President, by retaining the majorities in the House and the Senate, as they have, that we would deliver byrepealing and replacing That starts with tonight's vote.                      Nomination of Rex Tillerson  Mr.President, this morning I had the honor of introducing Mr.Rex Tillerson,President-Elect Trump's nominee to be Secretary of State, at his confirmation hearing before the Foreign Relations Iwas joined by my colleague Senator Cruz from Texas, former Senator Sam Nunn, and former Secretary of Defense Mr.Allof us said that Mr.Tillerson is an inspired and outstanding appointment by President-Elect  I have come to learn thatMr.Tillerson is a person whom I both respect and admire the longer I have gotten to know him. He has proven over his decades-long career in the top echelons of a large global company that he has what it takes to represent the United States on the worldstage. True, to this point, his responsibility has been toward shareholders of the company he has represented, but I have everyconfidence he can transfer that same sort of diligence, that same sort of acumen, and those relationships, from which a largemultinational corporation has benefited, now to the American people, and the United[[Page S235]]States of America can resume its placeon the world stage with him as our top diplomat.  I said before that one of my biggest frustrations with the currentadministration is it regularly ignores our allies while intentionally propping up or strengthening our adversaries. I have everyconfidence that Mr.Tillerson will flip that narrative, and he will help the United States regain our leadership role in theworld by unapologetically supporting our allies and friends while keeping our enemies in check. He is the right man to lead theState Department, and I hope we confirm him soon.                      Nomination of Jeff Sessions  Mr.President, let me add, today we are engaged in the second day of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding thenomination of Senator Jeff Sessions, our colleague of longstanding, to be U.Attorney  Some people whohaven't had the benefit of working with Senator Sessions know him by his record. Frankly, given some of the testimony, Idon't recognize the person who is being described by those who, for various reasons, are opposing his nomination. We know thathe has an outstanding record of service, both to the people of Alabama, to the United States as U.attorney, and then in theU.Senate for the last 20 years.  It is ironic that we are having a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on thequalifications of Senator Sessions to serve as Attorney General, a committee on which he has served for 20 years. Ourcolleagues across the aisle don't need to have a hearing to know Jeff Sessions because they already know him well. Theyknow him to be a man of honor, a man of principle, a man who is true to his word, and who believes, above all, that the role ofthe Attorney General is to enforce the law of the land--something we have not seen in the last 8 years during the Obamaadministration, where the Justice Department has become a political arm of the White  I have every confidence thatSenator Sessions, as the next Attorney General of the United States, will restore the reputation of the Department ofJustice and the Office of Attorney General to one that respects the rule of law and dispenses equal justice under the law.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, over the past few days, we have been listening to the health care horror stories from across the country,such as families earning an annual income of $50,000 who opted for high-deductible coverage and are facing up to $6,000 or, inone case, $10,000 of out-of-pocket costs before their coverage even begins. That is not affordable insurance.  Nearly 7 yearsafter the enactment of ObamaCare and 3 years into implementation, one thing is crystal clear: ObamaCare has failed, butRepublicans are working to fix the damage. Over the past several years, it is clear that this law is simply unworkable formillions of hard-working Insurance markets are collapsing, premiums are soaring, and health care choices aredisappearing, but the answer isn't to ignore the problem. With ObamaCare getting worse by the day, it is time for us to act. Therepeal resolution we are debating this week promises relief from ObamaCare and provides the tools necessary to immediatelyrepeal this failed law while ensuring a stable transition period to a patient-centered health care system that gives Americansaccess to quality, affordable care. The resolution includes instructions to authorizing committees sothat repeal legislation can move through a fast track process and can pass with a simple majority in the House and Theseinstructions to committees are provided to allow immediate action on repeal with the intent of sending legislation to the newPresident's desk as soon as possible.  Headlines from across the Nation highlight the urgent call to action. The New YorkTimes says: ``Obamacare Premiums Set to Rise Even for Savvy Shoppers.'' The Wall Street Journal says: ``Insurers Move to LimitOptions in Health-Care Exchange Plans.'' The Baltimore Sun says: ``Marylanders face hefty rate increases for ObamaCare.'' TheOmaha World Herald says: ``Health insurance rate increases may have some Nebraskans in sticker shock.'' The Miami Herald says:``Florida's ObamaCare premiums to rise average 19 percent in 2017, the State says.'' And the Bergen County Record says: ``NewJersey left with just two ObamaCare health providers for 2017.''  My own State of Wyoming is down to one insurer in theindividual market, both on and off the exchange. That is a national scandal. We have heard from people who talked about countieswhere there are no insurers. We have heard people talk about the costs they have both for the premiums and the deductibles. Andjust talking about the premiums, in New Mexico they had some counties where the average cost of a house payment is less than themonthly cost of their health care--much less, about 50 percent less in one instance.  It is also important to look at thefacts surrounding Some on the other side of the aisle like to focus on how many people are insured under the law, butlet's look at how many are not insured. Almost 28 million Americans remain without insurance under Even withinsurance, many still can't afford the care due to surging deductibles. If you can't afford the deductible, you really don'thave insurance. If you can't afford the insurance, you don't have insurance. And it isn't the insurance that is important; it isthe availability of providers that can take care of you. Most of the newly insured gained coverage only through a flawedMedicaid program that is providing inferior quality and threatening to bankrupt States across the  According toresearch from the architect of ObamaCare, Jonathan Gruber--he explicitly said that most of the newly enrolled beneficiaries wereactually eligible for Medicaid before In fact, his research showed that two-thirds of new people signing up forMedicaid were brought into the program, not through ObamaCare but by increased Medicaid advertising.  As America soondiscovered, the President and congressional Democrats focused exclusively on coverage and mandates that were handed down fromWashington instead of patient-centered reforms. Coverage was the silver bullet for them because coverage equaled health care.They forgot a key detail though: The cost of the plans that were mandated made it nearly impossible for many to pay for theinsurance or, if they had coverage, to pay for care with the sky-high deductibles. I know that some people on my staff hadhealth savings accounts that gave them catastrophic coverage. They didn't have to worry about going bankrupt over health care.Their deductibles were lower than the ones that we have with this health care.  Focusing on and highlighting the number ofpeople now enrolled in ObamaCare doesn't translate into anything more than phantom insurance, which, for users plagued byinadequate coverage, is coupled with huge out-of-pocket costs. We are seeing families now having to forgo medical care, notbecause they don't have insurance but because it is simply too expensive to go to the doctor with their ObamaCare health plan.  Normally I would say that you get what you pay for. But with ObamaCare, you seem to just pay without getting much at all. Itis kind of like buying a bus ticket, but when you show up for the trip, they tell you that to get a seat, you are going to haveto spend a little bit more, and then you have to chip in for the gas.  For years, Republicans have pledged to repeal thisdisastrous law. Passing this resolution is just the first step in keeping that promise, clearing the way for consideration ofrepeal legislation that will be signed into law by the new While providing immediate relief from ObamaCare,Republicans will ensure it is a stable transition in which those with insurance will not lose access to health care coverage.This will allow the Nation to move to a patient-centered health care system that gives hard-working Americans access to quality,affordable care. The goal is a more modern health care system where there is innovation to improve the health of all Americans,where insurers are offered new and affordable options, and where families have a more direct say over their own health caredecisions.[[Page S236]]  Unwinding partisan gridlock to make these changes will not be easy. As I noted in my earlier remarks, ourNation has made great strides in improving the quality of life for all Americans, but these transforming changes are alwaysforged in the spirit of bipartisan compromise and cooperation. We still need health care reform, but it has to be done the rightway. Passing this resolution will start building a bridge from ObamaCare's broken promises to better care for each and every Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk willcall the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1079,topic-id,382,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today to make a clarification because while I support this resolution, I oppose thedescription that some here have used. They are calling it a budget. This isn't a budget. It is a paper trail of crimes ourgovernment commits against the future of our Nation vis-a-vis overwhelming debt. We need to be honest. We are sitting on $20trillion in debt, and aside from starting the repeal of the unaffordable care act, this does nothing to address that.  Reluctantly I will vote for it to repeal the monstrosity that is the unaffordable care act.  We were told we need to pass the bill so that we could find out what was in it. Well, we found out what was in it. We sawpremiums skyrocket; we saw families lose their plans and their doctors, even the ones they liked and they wanted to keep; and wesaw businesses struggle. Now we are left in a position where we need to pass this resolution to get rid of what we found.  Liberty and self-determination are the lifeblood of this Nation, and the Nation is terminally ill. Our debt is a cancer thatcontinues to grow; and like a cancer, it doesn't discriminate. It is colorblind, it is gender neutral, and it doesn't care aboutyour political affiliation or what State you are from. It is here, and it continues to grow.[[Page H500]]  Our children are being encumbered, packaged, and sold to the gallows by way of unprecedented debt. This is an unprecedentedtreatment, but if we continue down the ObamaCare unaffordable care act path that we are on, the results are guaranteed.  Today's resolution provides treatment for some of the symptoms, but it is about time that we started getting to the rootcauses of the disease. The more government encroaches on the lives of its citizens, the more debt grows, the less our libertiescan breathe, and the sicker we become.

299,topic-id,714,"Mr.President, I rise in favor of amendment 82. This amendment would make it so anyone inCongress trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act would not be allowed to touch women's health care services.  I have beenlistening to my colleague from Montana and my colleagues in this Chamber speak about health care in our country, and after manyhours, I am worried there is a lack of concern. I am worried there is a basic lack of empathy of what is going to actuallyhappen to millions of Americans, and I am particularly worried about what will happen to women and their children and theirfamilies. So I want to spend a moment just talking about what the ACA actually provides for women and what actually will happenwhen it is no longer there.  I am very concerned that we are barely 1 week into the new Congress and too many of mycolleagues have already made it clear that their most urgent priority this year is to take our country back to its darker dayswhen women could be denied coverage and charged higher health care premiums just because they are women. I am outraged by this,and I stand with millions of American women and men, moms and dads, sons and daughters who are outraged too. The Affordable CareAct uniquely gave women access to health care on a level that was unprecedented. In fact, 9.5 million more women now have accessto basic health care because of that law.  In my State alone, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, women can now have access tocontraceptive care, cancer screenings, and mammograms. Millions of women who were pregnant or survived diseases like cancer areable to keep seeing their doctors without fear that their health insurance companies will take it away, but too many people inthis Chamber don't seem to understand that consequence or seem to care about that consequence. After years of talking about it,some of my colleagues now seem determined--even entitled--to take away this lifesaving health care for millions of women.  Theelection in November was not about women's health care. No one came to Congress with a mandate to take away women's access tomammograms and cancer screenings, but now we are one big step closer to once again making it impossible for millions of Americanwomen to see a doctor when they need to in order to access basic medicine and reproductive health care services so they can livehealthy, happy, productive lives. For some, there is a very real risk that if they do get cancer or some other life-threateningdisease, they will have to declare bankruptcy just to pay for the health care they need. This is something we must standtogether to stop. It will show the American people that we understand what is happening to them. The consequences are too realand too dangerous, and for too many families the consequences are actually life or death.  We should never go back to thedays when insurance companies can tell a woman: You are no longer economic for us. We can't make money insuring pregnant women.We cannot go back to the days where insurance companies can tell a breast cancer survivor to go elsewhere because theirinsurance costs too much. I don't think we can ever go back to the days when insurance companies can simply charge women morefor the same plan than men. We should not turn back women's basic health care rights.  My amendment makes it very clear thatthe Senate would be forbidden from directing the committees to cut funding for basic women's health care services. It wouldensure that the women's health care protections we put into the Affordable Care Act would stay there and women would have accessgoing forward. It protects vital services such as disease screenings and comprehensive reproductive care that millions of womenin my State rely on.  If my colleagues destroy the Affordable Care Act, it will have real, direct, and painful consequencesfor a lot of women and the families who love them. I think it would be what we call the ultimate overreach by Congress, and itwould take years to fix.  I urge my colleagues to not let these protections be taken away from American women and theirfamilies, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very simple amendment.  I yield the floor.  The The minority leader.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgS224-2.txt,1866,REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACTOF 2017,2017.0,11.0,January

Nothing in this amendment will say that you cannot charge women for healthcare or drop their coverage when they become pregnant.

916,topic-id,960,"Mr.President, Irise to strongly oppose this legislation concerning a waiver for General  I know that all of my colleagues on theArmed Services Committee who just left the hearing on this very topic with General Mattis and this entire body take theoversight role of our committee very seriously. We take civilian control of the military as a fundamental constitutionalprinciple of the Founding Even George Washington put aside his commission 5 years before he became our Commander inChief and became the President of the United When Congress in 1947 debated the National Security Act to create theDepartment of Defense and create the Secretary of Defense, they decided to imbue this idea of civilian control into theSecretary of Defense by law, by mandating that he had to be separated from the military at least 10 years before taking on therole of Secretary of Defense, enshrining again this notion that civilian control is so important to our democracy and ourAmerican values.  On Tuesday, the Armed Services Committee had a very compelling hearing. We had two experts testify aboutthe reasons for civilian control and why they are still so important today. The importance of having a Secretary of Defense whobrings a civilian perspective to this position and brings with him or her a breadth of views and experience--those views comingfrom a civilian are very important.  Second, they said it is very important not to politicize our officer ranks, meaning oursenior, top military advisers jockeying for the next job as a political appointee. That undermines the functioning of themilitary, and they testified about countries where it has had such deleterious effects.  The third reason is concern aboutbias toward one service or another. Arguably, if one comes from a particular service, one may have preferences innately for thatbranch of service, which could undermine the strength of our military.  The fourth reason, which is really important intoday's world, is the desire to model civilian control for other countries around the world that are struggling to become moredemocratic, less autocratic, and less militarily run.  Those are the four reasons given as to why civilian control of themilitary is so important. Cohen and Hicks both agreed--despite those four reasons--that from their perspective, it shouldbe abrogated. Cohen said it was because the characteristics of the incoming administration gave him such concern that heneeded to have someone like General Mattis and thought the qualities of General Mattis were important. Even Hicks said itwas the qualities of General Mattis that were so unique and important, but she very importantly said: Never, though, should wesay that it is time for a general to be the Secretary of In her perspective, it should never be that you need ageneral. So for her it was not the exigencies of circumstances; it was the specific characteristics of General  Overwhelmingly, the Senators and the Members of the Armed Services Committee, myself included, have expressed enormousgratitude for the extraordinary service of General That is not in debate. But if there is no civilian in all the worldas of today at this moment who could meet the needs of the incoming administration, then who is to say that there will be nocivilian in the future who could meet the needs of this administration, should they need another Secretary of Defense, or thenext administration?  What we are doing today, inadvertently, because of a cherished notion we have toward this one nominee,is subverting the standard, and, in fact, this exception now can swallow the whole rule. If we are literally saying an exceptioncould be made because of the nature of an administration and the nature of a nominee, we have literally swallowed the rule.  I think it is a historic mistake. I truly believe we are about to unwind something that has served this country well for thepast 50 years. We are about to unwind it. Interestingly, the last time the Congress unwound it, they said: Never again.  Theydidn't say: If you have an urgency as we have now, which was the concern, according to these experts, that World War III waslooming, the concern that we needed a well-known, well-loved general because of all the foreign policy worries of the momentwith North Korea; they said: Never again.  I don't know why we are here. I really don't know why--because it is not thestandard.  Now this is the world we are going to live in. President-Elect Trump will mainly have his foreign policy inputfrom two four-star generals and a three-star general. So where is the diversity of opinion coming from? Where is that balancegoing to come from, the 1 reason the experts gave for why we have civilian control of the military--Tillerson?  EvenGeneral Marshall, if we remember history correctly, had the experience of being a former Secretary of State and head of the RedCross, so he had civilian experience in addition to his military experience. Civilian control has very important constitutionalreasons based on our democratic values, the balance of power, and how our democracy runs. Those principles are being gutted andignored. We are not using the right standards, and I think it is a historic mistake.  As I stated, this has nothing to dowith our particular nominee. These principles exist for a reason. It has enabled our country's success for decades and has keptour democracy safe. If we take this change in our laws lightly, as we are about to do today, when future Congresses--or even thissame Congress 2 or 3 year from now--look at this and want to make the same exception, it will be much easier to do.  I willcontinue to oppose this waiver for any nominee who is not a civilian or who has not met the waiting period that is required bylaw, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. I urge them to vote no.  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgS299-2.txt,1866,83,2017.0,12.0,January

830,topic-id,2848,"Mr.Speaker, it is Thursday evening in the House of Representatives, and I continue to hear friends, fellowMembers of the House, and reporters in anguish over the issue of a potential wall between the United States and Mexico; so Ithought it was worth looking at some information about Mexico--our closest neighbor to the south. The data should be recent.  They have got nearly 120 million people in The gross domestic product is around 2.1 trillion in pesos. They have 2.1percent growth--terrible. It is about like the Obama economy. The average income is around $17,000 per capita. Inflation is 4.0percent.  Yet, you look at the economics of Mexico in the world, and you think, wow. You look at their resources--extraordinaryresources, just extraordinary resources. We know they have got hardworking people because we know, from the people of Mexico whohave come to the United States, that people constantly indicate, gee, they are the best workers we have, these hardworking folksfrom  So you have got hardworking people in the nation of Mexico, and you have got incredible natural resources that have neverbeen tapped--or not adequately tapped. We don't even know the full potential--oil, gas, copper. There are all of these differentminerals that Mexico is supposed to have. You look at what people have done over the thousands of years--I mean, advancedcivilizations. Why is Mexico not one of the top 10 or even top five economies in the world? It is listed 62nd in the world.  They have got plenty of land. I can personally testify that they have some of the most beautiful terrain in theworld--beautiful beaches, mountains, farming regions; just magnificent land, minerals, and hardworking people. Why is it 62nd inthe world as an economy? That is an interesting question.  It would seem to be because--from hearing people who have looked at Mexico and who have either tried to start a businessthere or who have looked at it to start a business there, to start manufacturing there--of course, there are many who have set upmanufacturing shops down there, but they are easily persuaded out of it if they can find a more suitable place. The reason it isoften easy to persuade people to set up shop somewhere else is because of the drug cartels, the corruption that the drug cartelsbring to  What is it the drug cartels are making billions of dollars off of that allow them to corrupt police departments? citygovernments? the Mexican border patrol? the Mexican military?  Obviously, the people in all of the Mexican Government are not corrupt. I have met too many who want desperately to make thenation of Mexico one of the greatest in the world, and it is possible that could happen but not so long as the drug cartels are,potentially, the most powerful entities in I mean, they are right next to the United They really should be oneof the top, at least 10--if not the top five or the top three or four--economies in the world, but they are nowhere close.  Drug cartels, we have found--and we know--make money, particularly off shipping illegal drugs into the United Theyhave made a fortune off of it. I have heard from friends of mine in Texas who are in the drug enforcement business, both Federaland When the U.Congress took action to make it more difficult to get SUDAFED, which is used in the cooking ofsubstances that are put together in order to create methamphetamine, that meth lab became much more rare, especially in eastTexas, where I live, where we have got lots of trees, woods--terrain where people can easily hide out, set up a lab, cook somemethamphetamine, especially as developed during my time on the felony bench, where people in Texas learned how to cookmethamphetamine, create methamphetamine with a cold cooking process that didn't subject them to quite the danger and didn'tcreate quite the nasty smell that often got meth labs reported to the authorities.                              {time}  1945  By drying up so many of the meth labs, we were told it is going to be a great day for We dry up the meth labs bymaking it tougher to get Sudafed because you have to ask, give your driver's license, and you are restricted to a very limitedamount of We were told that is going to dry up drugs. Methamphetamine is going to be a thing of the past. We will cutit to next to nothing.  Well, it is true. It is not as widespread as it used to be, but I am told that more pure drugs with much more devastatingresults and much more addictive are coming up from Mexico in greater numbers, greater quantities. It is even worse than it waswhen methamphetamine was being cooked because of the purity of the substances and the addictive nature. Also, as a result ofdrying up so much in the way of methamphetamine, we have much more of the heroin epidemic crossing  Additional drugs have come from Mexico across our porous border that seems to have grown during the Obama administrationdramatically. Why? Because our border has really not particularly been all that enforced.  It turns out that it is not just other drugs that are coming across our border. Since we have been able to eliminate so manymeth labs, especially in Texas, we see stories like this one from Bob Price, January 5, ``Feds Seize Nearly $7M in Meth At TexasBorder.'' That is a story about the seizure of methamphetamine at two international border bridges in south Texas in 1 week. TheCustoms and Border Protection, CBP, that was assigned to the World Trade Center International Bridge in Laredo, this articlereports how they had caught two drug traffickers with 200 pounds of crystal meth in one vehicle, and that was December 22, 2016.  We also know that the border security under this administration has become just almost nonexistent. We had an article fromJanuary 12, today, from McAllen, from Fox News, entitled, ``Cartels, Smugglers Exploit Border Wall Fears Ahead of TrumpPresidency.'' So apparently they are using this time before President Trump is sworn in next week to scare people into comingnow. Bring your drugs now. Come illegally now into the U.before Trump becomes President.[[Page H466]]  I guess it is a bit akin to After holding American hostages for over a year under Commander in Chief Jimmy Carter,became so scared of a tough, independent-minded Ronald Reagan coming into office, they let those hostages go on the very day hewas sworn in. So they didn't risk him taking military action against them.  This is another story from Jessica Vaughan, January 2017, that reports that ``ICE Deportations Hit 10-Year Low.'' This isJanuary 2017. DHS has hit a 10-year low in deportations.  We see stories about how border control is almost nonexistent on our southern border, stories that expectation of amnesty isattracting immigrants to our U.border.  Here is another story from January 10 by Brittany Hughes, ``Border Agents Catch Another Wave of Illegal Aliens From CubaAmid Escalating Spike.'' I have been told, when I am down there, they are seeing more and more Cubans coming across the Mexicanborder of all places.  So the insecurity--not mentally--of the United States, but the actual insecurity of the United States because of ourvulnerability to people that hate us and drug cartels that want to make billions of dollars by hooking people on drugs thatthey will deliver, has reached insane levels. That is probably part of the reason that Donald Trump was elected President by anavalanche in the electoral college.  If you look at the counties that voted for Hillary Clinton and you look at the counties that voted for Donald Trump, itbecomes very clear that the Democratic Party in the United States has basically become a fringe party. They won the fringes:West Coast, East Coast, part of Florida, part of the northeast, Chicago, Detroit, some of the northern cities, the southernvalley of I mean, it is a fringe party. There are a few exceptions inside the country, but basically the rock-solidinterior that the American people make up--in what some refer to as fly-over country in America--voted rather solidly for  Here are numbers from the CIA World Factbook on Mexico:  Crude oil exports, a 2015 estimate, had 1.199 million barrels per day. Country comparison to the world, 13.  Crude oil imports, 11,110 barrels a day. Crude oil, proved reserves, 9.7 billion barrels, and that is just proven reserves.  If you look at natural gas from a 2014 estimate, 44.37 billion cubic meters. That is supposed to be 19th in the world, butwhen you consider how productive they could become once they began fracking, using more advanced technology, then you find outthat, wow, this is a nation--the nation of Mexico--that really should be one of the top 10 economies in the world.  What is the excuse that it is not? It has hardworking people, natural resources that most of the world could only envy. Whyis it not one of the top 10? We keep coming back to the drug cartels and the corruption that they have brought to Mexico and thebillions of dollars that are generated by the drug cartels.  As we have talked about here in the House, the border patrolmen tell me--I have been there all night--there is not a singleinch of the U.S.-Mexico border that is not controlled by one of the drug cartels and that nobody should cross the border unlessthey have paid the drug cartels, have the drug cartels' permission.  I have seen firsthand how it works. They will send a group across the river with coyotes in rafts when they are down on theRio That keeps the Border Patrol busy. At another place, they send people with drugs.  I have been there and seen their lookouts, climbed up on perches where they can watch. When the Border Patrol goes by, theyknow they won't be back for a while, so they get surprised when I drive by in the middle of the night.  They are all over the place around our southern border. They are making billions of dollars. Whoever came up with thebusiness model for the drug cartels that you could make such massive amounts of money bringing drugs illegally into the UnitedStates, it was really a business genius. But it would take a business fool in the United States to allow the kind of model thatMexico has set up for its drug business to even get a foothold in the United  As I have mentioned, one of the Border Patrol told me that the drug cartels call the Department of Homeland Security theirlogistics. They bring their drug dealers. They bring their drug traffickers. They bring their prostitutes. Unfortunately, girlsare being forced, often, into drug trafficking or human trafficking, and they are going to be used as prostitutes to make moneyfor the drug cartels. They send them across.  As a border patrolman said, they send them across, and then DHS here in America becomes their logistics. We ship themwherever they want them to go in the United All they have to do oftentimes is just have--I have seen them--a Xerox copy ofthe address where they are supposed to go, and DHS puts them on the bus--sometimes flies them, but usually buses--and ships themoff to a city where the drug cartels want them to set up shop.  I have been there in the middle of the night when border patrolmen will ask how much they paid to be brought in illegally tothe U.Some of the Spanish speakers in our Border Patrol are really incredible as they drill down and get answers to theirquestions that are not always on the list that DHS tells them to get.  ``How much money did you pay?'' They would say, ``Well, you didn't have $6,000, $7,000, $8,000. Where did you get thatmoney?''  ``Well, I was able to get $1,000 from somebody in the U.S., $1,000 from somebody in Mexico or Guatemala.''  ``Well, what about the rest?''  ``They are going to let me pay that out after I am in the United States.''                              {time}  2000  It becomes clear very quickly that, once again, this business model that the drug cartels have includes getting people inrafts where the Rio Grande River requires a raft, or just getting them across in unguarded areas, or areas where we need a walland don't have one, getting them across, and then getting DHS to send them to the city where they want to set up shop as drugtraffickers, human traffickers.  What a business model. You get the Federal Government of the United States to help you set up your business machine, yourbusiness model in the United They are shipping your employees around the country to different cities. Yes, it isnormally under the guise of: I have a relative there, here is the relative's address. They are going to take care of me.  Perhaps you get delayed and have to wait for an immigration judge that was appointed by Eric Holder to give you a notice toappear for a hearing 4 years later, a year, 2 years later, and then you can go on to the city where the drug cartels want you tofinish paying off what you owe them for getting you into the United  So to have a business model that requires your workers to pay you is extraordinary, but that is what drug cartels are ableto do when you have a willing Obama administration here in the United States that will help you set up your drug cartelmechanism here in the United That is what has been going on.  In the meantime, back in Mexico, you generate so much money by having your workers pay you to work for you, and gettingbillions of dollars from the drugs that are sent into the United States, hooking people here in America, making them reliant onand addicted to drugs that destroy their lives. So basically the drug cartels get a two-for. They destroy the humaninfrastructure of the United States with poison that some would say, well, that is another name for illegal drugs. And then, inthe meantime, you have got all of that money coming to you, and you use that money to buy off police. Thank God there are somestand-up police in Mexico that can't be bought. But if they go too strongly head to head with the drug cartels--we have seen thepictures--they can end up with their head on a pike as a message. We have had chiefs of police that were killed when they refusedto kowtow to the drug cartels, and so the message becomes pretty clear.  It seems to me that the biggest reason that Mexico--with extraordinary people and extraordinary natural resources, abeautiful, fantastic country, a location that is just incredibly advantageous because they have got shipping that can go out onthe West Coast like we do to the Pacific, shipping on[[Page H467]]the East Coast into the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, ready accessto North American markets, ready access to South American market, what an opportunistic location for Yet, they struggleso far behind most nations, or so many nations in the world. Dozens and dozens, 60 or so, are before them because drug cartelshave such a powerful part in Mexico itself.  So there are many Americans, especially friends of mine across the aisle here, who think it is an absolute outrage to talkabout building a wall between the United States and There are some Mexican officials that think it is an outrage to talkabout building a wall between the United States and  Now, some of those Mexican officials think it is an outrage because they haven't thought through the magnificence that mayarise in Mexico once we have secured the border between Mexico and the United States and we can slow the drug trafficking to atrickle. So the drug cartels will not be looking at billions of U.dollars; they will be looking at thousands; and if they areextremely powerful, maybe millions. But if we get that down to thousands, then the Mexican people will be able to have controlwithout corruption, without massive pockets of corruption, without a drug cartel that can buy soldiers, buy police, buy chiefsof police, and buy mayors. Again, thank God it is only a small part of Mexico, but it keeps Mexico suppressed from the greateconomic power that it could be. And the potential is all there.  You build a wall, then you shut down the drug cartels. And when they only have thousands of dollars to bribe police insteadof millions or billions of dollars, then law and order will prevail and the drug cartels will not, and we will have the mostextraordinary neighbor to our south all because we followed the example in Mending Wall, and we had a wall between us that wekept up, we took care of, we shut down, helped Mexico shut down the drug cartels by being a good neighbor, enforcing the border,and the standard of living in Mexico spirals upwards through the sky. The power Mexico would have as a nation in anyinternational organization will be extraordinary, and the United States will reach an unparalleled relationship as a neighbor.That is worth building a wall for.

92,topic-id,1496,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, it is a new day in For 8 years, the Obama administration has brought us one thing in response to theNation's need for recovery from hard times--failure.  Bold, innovative measures to unleash American freedom, opportunity, and resourcefulness could have brought prosperity'sreturn after the Great Recession, just as under Ronald Reagan following his era's recession.  But the Obama administration responded differently, with measure after overreaching measure, through regulation, taxes, andspending. It was consumed by the folly of trying to force transformation from the American people through command and controlfrom Everywhere it went, it sought to choose the winners and losers.  When Washington tries to choose the winners and losers, we all lose. And lose we have. We have a national debt of $20trillion thanks to the outgoing administration's blowout spending. We have an economy that for 8 years has failed to produceenough good, new, full-time jobs to sustain growth and restore dignity to the unemployed. We[[Page H324]]have 92 million Americansoutside the workforce, a level not seen since the Carter years, and nearly $2 trillion of American wealth is commandeered eachyear to be spent as Washington bureaucrats see fit, through runaway regulation.  But it is a new day in An incoming administration promises a new approach to make America great again. Central tothat approach is regulatory reform. The Obama administration abused regulation to force its will on the American people. Theassembling Trump administration promises to wipe out abusive regulation, freeing Americans to innovate and prosper once more.Today's legislation will give this new administration the tools.  The heart of today's bill, the Regulatory Accountability Act, title I, restores to the people the true right to be heard byWashington's regulators. It commands Washington bureaucrats to listen to the facts and ideas offered by the people and to followthem when they are better than the bureaucracy's own. It calls on regulatory agencies to achieve the benefits Congress hascalled on them through statutes to achieve. But it gives the people full opportunities to offer fresh alternatives for doing soand to vet with the agencies the facts and ideas that work and those that don't.  After the public has fully contributed its say, agencies must choose the lowest cost alternative proven to work, achievingthe needed benefits but rejecting unneeded costs. That leaves resources free to generate the benefits, create the jobs, andyield the higher wages only the private sector, through hard work and ingenuity, can achieve.  The other titles of the bill strongly buttress this reform.  Title II, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, wipes out judicial deference to agency interpretations of statutes andregulations and restores to our system of checks and balances the rule Justice Marshall declared in Marbury v. Madison that ``itis emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is''--not the bureaucracy. When title II islaw, our courts will no more be rubber stamps for runaway regulatory interpretations that burst the bounds of what Congresstruly intended through statutes.  Title III, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, provides teeth to existing law written to promptregulatory agencies to tailor flexibility for small businesses into their rules. Small businesses have fewer resources to complywith Washington's mandates. They need flexibility to survive. The terms of existing law for too long have been ignored byWashington bureaucrats. Title III assures the law will no longer be ignored, resulting in freedom and flexibility for America'ssmall businesses, which create the lion's share of new jobs in this country and are pillars of communities across this land.  Title IV prevents one of the most egregious of bureaucrats' regulatory abuses: the promulgation of new rules that imposeover a billion dollars in annual compliance costs, which must then be complied with even while meritorious litigationchallenging their issuance proceeds in court. Title IV, the REVIEW Act, eliminates this abuse, forcingagencies to stay their billion-dollar rules administratively if they are timely challenged in court.  And in titles V and VI of the bill, the ALERT Act and the Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act, thislegislation delivers much-needed, greater transparency for the public about what new regulations agencies are developing andproposing so they can better prepare to comment on what is proposed, shape what is promulgated, and comply with final rules.  With the help of these reforms, we can truly make America more competitive again, put Americans back to work, and freeAmerica's entrepreneurs to innovate and launch more exciting new products and services again.

I would also like to highlight a few Members whose work is inside this bill. First, Congressman Marino, CongressmanRatcliffe, Chairman Chabot, and Congressman Luetkemeyer have all done a tremendous amount of work to make thisbill here today, and I appreciate that.  Mr.Chairman, we have a grave problem in our Federal It undermines our Constitution, it contradicts the will ofthe people, and it is a deadweight on our economy destroying American jobs and costing billions of dollars per year in paperworkand lost opportunities. I am talking about the duplicative and unforgiving Federal bureaucratic state.  But before I discuss the dangers that an overzealous bureaucracy poses to our country, I want to be clear that the House hasalready made great progress. We are engaged in a two-step approach: first, to change the structure of Washington that deprivesthe people of their power; and second, to repeal specific harmful regulations. We will get started on the second part early nextmonth.  We have already passed two bills last week to change Washington's structure, the Midnight Rules Relief Act and the Today, we will pass the third, the Regulatory Accountability This requires agencies to choose the least costly optionavailable to do what they are charged to do and prohibits large rules from going into effect while they are still beingchallenged in court. It also ends something called Chevron deference where courts automatically bend to the agency'sinterpretation of the rules. Under the current standard, that means the agency will win almost every single time in thecourtroom and the people lose.  These three bills are about more than stopping bad regulations from being made. They are about changing the process inWashington that systemically prioritizes government over the[[Page H329]]common good instead of making government serve the commongood.  Mr.Chairman, our Nation is based on a principle that power ultimately comes from the people. Elections are the greatfoundation of our Republic, and, as we saw so clearly this last November, through them, the people can make their voices heard.But something has changed. Some of the most significant decisions in Washington, those that most affect the lives of the public,are made by those who don't stand for election.  What happens when the EPA imposes rules that deprive people of their property rights, when the Department of Health andHuman Services tries to force nuns to violate their religion, or when the VA perpetuates a system that lets veterans die whilethey wait for their care? The people can't vote out bureaucrats who write rules at the EPA or the Department of Health and They can't vote out bad leaders of the  These bureaucrats know it. They know they aren't accountable to the people even as they exercise great power. Withoutelections, the people lose. Washington is brimming with executive employees devoted to preserving the status quo.  Then there is a revolving door of high-level Federal employees who head to major consulting firms and lobbying arms toinfluence the very agencies they came from. This breeds thousands of regulations that further enrich the connected andpowerful--sometimes at the great expense of the average                              {time}  1415  It is our economy and the American workers who suffer the most. Federal regulations written and enacted by thesebureaucracies impose a burden of about $1.89 trillion every year. That number is hard to make sense of or to even imagine. Itcomes to, roughly, $15,000 per U.household, or 10 percent of the American  The Obama administration alone has written regulations that require over 583 million hours to comply with. That is anaverage of nearly 5 hours of paperwork for every single full-time employee in The Federal Register is now the length of80 King James  When bureaucrats and agency heads cannot be held accountable and when they keep their jobs regardless of corruption,incompetence, waste, fraud, abuse, or the backroom deals they make with special interests, that is the problem. That is theswamp, and we need to drain it.  There is a reason the House is restructuring Washington first. It is that we made a commitment to the American people thatwe would drain the swamp. Now we are today.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,446,"CONCURRENTRESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,11.0,January

127,topic-id,275,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The facts are plain, the conclusion is clear: the rampant tide of unchecked, unbalanced Federal regulation is overwhelmingjob creators and households all across this Thanks to Washington's endless excess of regulations, hardworking Americansface higher prices, lower wages, fewer jobs, and fewer new business starts; and America as a whole is less competitive, lessinnovative, and less prosperous.  Federal regulations now impose an estimated burden of an amazing $1.89 trillion per year. That burden is burying America'sjob creators and suffocating job opportunities. It equals roughly $15,000 per U.household, over 10 percent of America's GDP,and more than the GDP of all but eight countries in the world.  The Obama administration set new records for numbers and effects of major regulations, over 600 in total, with an average of81 per year. That is roughly one every 3 working days. Through just August 2016, these rules had economic effects of over $740billion and imposed 194 million paperwork burden-hours; and this only built upon the insufficiently checked regulation alreadyimposed by previous administrations.  This problem must be solved, and this bill is the number one solution to this problem. Its bold, innovative measures willunleash American freedom, opportunity, and resourcefulness by dramatically reducing new regulatory costs; and they will do thatwhile still allowing agencies to achieve the benefits that Congress' statutes have tasked them to achieve.  Far fewer costs, all the benefits, who could be against that? We all should be for it, just as the American people are.  Support the American people.

129,topic-id,260,"Mr.Chairman, if Congress is effectively to rein in the runaway administrative state, a crucial part of theplan must be to overturn, legislatively, the doctrines of judicial deference to agencies' interpretations of the statutes andregulations they administer. These doctrines, founded in the Supreme Court's decision in Chevron v. NRDC and Auer v. Robbins,have, over the years, turned the courts far too much into a rubberstamp rather than a vigorous check on the self-servingtendencies of agencies to interpret the law to expand their own power.  Title II of the bill, the Separation of Powers Act, delivers this legislative reversal of Chevron and There is onething, though, that still needs to be added to that portion of the bill; that is language to check the potential that once theyare restored--the full interpretive powers that rightfully belong to them--our Article III courts will not engage in judicialactivism.  To put a point on it, judges must not be allowed to use the Separation of Powers Act as a license to interpret ambiguousstatutes always to expand agency power. My amendment, therefore, succinctly but powerfully provides just that. It prohibitscourts from reading ambiguities in statutes to contain implicit delegation of legislative rulemaking authority to agencies orfrom reading those ambiguities expansively to extend agency power.  Although it failed in its task, the Chevron doctrine was originally crafted to help check that kind of judicial activism. Aswe end the failed Chevron experiment, we should make sure we do not go back to judicial activism. I urge my colleagues tosupport this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

To AllMembers of the U.House of Representatives: On      behalf of the Agricultural Retailers Association (ABA), I am      writing to urgea vote in support of H.5, the ``Regulatory      Accountability Act'' sponsored by Representative Bob      Goodlatte (R-VA). Thislegislation includes a number of      important provisions designed to reform the Federal      rulemaking process.       All stakeholdershave a right to fair, open, and transparent      rulemaking that respects the proper role of the states and      the intent of Congress.For decades, there have been Executive      Orders issued from both Republican and Democrat      Administrations highlighting theimportance of an open,      transparent, and fair regulatory process. H.5 is an      important step forward in codifying the principlesthat      Presidents of both parties have issued in Executive Order      12004 (Issued in Match 1978), Executive Order 12291 (Issued      inFebruary 1981), Executive Order 12866 (Issued in September      1993), Executive Order 13132 (Issued in August 1999), and      ExecutiveOrder 13563 (Issued in January 2011).       Some of the reforms in H.5 include provisions such as      requiring federal agencies touse less costly regulations,      rather than more costly proposals, to obtain a stated      objective; requiring federal agencies toexplain how their      proposed regulations would impact small business owners,      their employees, and customers; prohibiting any newrules with      a significant economic impact from taking effect until      litigation against such proposal has been fully      settledwithout impacting existing regulations; and requiring      Federal agencies to publish mandatory transparency reports.       CollinPeterson (D-MN) plans to offer an amendment on      the floor of the U.House of Representatives to prohibit      agencies from usingsocial media to sway public opinion in      favor of a pending agency proposal. This common-sense      amendment is necessary to preventactions taken by federal      agencies such as the U.Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) that the General Accountability Office(GAO) found took      unlawful actions during its `Waters of the United States''      (WOTUS) proposed rulemaking. ARA urges all Housemembers to      vote in favor of the Peterson amendment and to vote ``Yes''      on final passage of H.R, 5.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Rep.: The House of Representatives will soon take up      H.5 for debateand a vote. This measure contains a number      of important elements that are designed to improve the      Federal rulemaking process.American Farm Bureau urges all      members to vote in favor of this legislation.       For decades, presidents of both parties haveissued      Executive Orders and Memoranda underscoring the importance of      a regulatory process that is open, transparent andfair:       President Carter stipulated in EO 12044 that regulations      should not impose unnecessary burdens on theeconomy.       President Reagan issued EO 12291 in February 1981 to assure      that least-cost alternatives would be used in      regulatorydecision-making.       President Clinton affirmed that regulations should maximize      net benefits (EO 12866, September 1993). Laterin his      Administration, President Clinton issued EO 13132 reaffirming      the importance of federalism and respecting the rights      ofstates.       President Obama underscored the importance of sound science      in his Memorandum of March 2009. He also reaffirmedPresident      Clinton's EO 12866 when he issued EO 13563.       We understand that an amendment to H.5 will be offered      on the floorby Peterson to prohibit agencies from using      social media to sway public opinion in favor of a pending      agency proposal. Thisamendment stems directly from EPA's      conduct in its `waters of the US' (WOTUS) rulemaking, conduct      found unlawful by the GeneralAccountability Office and      scrupulously detailed in a report released by the House      Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,``Politicization      of the Waters of the United States Rulemaking.'' We strongly      support the Peterson amendment and urge allmembers to vote in      favor of its adoption.       All stakeholders--farmers, ranchers, environmentalists,      academics, agency staff, andthe general public--have a right      to a rulemaking process that is fair, open, transparent,      respectful of the role of states in ourFederal system, and      faithful to the intent of H.5 is an important      step in codifying principles that Presidents ofboth parties      have enunciated for decades. This legislation deserves      strong, bipartisan support.       We urge all members to votein favor of the Peterson      amendment and to vote ``Yes'' on final passage of H.5.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of Associated Builders and      Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry      tradeassociation with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000      members, I am writing in support of the Regulatory      Accountability Act of2017 (H.5) introduced by Bob      Goodlatte (R-VA). ABC supports this legislation, which would      reform the AdministrativeProcedures Act and strengthen      existing checks on federal agencies, allowing for more cost-     effective regulations through a moretransparent process.       As builders of our communities and infrastructure, ABC      members understand the value of standards andregulations      based on solid evidence, with appropriate consideration paid      to implementation costs and input from affectedbusinesses.      ABC strongly supports comprehensive regulatory reform which      includes across-the-board requirements for departmentsand      agencies to appropriately evaluate risks, weigh costs, and      assess benefits of all regulations. H.5 is an excellent      stepin regulatory reform as it ensures more accountability      from federal agencies and greater stakeholder transparency.       Today,federal regulatory agencies wield incredible power      through rulemaking. They have grown adept at using procedural      loopholes inorder to accomplish narrowly-focused goals. These      agencies operate relatively unchecked and unsupervised,      especially during theearly stages of the regulatory process.      They often disregard and circumvent the will of Congress and      the American public byissuing regulations with poor or      incomplete economic cost-benefit forecasting or other data      analysis, instead of using the bestand most accurate data      that could have created more practical, sustainable rules and      regulations.       Consequently, someregulations that have limited or      questionable benefit result in crippling costs for companies      and often no serious considerationis given for more practical      alternatives. For the construction industry, these      regulations routinely translate into higher costsand are      passed along to the consumer.       Ultimately, these costs impact our industry's ability to      expand and hire more workers.It is particularly alarming that      small businesses, which comprise the vast majority of the      industry, are disproportionatelyaffected by this      irresponsible approach to regulation.       Thank you for your attention on this important matter and      we urge theHouse to pass the Regulatory Accountability Act of      2017.           Sincerely,                                           Kristen Swearingen,                                      Vice President ofLegislative     & Political                                  ____                                            The Associated General                                        Contractors ofAmerica,                                  Arlington, VA, January 10, 2017.     Re Vote ``YES'' on the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017,          H.R.5.     Paul Ryan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear RepresentativeRyan: On behalf of the Associated      General Contractors of America (AGC) and its more than 26,000      commercial constructioncompany members, I strongly urge you      to vote ``YES'' on the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017,      H.5. This legislation iscritical to helping ensure that      regulations undergo thorough economic analysis, are based in      sound science and/or substantialempirical data, and are      transparent with clear and feasible methods and goals.       The current regulatory process allows federalagencies to      promulgate rules based on unconvincing, scant and--     sometimes--just plain wrong evidence. For example, Professor      Sunding, Ph.D., Thomas Graff Chair of Natural      Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley      found that the``errors, omissions, and lack of transparency''      in the Environmental Protection Agency's economic analysis      underlying its Watersof the Unites States (WOTUS) rule to be      ``so severe as to render it virtually meaningless.'' Yet, the      EPA was able to finalizethat rule based on such flawed      analysis.       Federal agencies also write rules that are not feasible for      the constructionindustry to follow. The Occupational Health      and Safety Administration (OSHA) crystalline silica rule, for      instance, put forth apermissible silica exposure limit that      is beyond the capacity of existing dust filtration and      removal technology. Despite thisfact, OSHA finalized this      rule and the construction industry is left liable to      implement.       The Regulatory Accountability Actwill help hold federal      agencies accountable to the facts throughout the rulemaking      process. Under this legislation, the publiccould challenge      the underlying evidence agencies put forth to justify their      rules. Such challenges could occur through hearingsbefore the      agency and before courts, which generally defer to any      evidence put forth by federal agencies currently. As a      result,agencies would be incentivized to undertake more      rigorous and realistic analyses, rather than risk delays as a      result of relyingon cherry-picked studies or self-serving,      internal data.       The purpose of the bill is not partisan. Rather, it is to      ensurethat the regulations federal agencies put forth are      feasible and based in thorough economic analysis and sound      science. To doso, H.5 allows for greater transparency,      more public participation and needed objectivity in the      rulemaking process. As such,AGC again urges you to for in      favor of H.5.[[Page H346]]       Thank you for your consideration.

We support a smarter approach to federalregulation that would      engage regulated parties earlier in the process, improve the      quality of information used to makeregulatory decisions and      consistently apply rigorous cost-benefit analysis to major      regulatory proposals.       We are particularlypleased that H.5 includes the      previously introduced version of the Regulatory      Accountability Act, also championed by ChairmanGoodlatte, the      ALERT Act, championed by Representative John Ratcliffe, and      the Providing Accountability Through TransparencyAct,      championed by Representative Blaine       Overall, the smart regulatory improvements embodied in the      RegulatoryAccountability Act of 2017 will:       Make U.companies more competitive. Usually after      prolonged periods of consideration,federal agencies regularly      issue rules that impose large and often unnecessary burdens      on U.businesses--burdens that foreigncompetitors may not      have to bear. The Act will reduce these burdens.       Enable U.companies to be more innovative.      Americanbusinesses are the world's most innovative, and that      innovation supports America's high standard of living. Rules      that requireparticular technologies or approaches or fail to      keep up with technological evolution can jeopardize future      innovation. The Actwill encourage flexible, non-prescriptive      implementation that preserves the capacity to innovate.       Stimulate investment byenhancing business certainty. If      companies are unsure about what regulators will require or      how to comply with rules, they willbe reluctant to commit      capital to new or expanded productive investments. By      encouraging early engagement with regulated partiesand      improving the transparency and accountability of the      regulatory process, the Act will result in greater certainty      for U.S.businesses and thereby accelerate job growth and      investment.       The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 would make the      U.S.regulatory system more transparent, accountable and      effective. We endorse this legislation and pledge our full      support to see itenacted into law.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     DemocraticLeader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi:On behalf of      the 1.1 million members of the National Association of      REALTORS (NAR), I urge the House to approve H.     5(Goodlatte, R-VA; Peterson, D-MN), the ``Regulatory      Accountability Act''.       NAR believes that federal regulations should benarrowly      tailored, supported by strong data and evidence, and impose      the least costs possible on regulated stakeholders.       TheRegulatory Accountability Act embodies these principles      and will contribute to a more transparent and accountable      regulatoryprocess by:       Increasing public participation in shaping the most-costly      regulations at an earlier point in the rulemakingprocess;       Instructing agencies to choose the least costly option that      achieves congressional intent unless they can show acostlier      option is needed to protect health, safety, or welfare;       Requiring public hearings for the most-costlyregulations;       Improving the process for evaluating how small businesses      are impacted by regulations; and       Providing for amore rigorous test in legal challenges for      those regulations that would have the most impact.       The Regulatory AccountabilityAct builds on established      principles of a fair regulatory process and would make the      regulatory process more transparent,agencies more accountable      for their decisions, and regulations better-tailored to      achieve their purpose without unnecessaryburdens on      stakeholders.       The Regulatory Accountability Act would allow Congress and      the public to reassert control over thefederal regulatory      bureaucracy. Therefore, NAR strongly supports the Act, and      urges passage of the bill when it comes to theHouse floor for      a vote.           Sincerely,                                                 William Brown,     2017                                  ____                                             NationalFederation of                                         Independent Business,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.     Steve Chabot,     Chairman, HouseCommittee on Small Business,     Washington,       Dear Chairman Chabot, on behalf of the NationalFederation      of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small      business advocacy organization, I am writing in support      ofH.33, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility      Improvements Act of 2017. This legislation puts into place      strong protectionsto ensure that federal agencies fully      consider the impact of proposed regulations on small      businesses.       In an economy wheretwo-thirds of all net new jobs come from      the small business sector, we appreciate that this      legislation would require regulatorsto analyze further the      impact of certain proposals on job creation. As you well      know, the annual cost of federal regulation peremployee is      significantly higher for smaller firms than larger firms.      Federal regulations--not to mention state and      localregulations--add up and significantly increase the cost      of starting and running a small business.       H.33 expands the scope ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act      (RFA) by forcing government regulators to include the      indirect impact of their regulations intheir assessments of a      regulation's impact on small businesses. The bill also      provides small business with expanded judicialreview      protections, which helps ensure that small businesses have      their views heard during the federal rulemaking process,      notafter.       The legislation strengthens several other aspects of the      RFA--such as expanding the small business advocacy      reviewpanel process to all agencies. Currently, the panels      only apply to the Environmental Protection Agency, the      Occupational Safetyand Health Administration, and the      Consumer Financial Protection These panels have      proven to be an extremely effectivemechanism in helping      agencies to understand how their rules will affect small      businesses, and help agencies identify less      costlyalternatives to regulations before proposing new rules.       Finally, H.33 expands the standard for periodic review      of rules byfederal agencies and gives the U.Small Business      Administration's Office of Advocacy increased input into      agency compliancewith the These important protections      are needed to prevent duplicative and outdated regulatory      burdens as well as toaddress penalty structures that are too      high for the small business sector.       NFIB supports H.33 because it strengthens therequirement      for federal agencies to consider both the direct and indirect      economic impact of proposed regulations on smallbusinesses.      We look forward to working with the committee towards      enactment of the Small Business Regulatory      FlexibilityImprovements Act of 2017.           Sincerely,                                                Juanita Duggan,     President and CEO                                  ____                                         Chamberof Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 2017.       To the Membersof the U.House of Representatives: The      U.Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.5, which      includes the RegulatoryAccountability Act, and may consider      including votes on, or in relation to, H.5 in our annual      How They       The Chamber commends the House for acting on regulatory      reform legislation so early in the 115th session, and      forbringing H.5, which also includes important provisions      related to small businesses, to the floor.       The RegulatoryAccountability Act is a long-standing      priority for the Chamber and would update the Administrative      Procedure Act (APA) toimprove how federal agencies promulgate      those rules with the most significant impact on jobs and      economicgrowth.       Modernization of APA is long overdue. While there has been      a dramatic increase in high impact, transformative rulesthat      are slowing economic growth and inhibiting job creation, APA      rulemaking provisions have remained virtually unchanged      since1946 when the law was established.       H.5 would target only the most expensive and burdensome      of these rules for increasedscrutiny by providing greater      transparency, by holding agencies accountable, and by making      sure the data behind the decisions ofregulators are made      publicly available.       The Chamber urges you to support this legislation and to      oppose any weakeningamendment when it is considered likely      next week.

Theseinclude, for example, guidelines on cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, consistency with the Information Quality Act, andgood guidance practices.  Since the importance of these issues and the need for swift and effective implementation of reform, the amendment'sinstitution of a 270-day deadline for the issuance of these guidelines is very reasonable, very constructive.

Title III of the bill contains important reforms to make sureagencies finally take seriously Congress' directive to write rules with flexible accommodations for small businesses, the sourceof most of our Nation's job creation.  Congress' demands for flexibility began with the Regulatory Accountability Act during the 1980s, but agencies have neverfully complied. One of the key ways agencies have skirted the law's requirements has been to certify their way out of any needto actually provide flexibility by finding that a proposed or final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.  This amendment puts the brakes on an inadequately substantiated certification by requiring certifications to includeeconomic assessment details sufficient to support the certifications.

The gentleman's amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, responds to an extreme example of rulemaking abuse that played outduring the 114th That abuse was the Environmental Protection Agency's advocacy campaign to skew the informationsubmitted for its administrative record and promote lobbying on behalf of its massive proposed waters of the United States rule.  It is one thing to propose a rule and open the agency's doors impartially to information from all members of the public. Itis quite another to promote public submissions to guarantee the cooking of the administrative record to support the agency'sview and to advocate lobbying of Congress to support that view.  This amendment makes sure that the biased agency activity manifest in the waters of the United States rulemaking neverhappens again.  Mr.Chairman, I support the amendment.

154,topic-id,186,"I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, and I support his amendment.  Mr.Chairman, many of the reforms in title I of the bill focus on assuring better decisionmaking and cost control for majorrules--typically, those that impose more than $100 million or more per year in costs.  One of these reforms is the commonsense requirement that an agency, when it publishes amajor rule, include a plan for reviewing how the rule is working within 10 years. A focus of that review is to determine whetherit is possible, after the rule has been put into practice, to find new ways to lower the rule's costs.  The gentleman's amendment speeds this process up, requiring review within 5 years, and increases Congress' oversight,requiring reports by agencies to Congress on their reviews. Most importantly, the amendment requires that, if an agency's reportto Congress shows the rule's costs in practice are higher than anticipated at promulgation, the agency must institute a notice-and-comment process aimed at identifying revisions that can lower costs.  This is a measure that can only strengthen the bill's effectiveness and help lower unnecessary burdens on the I support the amendment.

156,topic-id,189,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for the time.  I support his amendment. Agency guidance is a crucial part of our regulatory system--flexible because not legally binding,but needed so regulated entities can understand how best to comply with agency rules.  Guidance, if it responds in a timely way to the regulated community's need for it, helps everything to function smoothly.But one thing that does not help is agency heel-dragging in the issuance of guidance as the regulated community comes up againstlegal or practical deadlines by which it needs to implement compliance measures. Too often agencies hurry up and wait to produceneeded guidance, then tell those who waited long and hard for it to hurry up and respond, pronto. That can leave very littletime for the regulated community to act before deadlines hit.[[Page H355]]  To solve this problem, the amendment offers a simple but much-needed solution. It requires that, within ``good-guidance''guidelines to be issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under the bill, there be guidelines for agenciesgenerally to assure at least 90 days for regulated entities to institute measures consistent with newly issued guidelines.

Chairman Conaway and Subcommittee Chairman Austin Scottheld four hearings throughout the 114th Congress regarding the CFTC and its future, during which time they invited input from awide variety of interested stakeholders. I believe that they have struck the right balance in providing the CFTC with theauthorizations necessary for the agency to do its job, while increasing oversight, instituting reforms to protect end-users fromregulatory overreach, and improving consumer protection against fraud or mismanagement.  I am also pleased to see that since the House of Representatives last acted to reauthorize the CFTC, in light of many yearsof concern about aluminum markets and warehousing practices, the London Metal Exchange has implemented additional reforms totheir aluminum warehousing practices and[[Page H413]]contracts.

But Senator Scottand I are going to take a moment or two to talk about a topic that I think millions of Americans appreciate: college football.  In the South, where Tim and I come from, it is as close to being a religion as you can get, and we are here tocelebrate Clemson University becoming the national champion in college football, beating Alabama in the best college footballplayoff game I have ever witnessed in my life.  To the people of Alabama: You had one heck of a ride, a 26-game winningstreak, something you should be proud of.  To the Tigers: You beat the best team in the country, and, to me, the way you wonis as important as the outcome.  DeShaun Watson is probably going to go in the very top of the draft to the I would sayhe is the best college football player in What DeShaun has won for Clemson is unbelievable. The way he has done it iseven more unbelievable. He graduated in 3 years. He is one of the nicest young men I have ever met in my life. His faith means alot to him.  He threw the ball to Hunter Renfrow, who was a walk-on--a young man from a small town in South Carolina whowalked on to the Clemson University team. Because of Coach Dabo Swinney, he had a shot at making the team and wound up catchingthe winning pass to win the national title.  How is this possible? It is possible because of leadership at the top. PresidentClements, our new president, has a vision of Clemson University as aggressive and bold off the field as Dabo has had on thefield. I think Dabo Swinney represents the best in college sports. The Clemson team is truly a family.

The Clemson program is a model for college athletics. Dabo has an uncanny ability to take people from different backgroundsand mold them into a team. He loves his players and they love him.  I live 5 miles from Clemson University and went to theUniversity of South Carolina, and most of you don't know what that means: the biggest rivalry.  I am proud of I grewup in the shadow of the university, 5 miles from the stadium. I have been around the Clemson Tiger family all my life.

Thisyoung freshman quarterback is coming back. He is an incredible talent. The people of Alabama should be proud of their footballteam and their coaching staff because you have been on top of the mountain for a very long time.

957,topic-id,1097,"Mr.President, for too long, American families, farmers, and job creators have suffered under President Obama's regulatoryonslaught. His administration threw caution to wind, pumping out regulation after regulation and further entangling thegovernment into Americans' daily lives.  In November, the American people issued a strong rebuke to President Obama'soverreach and his administration's way of doing business.  They want a new direction. They want more accountability. They wantmore transparency. They want the government off their backs so that they can get back to making this country greatagain.  President-elect Trump has committed to working with Congress to roll back the regulatory overreach of the Obamaadministration, and to making the government more answerable to the people.  So, I rise today to introduce an important pieceof legislation that will help achieve these goals and ensure a more accountable and transparent government going forward.  Bysome estimates, Federal Government regulations impose over $2 trillion in compliance costs--on the American economy. The cost ofcomplying with all these regulations falls particularly heavy on small businesses.  It is no wonder why many Americanbusinesses have shut down or moved overseas. How many innovators dreamed of starting a small business but decided against itwhen faced with the burden and uncertainty of our regulatory state?  We have to do better.  The Federal Government should doeverything possible to promote job creation. To accomplish that, common sense would tell us that the government needs to removebureaucratic barriers rather than put up new ones.  But as we all know, the Obama administration showed time and again that itwould rather push forward with its regulatory agenda than ease the burden on our economy and job creators.  Adding insult toinjury, the Obama administration often kept folks in the dark about new regulatory initiatives.  Through secretive litigationtactics, the administration took end-runs around our nation's transparency and accountability laws. It is a strategy known assue-and-settle, and regulators have been using it to speed up rulemaking and keep the public away from the table when key policydecisions are made.  Sue-and-settle typically follows a similar pattern.  First, an interest group files a lawsuit against afederal agency, claiming that the agency has failed to take a certain regulatory action by a statutory deadline. The interestgroup seeks to compel the agency to take action by a new, often-rushed deadline. All too often, the plaintiff-interest groupwill be one that shares a common regulatory agenda with the agency that it sues, such as when an environmental group sues theEnvironmental Protection Agency,  Next, the agency and interest group enter into negotiations behind closed doors toproduce either a settlement agreement or consent decree that commits the agency to satisfy the interest group's demands. Theagreement is then approved by a court, binding executive discretion.  Noticeably absent from these negotiations, however, arethe very parties who will be most impacted by the resulting regulations.  Sue-and-settle tactics undermine transparency,public accountability, and the quality of public policy. They can have sweeping consequences. For example, the Obamaadministration's so-called Clean Power Plan, which is the most expensive regulation ever to be imposed on the energy industry,arose out of a sue-and-settle arrangement.  These tactics alsoundermine congressional intent.  The Administrative Procedure Act, APA, which has been called the citizens' ``regulatory billof rights,'' was[[Page S316]]enacted to ensure transparency and accountability in the regulatory process. A key protection is thenotice-and-comment process, which requires agencies to provide notice of proposed regulations and to respond to commentssubmitted by the public.  Rulemaking through sue-and-settle, however, frequently results in re-aligned agency agendas andshort deadlines for regulatory action. This makes the notice-and-comment process a mere formality. It deprives regulatedentities, the States and the general public of sufficient time to have any meaningful input.  The resulting regulatory actionis driven not by the public interest, but by special interest priorities, and can come as a complete surprise to those mostaffected by it.  Sue-and-settle litigation also helps agencies avoid accountability. Instead of having to answer to the publicfor controversial regulations and policy decisions, agency officials can just point to a court order entering the agreement andsay that they were required to take action under its terms.  We should also keep in mind that these agreements can havelasting impacts on the ability of future administrations to take a different policy approach--such as to remove regulatoryburdens on farmers. Not only does this raise serious concerns about bad public policy, it also puts into question theconstitutional impact of one administration's actions binding the hands of its successors.  Sue-and-settle, and theconsequences that come from such tactics, is not a new phenomenon. Evidence of sue-and-settle tactics and closed-door rulemakingcan be found in nearly every administration over the previous few decades.  But without a doubt, there was an alarmingincrease under the Obama administration. The U.Chamber of Commerce found that just during President Obama's first term, 60Clean Air Act lawsuits against the EPA were resolved through consent decrees or settlement agreements.  And since 2009, sue-and-settle cases against the EPA have imposed at least $13 billion in annual regulatory costs.  But we now have an opportunityto curb these abuses, and an incoming administration that has committed to reining in the regulators.  That is why today I amintroducing the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Senators Blunt, Inhofe, Cornyn, Cruz,Fischer, Rubio, Flake, Hatch, and Tillis are cosponsors of this important bill. And I'm pleased thatRepresentative Doug Collins introduced a companion bill today in the  The Sunshine bill increases transparency byshedding light on sue-and-settle tactics. It requires agencies to publish sue-and-settle complaints in a readily accessiblemanner.  It requires agencies to publish proposed consent decrees and settlement agreements at least 60 days before they canbe filed with a court. This provides a valuable opportunity for the public to weigh-in, which will increase accountability inthe rulemaking process.  The bill makes it easier for affected parties, such as States and businesses, to intervene in theselawsuits and settlement negotiations to ensure that their interests are properly represented. It requires the Attorney Generalto certify to a court that he or she has personally approved of the terms of certain proposed consent decrees or settlementagreements. And it requires courts to consider whether the terms of a proposed agreement are contrary to the publicinterest.  The bill also makes it easier for succeeding administrations to modify a prior administration's consent decrees.That way, one administration won't be forced to continue the regulatory excesses of another.  The Sunshine for RegulatoryDecrees and Settlements Act will shine light on the problem of sue-and-settle. It will help rein in backroom rulemaking,encourage the appropriate use of consent decrees and settlements, and reinforce the procedures that Congress laid out decadesago to ensure a transparent and accountable regulatory process.  I thank my colleagues for their support of this bill.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgS315.txt,457,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,12.0,January

They claim they only wantgood government. In reality, they want no government at all. They want to wrap Federal agencies in so much red tape that theywon't be able to move to protect our health, our safety, or our natural resources.  Language in title III tries to prevent Federal land managers from actually managing Federal lands. This language would makeland managers jump through the same procedural hoops over and over again just to put a new land management plan in place. Thesenew requirements are completely redundant, which is, of course, the point.  Federal land management plans already go through extensive review, including by the public, before they are ever evenimplemented. One way we know this is that the House Republicans complain constantly about how long it takes Federal agencies tocome up with a decision. Yet, here they are claiming that this Republican Congress knows best how our public lands and resourcesshould be managed.  Let's stop and look at the record. Last Tuesday, almost every single Republican Member of this House voted for a change inour House standing rules to calculate the value of all Federal lands as zero for accounting purposes. Yes, House Republicansagree that all Federal lands are essentially worthless.  Then, on Thursday of this week, 229 House Republicans voted against an amendment I offered to another bill to declare thatclimate change is real. Yes, 95 percent of House Republicans voted to deny a settled scientific fact.  Yet, here we are today with the same House Republicans who deny science; the same House Republicans who think public landsare worthless, claiming they know how to manage these public lands.  Science deniers and those who think our public lands have no value have no credibility when they bring legislation to thisfloor claiming that they want to improve public land management. As with health care, as with so many things, they don't want toimprove it; they want to destroy it.  Congressional Republicans have proved themselves completely incapable of building or preserving anything. They are onlyinterested in tearing things down, starting with health, safety, and environmental protections for our people and ourcommunities.

I am going to focus on two consequences that are true of so many programs that thegovernment puts out there.  First of all, ObamaCare is one more program that discourages work. If you talk to your accountants again and again, theywill tell you stories of people who are very conscious of the fact that, as they get a raise, as they work more overtime, theylose big subsidies. If I were to lose my next election, ObamaCare would continue. As my income would go up from $49,000 to$50,000, I would get hammered with a $4,500 loss. So it wouldn't be surprising that people in my position would be very carefulnot to get a raise or not to work overtime.  Even worse, this is one more government program that discourages marriage. If you have a single parent who is making $20,000and if he decided to marry somebody making $30,000 or $40,000, he would be hammered with a $3,500 loss. Combined with theFoodShare program, the low-income housing subsidies, Pell grants, and various TANF programs, this is just one more step that theAmerican Government has taken to discourage work and to discourage marriage.

6,topic-id,799,"Mr.Speaker, as I have said before, we hope for the best from the new President, but we must prepare forthe worst.  Everyone who has looked at the record of the key advisers to President-elect Trump on the issue of immigration has reasonfor very deep concern that the new President is going to follow the advice of some of the most extreme voices in the immigrationdebate.  As for the new President himself, he is a bit of an unknown because he changes his mind on key issues just as quickly as hisTwitter feed refreshes.

He knows more about computers and the Internet, ISIS and terrorists, Russia and NATO than all of the policy experts puttogether, and he thinks of himself as kind of the ultimate Presidential adviser to the new  But it is Trump's lieutenants who worry most of us. They are the most clearly ideological and dangerous set of leaders everassembled in American Government on immigration and any number of issues we care about.  They are vindictive when it comes to our immigrant community. The truth is that among the new President key advisers aresome of the staunchest opponents of legal immigration. They are against legal immigration. That is right.  While we all oppose illegal immigration, and some of us have been working for years to upgrade the American system so thatimmigrants come with visas instead of smugglers, the people with access to the Presidency disagree, and they don't wantimmigrants to come here at all from anywhere.  Look, we have made legal immigration extremely difficult for everyone and simply impossible for most people. And then wehave been relying on deportation, walls, enforcement, and curtailing due process rights for immigrants, and that constitutestheir immigration control strategy for the past 25 years. And it hasn't worked for 25 years.

That we don't want people to haveto choose between 10 years in exile or the green card for which they qualify under U.law because our laws have been craftedto punish people by keeping them in an undocumented status even when they can apply to be here legally. That we are committed todefending immigrant communities if and when the new President and his henchmen develop Muslim registries or neighborhood sweepsor mass roundups disguised as ``fugitive sweeps.''

I have heard from many end users in my district about the need for commonsense reforms to our financial regulations that areencapsulated in this bill. These financial regulations affect entities and the people I represent and rely on every day, fromthe rural electric cooperatives that use these financial tools to keep energy prices as low and as stable as possible for ruralMissourians, to the local grain elevators and farmers that manage their price risk using futures and options at a time whenprices are low.

700,topic-id,463,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to bring certainty to farmers, agricultural cooperatives,and grain elevators across Missouri and the country that are having problems complying with burdensome reporting requirements atthe Dodd-Frank never intended to regulate end users like independent grain elevators who work on behalf of Missourifarmers to help manage their price risk. My amendment works to correct this oversight and provide a stable environment for allplayers in the industry.  My amendment is simple. It would require the Commission to address three outstanding concerns to the Ownership and ControlReports rule, better known as the OCR rule, before the Commission can begin enforcement, which, by the way, the CFTC is notenforcing presently. This industry currently is operating under a no-action relief letter, meaning the OCR rule is not beingenforced due to the inability of the industry to meet the stringent requirements of the CFTC regulations. That could change, andthe problem needs to be addressed.  Specifically, my amendment does three things. First, it increases the threshold from 50 to 300 contracts per day percommodity for those market participants that need to comply with this rule. This will exempt low-volume entities like grainelevators and small agricultural cooperatives from the reporting requirements for large trading firms and major players in thesemarkets. Even with the new threshold established by my amendment, the CFTC will still gather ownership and control informationon the major players and midsized traders.  Second, my amendment removes a small but very burdensome portion of the long list of reporting requirements under the finalOCR rule. My amendment removes the natural person controller requirements which require farmer cooperatives and grain elevatorsto report specifically personally identifiable information on individual employees. The CFTC has never required such granularinformation for many of my constituent businesses, and such requirements are making Futures Commission Merchants much lesswilling to work with small and medium-sized entities in the countryside. Even with the small changes made by my amendment, theCFTC will still be properly equipped to track ownership and account control data across the market.  Finally, this amendment will require the CFTC to ensure that current regulations do not conflict with current foreignprivacy laws. Having a large, open, liquid market is important to managing risk, and operating on an international basis is avaluable aspect of a commodity market. The CFTC should be responsible for dealing with other governments on privacy concerns. Itis inappropriate to push that burden onto the firms and customers that it regulates.  This amendment is supported by a wide range of industry and farmers groups, and I encourage my colleagues to support myamendment to provide relief from the regulatory burdens of this rule on small cooperatives, grain elevators, and farmers who aremerely hedging their legitimate market risk and serving their customers' interests.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH404-6.txt,2032,REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACTOF 2017,2017.0,12.0,January

922,topic-id,1327,"Mr.President, several years ago, Democrats in Congresspulled out all the stops to pass the so-called Affordable Care Act and force the system we now call ObamaCare on the They passed the law on a purely partisan basis and without any regard for public opinion. Quite simply, it was one ofthe most blatant exercises in pure partisanship in our Nation's history. It deepened partisan divides in Washington and aroundthe country and contributed to the cynicism many have about whether their government is actually paying attention to theirneeds. Worst of all, in the years since the passage of ObamaCare, the American people have been paying the price in the form ofskyrocketing costs, fewer choices, burdensome mandates, and unfair taxes.  For 7 years, many of us in Congress--virtually allof us on the Republican side--have been working to right what has gone wrong under the Affordable Care We have pledged toour constituents that, given the opportunity, we would repeal ObamaCare and replace it with reforms more worthy of the Those promises are among the biggest reasons why we Republicans are now fortunate enough to find ourselves in control ofCongress and, very soon, the White  Last night we took a big step in the effort to repeal and replace Withthe budget resolution passed, many in Washington and in the media are talking about what happens next. We are hearing a lot ofdiscussion about the timing of our repeal-and-replace efforts, with some arguing that we should hit the brakes and solve everyproblem in advance of taking another vote. My view is that the repeal of ObamaCare cannot wait. The American people need us toact now. While there is still some debate as to what our replacement plan should look like, a majority of Senators voted lastnight to give us the tools to take the next steps to repeal and replace The American people have entrusted us withthe power to do just that.  We could spend the next several months coming up with more slogans and analogies, but this is nota campaign. The elections have been won, and it is time to do what our constituents have sent us here to do. I am not saying weneed to put off the replacement effort. On the contrary, I think it is important that the legislation we draft pursuant to thebudget reconciliation instructions include as many sensible health reforms as possible, keeping in mind the limitations thatexist with our rules and the necessary vote count.  We should definitely work on making the largest possible downpayment onthe ObamaCare replacement with the budget reconciliation bill. That downpayment should include measures that give individualsand families more control over their health care decisions and empower States to do more of the heavy lifting when it comes toregulating health care. In addition, we need to provide for a smooth transition period so we can maintain some stability in thehealth insurance markets and ensure that we are not leaving Americans who have insurance under the current system out in thecold.  As chairman of one of the primary committees with jurisdiction over these matters, I have been working closely with myHouse counterparts--Chairman Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee and Chairman Greg Walden of the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee--to develop proposals on the matters that fall within our purviews. We have been talking withstakeholders throughout the country and working through the various problems that exist. That work will continue unabated as wework on the immediate repeal effort and into the future. I am quite certain that my friend who chairs the Senate HELP Committeehas been similarly engaged in addressing the draconian insurance regulations that were imposed under ObamaCare, as well as theother parts of the law that are within that committee's jurisdiction.  In other words, the work to replace ObamaCare isongoing, and we hope to have some initial elements ready to include in the budget reconciliation package. That work willcontinue once the repeal has been passed and signed into law so that we can help ensure that affordable health care optionsexist for We do not need to wait until every single replacement measure is drafted and agreed upon before movingforward. Instead, we need the incoming administration to add to our current efforts and work with us to produce a fullreplacement plan and then to execute it. I look forward to continuing to work with President-Elect Trump and his team.  Thepath forward on replacing ObamaCare could end up taking many forms. We could draft and pass a series of limited reforms toreplace ObamaCare piece by piece or we could pull together a full and comprehensive replacement package that puts all thenecessary changes into law at once. I think there are merits and potential pitfalls with either approach. That is something weneed to consider as we move forward, but it is not a decision that needs to be made before we can keep the promises we all madeto our constituents to repeal  To be sure, replacing ObamaCare is going to be a difficult process; however, with anew and more cooperative administration in place, I have every confidence we can accomplish these important objectives withoutimposing artificial deadlines or goalposts or putting the repeal process on hold. All of this is possible so long as we remaincommitted to the principles that have guided most of our efforts thus far. For example, in my view, the new reforms need to bepatient-centered, not government-driven. They need to recognize the reality of the marketplace and the benefits of competition.Perhaps most importantly, any suitable reforms need to put the States back in charge of regulating and overseeing health carepolicy. If the ObamaCare experience has taught us anything, it is that when the Federal Government gets a hold of something thatis as consequential as health care, it will overpromise results, overstep its authority, and overregulate the subject matter.  As I have said a number of times, Utah is not California or Massachusetts, and California and Massachusetts are not Utah.All of our States face different challenges and have different needs. There is no reason to begin with the premise that anysingle approach to health care policy is what is best for the entire country. That is why I, along with several of mycolleagues, have been engaging with stakeholders at the State level for quite some time as we work to craft reforms and to putthem in place. For example, next week the Senate Finance[[Page S304]]Committee is hosting a roundtable discussion on Medicaid withsome of the most prominent Governors in the country. I am pleased that Energy and Commerce chairman Greg Walden will joinus for the discussion as well. This meeting and others like it will give States the opportunity to detail the challenges theyface and how we can empower them to meet those challenges instead of dictating solutions from offices here in Washington,  I believe all of my colleagues want to be judicious and methodical with this undertaking. No one wants to act recklessly anddo even more damage to our Nation's health care system. Discussions and debates over the substance of our ObamaCare replacementshould continue. As I said, they have been going on for some time now, and they are not going to stop. But after last night, wehave the tools we need to take the first major step in this effort by repealing In my view, we need to take that stepnow.  Republicans are united in our desire to repeal We have the support of the American people to do just that,and I personally will do all I can to deliver on that promise. I hope our friends on the other side will work with us. If theywill, I think we can come up with an approach toward health care that not only will work but will be better for our country butmost importantly, better for our citizens, better for the States that will manage a lot better than we will here, and better forour citizens within those  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

For 6 years, we have witnessed the failed rollout of the ObamaCare program. We didn't get to keep our plan that we liked,and we didn't get to keep our doctor that we had such a good relationship with. We have seen physicians leave the business. Wehave spent billions on duplicative, unnecessary exchanges that are now failing across this country. So I commend the RepublicanStudy Committee, and I am proud to be a part of this group to talk about how to bring relief to the American people on thefailed ObamaCare law.  I still hear from constituents--even now, 6 years later, from this rolling evolution of ObamaCare--who have seen theircoverage lost and their increases in healthcare costs skyrocket. This healthcare regulatory burden that we are talking abouttonight has led to droves of part-time jobs instead of full-time jobs and unaffordable group plans for the people who were in agood small business group plan. This regulatory burden is on top of what has been a 6-year to 8-year crushing burden on businessfrom many different agencies from the EPA and beyond.  One constituent wrote my office after he was forced to accept an insurance plan to meet the affordable healthcare law thatcost him $1,300 a month, Mr.Speaker, and he still has to meet two $2,500 deductibles before the insurance coverage kicks in.Now, that is $20,600 a year. Mr.Speaker, I was a small businessman before I joined Congress, and we had employees that made$20,600 a year in our small business. So what is left for the family budget when you are going to spend $20,000 for health care?That is typical now after the rollout of ObamaCare for a family of four. This is in a place in our country where healthcarecosts $20- or $30,000 a year in out-of-pocket expenses? Obviously, this system is broken.  Now, in Arkansas, unlike much of the country where people are definitely seeing large, double-digit, or, in some cases,larger increases in the ObamaCare premium, Arkansans, on the exchanges, are seeing lower than those average increases. In myview, this is largely because our Governor and our State legislature are working hard to make the best out of a bad situationand fighting to pursue innovative measures that work best for our small  The Arkansas Works program has helped to prevent skyrocketing premiums on the exchanges, and the State is still subject,though, to duplicative reviews by Federal and State agencies and costly and burdensome regulations that have nothing to do withtrying to lower the cost of health care for  This week, Governor Hutchinson wrote the House leadership decrying the individual and employer mandates and stressing theneed for healthcare reform that provides our States more flexibility--more flexibility, Mr.Speaker--todesign programs that fit the needs of people in our State while increasing predictability and affordability. Some of the pointsGovernor Hutchinson made in his letter to our leadership include calling for States having the option of receiving Medicaidfunds through a block grant enabling them to tailor the program in the Medicaid population under health care in what fitsArkansas, what Arkansans can afford. In fact, that is our Better Way approach, Mr.Speaker, for the Medicaid population.  He calls for the elimination of the Federal health insurance exchanges. We had exchanges before ObamaCare that can beoperated by States in the private sector without Federal interference. Governor Hutchinson called for restricting theduplicative reviews of rate and plan filings by They are already being done by our individual State insurance regulators.Of course, the thing that drives up costs not only for the Medicaid population, for people on the ObamaCare exchanges, and forpeople out in the group health plans is the essential health benefits requirement.  Governor Hutchinson says that this has driven up costs for everybody, for government, for families, and that elimination ofthese requirements would provide flexible options for insurance providers to offer cheaper plans to younger and healthierindividuals. That is key to choice, Mr. In some counties, Arkansans now only have one insurance option. I don't think one option is an option. There is no choice.This monopoly or oligopoly pricing combined with the mandates are demonstrating the unaffordability of the Affordable Care  With the recent election, we now have a unique opportunity to recognize these flaws of this one-size-fits-all, BigGovernment-mandated, top-down approach to health care, reverse course, and, again, bring relief to the American people of thisfailed law put forth by the Obama administration. Chairman Walker and the Republican Study Committee have put together acomprehensive plan to repeal ObamaCare and replace this failed law with conservative principles.  Mr.Speaker, Americans want change. We are asking that we design those changes with patients in mind and that we, in fact,in this group--Mr.Walker, I know you agree--we will read the bill before we pass it.

Today I rise in support of H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability  One can cut the hyperbole on the other side of the aisle with a knife today because we are not here talking about guttingenforcement. We are not here talking about exceptionally benefiting Wall Street operators. What we are talking about isenhancing the SEC's cost-benefit process.  The Commission has made many positive strides toward its economic analysis in the past few years. This bill will enhancetheir efforts at ranking and providing resources to the rules that will in fact provide investor protection and provideefficient, competitive U.markets. Too many of their resources have been deviated on wild goose hunts related to the Dodd-Frank mandates.  During this same time, we have experienced a sharp decline in initial public offerings and public companies generally.Largely, in my view, that is as a result of the regulatory burden and the costs associated with being a public company. Thisshould be a concern to every Member of this body.  This bill would make the SEC's rulemaking process more accountable by enhancing its cost-benefit analysis requirements andwould require the Commission to revisit its rules after implementation to ensure they are actually achieving their intendedpurposes.  This bill does away with the notion that congressional mandates are exempt from cost-benefit analysis and requires theCommission to evaluate these rules as well--a good thing; Congress doesn't always get it right--in addition to identifyingalternatives which might even include no rule at all, in short, using common sense.  Requiring this sort of more robust economic analysis will also help the SEC set priorities. Chair White testified before ourcommittee in the past Congress that they have 50 front burners.

1067,topic-id,516,"Mr.Chairman, every American will be affected by this vote, not just the 20 million people who will lose theirinsurance immediately. Thirty million, in total, will lose their insurance. Everybody's premium will ultimately go up.Preexisting conditions will not be available. Seniors will pay more for prescription drugs. 25-, 24-, 23-year-olds will bedropped from the insurance of their families.  The fact of the matter is--the gentleman from Florida that just spoke--there is not a better way that has been proposed. Thereis some discussion about across State lines. There is some other discussion about health savings accounts, which is great if youhave the kind of salaries we have; but if you are an average American trying to support your family, getting additional funds toput into a health savings account is not available to you.  Mr.Chairman, this budget resolution is an abdication of responsibility and duty. Rather than showing Republican spendingand revenue priorities, it is nothing more than a vehicle for expediting a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and takinginsurance coverage away from 30 million people.                              {time}  1200  Again, let me remind you it is hundreds of millions of people that will be adversely affected.  Since taking the House majority, Republicans have held 65 votes on this floor to undo healthcare reforms that have broughtthe uninsured rate to its lowest in recorded history and banned discrimination and discriminatory practices, such as denyingcoverage to Americans with preexisting conditions or charging women higher rates than men simply because of their gender.  Now our Republican colleagues want to repeal the Affordable Care Act without immediately replacing it, contrary to at least12 of their colleagues in the United States Senate--Republicans--saying that is not the right way to go. That is what thisresolution would do.  By the way, they should have adopted this resolution last Congress by April 15. They didn't do so.  This is not a real budget resolution. This is simply a device so that they can jam through repeal of the Affordable Care Actin the United States Senate contrary to the existing rules. It would come at a severe cost to our economy and our budgetsustainability.  In addition to the 30 million who would lose their insurance, tens of millions more, as I have said, would see their costsgo up. A report by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund and Milken Institute found that the repeal would lead to the loss of 3million jobs, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found it would add $350 billion to deficits over the next 10years.  Let us be clear, Mr.Chairman, a vote for this budget resolution is a vote to take health insurance away from 30 millionAmericans and adversely impact the health care of millions more.  I urge my Republican colleagues who have serious concerns about our fiscal path and misgivings about repealing theAffordable Care Act without replacing it: let's lay down a marker that Congress should not rush headlong into this costly repealnot only in terms of dollars, but in terms of health security consequences for the American people.

713,topic-id,474,"Mr.Chair, I rise today in support of H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, which would improve andstrengthen the SEC's rulemaking process by requiring more rigorous economic analysis.  What exactly does that mean?  Well, an economic analysis is quite simple, frankly. It is a systemic approach to determine the optimum use of scarceresources involving comparison of two or more alternatives to achieve a specific objective under the given assumptions andconstraints. That is a whole lot of words and jumbo. But what we need to do is make a comparison, what is going to be thebenefit.  Economic analysis takes into account the opportunity costs of resources employed and attempts to measure, in monetary terms,the private and social costs and benefits of a project to a community, an economy, or to an individual.  In its simplest terms, the SEC would have to determine the costs and benefits of proposed regulations, as well as potentialalternatives to determine a best direction forward, basically ensuring that the SEC is thoroughly assessing both the need forthe regulation and adequately evaluating the potential consequences, both intended and unintended, and is there a benefit.  Mr.Chairman, requiring economic analysis by Federal regulators is not a partisan issue. In fact, both President Clinton andPresident Obama issued executive orders requiring regulators to ensure that their rules were maximizing and achieving a netbenefit.  H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, would ensure consistent and effective application of the SEC's economicanalysis guidance by building on the bipartisan effort to strengthen economic analysis requirements, as well as require aretrospective review of existing regulations for independent agencies like the  Specifically, the bill would enhance the SEC's existing economic analysis requirements by requiring the Commission to firstclearly identify the nature of the problem that would be addressed before issuing a new regulation--too often, we are justshooting at a target that we don't even know is actually a target--and to prohibit the SEC from issuing a rule when it cannotmake ``a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify the costs of the regulation.''  Additionally, H.78 would require the SEC to assess the costs and the benefits of available regulatory alternatives,including the alternative of not issuing a regulation, and choose the approach that would maximize the net benefit. The SEC mustalso evaluate whether a proposed regulation is inconsistent or incompatible or duplicative of other Federal regulations.  In testimony before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises last year, former SECCommissioner Dan Gallagher noted that the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would ``promote and improve economic analysis at theSEC and make the agency even more accountable to the investing public.'' He further testified that this bill ``will help ensurethe economic analysis conducted by economists is firmly entrenched in every rulemaking the SEC conducts under the Federalsecurities laws.''

It doesn't matter what the words say,just let's have more of them.  We already have the SEC Chairman and the Commissioners covered by both governmentwide ethics laws and regulations as well asSEC supplemental ethics regulations which apply to all SEC employees. For example, they cannot participate personally andsubstantially in any matter that would have direct or predictable effect on his or her financial interests or imputed financialinterests in the future, as required under the code.  Also, unless they are specifically authorized by the SEC's ethics counsel, they should recuse from any matter in which he orshe has a ``covered relationship.'' Well, what is a covered relationship? Well, a covered relationship includes formeremployees, clients, and even a spouse's employer. Further, the SEC employees must report their financial holdings to the SEC'sethics counsel; and this requirement goes beyond, frankly, the governmentwide reporting requirement.  Finally, the SEC Chairman or a Commissioner must not engage in any other business, employment, or vocation while in office;nor may he or she ever use the power of their office to influence their name to promote the business interests of others, asrequired by law.  As such, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

746,topic-id,230,"Mr.Chairman, I just find it a bit ironic that the other side is not interested in doing this cost-benefitanalysis which is in the underlying bill here because it is too burdensome. But what do they want to do? They want to add morepaperwork and more burden in their amendments.  Despite what you have heard, the SEC is not a systemic risk regulator; and even the former chairman of the Committee onFinancial Services, Barney Frank, noted at the time when the FSOC was reviewing asset managers for systemic designations, herecognized that these are not entities that pose a systemic risk to the financial system. And while the SEC does not regulatesystemic risk, I am afraid that this amendment could be potentially politically misinterpreted and applied to a number ofcapital market participants and activities which they, frankly, have no business regulating. So it would lead to the same fire,aim, ready kind of situation rulemaking that we have seen from the current administration that hinders growth and that capitalmarket formation that we have just talked about in the last amendment.  The bill before us will ensure that future SEC rulemakings are prudently proposed and adopted to achieve the maximum netbenefit, and that is what we are really talking about here today.

752,topic-id,364,"Mr.Chairman, I would just like to point out to all of my colleagues and to the American people that currentlythe SEC is under a court order to clarify how exactly they are doing their rulemaking. And there is a staff-level rule letter.  With this underlying bill, we are trying to codify that. We are trying to make sure, not just with a letter, but by law,that they do what they are being ordered to do. And I will remind all of my colleagues and those of you out watching us, theSecurities and Exchange Commission has a mission that has three parts.  The first part is to protect investors. Nothing in this bill weakens there. Nothing in this bill takes anything away fromthat. We, in fact, underscore that.  The second mission that it has is to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Emphasis again, fair, orderly, andefficient markets. What we are seeing is inefficiency that is being built into the marketplace right now, and we are here toclarify that. Let's find out, as the SEC is preparing a rule, what the goal and objective is and what is going to be the impacton it. Yes, cost is part of that, and we are able to look at that.  The third thing the SEC intended to do is to facilitate capital formation.  Why is that important and what exactly does that mean?  It means making sure that there is enough money around so that companies, big, medium, and small, are able to go in thereand get the cash and the credit that they need to go and expand and do the job that they are trying to do, which is, by the way,employ all of us in  We have talked a lot about the underlying bill and not so much about the particular amendment that we have before us, but Ido continue to oppose the amendment and encourage the passage of the underlying bill.

The SEC is already covered by both governmentwide ethics laws and regulations as well as SEC supplemental ethics regulationswhich apply to all SEC employees, including the  Perhaps the sponsor of the amendment is not aware that under existing Federal law, the SEC Chairman cannot participatepersonally in any matter that would have a direct and predictable effect on her financial interests or imputed financialinterest, and I would invite the sponsor to review the code at this point.  Additionally, SEC supplemental regulations prohibit SEC employees, including the Chair, from holding any security in adirectly regulated entity, and they must also preclear all purchases and sales of securities.  Further, the Chairman or Commissioner must not engage in any other business, employment, or vocation while in office, normay she ever use the power of her office or the influence of her name to promote the business interests of others.  Finally, the amendment does not seem to address what I believe Congressman DeSaulnier's description is intending toaddress as it is the Federal Reserve, not the Securities and Exchange Commission, that regulates the too-big-to-fail banks or,as the amendment states, financial institutions.  The SEC does not regulate financial institutions. The code defines the term ``financial institution,'' and the definitionincludes ``a bank, a foreign bank, and a savings association.''

The SEC does notregulate financial institutions. 15 U.S.78c defines the term ``financial institutions,'' and that definition includes a bank,a foreign bank, and a savings association. The SEC does not regulate any of the entities that are described in this.

762,topic-id,377,"Mr.Chairman, I believe the sponsor of the amendment was in the Chamber when we were discussing this on thelast amendment. Federal law, as well as SEC supplemental regulations, already govern ethics and conflicts of interest.  It is well-known, especially if you check out my Twitter account, I think, that most people who support this President don'tbelieve I support this President enough. A number of people would say that I haven't supported the SEC Chairman to the levelthat I should. This, frankly, is insulting to the current President as well as the Implying somehow that this Chair haspreyed off of poor people until they went bankrupt, as was just sort of laid out by the sponsor of this, is an insult.  To believe this of the SEC Chair, who is typically--and I know in this particular case is--a very accomplished professional,is amazingly shortsighted, I believe. Additionally, the Chair is required to receive personal annual ethics training as well asan initial ethics briefing. I direct the sponsor to review the statute on this.  Additionally, the Chairman and the Commissioners are required to file an ethics agreement letter in which she will agree todivest prohibited assets, and if she has not done so prior to the appointment, she is to recuse herself from matters in whichshe has financial conflict or the impartiality conflict, which can be found also in code.  Finally, the Chairman or a Commissioner is prohibited from engaging in any other business, employment, or vocation while inoffice, or she may never use the power of her office or her name to promote or influence a business interest.  Once again, I think that what we are trying to do here with the underlying bill is to make sure that the SEC follows throughon what the courts have mandated in previous rulings in that they use a cost-benefit analysis. This is not about fraud. This isnot about whether Mary Jo White needs ethics training. This is about making sure that the SEC has an identifiable target andgoal with the rules that it is putting in place and then analyzing whether the costs and the benefits weigh in favor ofprotecting the consumer. Ultimately, this amendment does nothing to forward that. I oppose the amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.

Additionally, Chairmen andCommissioners are required to file      ethics agreement letters in which they agree to divest.  The bottom line is that we don't need additional words in the Federal Register to do what is already being done.

It will be short, and it will be sweet, but it will be to the point.  I was here in 2009when we passed In fact, as the Presiding Officer will remember, it was at 9 o'clock in the morning on Christmas Evein 2009. I opposed it at that time for a particular reason. The reason was that I saw it driving ustoward a single-payer health care system, which I personally opposed. But the votes were there. It passed, and it passed on thepromise that if you liked your doctor, you could keep him; if you liked your insurance, you could keep it. And because everybodyis going to be insured, rates will go down and everything is going to be wonderful.  What has happened over the last 8 yearshas been pretty incredible. Rates have gone up tremendously. People have not been able to keep their insurance. We findourselves on the cusp of being forced to a government single-payer health care system because the private markets arecollapsing.  In my State of Georgia, where we have 159 counties, up until this year every county had at least two or moreproviders providing health insurance. Today in 2017, 96 of our 159 counties have one carrier. Next year half of them will bedown to no carrier, and we will be forced into a system that we don't know what it will look like. Prices have gone up not justby a little bit, but they have gone up by an awful lot. The end-user market in Georgia is approaching the breaking point.  Iwill give you a couple of examples. Two parents in Georgia picked the least expensive plan available this year to their familyof four. It comes out to be a $6,500 deductible and $2,400 a month for premium--unsustainable.[[Page S240]]  A couple in theirsixties had a similar plan but were just outside the subsidy limit of $96,000 for their family. So they are paying over 50percent of their income for health insurance.  Hard-working families deserve better. Although President Obama promised thislaw would reduce premiums and make health care more available, it has done the opposite. ObamaCare is unsustainable. Now, thatis the practical answer, and that is exactly what got us to where we are today.  We are in the process of attempting to getthe budget reconciliation act before us so that we can repeal ObamaCare, but we must also talk about what we replace it withbecause repealing it without a replacement is not an acceptable solution. It is not a solution. It is a conundrum.  We mustprioritize returning the oversight of individual markets to the States and provide them with the flexibility to design theirMedicaid programs in ways that enable them to cover most people and tailor benefits to meet the needs of the unique populationsin their  We have proven in the past that regulation by the State insurance commissioners work. We need to returnassociation health plans to be competitive in the United We need to allow the sale of interstate insurance across Statelines and stop the prohibition against that. We need to open the opportunity for entrepreneurship in the private sector to fillthe void that is being filled by the vacuum that has been created by the mandates of  We need to also preservethose things in ObamaCare that made sense--preexisting condition, absolutely; insurance coverage up to the age of 26 whilestaying at home with a parent, absolutely. Those things can be done, and we ought to do them because they were the right thingto do when we did them, and they are the right thing to preserve now. But it is absolutely essential that we see to it that wereturn insurance to the private sector and regulation to the If we fail to do so, we will have higher premiums or nopremiums at all and no plans at all.  So as we talk about repealing, we must also end up landing on a replacement. It isunsustainable and impractical, and it is wrong for us to say we are going to repeal ObamaCare without replacing it with a planthat we know works and has the opportunity. Let's address that which caused ObamaCare to happen. Let's fix the breaks that havetaken place. Let's bring back competition, State regulation and authority, and let's see to it that health care in America isaccessible and is affordable. It is important for us to do it. It is essential for us to do it, and I plan to commit myself toseeing to it to do my part to repeal We replace it with a sustainable program, we return the program to the States,wherever possible, and we see to it that Americans have health insurance coverage at a competitive and fair price.

8,topic-id,729,"Mr.Speaker, I was reflecting the other day. Last week, we all joined together in this Chamber, we held upour right hand, and we swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  That is an oath I have taken both as a Member of Congress--now on my fourth term--and as a military pilot, something similarto that, talking about the importance of the military to protect and defend the In both of these roles, I haveseen firsthand the sacrifice that men and women of the military have been willing to make to defend their freedoms, to defendthe Constitution, defend the country.  This last month was especially tough for our Nation's security and for our foreign policy. The 8-year decline of Americanglobal leadership, under the President, came to a head. A sad trend built by the Obama administration continued as the WhiteHouse worked with our enemies and abandoned our friends.  For one, the recent ceasefire in Syria was reached without United States' input, ultimately empowering tyrants in Iran andin In fact, to think about the situation in Syria, I want to remind people there are half a million dead Syrians rightnow, innocent civilians. And I have heard people say, completely incorrectly, that it doesn't matter; they are all basicallyterrorists. But let's say it is.  There are 50,000 children in Syria that did not get an opportunity to go be a teacher or a police officer or a firefighteror a doctor because of tyrants in Iran, because of Bashar al-Assad and because of Russia empowering them and using precision-guided munitions to hit innocent civilians and take their life away.  Last week, the U.abstained from a vote in the United Nations Security Council on the biased resolution targeting our ally Mr.Speaker, rather than turning on freedom-loving nations around the world, we must stand with them. Nowhere is this moreimportant than in the fight against terrorism.  Before the holidays, a list went out from ISIS accounts with the names of churches in the United States that should beattacked over the holidays. Then, an attack in Berlin took the lives of 12 innocent civilians and injured more than 50 in aChristmas market. On New Year's Eve, there was a savage attack at a nightclub in Istanbul, killing 39 revelers and injuringdozens.  Both attacks were claimed by ISIS seeking to strike fear into freedom-loving people around the world. While we all mustremain vigilant, we cannot give in to that fear, and we must continue to live our lives.  What we need right now, Mr.Speaker, is a renewed American moment, renewed American leadership after 8 years of decline. Weneed a Churchill moment. I think about Winston Churchill after the bombs rained down in London, and instead of hiding andcowering and talking about how terrible it is, he goes out on the streets, rallies the people, and says that you cannot shatterus. And the people unite behind him.  It is time for America to exhibit the same kind of leadership exhibited by George Bush in the bullhorn speech after thefall of the World Trade He showed Americans unity, strength, resolve, and he reminded the world that our foundationswill not be shaken even if you shake the foundations of our biggest buildings. And you can shatter our steel, but you can'tshatter the steel of American resolve. I haven't heard speeches like that in quite a while from the oval office.  Mr.Speaker, it has been a rough election cycle for our country. It has been a tough, very divisive, and difficult time, butnow it is time to come together. We are going to have our partisan differences and battles, and that is fine. That is what weare out here for.  But, Mr.Speaker, America needs to remember our mission, our God-given mission. I believe that is to be an example of self-governance to billions of people that don't have what we have, but are desperate for it.  We used that kind of leadership in the cold war as millions lived behind the Iron Curtain and saw what freedom could be. Andthere are iron curtains that exist today; terrorism, strongmen, a resurgent Russia--an iron curtain of soft expectations and lowexpectations of people.  For the last 8 years, we failed to articulate that mission. Mr.Speaker, we are a nation in need of remembering thatmission, and it is my sincere hope that this will change very soon.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH304.txt,2014,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S.

778,topic-id,595,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back tocommittee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to a vote on final passage as amended.  Mr.Speaker, the amendment I am offering this afternoon is simple. It would prevent any jurisdiction's swap laws fromautomatically being considered comparable to the United States if it is found to have engaged in cyber attacks targeting U.S.elections. As someone who has been involved in cybersecurity policy for the better part of a decade, it could not be morerelevant, it could not be more timely.  During the past year, Mr.Speaker, the core of our democracy came under attack. The Russian Government, acting under theorders of authoritarian President Vladimir Putin, conducted a sustained information warfare campaign designed to undermine theAmerican people's faith in our electoral system. The influence operation involved traditional tradecraft, including Russianstate-owned media broadcasters. It also, notably and notoriously, involved the hacking of Democratic Party organizations,including the Democratic National  These are facts, Mr.They are the findings of independent security researchers that have been recently confirmed bythe brave men and women serving their country as part of the intelligence community for whom I have great respect. The contoursof what happened are indisputable, and they should be undisputed.  Yet, our response to this unprecedented attack has been anything but unified. Putin and his henchmen acted with an intent tosow discord, to make us question each other's motives, and to raise doubt about the validity of our election results. We knowthis was Putin's intent, and yet, rather than acting with solidarity to address the problem, we bicker.  Mr.Speaker, next Friday, I will be here at the Capitol for one of the greatest American traditions, the peaceful transitionof power. Mr.Trump may not have been my choice for President, but, come next week, he will nonetheless be my I willjoin with my colleagues here, and we will congratulate him on his inauguration. We will do so because there is no evidence thatany vote tallies were altered and, like it or not, Mr.Trump clearly prevailed in the electoral college.  But if we can join together on the election of the President, something many of my colleagues have severe disagreementsabout, why can we not do so to decry Putin's attempted interference? Why do we not speak today as a body with one voice to say:you've failed, Mr.Putin; our faith in our democracy is as strong as ever?  I will not pretend that my amendment to this bill is sufficient punishment for the brazen attack on our democracy. But itwill send a powerful message that this House is unified. It will send a powerful message to Putin that American democracy isresilient. It will send a powerful message to our allies that we will not stand idly by as Russians attempt to affect theirdemocratic institutions. And it will send a powerful message to our constituents that our commitment to free and fair electionsrises above partisan politics.  President Obama spoke very eloquently on Tuesday about the challenges faced by our democracy. ``Our democracy isthreatened,'' he said, ``whenever we take it for granted.'' Passing this amendment makes it abundantly clear that we very muchunderstand how lucky we are to live in this country and how attacks on it will not be tolerated. I will reiterate that thisamendment will not kill the bill in any way. Rather, we will move immediately to vote on final passage following its adoption.  I urge my colleagues to join me in this display of solidarity and resilience.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

TheFramers of the Constitution established that the Senate should provide advice and consent in the appointment of such Congress subsequently, in the aftermath of World War II, sought to implement limitations on who could serve asSecretary of Defense, specifically, a cooling off period for members of the military nominated to serve as Secretary of Defense.The goal? To ensure that America's military would remain under civilian control. Circumventing these limitations requires an actof It has been done just once before, ironically almost immediately after Congress first enacted those limitations.  In Mattis, the President-elect--who is inexperienced in the world of military affairs and has sometimes proven rash inhis public comments--has identified an able leader, who is tremendously popular and who has time and again shown himself worthyof the respect he has earned. I believe he will be a voice of reason in the Department of Defense and was encouraged to hear athis confirmation hearing this morning that he understands the importance of civilian control of our Defense Department andintends to preserve that tradition.  As Senator Reed said earlier today in the Armed Services Committee, this is a once-in-a-generation waiver. Chairman McCain similarly emphasized that he supports the law that this legislation wouldtemporarily waive. I do not support efforts to change the law to permanently eliminate this statutory cooling off period. I amdisappointed that the Senate majority has insisted on creating an expedited debate on such a critical question. I cannot supportsuch an abrupt and accelerated revision of the law, even in the form of a one-time-only exemption. I couldn't support such ahaphazard process, regardless of who the President, President-elect, or the nominee is.

320,topic-id,1438,"Madam President, I rise today togive voice to some of my fellow Utahns, including a few of my fellow Utahns who are suffering because of the health care lawpassed by this body nearly 7 years ago. These are not stories from wealthy Utahns who have simply had to pay higher taxes, norare these stories from low-income Utahns who already have insurance through Medicaid.[[Page S246]]  These are letters are from thetoo often invisible victims of ObamaCare--those middle-class families who used to be able to afford health care when they neededit but are now forced to pay for it and to pay for what amounts to, in some cases, one of their largest payments or even theirlargest payment they make each month for a so-called insurance plan that never seems to pay out because of high deductibles.  Jenica from Davis County, UT, writes as follows:       I am an ordinary mother raising my kids andstriving to live      within my means. For the first time, my family is facing a      year with no health insurance. Our gross incomefalls a few      hundred dollars per month too high for us to receive help      through CHIP or UPP programs, but we cannot afford topurchase      health insurance through my husband's work or through the      After this year's premium increases, the      mostinexpensive plan offered to us on the Marketplace is a      full quarter of our gross income per month (before taxes),      and if we putthat into our budget we will not be able to save      any money to pay deductibles as healthcare needs arise.       We face the sameproblem with my husband's work insurance;      it would be even more expensive, and we cannot wisely budget      a quarter or more of ourincome toward health insurance      premiums.       I know this problem is not limited to my family, and I want      you to be aware ofthose of us who are falling in the gap this      year. We earn barely too much to receive any assistance, but      not enough to actuallypay for insurance premiums. It seems      the wisest course for us is to withdraw from insurance and      save our money to pay formedical expenses in cash, as well as      saving to pay the fine on our taxes next year.       It is a decision I do not make lightly,as I know that the      insurance companies need more people, not less, to      participate to make the system work. However, my familycannot      afford to participate this year.       I know you will represent us well and take our needs into      consideration as you workwith the other members of Congress      to make our country's healthcare system work for all of us.      Thank you for serving our stateand our country. May God bless      you in your efforts.  May God bless you, May God bless you for having the courageto write these things down and to share them with your fellow Utahns and your fellow  I promised Jenica that Iwill do everything I can, everything within my power, to make sure that you and families like yours are not forgotten when werepeal this law and replace it.  Trevor from George, UT, had a similar story. He writes:       Irecently got a new job and I'm trying to get healthcare.      None of the 3 plans my employer offers are affordable to me,      eventhough the government claims they are. Even if I were to      buy the cheapest plan, I would never be able to use it      because of thehigh deductibles.       I do not qualify for Medicaid, and earn $1,000 per year too      much to qualify for subsidies.       In anutshell, I can't afford to buy insurance from      anywhere, and by not buying it, I can't afford the penalty      levied by the federalgovernment. What is someone in my      position supposed to do?       The ACA is not helping the very people it was designed to      helpand is in fact throwing a terrible burden upon me and my      family. We need a new healthcare system. This one is not      working.Please share my story so that others will be aware      that people in my position (and there are many of us) are      struggling.  I will share your story, Trevor, and soon we will be one step closer to a new type of system, a system thatwill put patients and doctors back in charge of health care decisions rather than having those decisions made by governmentbureaucrats in  The last letter I would like to share today comes from Washington County, Ron from WashingtonCounty writes as follows:       Today I received a letter from my health insurance carrier      indicatingthat the premium for me and my two kids--yes, only      three people--is increasing from $1,020 per month to $1,706      per month, anincrease of slightly over $8,200 per year. My      annual income for 2017 will not be increasing, let alone to      cover eight grand.       Later this afternoon, I am contacting my travel agency (a      local small business) and asking Judy to cease her research      intomy family vacation for the summer of 2017. Why would I      cancel my vacation and also take away revenue from a local      smallbusiness? The answer is ``67.26%.'' That is the      percentage increase for my health care insurance.       I need you to see thatthis is real. It greatly and      negatively impacts my family and it subsequently impacts      local businesses as more of my money isdrained from the      economy. I make roughly $60,000 per year. My medical premium      is now one third of my gross income! Plus, I stillhave to pay      out deductibles and copays.       Even the bronze programs, which are worthless, are designed      to bankrupt a family andend up costing more in the long-run,      have exceeded the cost of the mortgage I took out on my      George home in 2014. More thanmy mortgage! Repeat more than      my mortgage. That should send shivers down anyone's spine.       One of the most important aspectsof America's middle class      is the ability for a family to purchase a home. Now that      insurance premiums have exceeded the mortgagepayment of a      median priced home in the US, I suspect that the dream is now      slipping out of the hands of many  Ron, you are absolutely right. Thanks to ObamaCare, the American dream is now slipping out of reach for far too manyfamilies throughout the State of Utah and throughout the entire country. These are not just the stories of a few isolatedThese are not just stories from a few statistical outliers. There are fewer affordable options for Utahns throughout the In 20 out of Utah's 29 counties, Utahns can only choose a health plan from one insurance company. They have just onecompany to choose from, and the options available are not always as robust as they should be. Within those options that theyhave, the costs have risen far too much each year. For 2017 plans, insurance rates across Utah increased at least 30 percent, onaverage. This is after multiple years of substantial premium increases in the other years leading up to this.  Fortunately,help is on the way. Thanks to President-Elect Donald Trump's victory this November--and thanks to the outcome of House and Senateraces throughout the country--we now have the opportunity to uproot this ill-conceived health care law, root and branch.  Theold system, to be clear, is far from perfect. After we repeal ObamaCare, we still have much work to do unbundling health carefrom employer-provided health insurance so doctors, nurses, patients, and innovators can do the work of bringing down prices andincreasing quality. That is what happens when we allow the free market to operate. We get competition. When people compete, twothings happen that are important for consumers: Prices go down and quality goes up.  That is what the American people havecome to expect and basically every other sector of our economy. Sadly, we have seen the opposite become true with respect to ourhealth care system under ObamaCare because we have restricted free market forces, and we have impeded competition. As a result,prices have gone up and quality, in some cases, has gone tragically down.  Step one involves repealing this health care law.Trevor, Jenica, and Ron, I want you to know that I hear you. I hear you and I hear all Utahns who have contacted me to sharetheir experiences with this health care law. My colleagues in the Senate have heard you too. We will repeal this health care lawand we will bring reform and competition to our Nation's currently broken health care system.  Madam President, I yield thefloor.

Until now, Oakland, California, never held a State championship,but now we have two. On December 17, Bishop O'Dowd clinched the CIF State Division 5-AA They beat Valley ViewHigh School 43-24, with former Oakland Raiders running back Coach Napoleon Kaufman leading them to victory. The same day,McClymonds' Warriors claimed the CIF State 5-A Championship with a 20-17 victory, becoming the first Oakland Athletic Leagueteam to win a State championship.  McClymonds is a public historic high school in the West Oakland community of my district. Coach Michael Peters has coachedMcClymonds since 1992 and has shown his commitment over the years to ensuring his athletes succeed both on the field and in theclassroom.  Bishop O'Dowd, a Catholic high school, has been an athletic force for years, and I am so proud of their team. They haveachieved the historic accomplishment of their championship also.

827,topic-id,1038,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for yielding, but also for her tremendous leadershipon so many issues, including as a champion for women and women's health and reproductive health care, and also for thisimportant discussion tonight.                              {time}  1915  I just want to mention that I serve on the Budget Committee, and you mentioned a nominee, Congressman Tom Price ofGeorgia, for Secretary of Health and Human Once again, we see President-elect Donald Trump making recommendations ofthose individuals who want to dismantle the safety net and dismantle health care within the agencies that they are going to run.This is a very, very troubling development in terms of these cabinet appointee nominees.  I note that--and many know--President-elect Trump ran one of the most divisive and prejudiced campaigns that we have witnessedin modern history. Since winning the Presidency, he has nominated billionaires to serve in his cabinet, proving that he willgovern just as he campaigned. Also, he has nominated individuals who want to dismantle, for the most part, the agencies thatthey will have jurisdiction over.  Another example is his choice for Secretary of State, which Congresswoman Watson Coleman mentioned, and that is I serve on the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee andunderstand the importance of our diplomatic initiatives, our USAID initiatives, and our efforts to really bring education andhealth care to the poorest of the poor around the world. Our Secretary of State serves as the Nation's chief diplomat andrepresents America's interests around the world. I have the opportunity and the privilege to serve on the committee that fundsthe majority of these efforts.  So the nomination of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson really troubles me. His extensive ties to the Kremlin raises thequestion: Whose interest will he represent?  Our country cannot afford a Secretary of State who will place private corporate interests over the needs of the Americanpeople and our national security interests. His recent confirmation hearing revealed what we have known all along in Republican-controlled Washington, that cabinet officials will cater to special interests, not to American families, based on the nomineesthat we have seen come forward.  It is not just the Secretary of State we should be concerned about. Here at home, President-elect Trump has nominatedcabinet officials that would turn back the clock on progress. His nomination for Secretary of Labor, Andrew Puzder, is anothermillionaire CEO who benefits from an economy rigged against families struggling to make ends meet. He earns more than $1 milliona year, but opposes a raise for low-wage workers earning just $15,000 a year. He says that food assistance programs keep low-wage workers like those he employs at, I believe, Carl's and Hardee's--he says that if low-wage workers apply for these foodassistance programs, then the programs actually discourage work. There are millions of people who are working two jobs beingpaid minimum wage who need food assistance, who need food stamps, because they can't survive in today's economy.  So the working, poor, low-income individuals, should be very troubled by this appointment as Secretary of Labor, which issupposed to look out for the rights of working men and women. We need a Labor Secretary committed to helping working familiesand addressing the epidemic of poverty, not one who caters to the most affluent.  Also, by nominating Senator Sessions to lead the Justice Department, President-elect Donald Trump is making it clearthat he will abandon our fundamental civil and human rights. Senator Sessions has a long history of opposing civil rightsand equality. I am very proud of members of the Congressional Black Caucus for really setting forth his record and his history,such as laying out the fact that he was rejected from serving as a Federal judge due to his blatantly racist comment. Heforcefully degraded the LGBT community, opposed the Violence Against Women Act, and violated the Voting Rights Act, calling itan intrusive piece of legislation.  Clearly, someone who has publicly shown prejudice and intolerance is not qualified to serve as the chief law enforcement forour civil rights laws. Once again, you see a nominee who really doesn't believe in the values of liberty and justice for all, aperson to head an agency that is supposed to be an agency that ensures the civil and human rights for all. Let me be clear,these nominations are a chilling indication of how a Trump administration intends to govern.  Our Nation has made tremendous progress in the fight to protect, preserve, and expand civil rights, civil liberties, andhuman rights for all We will not allow a Trump administration to drag us back into the past.  Finally, let me just say something that is troubling me tremendously at this point in our history. Our Nation prides itselfon being a democracy. We actually promote democracy abroad through our democracy programs, which, of course, I have historicallyopposed. The point I am trying to make and want to make clear is that this new administration, when you look at the majority ofcabinet nominees, they are very, very wealthy and do not fundamentally believe in a strong public sector and in many ways do notsupport the mission of the cabinets they are actually asked to lead.  Privatizing Medicare and other public sector programs that ensure that the most vulnerable have a safety net and anopportunity to live the American Dream by privatizing these agencies is dangerous. It will lead to chaos. Private sectortakeover of the government is dangerous and it erodes our public institutions that are required in a democracy.  So, Congresswoman Watson Coleman, I believe this is the dangerous, slippery slope that this administration has embarkedupon, and we need to expose every step of the way who these individuals are, their background, and we have to urge that theycomply with the ethics requirement and submit their financial disclosure statements and all the required ethics forms so thatthe public will know who they are. We must be transparent and, of course, we would like for our President-elect to release hisincome taxes also.  Again, we kind of see what is taking place now. We knew this during the campaign. I thought that we were going to see nowmore of an effort to unify the country, but, unfortunately, I think these nominees show us which direction, unfortunately, thisnew administration will take.

We know that Planned Parenthood is one of the Nation's leading providers of high-quality, affordable health care for womenand their families. Denying access to healthcare providers such as Planned Parenthood will hurt women who need these servicesthe most: low-income women and women of color.

This amendment works to provide much-needed reliefand certainty for American companies by clarifying how the internal risk reducing transactions amongst the businesses' ownaffiliates are regulated. Many businesses of all types and sizes in our country use derivatives to manage the risks they facewithin their daily operations. Interaffiliate swaps are a commonly used and effective internal risk management tool thesebusinesses rely upon.  Unfortunately, derivatives reforms implemented under Dodd-Frank fail to distinguish the difference between interaffiliatetransactions and transactions executed between unaffiliated third parties. Such internal transactions ensure firms to centralizetheir risk management activities between affiliate counterparties and do not create additional counterparty exposure outside ofa corporate group. This amendment, therefore, clarifies that interaffiliate swaps are not subject to the same regulatoryrequirements as external, market-facing swaps between third parties.  In addition, this amendment is consistent with the CFTC's attempts to provide similar relief through rule exceptions and no-action letters. While such actions by the CFTC have provided relief, they do not provide a workable, clear, and predictable setof regulations that market participants can effectively operate under.  This amendment will keep in place appropriate regulatory reforms and provide much-needed regulatory and legal certainty forU.companies. Please join me in supporting this needed reform.

It represents our brightest opportunity to unleash innovation andinvestment so that American businesses, big and small, can create new futures.  I am also grateful that H.5 includes my bill, the REVIEW The REVIEW Act was featured as part of Speaker Ryan'sA Better Way agenda and passed the House on a bipartisan basis last fall. It represents a simple premise: regulations should benarrowly tailored, and massive regulations deserve full and thorough scrutiny.  The REVIEW Act would mandate a stay of any high-impact, billion-dollar regulation while judicial review is underway.Historically, billion-dollar rules have been few and far between. In fact, only 26 have been put in place since 2006; but, inrecent years, their frequency has grown along with the unprecedented reach of the regulatory state. In the past 8 years, anaverage of three per year have been put in place.  Their significance, however, lies in their impact on our country. These regulations are massive and have the potential tofundamentally and irreversibly change entire industries. If, later, judicial review finds the agency's reasoning to be legallyunsound or contrary to the intent of Congress, the[[Page H330]]compliance costs incurred--often meaning jobs that were lost--cannot beundone. The REVIEW Act provides an important check on regulatory largesse and is an important piece of this bill.  The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. It is time for us all to take our country and the economy inthe right direction. The Regulatory Accountability Act provides the reforms that are necessary to get us there.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,2053,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,11.0,January

Because of ObamaCare, I know more physiciansleaving their practice this year than any other year. With $12,000 deductibles and annual premium spikes of over 50 and manytimes over 100 percent, ObamaCare has made health care truly unaffordable and unattainable for many, many people. In fact, itwould be irresponsible for Congress to sit back and watch the ACA continue its death spiral and bankrupt our country.  As we begin to replace ObamaCare, we want to reassure Americans we will not pull the rug out from anyone.

820,topic-id,2230,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Collins) for including me in this Special Order tonightand for yielding to me and for becoming a friend of mine.[[Page H457]]  Mr.Speaker, it is with tremendous honor and humility that I rise to represent the hardworking values of the 18thCongressional District of Florida, with communities like Palm Beach Gardens, home of the PGA tour; Stuart, Florida, home to theU.Sailing Academy; Port Lucie, the spring training home of the New York Mets; and Fort Pierce, Florida, the home of theonly Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in the entire country. It is an amazing place for anyone to go to.  Before I go any further, I do want to--and I know I am joined by the rest of my freshmen colleagues, and probably the entirebody, when I say that our thoughts and our prayers have been with our new colleague, Mr.Rutherford from the FourthDistrict of Florida, the sheriff as I call him. He is a friend and a patriot. I know that we are all praying for his speedyrecovery.  As I talk to people in my community, there is one issue that keeps them up at night more than any other issue, and that issue is the water quality in our area, or rather, the lack thereof. I can tell you, it isnonnegotiable. It is a nonnegotiable priority for me, that we allow the water in our community, water that used to be so bluethat it looked like something out of a postcard, to once again become clean for this generation and for future generations.  When I was studying at Harvard, I studied the environment. I did very specific work in watershed infrastructure. I can tellyou, it doesn't take an academic to know that these waterways are irreplaceable treasures. They are central to the economy andthe quality of life in our region. It is why most people I know make our 18th District home, why they call it some place thatthey want to live for the rest of their life. It is the water and it is the weather. To tell you the truth, if you take thewater away, the weather isn't always that comfortable.  Right now there is water being discharged from the center of our State, Lake Okeechobee into the Treasure Coast of Florida,destroying our community, putting our people out of business, killing sea life, and making people sick. What makes our communityso beautiful is literally being robbed from us, and this cannot continue. Our lagoon and our estuaries have to be restored. Iwill work endlessly to strengthen the partnership between our local, State, and Federal agencies to upgrade that infrastructure;not just talk about it, but actually get it done because this is life or death for the community that I represent.                              {time}  1830  Mr.Speaker, if I sound heated over this, it is because I am heated over this. When I look back at history and see that thePanama Canal took less than a decade to build once the United States Government got involved, that the Hoover Dam was built andopen in 5 years, as far as I can tell, construction technology has only improved since the 1930s, but the infrastructurerestoration surrounding Lake Okeechobee and the Florida Everglades is taking decades. It is an absolute embarrassment that thewater infrastructure projects in Florida are taking so long and at such a great social and economic cost to communities like myown. We can't afford to wait any longer, and this will be my top priority.  Another issue that I hear about constantly is from people in our community talking about the role America's weak foreignpolicy over the last 8 years has played in destabilizing the Middle East and making our country and communities--places like FortPierce, where the terrorist who attacked the Orlando nightclub lived, where he worshipped--making our country less safe.  As a Member of Congress, I will work every day to provide the men and women of our armed services with the tools and theflexibility that they need to do their job and to come home alive.  When I was serving in the Army, I had the honor to work alongside the best men and women that I have ever known. I worked asa bomb technician in our highest level of military special operations; and under the cover of darkness in Afghanistan, our jobwas to kill or capture the most menacing targets each and every night that we could find.  I witnessed firsthand the extremists that want to literally destroy our way of life. My scars and the scars of my fellowveterans and peers, they should be a continual reminder of the enemy that we are fighting and why the work that we are doing isso important.  For me, on September 19, 2010, I found my last explosive device, and it wasn't that much different from so many others thathave claimed the lives of friends of mine. It was homemade explosives encapsulated in pieces of glass--nails, ball bearings,shrapnel that was meant to detonate whenever it was stepped on.  Mr.Speaker, the people that put that bomb there, that manufactured that device, who have killed or wounded our bravest menand women, their goal is to wipe our country and our allies off the face of this Earth, to bring that same war to our hometownsas they have done in so many places already, places like New York and Boston and Chattanooga, San Bernardino, Fort Hood, and Eight years of failed international leadership has created a vacuum of power that is being filled by ISIS and otherterrorist groups. ISIS right now has more money, more land, more resources than al Qaeda did at 9/11.  Sitting back and waiting for peace, that is not a strategy. Containment, that is not a strategy. We need an aggressivestrategy to root out extremists, eliminate any safe haven to prevent future attacks on the United States of  I can tell you, Mr.Speaker, I am as well aware as anybody that defeating those who come against us out of a hatred, itcomes at a cost. Friends of mine--too many friends of mine--have lost three or four limbs, have been blinded, have been covered ontheir entire body with burns, have had massive head trauma or some combination of all of the above injuries.  Sadly, I am also aware of how often the VA fails these men and women, and I can tell you that it is not an option. We haveto do better. We owe our veterans better than the care that they are getting right now.  Improving care for our veterans, it starts with reforming the Department of Veterans I strongly believe that thebest way to do this is to give veterans the flexibility to choose anytime, anywhere medical care. The increased competition willforce the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide a higher quality of care to our servicemen and -women.  Beyond this, we have to eliminate the corruption and the incompetence at the Department of Veterans Affairs to reduce theclaims backlog currently plaguing the VA hospitals across the country. These pending claims make it nearly impossible for themen and women who fought in places like Iwo Jima, the Chosin Reservoir, Saigon, Mogadishu, Kandahar, Mosul, and any other placesto live their life, as they have to wait years for a decision from the Department of Veterans Fixing these problemswill ensure that the future generations of servicemen and -women are not burdened with the same challenges that today's veteransare facing.  In addition to physical health care, we have to do more to help veterans with mental health care. There is a stat that isthrown around all too often that there are more than 20 veterans a day who take their own life. I have known some of them. Icould tell you how that is an unacceptable rate that far exceeds the average of the civilian population. But the fact is, tolose just one veteran from suicide is completely unacceptable.  This is very personal to me. I have seen firsthand the impact that war can have on soldiers returning home, all of whomdaily work through the trauma of having friends whom they are forced to remember who didn't come home with them.  Not a week goes by where I don't get a call from someone who wants to talk about the fact that they want to step in front ofa bus or go to sleep in their garage with the car running and never wake up. Often this call comes after a traumatizingexperience that they have just had at the Department of Veterans  We need to be there for one another, and we need to be there for our veterans. I think often about something that PresidentKennedy once said. He said:[[Page H458]]         The cost of freedom has always been high, but Americanshave      always been willing to pay that price.  Our veterans, they do pay that price. They make tremendous personal sacrifices. But just because they are always going to bethere and they are always willing to make these sacrifices for our freedom, that doesn't mean that we can take their service forgranted, which is exactly what is happening every single time one of our veterans is failed.  I am committed to doing all that I can to increase mental health resources for our veterans and doing anything, whether thatis legislatively or personally, to reduce veteran suicide rates.  But we also have to do more to assist returning veterans in finding jobs and starting new careers once they do exit themilitary. I know that the men and women that I served with were among the most talented and hardworking men and women that Ihave ever met in this entire world.  Veterans know what it is like to work in high-pressure situations, to be held to a standard of excellence. They know thestress of loading their body down with hundreds of pounds of equipment and trekking that across long distances, working togetheras a team. They know what it takes to go out there and get the job done, no matter what challenge is placed in front of them.And they know what it is to not just risk the bottom line, but to actually go out there and put their own life on the line.  Veterans are among the most qualified employees for any position. But veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan,they face an unemployment rate that is substantially higher than the national average. I am committed to working with localbusinesses and community leaders to discuss ways to reverse this troubling trend, as well as supporting legislation that willhelp our veterans use the very unique skills and talents that they have developed for the rest of their life.  Mr.Speaker, following my service in the U.Army, I made a very conscious choice to volunteer with the Israeli DefenseForces because our countries share common ideals of freedom and democracy and mutual respect for all people, something that Iknow firsthand is not common in most of the Middle  During my time in Israel, I served alongside soldiers driven by love for their fellow man rather than by hatred for theirneighbors. I learned with each family that I got to know just how much each family truly desires peace with every neighbor ofIsrael, regardless of their religion or their history with those countries. The same cannot be said of Israel's enemies.  For the United States, the choice is very clear: we either stand with a historic friend and ally who shares our values, orwe cave to groups like the Palestinians or countries like Iran who represent everything that the United States is not.  I have found that the most important time to stand for what is right is when it is the most difficult time to stand for whatis right. This moment in history is no different. We have to be proud of who we are, and we have to stand with those who standwith us and stand against any terrorist regime who seeks to threaten even one of us.  Mr.Speaker, the last thing that I want to say tonight is simply that it is a tremendous honor to have the opportunity toserve the people of Florida's 18th Congressional I know very well that the office that I occupy, it doesn't trulybelong to me. It belongs to those people. And the simple fact is that the status quo has not been good enough for them. Familiesacross the country, they are hurting, and I know that we have a lot of work to do.  I have laid out a number of priorities to help the 18th District and to strengthen our country, but I also know this: theproblems Washington, D.is facing, they cannot just be fixed with bills and laws.  One of the most important lessons that I ever learned in the military, that I ever learned in combat, was that inspirationmatters. Military leaders that I had who displayed courage and valor and selflessness, they drew the exact same thing out ofevery single soldier that surrounded them. And that is my goal as I am here in the Halls of Congress, every day, that I work to,above all, inspire each peer that I have here, Republican and Democrat, to have courage and to make sure that their sense ofduty is to America above anything else, and to make sure that we serve selflessly and, every day that we are given the honor toserve here, to make this country and our communities that much better.

928,topic-id,1509,"Mr.President, we have a longstanding tradition in ourcountry of civilian control of government and civilian control of the military. This was first symbolized by George Washingtonthrough his act of resigning as Commander in Chief for all of the Continental Army on December 23, 1783. It is a tradition, or amoment in time, that is preserved on the walls of the Rotunda where a mural depicts Washington's noble and selfless act.  Ourearly days were full of the warnings of a standing Army and of ongoing military control at high levels, and those ideas camefrom Thomas Jefferson and from Alexander Hamilton and from Samuel When we came to the point in our history where werealized that a continuing military force was necessary, we preserved the importance of civilian control.  We did so for ahost of important reasons, which others have pointed out on this floor but I think are worth restating. It is important to havea Secretary of Defense who brings a broad world view that includes a civilian perspective to the position.  Second, it isimportant not to politicize our officer ranks and have them essentially competing to position themselves to hold this positionof Secretary of  Third, we do not want the services competing against each other in order to hold this position.This is why the Joint Chiefs of Staff position is rotated on a specific schedule. And if we have a Secretary of Defense comefrom one military service, then another branch of service is going to say: Next time it should be our turn. The Marine Corpstoday, the Air Force tomorrow, the Army after that, and then the That is not the position we want to end up in.  Wealso know that across the world, countries wrestle with preserving civilian control; that is, preserving democratic republics inthe face of the power of military machinery in their country, military organizations, and we see military coups and we seemassive military influence.  It has been the desire of our country to model a republic that isof the people, by the people, and for the people, not a nation that becomes controlled by a massive concentration of power inthe military. Now my colleagues--many of whom are very learned in the history of our country--have arisen to say that there is aset of special circumstances, a unique set of circumstances, that merit an exception, and they note that there was an exceptiononce before in our history. That exception was the appointment of George Marshall to become Secretary of Defense in the timefollowing[[Page S306]]World War But think about how many circumstances we face in the world that can be put forward to be anexceptional time. It was exceptional when terrorists used planes to attack the Twin Towers in New York City and our Pentagon,and had not one plane gone down, the additional target may have been the Capitol or the White That was an exceptionalmoment. It is an exceptional moment when we are fighting Al It is an exceptional moment when we are fighting It isan exceptional moment when Russia invades Ukraine and takes over There is an exceptional moment almost continuously inthe face of a complex and changing world.  So I stand on the side of maintaining the principle of civilian control. Each timewe violate this principle, it is easier next time to say: It has been done before. But the conversation will not be ``We did itonce half a century ago, and so we should do it again,'' it will be ``We did it twice, once quite recently when we weren'tfacing a world crisis. Nobody had invaded the United We had not just lost a couple hundred thousand folks fighting forour country in a world war.'' So the conversation will get easier and more fragile, and that is not the direction we should go.  It was Eisenhower who warned about the overreach of a military enterprise--the ``military industrial complex,'' as hereferred to it. But one piece of our structure of government that has held back is to maintain that principle of civiliancontrol. Can anyone in this room rise up and say that out of the thousands of experienced individuals who have both nationalsecurity experience and civilian experience, there isn't one who currently meets either the 10- or 7-year standard ofseparation? I am sure there are hundreds who could meet that standard.  So here we are. If we could send a message to thePresident-elect: We reject your effort to eviscerate civilian control. Send us someone who is qualified. And if we feel thatperson is so far out of the reach of reason--which is what I have been hearing from my colleagues in private conversation,terrified that this President-elect will nominate somebody who basically is unhinged, that we have to seize on this moment totake this individual because this body won't have the courage to turn down and reject an unhinged individual nominated by thisPresident-elect. That is a sad commentary on the leadership of this body. It is a sad commentary on what has become of the U.S.Senate that we wouldn't have the courage under our advice and consent power to turn down someone we saw as unfit. That is, infact, how we are charged under this Constitution, under the advice and consent clause. It was Hamilton who laid out that it isour responsibility to determine whether an individual is of fit character or unfit character, and we would retain that power forany nomination that, in the collective judgment of this body, did not meet that standard.  So let's sustain the principle ofcivilian control and reject this change.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, in response to the Senator from Oregon who asked if there werenot any people who were qualified to serve as Secretary of Defense, I am absolutely certain there are. Is there anyone asqualified as General Mattis? My answer to the Senator from Oregon is no. I have watched General Mattis for years. I have seenthe way that enlisted and officers react to his leadership. I have seen the scholarly approach he has taken to war and toconflict.  I hope the Senator from Oregon will have at some point a chance to get to know him, and he will then appreciatethe unique qualities of leadership that are much needed in these times where the outgoing President of the United States hasleft the world in a state of chaos because of an absolute failure of leadership, which is disgraceful. We now see an outgoingPresident of the United States who in 2009 inherited a world that was not being torn apart in the Middle The Chinese werenot acting assertively in the South China The Russians had not dismembered Ukraine and taken Crimea, in gross violation ofinternational law. All of those things have come about because of his presidency.  So now he comes to the floor and objectsto one of the most highly qualified individuals and leaders in military history. I say to the Senator from Oregon: You arewrong.  I believe the overwhelming majority of this body will repudiate and cancel out his uninformed remarks.  Mr.President, in a few minutes we will vote on a historic piece of legislation. For just the second time in seven decades, thelegislation before us would provide an exception to the law preventing any person from serving as Secretary of Defense within 7years of Active-Duty service as a regular commissioned officer of the Armed This legislation would allow JamesMattis--the President-elect's selection for Secretary of Defense, who retired from the Marine Corps 3 years ago--to serve in thatoffice.  Earlier today, the Senate Armed Services Committee received testimony from General Once again, hedemonstrated exceptional command of the issues confronting the United States, the Department of Defense, and our militaryservicemembers, but he also showed something else--that his understanding of civil-military relations is deep and that hiscommitment to civilian control of the Armed Forces is ironclad.  General Mattis's character, judgment, and commitment todefending our Nation and its Constitution have earned him the trust of our next Commander in Chief, Members of Congress on bothsides of the aisle, and so many who are serving in our Armed General Mattis is an exceptional public servant worthy ofthe exceptional consideration. That is why, directly following the conclusion of today's hearing, the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee reported this legislation to the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 24 to 3--I repeat: with an overwhelmingvote of 24 to 3.  I am not saying that members of the Armed Services Committee are smarter than the Senator from Oregon, butI am saying that members of the Armed Services Committee have scrutinized--both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat,including the ranking member--have looked at General Many of us have known him for years and years, as he has shown theoutstanding characteristics of leadership that he has had the opportunity to display in his service to the country, and he wasvoted out by an overwhelming vote of 24 to 3. So obviously there are 24 people on the Armed Services Committee who believe inGeneral Mattis and believe that this exception should be made, as opposed to 3 who share the view of the Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgS299-2.txt,1900,ELECTING MEMBERS TO CERTAIN STANDINGCOMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE OF,2017.0,12.0,January

Mr.That is why, directly following the conclusion of today's hearing, the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee reported this legislation to the Senate with a vote of 24 to 3. I urge this body to follow suit.  That said, it isimportant for future Senators to understand the context of our action here today. Civilian control of the Armed Forces has beena bedrock principle of American Government since our A painting hanging in the Capitol Rotunda not far from thisfloor celebrates the legacy of George Washington, who voluntarily resigned his commission as commander of the Continental Armyto the This principle is enshrined in our Constitution, which divides control of the Armed Forces among the Presidentas Commander in Chief and the Congress as coequal branches of government.  Since then, Congress has adopted variousprovisions separating military and civilian positions. In the 19th century, for example, Congress prohibited an Army officerfrom accepting a civil office, more recently, in the National Security Act of 1947, and subsequent revisions, Congress's 7-year``cooling off'' period for any person to serve as Secretary of It was only 3 years later, in 1950, that Congressgranted GEN George Marshall an exemption to that law and the Senate confirmed him to be Secretary of  Indeed, theseparation between civilian and military positions has not always been so clear. Twelve of our Nation's Presidents previouslyserved as generals in the Armed Forces, and over the years, numerous high-ranking civilian officials in the Department of[[Page S307]]Defense have had long careers in military service.  The basic responsibilities of civilian and military leaders aresimple enough--for civilian leaders: to seek the best professional military advice while under no obligation to follow it; formilitary leaders: to provide candid counsel while recognizing civilians have the final say or, as General Mattis once observed,to insist on being heard and never insist on being obeyed. But the fact is that the relationship between civilian and militaryleaders is inherently and endlessly complex. It is a relationship of unequals who nonetheless share responsibility for thedefense of the The stakes could not be higher. The gaps in mutual understanding are sometimes wide. Personalities oftenclash. And the unique features of the profession of arms and the peculiarities of service cultures often prove daunting forcivilians who have never served in uniform.  Ultimately, the key to healthy civil-military relations and civilian control ofthe military is the oath that soldiers and statesmen share in common ``to protect and defend the Constitution.'' It is about thetrust they have in one another to perform their respective duties in accordance with our republican system of government. It isabout the candid exchange of views engendered by that trust and which is vital to effective decisionmaking. And it is aboutmutual respect and understanding. The proper balance of civil-military relations is difficult to achieve, and, as history hastaught us, achieving that balance requires different leaders at different times.  I believe that in the dangerous times inwhich we live, General Mattis is the leader our Nation needs as Secretary of That is why, although I believe we mustmaintain safeguards of civilian leadership at the Department of Defense, I will support this legislation today and GeneralMattis' nomination to serve this Nation again as Secretary of  I want to assure my friend from Rhode Island, theranking member of the Armed Services Committee, who has very serious concerns--I want to assure him that this is a one-time deal.I know the Senator from Rhode Island had deep concerns about this whole process we have been through. Yet I think he has put theinterests of the Nation and placed his confidence in General Mattis as being so exceptional that the law that was passed back in1947--there can be made one single exception to it.

Mr.Speaker, I rise to thank the people of Michigan's 10th Congressional I am honored to represent them andhumbled by their trust in electing me to the 115th  The weight of this office is not lost on me. As Majority Leader McCarthy said:       If youwalk on the floor of this House and you don't get      goosebumps, it's time to go home.  Standing here at this podium, I have goosebumps.  People often ask me why I ran for Put simply, I ran with the goal of helping people achieve their American For too many, the idea of the American Dream is just that: an idea, a fantasy, a fairytale.  I believe in the American Dream because I have lived it. I was born in South Boston to a working class family. Opportunitytook my family to Michigan when I was 11. My dad got a good job building trucks on the line at General Motors, and my mom workedat the Salvation My parents worked hard to provide for me and my six younger siblings. I learned the value of hard work ata young age watching my parents.  I was the first of my extended family to go to college and worked full-time to pay for my education; and then I dedicated mycareer to workforce training, helping people build the skills necessary to get good jobs to begin their careers to support theirfamilies. There is something about the pride that comes when someone gets a job. Their whole world changes when they see whatthey are able to achieve and what their work does for their families.  Over the last several years, failed policies and an unstable economy have put the American Dream out of reach for many.Though overall unemployment rates are down, long-term unemployment is high; labor force participation rates have droppeddramatically, and wage growth is anemic.                              {time}  1845  Instead of getting ahead, many Americans are just getting by.  In the November elections, Americans screamed for relief. My message to the people of Michigan's 10th District is that yourvoices have been heard. We are already working here in the House on measures to roll back regulations to support families,businesses, and the economy, and to breathe life back into the American  In order to make it possible for more people to achieve their American Dream, we must give them the freedom and the tools tosucceed. This begins by stemming the extreme regulatory overreach, fixing our healthcare system, and strengthening our workforce[[Page H459]]while restoring our critical infrastructure.  As we have learned in the last 8 years, we cannot regulate our way towards a stronger economy. The opposite is true:government overreach cripples our economy. From my years of running a business, I have firsthand knowledge of how excessiveregulations make it harder to succeed. Time and resources that could be better spent on growing a business and creating jobs arespent navigating a never-ending and confusing maze of Federal regulations.  Many of those regulations have been imposed without a cost-benefit analysis, placing costly burdens on families andbusinesses while providing little benefit. Regulators have exceeded their authority by placing undue burdens on those strugglingto make the economy work.  The House has already acted by passing the REINS Act and the Midnight Rules Relief Each of these measures would putaccountability where it rightly belongs: with the people's elected Representatives in Congress, not with unelected bureaucrats.  We are also reforming health care in American to prevent further harm to families and businesses. Patients and doctorsshould be in charge of their health care, not the government. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed, patient choice andaccess to care has declined while costs are ever increasing.  Despite all of the promises, many people who had plans or doctors they liked could not keep them. Insurance carriers areforced to severely narrow their networks to combat cost.  Our healthcare reform is a better way to increase accessibility and patient choice, in addition to reducing cost. We will dothat by allowing purchase of coverage across State lines, authorizing businesses and individuals to band together to increasepurchasing power and negotiate prices, allowing health savings accounts, and expanding risk pools. Our plan focuses on puttingpower where it belongs: with the people, with the patients.  Government overreach does not stop with our health care. I know that surprises you. The one-size-fits-all approach toeducation legislation in recent years has failed America's students. It is time to put parents and individuals in control oftheir education and give them options that will best suit their needs. I am eager to advance solutions that will help studentslearn and be better equipped for future jobs, to create flexibility for working families and prepare the workforce for a moderneconomy.  In addition to a strong workforce, our modern economy requires a robust infrastructure. It is essential that we protect andstrengthen America's infrastructure to keep Americans safe and create jobs, and I plan to work with this House to do just that.

And like any family, Alaska hasbeen blessed with outstanding sons and daughters, distinguished in their own unique ways.  Today I wish to pay tribute to thememory of one such Alaskan, acclaimed watercolorist Byron Byron's passing on December 4, 2016, just 2 weeks shy of his79th birthday, leaves a hole not just in the hearts of Alaskans, but in the art world itself. Given the indelible impact thatByron's prolific volume of work has had on Alaskans over the last 41 years, it is all the more impressive, considering that helived the first half of his life outside the  Born in Buckeye, Arizona on December 18, 1937, Byron was raised in thesuburbs of Los After graduating with a bachelor's degree in history from Seattle Pacific College in 1959, Byronattended Stanford Following his 1960 marriage to his beloved Lynn, who succumbed to breast cancer in 1998, thecouple set out to travel the world. The couple traveled to Africa to teach English and explored the Pacific, living in AmericanSamoa for a few years. They then returned for a job in Seattle before arriving in Anchorage for a job at an advertising agency,which he soon quit to paint full time.  He recalled that it was 1975, during the pipeline boom that he was painting pictures.``People started buying them so I quit work and started painting.'' Byron painted He later explained to the AnchorageDaily News, ``Alaskans love That's what they want to buy.''  Despite his talent in multiple mediums, includingportraiture and oils, Byron will likely be best remembered for his prolific work in watercolor and landscapes, and, perhapsrightly so, as many of the pieces and prints so familiar to most Alaskans were in that format. His work is so highly regardedthat one of his prints, ``McKinley Moonlight,'' was selected to serve as a background for Alaska's heirloom marriagecertificates. As his wife Billie said, Byron was ``inspired by both the scenic beauty of Alaska and its people.''  AlaskaDispatch News writer David James described Byron's landscapes for a recent book Byron completed this year as ``rich with colorand detail. His summer scenes explode with flowers, animals and sunlight, while his images of winter, where snow covers theground and twilight darkens the sky, are alive with elaborate hues and stellar lighting that belie the notion of Alaska as adesolate wasteland for half the year.''  But I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to highlight for the record thatByron's work was not just the beautiful landscapes that Alaskans love so much. Rather, he helped catalog the history of the 49thAmong the many honors we have as Senators is adorning our offices with artwork that represent our In my case,that includes two of Byron's prints proudly hanging in the hallway leading to my office. While the first is one of histraditional moonlit landscapes, the other is ``Anchorage Land Auction, 1915.'' It features a crowd huddled in what was then nomore than a tent city near Ship Creek, in what would eventually become downtown Byron's painting reminds me not justof those pioneers who ventured to Alaska with the promise of a new life waiting to be carved out of the wilderness but, despitehow far Alaska has come, how much raw potential still remains.  Despite our rich history and heritage, we are a young State,and many of our founding generation has been--and is now--passing from the scene. However, whether through his capturing of the75th Annual Anchorage Fur Rendezvous Festival or ``Fur Rondy,'' featuring Rondy 10-time champion George Attla racing his sleddog team down 4th Avenue, or in his painting the historic devastation to downtown Anchorage following the 1964 earthquake, Byronwas interpreting and memorializing the highs and lows of our history for generations of Alaskans to come.  I can think of nobetter way to end than with Byron's own words about his life: ``A dream come true. That is what Alaska has given to me.Incredible beauty for subject matter, and a receptive public have combined to allow me to do what I love best, painting all day,every day for more than 41 years.''  On behalf of grateful Alaskans and my fellow Senators, I extend my condolences to Billieand Byron's family. With Byron's passing, Alaska has lost a cultural icon, but his substantial body of work lives onforever.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgS310-2.txt,1694,"CONCURRENTRESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,12.0,January

His outstanding career as a player at both institutions earned him a place in the Wilbur Cross Athletic Hall ofFame, and his experience as a standout guard on the UConn football team in 1956 and 1957 helped forge a lasting commitment tohis alma mater and shaped the ethic of teamwork and dedication that would follow him to the Connecticut State  Firstelected to the senate in 1992, Joe's commitment to his constituents and his community has never wavered.

Since the first nomination was announced by President-elect Trump's transition team, phones in my office have been ringingoff the hook; and not a day goes by when I do not hear from my neighbors, friends, and constituents of their angst, frustration,and discontent. I share their anger and dread--that feeling of being punched in the gut--as name after name has been released.Each nomination from President-elect Trump has put the fox in charge of the henhouse.[[Page H463]]  We are not talking about simple differences in partisan ideology. We are talking about nominees who have devoted much oftheir professional lives to undermining the small-d democratic institutions that are the foundation of our country. This newadministration is so extreme that we cannot, in any good faith, give this President-elect the traditional deference to name acabinet that represents his governing philosophy because the appointments show it to be a philosophy that seeks to corrupt, ifnot fully destroy, our institutions, traditions, and values.  Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for Attorney General, was considered too racist to serve on the Federal bench by aRepublican Senate, much less to head the Justice Department, and is someone who has so little respect for women's rights hevoted against the Violence Against Women Act and called Roe v. Wade a colossal mistake.  Ben Carson, the nominee for HUD Secretary, said today in his confirmation hearing that he was against protecting LGBTAmericans from housing discrimination because protecting them from housing discrimination would be granting them extra rights,refusing to recognize that LGBT Americans deserve equal rights.  Tom Price, the nominee for HHS Secretary, wants to eliminate Medicare and Medicaid as we know them, repeal theAffordable Care Act without a second thought for the millions of Americans who would lose coverage or would be subject to limitson preexisting conditions and would be subject to lifetime and annual limits, and has so little understanding of women's healththat he insisted that not a single woman would lose access to contraception if contraception coverage were eliminated.  Betsy DeVos, the nominee for Education Secretary, advocated for years to move taxpayer dollars away from public schools andtowards for-profit, private schools that would leave behind low-income students, minority students, and children withdisabilities.  Scott Pruitt, the nominee for EPA administrator, does not believe in climate change and is so linked to the fossil fuelindustry that he has sued the EPA a dozen times to block environmental regulations designed to protect us from the effects ofclimate change.  The list goes on and on, each more horrifying than the one before. These are not the values the majority of Americans votedfor in November, and I don't just mean because Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million. I cannot imagine that thevoters who wanted to drain the swamp and voted for Mr.Trump for that purpose and have the needs of working people representedare thrilled to see him name the wealthiest cabinet--with the greatest collection of Wall Street insiders--in American history.  The fact is, President-elect Trump and the Republican Party do not have any mandate from the people to carry out thedystopian horror show this cabinet presents. Rather than rubber stamping the most extreme cabinet I have seen in my 25 years inWashington, the Senate should reject these extreme nominees, and then both Houses should do their constitutional duty to conductoversight of the administration.  I am ready to do that work. Over a month ago, along with my Democratic Judiciary Committee colleagues, I sent a letter toChairman Goodlatte asking him to hold hearings on the conflict of interest and ethics provisions that apply to thePresident of the United I have not heard a response. Every Democrat in this House signedon to the Protect Our Democracy Act, legislation to create an independent, bipartisan-appointed commission to investigateRussian hacking in the 2016 election and to make recommendations to ensure nothing like that happens again. It is interestingthat not a single House Republican has joined us.  I join my constituents and millions of Americans in wanting to know why Republicans are working so hard to protectPresident-elect Trump from having to answer questions about Russian influence in this election. Why are Republicans working sohard to support President-elect Trump's extreme and out-of-touch cabinet? Why aren't Republicans asking the same questions abouthow President-elect Trump will avoid conflicts of interest?  I have served in this body for nearly 25 years. I have seen this body take on the big questions of our time--the role ofgovernment in the lives of everyday Americans, the threat of terrorism in the city I call home and around the country, the rightof every American to marry whomever they love, the right of every American to vote free of intimidation, and the right of everyAmerican to make their own healthcare choices. I have seen us come through those battles bruised and battered but stronger.  That is why I refuse to despair. I refuse to put my head down and hide. I refuse to give up on I will stand hereand fight for the country we all believe in. I will do everything in my power to represent the strong progressive values of themen and women who sent me here.

Republicans may claim that women cango elsewhere for the services provided by Planned Parenthood--they've even gone so far as to provide additional funding forCommunity Health Centers to fill the gaps they clearly know this bill will leave behind.

959,topic-id,1684,"Mr.President, fraudulent and abusive phone scams plague thousands of Americans eachyear. These deceitful practices cause serious financial harm to victims, and have even led to tragedy in a few cases. Both theCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where I serve as Ranking Member, and the Special Committee on Aging, where Ipreviously served as Chairman, have explored the continuing severe impact of these scams. Consumers continue to lose millions ofdollars each year to fraudulent phone scams, many of which originate from other countries. And the impacts of these scams arevery real to the consumers who suffer. According to an October 2015 press report from CNN, one poor soul took his life earlierthat year after being tricked into spending thousands of dollars in a vain attempt to collect on his winnings in the Jamaicanlottery--winnings that were non-existent because it was all a scam perpetrated by phone-based fraudsters.  Nearly all of ushave trained ourselves to ignore phone calls and text messages from numbers that are not familiar to us. But these sophisticatedscammers know that--and have changed their tactics. Scammers today impersonate government institutions, promote fraudulentlottery schemes, and tailor their calls to individuals in order to coerce victims into paying large sums of money. Many scammersuse spoofing technology to manipulate caller ID information and trick consumers into believing that these calls are local orcome from trusted institutions.  In 2009, I introduced the Truth in Caller ID Act to prohibit caller ID spoofing when it isused to defraud or harm consumers. That law provided important tools for law enforcement and the Federal CommunicationsCommission, FCC, to go after fraudsters and crack down on these phone scams. I was pleased when my Congressional colleaguesjoined with me to pass that legislation and the President signed it into law. This was a huge win for consumers and the firststep toward ending these abusive practices.  Recognizing the pace at which phone scam technologies evolve, the law directedthe FCC to prepare a report to Congress outlining what additional tools were needed to curb other forms of spoofing. In 2011,the agency provided its recommendations to Congress on how to update the law to keep pace with new spoofing practices, such astext messaging scams.  The bill Senators Fischer, Klobuchar, Blunt and I have introduced today responds to theFCC's recommendations and builds on the 2010 Act to ensure the law keeps up with these spoofing scams. As these scams becomeincreasingly sophisticated, we need to make sure that consumer protections and tools for law enforcement[[Page S318]]keep up. That iswhy this legislation is so important.  The Spoofing Prevention Act of 2017 would extend the current prohibition on caller IDspoofing to text messages, calls coming from outside the United States, and calls from all forms of Voice over Internet  Additionally, for the first time, this bill would ensure consumers have access to information on a centralized FCCwebsite about current technologies and other tools available to protect themselves against spoofing scams.  Finally, the Actdirects the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to conduct a study to assess government and private sector work being done tocurb spoofing scams, as well as what new measures, including technological solutions, could be taken to prevent spoofed callsfrom the start. I know industry, in cooperation with the FCC through its Robocall Strike Force, already is making great stridesin this area, and I would expect the GAO to review that work closely.  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Fischer,Klobuchar, Blunt, and me in supporting the Spoofing Prevention Act of 2016 to ensure that law enforcement andconsumers have the updated tools they need to protect against this fraudulent activity. And make no mistake, I will press theFCC to continue to use its full authority under the Truth in Caller ID Act to stop these scams, including consideration oftechnical solutions--like call authentication--to protect consumers.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text ofthe bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in theRecord, as follows:                                 134       Be it enacted by theSenate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

73,topic-id,957,"Mr.Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 40, providing for theconsideration of two important pieces of legislation: H.238, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, and H.78, the SECRegulatory Accountability  The rule provides for the consideration of these measures under a structured rule and makes in order any amendment submittedto the House Rules Committee, including all five Democratic amendments to H.78, as well as all eight amendments submitted forH.238, allowing for a balanced debate on these very substantial issues.  H.238 is essential to the smooth functioning of the American economy and is long overdue for enactment into law. Thisimportant legislation reauthorizes until 2021 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, also known as the CFTC, which had itsstatutory authority lapse in 2013. The House passed the Commodity End-User Relief Act with bipartisan support in the 114thCongress, and a similar bill was also adopted in the 113th Congress, establishing a strong record of bipartisan support for thismeasure. Unfortunately, in both instances, the Senate failed to take up the legislation before the end of its respectiveCongress, which is why it is imperative that we pass this bill through both Chambers and send it to the President's desk.  After the financial crisis of 2008, practically everyone agreed that changes needed to be made to our financial servicessector in order to protect families, farmers, small businesses, and our economy, as well as to prevent another crisis in thefuture. Like many of my colleagues, I have concerns with some of the reforms that were instituted in response to the crisisbecause they have put overly burdensome restrictions and regulations on our economy and our business communities. But like everymajor, comprehensive law, there are always unintended consequences that need to be addressed, and H.238 does exactly that.  For example, the authors of Dodd-Frank argued the law's main purpose was to reduce systemic risk to our economy. However, Idon't think anyone would argue that farmers who are simply trying to lock in a good price for their corn or their wheat are asystemic risk to the economy. Similarly, restaurant chains looking to make sure they have enough beef, enough pork, or enoughpotatoes to sell to their customers don't pose a systemic risk, just as utility companies seeking to ensure that they haveadequate power supplies to meet the needs and demands of their ratepayers did not cause the financial crisis. Unfortunately, thecurrent law imposes rules that treat all of these entities as major risks to our economy, and it imposes overly burdensomecapital and paperwork requirements on them.  Mr.Speaker, critics may claim that this bill undermines consumer protections. However, this could not be further from thetruth.  Title I of the legislation puts in place greater consumer protections, like requiring brokerage firms to notify investorsbefore moving funds from one account to another in order to prevent abuses like those that occurred at MF Global prior to itsbankruptcy.  Title II makes reforms to the CFTC and strengthens the cost-benefit analysis the Commission must perform when consideringthe impacts of its rules. Opponents have claimed that requiring cost-benefit analyses will open up the CFTC to lawsuits.However, H.238 merely gives the CFTC a standard for writing good rules the first time, which will be a benefit for all of us.  Title III provides relief to the farmers, the restaurants, the manufacturers, the utilities, and other entities which relyon a steady supply of commodities and inherently want to avoid risk but have been caught up in the unintended consequences ofthe Dodd-Frank reforms. These users have a genuine need to use markets to hedge against bad weather, natural disasters,inflation, price shocks, and other unforeseen circumstances that could jeopardize their ability to serve their customers.  The rule also provides for the consideration of H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability This legislation replacesguidance adopted by the SEC in 2012 that currently governs the use of economic analysis in SEC rulemakings and requires the SECto identify and assess the significance of problems prior to regulating. It directs the agency to conduct a review of existingregulations within 1 year of enactment--and then every 5 years thereafter--to determine the sufficiency, the effectiveness, andthe burdens associated with their implementation. Further, H.78 instructs the SEC's Chief Economist to conduct a cost-benefitanalysis on regulations the agency is promulgating as well as to provide an explanation describing the SEC's decision-makingprocess, including the implications of not taking the regulatory action.  Economic analysis is the cornerstone of prudent rulemaking and entails evaluating the qualitative and quantitative costs andbenefits of proposed regulations as well as potential alternatives in order to determine the correct action an agency shouldtake. We must ensure Federal regulators are thoroughly assessing both the need for the regulation and adequately evaluating itspotential consequences--intended as well as unintended--to prevent small businesses and job creators from being unnecessarilyburdened by onerous Federal regulations.  Mr.Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the consideration of twobills that will hold Federal agencies and their rulemaking processes accountable to the American people. Voters sent a clearmessage in November that they want a Federal Government that is smaller, less intrusive, and more discerning in its regulatoryactions. House Republicans created our A Better Way agenda by listening to Americans about the ideas for our Nation, and thenew, unified Republican government will continue our work to change the status quo and provide real progress for all Americans.The adoption of this rule and the passage of the underlying bills is yet another opportunity to show that we heard this messageloud and clear and that we will reinforce our commitment to restoring the people's voice in our Federal  I am proud to support the rule providing for the consideration of these measures, and I urge my colleagues to support therule and the underlying bills.

It is signed, like I said, by over two dozen organizations.  I include in the Record the letter I received this morning, I think, as did my colleague, Representative Polis,from over two dozen agricultural groups and associations located throughout the country in unanimous support of H.238.

82,topic-id,1424,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I certainly appreciate the discussion over the past few minutes. I believe that this rule and the underlyingbills are strong measures that are important to the future of our country.  This rule provides for ample debate on the floor, the opportunity to consider and vote on both H.238 and H.78, as wellas every amendment that was submitted to the House Rules Committee, which reflects the balanced, open, and deliberative processafforded by this rule.  H.238 is a solid, substantial measure that will address several critical issues that the CFTC and end user are facing,while also addressing the CFTC's lapsed reauthorization with reauthorizing the Commission through 2021. While some opponentshave called for an open rule, this structured rule makes all eight submitted amendments in order.  Mr.Speaker, no one wants to see complete deregulation of our financial services industries and our commodities andderivatives markets. However, it is critical that the regulations put in place are appropriate for our economy and our users.These rules have to provide safeguards and prevent systemic risk but should not hinder our entire economy with one-size-fits-allregulations.  As we have discussed today, the current rules place enormous compliance and financial burdens on small businesses, onfarmers and ranchers, utilities, and manufacturers. They take these small, risk-averse entities and place them under the sameregulatory scheme as large financial institutions and hedge funds. H.238 will differentiate and exempt the end users who arenot a cause of systemic risk--as these entities inherently want to avoid risk--and, thus, shouldn't be subject to the same rulesand requirements as financial and investment firms that are less risk averse in nature.  The Commodity End-User Relief Act would make much-needed reforms at the CFTC to strengthen their rulemaking process and addcommonsense consumer protections so these regulations are not a continual burden on ourNation's farmers and small businesses.  Mr.Speaker, the rule also provides for consideration of H.78 under a structured rule and makes all five Democraticamendments in order. This legislation takes important steps to engrain a stronger commitment to economic analysis at the SEC,which will facilitate the promulgation of reasonable rules that do not unduly burden registered companies or negatively impactjob creation. The measure will increase transparency and oversight, while facilitating additional analysis and reviews ofexisting regulations, which should be something that all Members of this body can support.  As elected Representatives, I believe we must ensure our regulatory framework is not politicized and that Federal regulatorsare thoroughly assessing both the need for the regulation as well as adequately evaluating its potential consequences. This billtakes important steps towards achieving all of these goals.  It is important to remember that the financial crisis was not caused by the farmer who grows the food you eat for dinner, orby the utility you buy electricity from, or by the people who provide the wood in your desk or the metal used in your car. Idon't know of any reason why we should continue to treat them as if they were responsible, which is what the current law doesand is what H.238 seeks to correct.  Further, better informing the American people of the true impact of major regulations does nothing to diminish the abilityof regulators to adequately address illegal or inappropriate activities but, rather, increases transparency and the efficacy ofFederal rules, which is why passage of H.78 is so critical both to our constituents and to our economy.  Mr.Speaker, this is a strong rule that provides for open and fair consideration of these vital pieces of legislation aswell as every amendment that[[Page H321]]was submitted to the House Rules I am proud to speak in favor of this rule, and Iurge all of my colleagues to support House Resolution 40 and both of the underlying bills.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 40 Offered by Mr.Polls       At the end of the resolution,add the following new      sections:       6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant toclause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union forconsideration of the bill (H.     371) to address financial conflicts of interest of the      President and Vice The firstreading of the bill      shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debateshall be      confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally      divided and controlled by the Majority Leader and theMinority      Leader or their respective designees. After general debate      the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-     minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the      bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the      bill foramendment the Committee shall rise and report the      bill to the House with such amendments as may have been      adopted. The previousquestion shall be considered as ordered      on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without      intervening motion exceptone motion to recommit with or      without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to noresolution on the bill, then on      the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after      the third daily order of businessunder clause 1 of rule XIV,      resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       7.Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.371.                                  ____         The Vote onthe Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a specialrule, is not merely a procedural vote. A      vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against      the Republican majorityagenda and a vote to allow the      Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should bedebating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on      theprevious question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made bythe Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before theCannon cites the Speaker's ruling of      January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain thedemand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. OnMarch 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a memberof the opposition rose to a      parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon(R-Illinois) said: ``The      previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New      York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked thegentleman to yield to      him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``thevote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and]has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to      theRepublican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135).Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible toamend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, thesame result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . When the      motion for the previous question isdefeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member,because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler'sProcedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to orderthe previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment andfurther debate.''      (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon      rejection of the motion for the previous question ona      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question,who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previousquestion on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose theRepublican majority's      agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

999,topic-id,603,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend from Georgia for yielding me this time to speak on these important issues.  Mr.Speaker, the opportunity to speak on this important rule that provides consideration for the fiscal year 2017 budgetresolution and 84, which provides a legal exception for General Mattis to serve as Secretary of Defense, certainly areimportant issues. As a member of the House Rules Committee, I am very proud to support this rule as well as both of theunderlying measures.  84 provides a one-time exemption on behalf of an individual who is uniquely qualified to serve during a very challengingperiod in our Nation's history and a time when U.national security and military readiness is of paramount importance for bothAmericans and our allies around the world.  This legislation does not permanently change the law nor does it diminish the founding principle of civilian control of ourmilitary. In fact, this rule allows for consideration of legislation providing for a one-time exemption that does exactly theopposite. It reinforces the doctrine of civilian control of our military. By setting into motion this unique procedure, thepeople's elected representatives are taking the seriousness of this circumstance to heart, to debate and carefully weighgranting a historic exception, only provided on one other occasion in our history.  The man at the center of this matter demonstrates the extraordinary nature of the situation we currently face. General Mattis has served our Nation with unparalleled distinction over the past 40-plus years. Born in Pullman, Washington, GeneralMattis grew up in my congressional district, the Fourth District of the State of He attended what was then ColumbiaHigh School, now Richland High, and graduated from Central Washington  It was growing up along the banks of the Columbia River in Richland where General Mattis' parents instilled in him a deeppassion for reading, which then developed into a renowned lifelong devotion to intellectualism, military and world history, andthe study of war.  General Mattis has been in command at increasing levels throughout his career within the United States Marine Corps, wherehe began as a student enrolled in ROTC, rose to the rank of general, and served as commander of the United States CentralCommand responsible for American military operations in the Middle East, Northeast Africa, and Central Few individualscommand the respect and admiration General Mattis has earned amongst the troops, national security experts, and military andcivic leaders.  This rule allows for the consideration of legislation to provide the United States Senate its proper role of advice andconsent regarding the nomination of General Mattis to serve as our next Secretary of                              {time}  0945  I urge my colleagues to support this rule so the Senate can rightfully provide its constitutional guidance, which I amconfident will overwhelmingly support this distinguished leader and public servant from the great State of  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I lost my right eye a few years ago to complications from      ROP, too much oxygen at birth, and my left eye isseverely      impaired with potential for complications that would need      immediate specialized care.

I      paid these fees and sacrificedother luxuries in life so I      could get the care I needed with the doctors I wanted. They      are the best doctors in their respectivefields, and my trust      in them is important with this type of care.

There will never be a replacement because they don't have the votes for it. The Republicans areideologues. They don't believe we should regulate insurance companies or help people pay for their premiums, so they can neversupport a replacement plan that would do these things.  The ACA is a market-based plan to deal with the healthcare crisis that we faced 8 years ago. More and more people didn'thave health insurance. Insurance companies wouldn't sell them health insurance if they had a preexisting condition like cancer.People were paying more and more out of pocket, and the fact of the matter is that we stepped in in a practical way, not becausewe were ideologues, because we were looking at the situation practically to help people.  What did we do? We provided 20 or 30 million people who didn't have insurance with insurance.

I am so proud of him and his leadership as the ranking memberon the Budget  I am so sorry that the Speaker left the floor because I have some very good news for him. Clearly, he does not understandwhat the Affordable Care Act has brought to our country in terms of expanding benefits, lowering costs, and expanding the accessof many more people to the promise of our founders, of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, a healthier life, and thefreedom to pursue their happiness.  I understand why the Speaker may want to concentrate on some mythology that he presented about the Affordable Care Act,because he is not going to focus on what this bill on the floor does today, and the Republican budget. It does not create moregood-paying jobs, or raise wages. It does not invest in infrastructure to rebuild our  The Republican plan does not invest in the education of our children or the lifetime learning of working people. It does nothelp Americans find balance between work and family. It does not reduce the deficit. In fact, it increases the deficit. And itdoes not seek to drain the swamp of secret money from our elections.  Instead, the Republicans are feeding their ideological obsession with repealing the ACA and dismantling the health andeconomic security of hardworking families.  We all know that a budget should be a statement of our values. What is important to us as a nation should be reflected inour budget proposals. I always say: Show me your values, show me your budget.  Well, you heard me say some of what this budget does not do. As we get further into the next stage of the budget, we willsee that what their budget does is just broaden, widen the disparity in income in our country, give tax breaks to the high end.And part of their tax breaks for the high end is to repeal the Affordable Care Act so they can eliminate the tax on those whoare helping to fund the Affordable Care  So let me just talk about the Affordable Care Act for a while, because one of the things that the public should know is thatthe ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid, are now wed. If you mess with the ACA, it directly impacts these other important initiatives,Medicare and  The Republicans have never supported They opposed it at its origin and, over time, continued to oppose it.                              {time}  1230  In the nineties, their Speaker, Newt Gingrich, said Medicare should wither on the vine. Their Speaker, Paul Ryan, hasin his budget removing the guarantee of Medicare for our seniors. Remove the guarantee. That means you get a voucher and you goshop for Medicare in this nonexistent health plan that they put forth.  Republicans talk about how they are going to repeal and replace. It is interesting illustratively, but not realistic interms of the fact that, for 6 years, they have had a chance to propose an alternative. We have seen nothing.  What we have seen is cut and run. They want to cut benefits and run. They want to cut savings and run. They want to cutaccess and run. They want to cut Medicare and run. They want to cut Medicaid and run. The list goes on and on. They want to cutjobs. We will lose 3 million jobs if they have their way with their nonexistent cut-and-run plan on the Affordable Care  Let's talk about the relationship between ACA and Medicare and Hospitals will be devastated under the ACA repealbecause they will be left with uncompensated care.  One of the challenges to hospitals was that they must care for people who come in and don't have the ability to pay. Withthe Affordable Care Act, we now take care of that. That alleviates the cost to corporate America or those who are providinghealth benefits to their workers, adding between $1,000 and $3,000 a year per policy because they are carrying the uncompensatedcare cost. The Affordable Care Act alleviates that.  The reality is, as Mr.Neal, our new ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, has said, Medicaid is now a healthprogram that crosses the economic spectrum. It is not just for the poor. People think of Medicaid as a poor peopleinitiative--no. It enables mothers to work their way out of poverty by providing affordable coverage for their children--yes.  It enables people with disabilities to get the care needed to live and work in the community, and it provides criticalnursing home care for middle class elderly who have spent down their savings and have no other alternatives. As Mr.Nealsays, Grandma is going to be living in the guest room or in the attic or in the basement if you cannot have nursing home care.  This is very important to families because we want a budget that enables people to have good-paying jobs, increase theirpaycheck so that they can afford their home, address the aspirations of their children, and have a dignified retirement. If theyhave to care for their aging parents, they do less for[[Page H502]]their children. This assault on Medicaid is an assault on thefinancial stability of families across the board, whatever their age.  Furthermore, Medicaid is one of best tools to fight addiction. We made a big deal about our opioid legislation. Americanswho previously did not have access to health care and, therefore, self-medicated with opioids and other painkillers are able toaccess diagnosis, treatment, and pain management. Medicaid provides real care for the addiction and underlying condition to turnfor the better for individuals and their families and the community. The list goes on and on.  The jobs issue. In most of your communities, healthcare providers, hospitals, et cetera, are the biggest employers. Theywon't be anymore. Millions of jobs will be lost.  Mr.Pallone, our ranking member on Energy and Commerce, another committee of jurisdiction, keeps making that point. Whyare you being, he says, ideological about this when the practical effect is about the economic security of our families? I thankMr.Pallone for that.  Mr.Bobby Scott, the ranking member on the Education and the Workforce Committee shows what happens to States if youoverturn the Affordable Care In his own State of Virginia, he can give testimony to the increased cost to the State or lackof meeting the healthcare needs of constituents.  The ACA guards and strengthens the health care and economic security of every American, no matter where he or she getshealth insurance. It delivers transformational progress in terms of coverage, quality, and cost.  Much has been said about the fact that more than 20 million people now have access to affordable health care. This is awonderful and remarkable thing, but that is only part of the story.  Every American who has access to health care benefits from this. Most Americans receive their health benefits in theworkplace. If you do, you now cannot be discriminated against because of a preexisting medical condition.  You cannot be discriminated against if you are a woman. No longer is being a woman a preexisting medical condition, whichmeans you paid more if you are a woman.  No longer can the insurance companies levy lifetime limits for a preexisting condition that you may have or even for thecare that you are getting on a new basis. The list goes on and on.  Do you know how many people have a preexisting medical condition? There are 100 million families affected by preexistingconditions, such as if your child is born prematurely.  I, myself, have five children. Long ago, insurance companies said to me: You are a poor risk because you have had fivechildren. I said: I thought that was a sign of my strength. I didn't know that you were measuring it as a weakness.  Any excuse would have done, but not with the Affordable Care It stands there as a pillar of economic and healthsecurity. It stands there as a pillar of economic security like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which, again, theRepublicans and Newt Gingrich opposed in the 1990s and said would wither on the vine. In his budget, Paul Ryan takes awaythe guarantee. But it is a pillar of economic and health security.  So the proposal today increases the deficit, does not create jobs,undermines the health security of the American people, and does not do much in any regard to address the challenges I posed inthe beginning. It is no wonder they want to talk about the Affordable Care They have nothing to recommend in their budgetresolution.  The GOP's repeal plan will raise premiums. Mr.Chairman, the rate of growth of healthcare costs in our country has beengreatly diminished by the Affordable Care In the more than 50 years that they have been measuring the rate of growth, ithas never been slower than now.  Repeal will create chaos that will echo in the health coverage and costs of every Chaos is the order of the dayfor them.  The American people will not be dragged back to the days when an illness or injury meant financial ruin, that you might notget a job because someone in your family was ill and was going to raise the cost of health care in a company that might hireyou, that you could lose your home. Most bankruptcies spring because of not being able to pay medical bills.  In short, we will not allow the Republicans to make America sick again. I urge a ``no'' vote on this unfortunate resolution.

149,topic-id,178,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. This amendment will prohibit Federal agencies from usingtaxpayer dollars to advocate on behalf of a rule or generate comments to overwhelm the record with one point of view.  A GAO report documents how the EPA created a campaign to generate comments in support of the waters of the U.S., or theWOTUS rule. This is not how government, or the rulemaking process, should work.  The comment period should be a time for agencies to hear from the public about what is good, what is bad, and what needs tobe fixed with a proposed rule. In my opinion, agencies too often take laws passed by Congress and then turn them into somethingthat is unrecognizable.

I urge Members to consider this whendeciding how to vote on the amendments that will be debated here on the floor.

I ask my Republican friends: When will Main Street take priority over Wall Street?  I also take issue with the various provisions of this bill that will both slow the agency's work and create new avenues forcostly and lengthy legal battles.  By the way, implementing these provisions will cost the Commission an additional $45 million over the next 5 years and willrequire an additional 30 full-time employees.

702,topic-id,313,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment contains several troubling drafting--some people call them--errors or, I guess,questions. It prevents the CFTC from enforcing noncompliance with the final rule that includes more forms than were targeted.  When we did our part of the Dodd-Frank bill, one of the things that I thought was really not controversial was that we weregoing to try to find out, once and for all, who owned all of these swaps; who was on what side of positions. This is what causedthe problem in the first place with the financial meltdown. When Lehman Brothers went down and we allowed them to go broke, itcreated this big panic, AIG didn't know if they could cover their swaps or not, and it was going to unravel the whole situationbecause these firms that were trading didn't know who held what and what was going on. That was the underlying problem. So whatwe were trying to do is get some understanding of where everybody was in this market. When we were doing the bill, we made itvery clear, and I put in the legislation, that end users were not covered. That shouldn't have been an issue.  The problem with this amendment is it looks like it is going to include more than just that. So, I guess, again, this is afinal example in this bill of a process moving too quickly and a lack of regular order.  Finally, it contains a section on foreign privacy laws that could result in the agencies seeing a reduced scope of market intheir surveillance activities that may not be the intention. But, again, without the chance to consider this provision inregular order, we are not sure, and concerns that some people have remain unaddressed. So this could have been resolved duringthe process. It hasn't been. In its present form, I oppose the amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH404-6.txt,910,NOT ATTENDING INAUGURATION,2017.0,12.0,January

634,topic-id,291,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.238 and express my concerns with the process and theneed for this legislation at this time.  As we all know, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent Federal regulatory agency that, after the 2008financial crisis, took on more responsibility to bring[[Page H409]]greater transparency and oversight to the multihundred-trillion-dollar derivatives market.  This new bill, H.238, has new mandates and steps in it which will force the Commodity Futures Trading Commission toredirect funding from its core mission to satisfy some of the new mandates within this rule.  H.238 sets a flat reauthorization level of $250 million per year for the next 5 years, despite the annual average budgetrequests of the agency of well over $300 million since passage of Dodd-Freezing the funding level makes the new rulesalmost impossible to enforce. While we understand the need for the end users, the work of this group must go forward.  This punitive level effectively caps the CFTC budget and is a substantial departure from past reauthorization languageproviding for such funding as may be necessary for CFTC to carry out its expanded authorities under Dodd- H.238 will make it more difficult for CFTC to function and stifles its ability to respond quickly to the rapidly changingmarkets it regulates.  I thank Chairman Conaway for having allowed us in the last Congress to have many hearings and discussions about thisbill; but we have not even, as a matter, organized the Agriculture Committee in the 115th Congress to bring this matter to thefloor at this time. Therefore, the substance of the bill, as well as the process by which it is coming to this floor, are to bequestioned at this time.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the bill.

74,topic-id,955,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman for the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bills.  I start by, again, mentioning the fact that we have before us, under this rule, H.238, the Commodity End-User Relief Act,and H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability I will talk about them in a minute.  There are 56 Members of this body who are new Members and who had no chance to participate in marking up[[Page H318]]these billsin their committees of jurisdiction. Sure, I am back and Mr.Newhouse is back, but 56 people who were in that Congress inDecember are not here now, and there are 56 new people.  Again, a regular order process would allow these bills to go through committee and have ideas and the participation fromDemocrats and Republicans, who represent, collectively, tens of millions of people in this country, in improving these bills. Wedid not allow it. These bills just appeared fait accompli in the Rules Committee yesterday. Here we are on the floor. None ofthe new Members had a chance in their committees to offer them.                              {time}  1245  In fact, I am not sure where the Republicans are in their process, but Democrats are still finalizing our committeeassignments. We have some of them, and the rest will be completed shortly.  For Congress to work well, we need to have regular order. And for regular order to work, we need to make sure that the 56new Members who represent tens of millions of people are not disenfranchised in this process.  Now, getting to the bills. H.238, the Commodities End-User Relief Act, has been brought to the floor even before theAgriculture Committee convened or held its organizing meeting. It reauthorizes the Commodities Futures Trading Commissionthrough 2021. It makes a lot of changes to internal changes and modifies a number of provisions that were designed to preventfinancial meltdowns.  Additionally, H.238 includes language on issues that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has already addressedthrough its own efforts. For example, the Commodities Future Trading Commission has acted on 16 of 22 provisions in titles I andParticularly, many of us are concerned by the cross-border language in the bill, which would undercut efforts alreadyunderway by the Commission to negotiate an international system of safe and robust derivative rules.  H.238 would actually require the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to create a rule that would automatically allowU.banks and foreign banks conducting business in the U.to do so under the rules imposed by foreign jurisdictions, whichcan be substantially different than those of our own, removing the confidence in the marketplace that is needed for a commoditymarket to work.  Finally, as you know, Congress passed a number of reforms to enable regulators to respond quickly to changing markets. Theprovisions in title II would weaken the CFTC's ability to respond in a timely and effective manner.  The financial services industry continues to innovate. It is important that regulators keep pace and prevent systemic risks,prevent meltdowns, prevent bailouts. This bill would make it harder to do that.  An example of how the Commission is engaged with and talking about innovation is how to fully embrace emerging technologieslike blockchain and decentralized distribution ledgers. They are doing that because many financial firms are focusing on how toincorporate this technology into their business models. Therefore, it is imperative the Commission is given the ability to stayinvolved and understand the implications of new technology and innovations and is not hamstrung by this overly prescriptive law.  Now, the Commission does need reauthorization, and I would love the opportunity to work with my colleagues on the other sideto do so. It should be in a thoughtful, bipartisan manner that gives the agency the ability it needs to effectively look atincredibly complicated financial transactions, make sure that consumers and users of commodities that hedge their risks are notabused in the process. We do not want to hamstring the agency by unnecessary and counterproductive requirements as this billdoes.  The other bill, H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, also was brought forward before the Financial ServicesCommittee got organized. This bill was not even considered by the House last Congress, and it stalled in the Financial So you actually have a bill that didn't even clear committee last I was complaining about how the 56Members that are new to this body didn't have a chance to put their imprint on the first bill. The second bill didn't even makeit through the Financial Services Committee and didn't even pass the House floor last session. Yet, here it is without theappropriate committee consideration, depriving new Members representing tens of millions of Americans--Democratic andRepublican--the ability to improve this bill.  Under the guise of regulation changes, H.78 would actually require the SEC to conduct enhanced cost-benefit analysis inorder to ensure that benefits of their regulation justify the cost. In effect, the bill directs the SEC to look at things likemarket liquidity and small businesses, which, of course, it already does as part of its economic analysis. So, again, it is abill that would bury the SEC in regulatory paperwork.  H.78's cost-benefit analysis is weighted toward helping large financial institutions save money. I support reducing costsfor financial institutions. Who wouldn't? But that is not the primary drive of our regulatory structure. We should put consumersand our systemic risks first and foremost and, of course, where we can reduce the unnecessary costs for our financialinstitutions in the hope that those would be passed along to those they serve.

He was the longest serving county judge in the 18th Judicial That includes Florida's Brevard and Seminole Counties.Judge Majeed, or A.as many of us know him, was born in the former British colony of Guyana, South America, to parents whowere descendants of indentured servants from  Having grown up in a small village, his family didn't have much, and they worked hard for what little they did have. A.B.cherished the opportunity to attend and graduate from high school.  In 1969, he came to the United States on a student visa. He was Phi Beta Kappa and graduated magna cum laude from HowardUniversity here in Washington, D.In 1975, A.graduated from the Catholic University of America's Columbus Law  Alli became a U.citizen on November 16, 1979, and began his legal career working as an attorney and supervisor atCommunity Legal Services in Philadelphia, where he served the needy and indigent clients. He went on to work as a criminalattorney, assistant public defender, and assistant State attorney.  I knew A.before he was appointed as a county judge in 1993 by then-Governor Lawton Chiles to fill a vacancy and wassubsequently reelected to new terms unopposed all but one time. Once on the bench, Judge Majeed became known as a competent andrespected judge.  He also became well known for his motivational and educational talks about the importance of jury duty to groups of newjurors, many of whom show up disenchanted about being selected to serve. As someone who has been a juror and has heard his talkfirsthand more than once, I can promise you that it is extraordinary. No one in my pool of jurors looked forward to being calledfor jury duty, but after Judge Majeed's patriotic, uplifting, and inspiring lesson, everyone became enthusiastic about theopportunity to serve.  ``We take an oath to obey, preserve, and protect the Constitution of the United States of America,'' said Judge  To the Majeed family, this oath is serious business. He has three nephews who have served in our Nation's Armed Forces:Steve Majeed, U.Navy; Rick Majeed, United States Air Force; and Omar Majeed, United States  ``I love this country,'' he said. ``We believe deeply in it.''  In his letter of resignation to the chief justice of the State of Florida, Judge Majeed penned these words: ``I am beholdento the United States of America who opened her doors to me as a twenty two year old, on a student visa. She allowed me to dreamthe impossible dream, then showed me the way to make those dreams come true.  ``Serving the public, interacting with the Bar, and my many judicial colleagues have left me with a sense of accomplishmentbeyond my loftiest dreams.  ``As I tender my resignation my heart is filled with great joy of twenty four years of judicial distance well run. Withcredit to President Lincoln, I go forth from this place with malice towards none and charity towards all.''  Judge Majeed was elected president of all of the county judges in the State of He has dedicated much of hisnoncourtroom hours to civic activities motivating and educating the public on the virtues of the United States Constitution andour democratic  Alli Majeed is the father of three daughters and one son. His wife, Yasmin Majeed, is very active in community andcharitable causes throughout our community.

195,topic-id,435,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment is about transparency and accountability. I rise to urge my colleagues to support it.  When an agency decides to write a rule or revise an old one, they are sometimes required to share technical or scientificinformation to support their proposal. For many years, scientific research has relied upon the peer review process to ensurequality, integrity, and objectivity of published work. Peer review is when scientists open their research to the scrutiny ofother experts in their field in order to receive feedback, criticism, and ensure their conclusions are sound.  Unfortunately, when peer reviews of information return unfavorable comments or raise unforeseen issues with the quality ofwork, some agencies have acted to silence or hide the critiques. This, of course, is bad science, and it results in bad publicpolicy.  A recent example of this abuse occurred during a highly technical rulemaking proceeding in which an agency relied heavilyupon a single study that many criticized as profoundly inadequate. The agency commissioned two peer reviews of the study, whichwere completed and returned 2 weeks into the comment period for the public. However, after both scholars submitted highlycritical reviews that echoed the concerns of the many commentators, sadly, the agency withheld the release of their work to thepublic. When the agency finally did release the information as required by law, it was on the Friday that marked the very lastday of the comment period as part of a massive document dump that buried the negative reviews.  The political cherry-picking of scientific information and manipulation of the public record harms both the quality ofFederal regulations as well as the overall integrity of the rulemaking proceeding. When Federal agencies distribute scientificresearch supporting a proposed rule, the public and those affected by it deserve to be certain that the science is of thehighest quality and have a due process right to comment meaningfully on the rules the science intends to support.  My amendment will help protect this basic principle of good government and ensure fairness in Federal rulemaking byrequiring that the public be provided with a clear timeline for disclosure of any influential scientific information. Theamendment will also require agencies to offer an explanation if they revise the anticipated public release date of peer reviews.Simply put, the Federal agency will no longer be able to shield from the public view the existence of information that iscentral to evaluating a proposed rule.  We cannot continue to allow the Federal agencies to march toward a predetermined outcome at the expense of sound science andpolicy. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,1915,SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,2017.0,11.0,January

We collected 4 years' worth of Daily Registers in my office. Those are executive orders, rules, proposed rules, changes torules. I ask people how big they think the stack is. I get answers 4 feet, 6 feet, 7 feet. Well, actually, in 4 years' time, thestack was 7 stacks over my head--over 70 linear feet of laws made by unelectable, unaccountable people.  The public thinks we make the laws. Most of the laws we don't make. We allow unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to makethe laws; and the very least we can do to protect the public is ensure that we have transparency and accountability for theirprocedures, and that is exactly what this amendment does.  Mr.Chairman, before I close, I include in the Record a letter from a leading policy research institution thathighlights the need for legislation like my amendment that will improve the public peer review process in our         Phoenix Center for Advanced Legal & Economic Public            PolicyStudies,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.     Re Republic Peer     Speaker Paul Ryan,     Washington,    Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority LeaderPelosi: As both of you      know first-hand, developing and implementing good public      policy is no easy task. The issues beforeregulatory agencies      are often complex and technical, and therefore resolution      benefits from input from the best minds both inand out of      government. Yet, simply because someone writes a lengthy      report on a particular topic does not automatically meanthat      their analysis is valid. No presumption of scientific      legitimacy can be afforded when making good public policy.      Instead,if policymakers are going to rely on a particular      study, then that study deserves to be critiqued first via      public peer reviewin a dispassionate manner to see if the      prescriptions and findings hold up. This public peer review      is exceedingly importantwhen deciding controversial matters,      particularly because reviewing courts are loath to second-     guess expert administrativeagency's policy decisions--     choosing instead to limit themselves only to questions of      law. (See, e.g., USTelecom v. FCC, 825 F.3d674, 697 (D.     2016) (we do not ``inquire whether `some or many      economists would disapprove of the [agency's]      approach'because `we do not sit as a panel of referees on a      professional economics journal, but as a panel of generalist      judges obligedto defer to a reasonable judgment by an agency      acting pursuant to congressionally delegated authority.''))      As such, the peerreview process allows the public to better      hold government to account and results in more      informedpolicymaking.       Unfortunately, while the Office of Management and Budget      mandates peer review, many administrative agencies donot take      the peer review process seriously. By way of example, I am      attaching an op-ed I wrote in The Hill last yeardemonstrating      how the Federal Communications Commission flagrantly violated      the public's due process rights by hiding until thevery last      moments the highly-critical results of the agency's peer      review of an outside economic study which the agency      intendedto be the foundational document to impose price      regulation for Business Data By any account, such      behavior is not anexample of ``good'' government. Legislation      to improve the public peer review process at federal agencies      is therefore bothwelcome and necessary.

In additionto the well-documented improprieties with      the White House during the Open Internet debate, Wheeler,      among other transgressions,has attempted to force nonprofits      to reveal their donors in strict violation of Supreme Court      precedent, hired advocates who hadfiled in significant FCC      dockets as an interested party to come into the commission to      supervise those very dockets, andattempted to hold a FCC      ``town hall'' in which he had invited an outside party to      participate and comment on a yet-to-be-released item during      the ``sunshine'' period.       Wheeler is now at it again, this time in the context of the      FCC's attempt toimpose stringent price regulation for      ``business data services'' (BDS). Let's look at this shameful      timeline. Sometime last latelast year, the FCC started      working on a new regulatory framework for At the heart      of the commission's new regulatoryframework was an economic      appendix prepared by an outside expert, Marc Rysman of Boston            On April 14, 2016,approximately two weeks before the FCC      was to vote on the formal ``Notice of Proposed Rulemaking''      containing its proposed BDSregulatory framework, the agency      requested outside peer review (as required by law) of the      Rysman Appendix from Andrew Sweetingof the University of      Maryland and Tommaso Valletti of Imperial College Business      School (U.K.). Sweeting responded on April 26,2016 (12 days      after the peer review request); and Valletti responded on      April 28, 2016 (14 days after the peer review      request).Neither peer review was particularly kind to      Rysman's analysis.       On April 28, 2016, the FCC voted on its ``Notice of      ProposedRulemaking'' to provide an aggressive new regulatory      paradigm for BDS (hereinafter ``BDS NPRM''). Due to editorial      privileges,however, the FCC did not formally release the BDS      NPRM until May 2, 2016. Although the commission had the      Sweetling and Valletticritiques in hand during the editorial      privilege window and could have incorporated them into the      final BDS NPRM, the In fact, the FCC made no      mention of either critique of the Rysman Appendix in its      final BDS NPRM, choosing instead tokeep the existence of the      Sweeting and Valletti reviews secret from the public.       On June 28, 2016--almost two months to the daysince the BDS      NPRM was first voted upon and the very date initial comments      were due the FCC finally made the existence of theSweeting      and Valletti peer reviews public. Adding to the commission's      subterfuge, the agency chose the same day also: (1) toperform      a massive data dump into the record; (2) to release an      updated version of the Rysman Appendix; and (3) to      introducethree new staff studies (the same staff which are      charged with writing the final BDS rules) purporting to      address, andultimately correct, the shortcomings of the      Rysman In so doing, the FCC made sure that no one      could address eitherthese data or studies in their initial      comments.       For those who care about the integrity of our government      institutions, theFCC's constant disregard for due process is      deeply troubling. As the D.Circuit recently wrote in      Association of AmericanRailroads v. Department of      Transportation (2016):       No clause in our nation's Constitution has as ancient a      pedigree as theguarantee that ``[n]o person . . . shall be      deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of      law.'' U.CONST.amend. Its lineage reaches back to 1215      A.D.'s Magna Carta, which ensured that ``[n]o freeman shall      be . . . disseised of his. . . liberties, or . . . otherwise      destroyed . . . but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by      the law of the land.'' MagnaCarta, ch. 29, in 1 Coke, The      Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 45      (1797). Since the Fifth Amendment'sratification, one theme      above all others has dominated the Supreme Court's      interpretation of the Due Process Clause: fairness.at 27.       Now to be clear, as Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote in      Snyder v. Massachusetts (1934), while ``[d]ue process of      lawrequires that the proceedings shall be fair . . . fairness      is a relative, not an absolute, concept. It is fairness      withreference to particular conditions or particular      results.'' That said, as the D.Circuit again affirmed just      last month inU.Telecom Association v. FCC, it remains      black-letter law that ``[u]nder the [Administrative Procedure      Act], an NPRM must`provide sufficient factual detail and      rationale for the rule to permit interested parties to      comment meaningfully.' ''       Asthe FCC has by any reasonable account deprived parties      with the opportunity to comment meaningfully upon the      fundamentaleconomic analysis and data upon which it intends      to use to impose rate regulation for BDS, I think it is safe      to argue thatunder even the broadest light, the agency's      conduct in this case is a prima facie violation of procedural      due process.       Whatis the FCC so afraid of? Is it truly scared to have      substantive debate on the issues? Is the outcome so      predetermined that ithas to resort to kangaroo court tactics      that would make North Korean leader Kim Jong-un proud?      Indeed, it is a bit ironic (ifnot outright hypocritical) that      while the FCC is doing everything it can to prevent      meaningful comments about a highly complextopic, the Obama      administration is doing everything in its power to create a      culture which encourages robo-comments which offerup nothing      substantive to the debate other than to promote ideological      sophistry from both sides of the political spectrum. Andwe      wonder why (rhetorically) the FCC is now regarded as an      ``economics-free zone,'' as an AT&T executive noted?       Given theD.Circuit's recent proclivity to grant the FCC      great deference, no matter how many liberties it may take,      restoring the ruleof law at the FCC will ultimately fall into      the hands of Fortunately, the House Energy and      Commerce Committee hasscheduled yet another oversight hearing[[Page H364]]     next week with all five members of the Commission in      attendance, where perhapssome sunlight can be used as a      disinfectant. I therefore encourage the Commerce Committee      members and staff--from both sides ofthe aisle--to do their      homework, come to the hearing prepared, and call Chairman      Wheeler out on the carpet.

3,topic-id,774,"Mr.Speaker, a strong, safe, reliable, and efficient infrastructure system is vital for robust and sustainedeconomic growth. Comprehensive infrastructure reform is all-inclusive and requires an ongoing investment by the FederalGovernment in not just our roads and bridges but in all of the vital systems that support our way of life.  Currently, the United States needs around $3.6 trillion in infrastructure investment by 2020, just to keep our country in astate of good repair. By contrast, China, perhaps our greatest international rival, spends nearly four times of its GDP oninfrastructure than we do and announced nearly a trillion dollars more infrastructure spending just last year.  Put simply, our national infrastructure system is an embarrassment, earning a D-plus grade from the American Society ofCivil It is a threat to our economy, to American jobs, to our national security, and to our environment.  We need a public transportation system that gets people where they need to be, keeps our roads clear, and makes our citiesbetter places to live. We need a freight system that moves products and raw materials quickly, safely, and efficiently. We needairways that reliably move people and cargo around the country and the world in a timely manner. We need river locks and portsthat allow American farmers to ship their products to market, no matter where that is. We need water pipes and sewers thattransport safe, clean water to every And we need to close the broadband gap so that every American can take advantageof the opportunities the Internet provides.  Investing in America's infrastructure is good politics, good economics, and the right thing to do. Each year, Americans takearound 11 billion trips on public transportation systems like buses, commuter rail, and light rail, contributing to the $58billion industry that employs nearly half a million people. And yet, almost half of our Nation's buses and a quarter of our railassets are in marginal or poor condition.  My city of Chicago is the crossroads for the Nation's freight system, and each day more than 54 million tons of freight ismoved across the U.S., and nearly a quarter of it passes through the Chicago city limits--at times, very slowly.  We stand to lose $1 trillion a year in lost sales in 2020, if we fail to build out our freight infrastructure to keep pacewith future growth.  Congestion is also an issue at our Nation's airports. Ground delays are becoming a greater challenge as more and more peoplefly regularly. These delays can have a very serious consequence, resulting in passengers being late to their destinations, lostproductivity from cargo sitting on runways, and increased pollution due to needlessly burning jet fuel.  In addition to air and ground, we must also talk about our waterways. Each year millions of tons of material traverse inlandwaterways like the Mississippi River and the Saint Lawrence But, according to the Army Corps of Engineers, there is abillion dollar maintenance backlog that threatens to keep our waterways from maintaining adequate levels of performance.  There are problems in our water and sewer systems, too. The 240,000 water main breaks that occur in this country each yearcost us more than $2.6 billion; not to mention the lost productivity caused by closed roads, lost water, and other indirectimpacts. Nearly all of the U.underground water pipes will reach or surpass their useful lifespans in the next decade. Thelonger we wait, the higher the price tag will become.  Finally, we can use our infrastructure system to promote economic growth and economic equality, and one great way to do thatis to close the broadband gap and increase access to high-speed As many as 50 million Americans live in areas withoutthe ability to get high-quality and useful Internet access. Extending the ability to get online benefits businesses, employees,students, and everyone else without this vital utility, all while spurring economic activities that ripple throughout theeconomy.[[Page H304]]  The benefits of smart investment and infrastructure are massive. Every billion spent in infrastructure creates 13,000 jobs,in addition to improving the efficiency of the system. And every dollar invested generates almost $3 in economic activity.  Conversely, the consequences of failing to act are dire. Each American household stands to lose $3,400 per year indisposable income thanks to infrastructure deficiencies. That is money taken directly from our constituents' pockets, money theywould use to support themselves and their families, not to mention the economy as a whole, which could lose more than $4trillion in GDP and more than 2.5 million jobs by 2025.  We owe it to each other and every one of our constituents to act. I urge the 115th Congress to prioritize infrastructurespending and pass a comprehensive package that addresses all aspects of the connected infrastructure system.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH303-4.txt,1967,ACA AND AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES,2017.0,11.0,January

This training into all of the ethical standards that were just invoked by my distinguished colleague from Michigan iscritical to guard against regulatory capture and to protect the public interest. The whole challenge of a republic is how to getlegislators and other public officers, who are agents of the people, to serve the common good rather than their own, privateinterests. In the cost-benefit terms of this legislation, you would call this the ``agency problem.'' Our Constitution, witheverything from the separation of powers to the Emoluments Clause, to the Title of Nobility Clause is designed to safeguard thepublic interest and to reduce the prospects for mischief, corruption, and self-dealing by people in government. Providingmandatory ethics training is a simple way to remind all of us in public life whom we really work for--the American people.  Requiring employees to undergo basic ethics training is not unusual. In fact, every congressional staffer who works in thisbody is required to undergo ethics training in his or her first 60 days of employment here.

108,topic-id,678,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. I thank ChairmanGoodlatte for the opportunity to again lead on this issue and for the inclusion of two of my bills--the Separation of PowersRestoration Act and the ALERT Act--in this incredibly important regulatory reform package.  Because you see, Mr.Chairman, the realities of President Obama's failed liberal progressive experiment are all too real forthe three-quarters of a million Texans that I represent, realities like higher prices for families in Sulphur Springs trying tomake ends meet, fewer jobs for those seeking work in Texarkana, and small businesses in Sherman and Rockwall forced to closetheir doors. Mr.Chairman, these are just a few of the countless devastating symptoms of overregulation that citizens across ourgreat country have been forced to endure under President  The President gives a good speech, and he did so again in his farewell address last night. But the President read us afictional tale last night. The inescapable truth is that for 8 long years, the constant stream of regulations being pumped outby the Obama administration has taken a terrible toll on families, on businesses, and on our economy. It has made our Nationless prosperous and leaves folks worse off than they were before.  The urgency to reverse this unsustainable regulatory quagmire couldn't have been made more clear than in November, when theAmerican people rose up and voted for a new President who vowed not to subject us to more of the same. That is where my[[Page H331]]bill and all of the bills in the Regulatory Accountability Act come into play.  When you look back at the last 8 years, many people wonder how the Obama administration was allowed to grow at such analarming rate. Now, while there are a lot of troubling factors that go into that equation, the result of an infamous 1984Supreme Court decision, the Chevron doctrine, is certainly recognized as one of the key culprits. For three decades now, thisdoctrine has required courts to defer to agency interpretations of congressional intent.  Said in more plain terms, Mr.Chairman, this means that when individuals challenge Federal regulators in court, the deck isstacked in favor of the regulators, the very same regulators who have written the regulations in the first place. Lettingregulators grade their own papers, if that doesn't reinforce the need to drain the swamp, then I don't know what does.  My legislation, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, will fix this perversion of our Constitution by ensuring thatCongress, not executive branch agencies, write our laws and that courts, not agency bureaucrats, interpret our laws.  Mr.Chairman, title V of this bill is my ALERT Act legislation, and it provides another critical remedy to the currentregulatory process by fixing the lack of transparency that is both unfair and harmful to individuals and small businesses acrossthe country.  Right now, the current law requires the administration to release an update twice a year on the regulations that are beingdeveloped by Federal agencies--the problem is that the regulators are ignoring the law--as these updates have either been verylate or never issued at all under President Obama's watch.  Up to this point, there hasn't been a way to reinforce and enforce these requirements. So the ALERT Act tackles this problemby forcing the executive branch to make the American people aware of regulations that are coming down the track; and itprohibits any regulations from going into effect unless and until detailed information on the cost of the regulation, its impacton jobs, and the legal basis for the regulation have been available to the public on the Internet for at least 6 months.  Mr.Chairman, the way our government has been allowed to function under this administration isn't how our forefathersintended our government to work. Today's legislation takes a giant step forward in fixing how Washington works. I have alreadyspoken to President-elect Trump about partnering together to make this the law of the land and to give the American people backthe government that our Founders intended, a government that works for them, not the other way around.  Mr.Chairman, we owe them nothing less.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,2268,SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,2017.0,11.0,January

923,topic-id,1528,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss 84, a bill that wouldprovide a one-time exception from the longstanding law that requires a member of the military to be retired from the armedservices for at least 7 years before being appointed as Secretary of We areconsidering this legislation today because the President-elect's nominee for Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis, hasonly been retired from the U.Marine Corps for 3 years.  In considering the unique situation presented by this nomination,this week the Armed Services Committee held two hearings. The first hearing, on Tuesday, had a panel of two excellent outsidewitnesses who discussed the history of the retirement restriction law and the benefits and challenges of legislating anexception to that law. Then, this morning, the committee held a nomination hearing with General Mattis and examined his views ona wide range of defense challenges facing our country and the Defense  General Mattis has a long anddistinguished military career, and he is recognized by his peers as a thoughtful and strategic thinker. However, since itspassage in 1947, the statutory requirement designed to protect civilian control of the Armed Forces has only been waived oneother time. Therefore, I believe it is extremely important that we carefully consider the consequences of setting aside the lawand the implications such a decision may have on the future of civilian and military relations.  Civilian control of themilitary is enshrined in our Constitution and dates back to George Washington and the Revolutionary This principle hasdistinguished our Nation from many other countries around the world, and it has helped ensure that our democracy remains in thehands of the people.  The National Security Act of 1947, which established the Department of Defense, included a provisionprohibiting any individual ``within ten years'' of ``active duty as a commissioned officer in a regular component of the armedservices'' from being appointed as the Secretary of However, in 1950, President Harry Truman nominated former Secretaryof State and former Chief of Staff of the United States Army General George Marshall to serve as the Secretary of Defense, thuscausing Congress to pass an exception to the statute.  While Congress ultimately waived the restriction for General Marshall,the law included a nonbinding section that stated: ``It is hereby expressed as the intent of the Congress that the authoritygranted by this Act is not to be construed as approval by the Congress of the continuing appointments of military men to theoffice of Secretary of Defense in the future. It is hereby expressed as the sense of the Congress that after General Marshallleaves the office of the Secretary of Defense, no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved.''  Nearly 70 years later, Congress again must make a determination if an exception should be made in the case of Let me remind my colleagues why making this change is so significant. During our committee hearings, Kathleen Hicksastutely noted: ``The Defense Secretary position is unique in our system. Other than the President acting as commander in chief,the Secretary of Defense is the only civilian official in the operational chain of command to the Armed Unlike thePresident, however, he or she is not an elected official.''  As I stated during the committee's consideration of the waiverlegislation, we must be very cautious about any actions, including this legislation, that may inadvertently politicize our During this past Presidential election cycle, both Democrats and Republicans came dangerously close to compromising thenonpartisan nature of our military with the nominating convention speeches from recently retired general officers advocating fora candidate for  I am also concerned about providing a waiver for General Mattis in light of the fact that he willjoin other recently retired senior military officers who have been selected for high-ranking national security positions in theTrump Throughout our Nation's history, retired general officers have often held positions at the highest levelsof government as civilians. In fact, a few have even been elected  What concerns me, however, is the total numberof retired senior military officers chosen by the President-elect to lead organizations critical to our national security andthe cumulative affect it may have on our overall national security policy. Specifically, there may be unintended consequenceshaving so many senior leaders with similar military backgrounds crafting policy and making decisions as weighty as those facingthe next administration.  In the course of our review of General Mattis' nomination, the reason most often cited in supportof a waiver allowing him to serve is that a retired four-star general known for his war-fighting skills and strategic judgmentto lead the Department of Defense will counterbalance the President-elect's lack of defense and foreign policy experience. AsTom Ricks wrote recently in The New York Times: ``Usually I'd oppose having a generalas Secretary of Defense, because it could undermine our tradition of civilian control of the military. But these are not normaltimes.''  Likewise, Eliot Cohen testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this week, and he argued thatif it weren't for his deep concern about the Trump Administration, he would oppose the waiver for General Specifically,he stated: ``There is no question in my mind that a Secretary Mattis would be a stabilizing and moderating force . . . and overtime, helping to steer American foreign and security policy in a sound and sensible direction.''  If Congress provides anexception for General Mattis, we must be mindful of the precedent that action sets for such waivers in the future. Therestriction was enacted into law for good reason, and General George Marshall is the only retired military officer to receivethis exception.  Based on General Mattis' testimony this morning, as well as his decades of distinguished service in the U.S.Marine Corps, and weighing all of the other factors, I will support a waiver for him to serve as Secretary of GeneralMattis testified to the fact that the role of Congress does not end with the passage of this legislation. As Hicks stated,``The United States Congress, the nation's statutes and courts, the professionalism of our Armed Forces, and the will of thepeople are critical safeguards against any perceived attempts to fundamentally alter the quality of civilian control of themilitary in this country.''  Any of us who support this bill have a profound duty to ensure that the Department of Defense andits leaders,[[Page S305]]both civilian and military, are following and protecting the principles upon which this country isfounded.  Let me be very clear. I will not support a waiver for any future nominees under the incoming administration orfuture administrations. I view this as a generational exception, as our bipartisan witnesses recommended. I would ask that mycolleagues on both sides of the aisle make this same commitment. Indeed, I intend to propose reestablishing the original 10-yearban which was in place when the Defense Department was established. Restoring the threshold for service to 10 years would send astrong signal that this principle of civilian control of the military is essential to our Democratic system of government.  Atthis point I would ask if the chairman of the committee might engage in a colloquy. I do that first by thanking him for theextraordinarily fair, thoughtful, and careful way he has guided this nomination through the committee and here to thefloor.  I wish to thank the Senator from Arizona for the thoughtful and thorough process we have had in considering thenomination of General I think one of the high points was a hearing on civilian military relations with Eliot Cohen andKathleen Both witnesses emphasized that while they supported this waiver, it should be a rare, generational exceptionto ensure the integrity of civilian control of our military, which is the bedrock of our democracy.  I agree wholeheartedlywith that assessment, and I would ask the chairman if he also agrees with that assessment.  Mr.Mr.President, I would say that I also agree. I want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership, andI want to thank him for setting the tenor and the environment that surrounds the Armed Services Committee, which resulted in the24-to-3 vote today in the Armed Services Because of the relationship that we have, but also because of hisleadership, we have a very bipartisan committee, which is vital to maintain, considering the awesome responsibilities wehold.  The Senator from Rhode Island has displayed time after time a willingness to work together for the good of the country.I think this is the latest example, even though he had significant reservations--which are valid--concerning the short period oftransition from wearing the uniform to holding down the highest civilian position as far as defense of the Nation is concerned.I know he didn't reach this conclusion without a lot of thought, a lot of study, a lot of--as he has displayed--references tohistory; reasons for the origination of this legislation, which requires 7 years before an individual is eligible to beSecretary of Defense after leaving the military.  So I just wanted to thank the Senator from Rhode Island, and I look forwardto an overwhelming vote.  Mr.President, could I ask the parliamentary situation as it is right now.

29,topic-id,599,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to praise Senator Jeff Sessions, President-elect Trump's nominee forAttorney Senator Sessions, I am praising him today for his inspiring testimony before the Senate JudiciaryCommittee yesterday. During his confirmation hearings, Senator Sessions was questioned on a wide variety of issues thatwill be under his purview as our Attorney Included in the numerous topics covered were questions about his intentionsto enforce Federal law as it pertains to marijuana policy.  Senator Sessions is a patriot. He is a constitutionalist. He is a man of the highest moral integrity, and I havecomplete confidence that if confirmed as Attorney General, he will faithfully enforce our laws--not just those he agrees with,but all the laws duly enacted by  As it pertains to marijuana policy, Senator Sessions promised to do the same, to follow the law. During his exchangeson that topic of medical marijuana policy, being questioned by both Senators Leahy and Lee, Senator Sessions stated hisintention to follow Federal law. At one point he indicated that if Congress no longer desired to make possession anddistribution of marijuana an illegal act, ``Congress should pass a law to change the rules.''  At this time, I feel compelled to point out that Federal law has been changed and currently prohibits the Department ofJustice from spending appropriated funds to prosecute individuals who are acting in compliance with their State's medicalmarijuana laws. In fact, a provision has been in the law since December 2014, when Congress passed and President Obama signedinto law the Consolidated Further Continuing Appropriations The act included a provision passed on the floor of the Houseas an amendment earlier that year by a vote of 219-189. The following year, a similar provision was passed by a wider marginof 242-186. That provision, offered by myself and cosponsored by my colleague, Sam Farr, restricts the Federal Governmentfrom superseding State law when it comes to the use of medical marijuana. This law will remain in effect through April 28 ofthis year, although I expect with the House and the Senate, both on record on this, that this provision will be renewed. I amespecially confident of that when realizing that President-elect Trump is on the record, as he stated in the last campaign, thatthis issue should be left to the Thus, I am confident that this legal provision, which says that the Federal Governmentshall not supersede State law when it comes to medical marijuana, will be renewed.  Importantly, in August of last year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in U.v. McIntosh that Federal funds cannotbe used to prosecute those in compliance with their State's medical marijuana laws. This provision will be part of American lawas long as it is renewed and Congress makes it part of the law. I am confident that if Congress does that, Attorney GeneralJeff Sessions, my friend, a person I admire greatly, will abide by the provisions and, thus, respect State medicalmarijuana laws, as dictated by Congress and enforced by the judiciary.  As he rightfully pointed out in his testimony yesterday, Senator Sessions said it will be his duty to see to it thatthe laws under his purview as Attorney General are faithfully executed, and this includes the Rohrabacher-Farr limitations thatno funding shall be used to prosecute those throughout our country who are in compliance with our States' medical marijuanalaws.  All of this comes down to a constitutional theory and a constitutional commitment to what we call the 10th Amendment, andthat is the States have a right to make determinations in all of those areas that the Federal Government should not be involvedin. This should definitely be left to the                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH311.txt,979,SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,2017.0,11.0,January

Instead, we are here tonight, talking with the American people about ``what could be'' when we first get ridof this terrible law--something that many of us have voted on 60 times or more to do. We now have a real opportunity with notonly a Republican House, but a Republican Senate, and with a President who is willing to work with us.  The verdict is in. In Indiana alone and in my district, I have met person after person who has horror stories about thefailure of  I spoke with Anna, whose husband, Jack, survived stage IV cancer. With Jack's cancer only having a 30 percent survival rate,it is crucial that he has effective doctors who know how to treat and how to work the problem. Instead, Anna's doctor quitpracticing medicine--well before his planned retirement age--due to the burdensome costs of ObamaCare, which is something that thegentleman from Georgia also mentioned.  It is not just doctors who are unable to perform their duties--their profession--under this insidious law, but also insurancecompanies that are withdrawing from the market as we speak. Last year alone, we saw Indiana's exchange lose 50 percent of itshealth insurance carriers due to regulations of This included IU Health, which covered almost 30,000 Thislack of options means that healthy Hoosiers are being forced to pay for coverage that they don't want, that they don't need, andthat, in fact, may do more harm than good.

If I left this Chamber and, God forbid, I broke my leg on my way down the steps, I wouldn't worry too much about where I wasgoing--just to the nearest emergency room.

Most of our healthcare decisions can be made by attaching value to the services and products that we want.We do it in every other part of our consumer-driven life. Why can't we finally do it with health care? That is what people likePhil Roe have practiced in medicine their entire lives. That is what he has taught me. That is what we know as Why can't we be trusted to do that with our health care?  Whether the intent is malicious, whether the intent is malign, the intent of the people who support ObamaCare--that insidiouslaw--is wrong. It says: just give your life over to these few people, and let them run it for a while, and everything will befine. Unfortunately, throughout not only American history, every time it has been tried here and every time it has been tried inworld history, it has failed. Control over the individual has failed, and it will do the same, as we are seeing every day now,with regard to our health care.  Let's repeal this insidious law, and let's get back on the track of replacing it with something that we all can trust,beginning with ourselves.  I thank the chairman for his leadership.

1026,topic-id,432,"Mr.Chair, I thank the chairwoman for yielding the time. It is a pleasure to continue our work together on thisvery important issue.  It has taken us 6 years to get to today, the first real step in repealing what is one of the most insidious laws that evercame out of these Chambers--insidious because it was built on lies. Remember ``You can keep your doctor if you want to,'' ``Youcan keep your plan if you want to''? Remember when premiums were to go down because this, of course, Mr.Chairman, was theAffordable Care Act?  The gentleman from Kentucky made some assertions just a while ago. I want to take a look at the State of Kentucky itself.Four plans left the ObamaCare exchange at the end of 2016 in the State of Of the remaining plans, each increased theirpremiums by double digits: 22.9 percent, 29.3 percent, and 33.7 percent, respectively, for 2017. And Kentucky's exchangeenrollment decreased by 12 percent.  How, Mr.Chairman, is this helping people?  Look, if we didn't care about people, we could stand by and watch this failed plan, this insidious law continue to implode,continue to hurt people. Instead, we stand here ready to erase the foundation that this law was based on and put forth a betterone, one that doesn't leave anyone behind, one that is based on market-driven, consumer-driven, patient-driven needs andexpectations and allows them to, for example, keep their job.  What do I mean by that, Mr.Chairman? Consider this. Not only do we have bad healthcare outcomes as a result of thisinsidious law, people are losing work. They are being robbed of their dignity to work. Since ObamaCare, 21 percent of businessesare reducing the number of employees, their wages and salaries and their benefits, including their retirement benefits.  So this insidious law is not only having detrimental implications on our health care and people's health, but it is takingaway the very dignity that they have to work.  It is also spelling the death of health savings accounts, proven over the last several years to be part of the solution toconsumer-driven health care. The idea that you can save for your healthcare expenses, with or without the government's help, sothat you can make value decisions as to your health care without government interference. It leads to better patient outcomes.It leads to freedom to make healthcare decisions absent the oversight of the government. ObamaCare all but outlawed healthsavings accounts. I think[[Page H492]]health savings accounts are probably in every one of those different plans the chairwomanpointed out.  So we are offering a replacement. We are offering solutions. We are offering a better way.  ",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH490.txt,2017,SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,2017.0,13.0,January

In the aftermath of World War II, leaders from both parties, who many in this House revere to this day, developed theprinciple of civilian control of our Armed Forces and codified it into law. They had seen the rise of fascism and communism, andheld this principle dear because they believed it was necessary for the safety of our democracy. It was the outgrowth of a longtradition of thinking about civil-military relations, as old as our Republic itself, going back to the  Yet, almost all of these same leaders and legislators made an exception for General George Marshall; but when they did so,they did not take the action lightly. The exception in 1950 did a number of things that this legislation does not, which mycolleagues have spoken about. All are serious, but I want to highlight one.  The exception in 1950 named General Marshall by name and applied the exception only to him. This bill does not name GeneralMattis, and it is written more broadly. The principle of civilian control of the Armed Forces was importantto the Greatest Generation and it was an exception in every sense, an exception for an exceptional individual.  This matter should not be rammed through There are serious issues to discuss. I believe civil-military relationsremain vitally important to the American people and to the health of our democracy.  I believe that General Mattis is an excellent general officer. He has served our Nation well, and he will be a capableSecretary of My opposition to this legislation is not about General Mattis' capacity to serve in this role.  Mr.Speaker, I ask: Why is this legislation written so that it could apply to other individuals and does not name GeneralMattis and state that this is only for him?  We are being asked to rush, without conducting proper oversight, without holding a hearing, and after being prevented by anunelected transition team to hear from General Mattis himself.  This is the people's The House should have a proper hearing before a decision of this magnitude is made.

I would like to highlight a provision of this legislation that I offered 3 years ago that requires agencies to identify whennew rules will have a negative impact on jobs and wages.  Too often, regulators and agency heads are well aware of the negative impact a regulation will have on Americans' jobs andwages even before it is imposed, but they impose it anyway. Specifically, my provision defines when rules have a negative impacton jobs and wages and requires agency heads approving such a rule to submit a statement that they approve the rule knowing itsnegative impact.  When people in this far-off Capitol take away the jobs and livelihood of working families, as they have done with miners andpower plant workers and laborers in my district, they need to own up to it.

Is it: We are afraid they might take over the government? Well, if there was ever anopportunity for that concern, it was in the 1790s. President George Washington, a general, was revered. He had appointed to hisCabinet five generals and a couple of colonels. If there was ever a time for a military takeover of the United States, it wasthen. Instead, George Washington relinquished the most important, powerful position in the land. He, like all warriors,understood what it meant to serve their country.

307,topic-id,601,"Mr.President, I thank my friend from Delaware for yielding.When we talk about the health care crisis in this country, it is not just health care, it is also the outrageously high cost ofprescription drugs. I know in my State of Vermont, and in fact throughout this country, millions of people today are unable toafford the medicine they need.  In fact, almost one out of five Americans who go to the doctor and get a prescription areunable to afford to buy the medicine their doctors prescribe. Frankly, that is insane because what happens if you don't take themedicine your doctor prescribed, often you are going to get sicker. Sometimes you may die. Sometimes you may end up in theemergency room. Sometimes you may end up in the hospital. It is literally beyond comprehension that almost one out of fiveAmericans today are unable to afford the medicine they need.  Meanwhile, while so many of our people cannot afford themedicine they need, the top five drug companies last year made $50 billion in profit--$50 billion in profit. The top 10 CEOs inthe pharmaceutical industry earned over $300 million.  So what we have is a scenario in which the American people pay thehighest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Millions cannot afford the medicine they desperately need, but at the sametime the drug companies make out like bandits, and their CEOs earn exorbitant compensation packages.

308,topic-id,1131,"Mr.President, perhaps people then will ask a simplequestion: How does it happen? How does the same exact same medicine sold in the United States sell in countries around the worldfor a fraction of[[Page S238]]the price that we have to pay? The answer is severalfold. 1, we are the only major country on Earth,of course, that does not have a national health care system guaranteeing health care to all people. We are the only majorcountry on Earth not to have that.  As part of that problem, we are the only major country not to negotiate drug prices withthe pharmaceutical industry. You can walk into a drug store today, and the price could be double or three times what you paid ayear ago. There is no law to stop them. They can and they will raise prices as high as the market will allow. If people die as aresult of that, not a problem for them. If people get sick, not a problem for them.  Perhaps next to Wall Street, thepharmaceutical industry is the most powerful political force in this country. They have spent more than $3 billion on lobbyingsince 1998, and they have 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol We have 100 There are 435 Members of the Yet thedrug companies have 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol They have lobbyists all over the country in every State capital.  Theseare no small-time lobbyists. These are former leaders of the Democratic Party, leaders of the Republican Party, people who haveenormous contacts. So the drug companies are able to raise prices to any level they want because we as a nation, uniquely amongmajor nations, do not negotiate prices with them. The reason we do not negotiate prices with them is they got lobbyists and theymake very hefty campaign contributions to make sure Congress, in fact, does not pass legislation which will lower drug prices inthis country.  The pharmaceutical industry is an industry that is not only incredibly greedy, but they have a business modelwhich is largely based on fraud. Like Wall Street, their business model is largely based on fraud. Almost every major drugcompany, not widely known--but almost every major drug company in this country--multi, multibillion-dollar corporations--have beenfined for illegal activities and for cheating consumers in our country and all over the world.  Since 1991, with laxenforcement--it is not like we have a vigorous Attorney General's office that really goes after these guys. With relatively laxenforcement policies, drug companies over the years since 1991 have paid over $35 billion in fines or reached settlements forfraud and misconduct. Imagine that. This is just when they are caught, and I suspect that most of thetimes they cheat, they don't get caught--but $35 billion in fines or settlements since 1991 from the major drug companies in thiscountry.  Let me give you just a few examples of some of the settlements and fines the major drug companies have made inrecent years.  In 2013, the Justice Department ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $2.2 billion in fines because they``recklessly promote drugs for uses that have not been proven to be safe and effective.''  According to the U.attorneyhandling the case, Johnson & Johnson's ``promotion of Risperdal for unapproved uses threatened the most vulnerable populationsof our society--children, the elderly, and those with developmental disabilities.''  In 2010, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals paid$520 million to resolve allegations that it illegally marketed the antipsychotic drug Seroquel for uses not approved as safe andeffective by the Food and Drug  In 2009, Eli Lilly was fined over $1.4 billion for its off-label promotion ofanother antipsychotic product known as According to Federal investigators, Eli Lilly's ``illegal activity increasespatients' costs, threatens their safety and negatively affects the delivery of healthcare services to the more than nine millionmilitary members, retirees and their families who rely on''  Very interestingly--and I am sure many of the Memberssaw it--President-Elect Trump had a press conference this morning, and in his press conference, he said that pharma is ``gettingaway with murder.''  Mr.Trump: Pharma is ``getting away with murder.''  Do you know what? Mr.Trump is exactly right.Pharma is getting away with murder. Pharma has gotten away with murder for many decades.  The interesting issue is, with aRepublican President-elect telling the truth, that pharma is getting away with murder, will the Republicans, will all theDemocrats have the guts finally to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and their lobbyists and their campaign contributionsand fight for the American consumer and end the disgrace of having our country pay, by far, the highest prices in the world forprescription drugs?  The good news is--I say to my fellow Republicans and to Democrats--the good news is that tonight you aregoing to have that opportunity because as part of the so-called vote-arama, I will be offering a very simple amendment which Ihope wins strong bipartisan support. In fact, there have been a number of Republicans over the years--in the House and in theSenate--who have supported the concept of reimportation for many years.  What this amendment will do is allow pharmaceuticaldistributors and pharmacists and those involved in the pharmaceutical industries--those people who sell drugs--to import low-costmedicine from Canada and other countries which will be FDA-approved. In other words, all over this country people ask a verysimple question: We can eat fish and vegetables that are grown all over the world, but somehow we cannot get into this countrybrand-name prescription drugs manufactured by some of the largest drug companies in the world from an advanced country likeCanada? The reason we can't do that is for one reason and one reason alone, and that is the power of the pharmaceuticalindustry.  I would hope that tonight, both Democrats and Republicans will stand together and demand that this country be ableto import safe, low-cost medicine from Canada and from other countries.  I should also mention that I will be introducinglegislation with Representative Elijah Cummings from Maryland in the coming days on this very issue, on the issue ofreimportation and also another issue that Mr.Trump touched on, I believe, today; and that is, the need for Medicare and thegovernment, in general, to negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry. The VA does it. Clearly, Medicare should be doingit as well. I believe we are going to have an amendment on the floor tonight. I would hope people support that amendment. I willbe introducing legislation on that issue as well as reimportation.  When we talk about the health care crisis in America, oneof the issues of concern to most Americans is the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. The question is whether theCongress has the guts to take on an enormously powerful industry, the pharmaceutical industry, with all of their lobbying andall of their campaign contributions.

I know I speak forvirtually all Democrats in saying that we have deep concern about the Republican proposal that would repeal the Affordable CareAct without having any alternative plan in place. We think the idea of throwing some 30 million Americans off of the healthinsurance they have and significantly reducing funding for Medicaid will not only be very, very problematic for lower incomepeople but also impact middle-class people who depend upon Medicaid to help pay for the nursing home care their parents get. Weare deeply concerned about the possible privatization of Medicare, making Medicare into a voucher program. We are concernedabout the increase in prescription drug costs for seniors that would occur. If the Affordable Care Act were repealed, seniorswould have to pay far more than they are paying right now, at a time when many seniors cannot today afford the high cost ofprescription drugs. What we find is outrageous is that, in the midst of all these attacks on the middle class and workingfamilies of this country, the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act would end up providing hundreds and hundreds ofbillions of dollars in tax breaks for the top 2 percent. I believe there are very few people in America who think we shoulddevastate the health care programs that millions of Americans depend upon and at the same time give huge tax breaks to the very,very wealthy.

Millions of Americans have received health care, in some cases for the first time in theirlives because we were able to expand  Senator Gillibrand is concerned about protecting women's health. TheAffordable Care Act has gone a long way in terms of equity for women, in terms of the health care they receive, and I hopenobody wants to see that disappear.[[Page S249]]  Senator Manchin will address a very important issue about the opiate epidemicthat exists in West Virginia and all across this country.  Senator Stabenow will be speaking about the need to protectmental health services. We have a major crisis in mental health care in this country. We need to do a lot more than we arecurrently doing, and we certainly do not need to do less.  Senators Cantwell and Carper will be talking about theneed to protect delivery system reform. Senator Brown will be talking about the need to protect the Children's HealthInsurance Senator Coons will be talking about the need to make sure there are no limits on the health insurancepeople with serious illnesses receive.  So there are a lot of very, very important amendments that will be offered, and Ilook forward to an interesting evening of discussion.  I would just conclude my remarks to say that I find it beyondcomprehension that at a time when we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all of our people--weare the only one--that at a time when we pay significantly more per capita for health care than do the people of any othernation, that at a time when we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs--what we need is to have ahealth care system that protects the needs of the middle class and working families of our country, not just the insurancecompanies and not just the drug companies. In fact, the votes tonight are really about whether we are prepared to stand up forordinary Americans or whether we are going to continue to kowtow to the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry.

How has that worked out for millionsof Americans who lost the plans that they liked and now cannot keep that plan?  What about the promise, Mr.Chairman, that premiums would go down by $2,500? President Obama made that claim. And today, inStates all across the Nation, you are seeing premiums go up, on average, 25 percent, and that is on top of double-digitincreases every single year ObamaCare has been in effect.  This law is not working. It is failing families. It is costing jobs across our economy. It is time to repeal this law andactually replace it with reforms that put patients back in charge of their medical decisions with their doctors. What a greatconcept that would be.  It is about time we focus on lowering the cost of health care and giving people real choices. In so many markets across thecountry--and it is a growing number--families have only one choice for health care now because ObamaCare has forced so many peopleout of the marketplace, which means you as a family don't have any choices, because one choice means it is a monopoly. And youwonder why the costs are skyrocketing.  Mr.Chairman, this should not be about preserving somebody's legacy. It should be about fulfilling those promises to theAmerican people that were broken.

289,topic-id,669,"Madam President, I rise today to speak on a matter of great importance to the foreign policy of thiscountry: our relationship with Russia and the efficacy of international sanctions to achieve our international security goals.  The reports of the past 24 hours are extremely troubling. But one thing we now all agree on is that Russia is behind thehacking of our election, as even the President-elect has now just said. This makes it even more important that we not only keepthe existing sanctions in place but that we institute a new, tough sanctions regime in response so Russia can't get away withwhat they did and other countries will know as well that they will suffer penalty if they try to interfere with our elections.  Unfortunately, this morning's Cabinet hearing on Mr.Tillerson's nomination is a very troubling sign of things to come. Inone breath, Mr.Tillerson said that the invasion of Crimea is a violation of international law, and in the next, amazinglyenough, he declined to commit to maintaining the existing sanctions regime against He said he wants to get classifiedbriefings first and then consult with the President-elect. But I remind the[[Page S224]]country, as my friend the Senator fromFlorida, Mr.Rubio, from across the aisle, did, that these sanctions are a result of past crimes.  We don't need aclassified briefing to know what Russia has done in the past. To duck the question and to refuse to commit to continuing thesesanctions is tantamount to sweeping Russia's flouting of international laws under the rug. It sort of says: Go ahead, interferein our elections again; nothing will happen to you. It says the same to China and Iran or to any other country that might try tohack.  Secretary Nominee Tillerson has also not committed to new sanctions. Just yesterday, abipartisan group of Senators, including the Senators from South Carolina, Maryland, Florida, California, Nebraska, introduced atough, new sanctions-on-Russia bill for their interference in our elections. I support this effort. I believe the Senate shouldact soon upon it. I am very concerned that thus far the President-elect, Mr.Tillerson, and Senator Sessions have notendorsed these tough new sanctions.  The Senator from Florida--not from my party--also pressed Mr.Tillerson on a series of warcrimes committed by the Assad regime and the Russian military in These crimes have been reported in the press anddetailed extensively by people on the ground and discussed at length by my friend, the Republican Senator from Arizona, Mr.Mr.Tillerson will not even acknowledge these violations of human rights and war crimes.  Finally, I am veryconcerned that despite the fact that we have registered lobbying disclosures from ExxonMobil itself, documenting theirinvolvement in lobbying against Iran sanctions, Mr.Tillerson said this morning that Exxon did not lobby on sanctions, to hisknowledge.  This comes on top of recent reports that Exxon avoided Iran's sanctions by dealing with Iran and other statesponsors of terrorism through a European subsidiary. This, too, is very concerning. It raises real questions as to whether thePresident-elect and his Cabinet are prepared to stand up to Putin, stand up to Iran, and represent the interests of the Americanpeople and defend our democratic allies around the world.  My friends on the other side of the aisle have nearly universallycriticized this President, Mr.Obama, for his policy on Syria and for not being tough enough on Vladimir Republicans havealways called themselves the party of I don't need to remind any of them of his famous speech in West Now, itseems, this fundamental tenet of Republican foreign policy, and indeed our national policy for the last few decades, is erodingbefore our very eyes.

It will, as many have repeated across the land over the last fewweeks, make America sick again.  Over the past few weeks, this fact has made some of my more thoughtful colleagues nervous.

No, you doit''--because no one can come up with a repeal plan that keeps the benefits of  This confusion of the Republicans makessense because the Republicans are in a pickle and driving into that box canyon. They promised every conservative group andaudience in the country for the past 8 years that they would repeal health care reform ``root and branch,'' but actually it isonly their base that wants repeal. Most Americans want us to keep the law and work to improve it.  In a recentPolitico/Morning Consult poll, only 28 percent of Americans support repealing the law if there is no current plan for replacingit--less than one-third. This is the Republican base.  Two-thirds of Americans support the provisions that prevent insurancecompanies from denying coverage to patients with preexisting conditions, 63 percent support letting kids stay on their parents'plan until they are 26, and there are similar numbers on the other major benefits of health care reform. Those are the keyfeatures. Those aren't extraneous. Those are the heart and soul of the Affordable Care The Republicans are in a pickle.They cannot please their base and the broader public at the same time so President-Elect Trump says to Congress: You come upwith replace.  The Congress says to the President: You come up with replace.  Abbot and  No replace. Wehaven't seen one yet, and it has been 6 years.  From a policy perspective, our Republican friends can't repeal a law and keepin place the provisions that are overwhelmingly popular with the majority of That is why they are in such a pickle.  The Affordable Care Act is not despised by the American people, only the hard right of the Republican base, which isfervently anti-government. It is an ideology. It doesn't matter how much ACA helps people. If the government did it, we don'twant it. They oppose health care because they oppose everything that government does. They oppose Medicare, Medicaid, evenSocial  If Republicans go forward with this plan, they may mollify their base--the base will stop complaining--butthey will ostracize and hurt the American people and ultimately lose in the court of public opinion.  There is a much moreresponsible course of action that I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to consider: abandon repeal.  We Democratsare willing to work with our Republican colleagues on improving the existing law. We will even look at a comprehensivereplacement plan if they can come up with it. We don't care about credit. You can call it McConnellCare or RepubliCare orRyanCare or It doesn't matter so long as it covers as many people as the ACA, so long as it helps bring health carecosts down, and so long as it doesn't move our health care system backward.  We haven't seen one so far. I am skeptical thatwe ever will, but we will look at one if they can come up with it. Unfortunately, that is not the road we are on. The votetonight is the first step on the road to repeal, which leads straight into that box canyon.  I just want to sincerely urge myRepublican colleagues, especially those who have rightly expressed concern about the very serious consequences of repealingwithout replacement: Vote against this resolution. Put this irresponsible and rushed repeal plan aside. Work with us Democratson a way to improve health care in America, not set it back 8 years. Don't make America sick again. Don't put chaos in place ofaffordable care, which is what you will do if you follow through on this resolution.  The consequences of throwing our systeminto chaos, which the Republican plan will do, are enormous: denying 30 million Americans health coverage, blowing a $1 trillionhole in our deficit, depriving the college graduate from staying on their parent's plan, preventing women from getting fairtreatment, and telling the family whose daughter has a preexisting condition that they can't get coverage, and they will have towatch her get sicker.  That--all of that--falls entirely on the shoulders of my Republican colleagues. I think that is ascenario we all would like to avoid.

905,topic-id,650,"Mr.President, I came to the floor yesterday to voice my serious concernswith some of the remarks made by the Secretary of State nominee, Rex Tillerson, in his hearing.  I was worried that hismilquetoast posture toward Russia, especially his failure to support strong U.sanctions--existing or proposed--bespoke afundamental misreading of the geopolitical climate and the true nature of our international security challenges.  I wasworried that, as Secretary of State, he only promised to recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for a[[Page S298]]period of 12months. Exxon's interests overseas aren't going away after 1 year. That is not good enough to resolve what is, potentially, amassive conflict of interest.  I am worried that Mr.Tillerson, as CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil, conducted business withall three foreign state sponsors of terrorism through a foreign subsidiary in a way that allowed Exxon to evade U.sanctions.As the head of Exxon, Mr.Tillerson did business with the terrorism trifecta: Iran, Syria, and This raises seriousquestions that the man who is nominated to be the face of the United States to the world has so much experience doing businesswith our most prominent and concerning adversaries.  At the hearing, under questions from the senior Senator from New Jerseyand the Senator from Oregon, Mr.Tillerson denied having knowledge of these dealings and directed the Senators to seek moreinformation from ExxonMobil itself. Three times he told the committee that he ``did not recall'' any of the details. Throughoutthe afternoon, it sounded like he was following the dodgeball rules for confirmation hearings: Dodge, dip, duck, dive, anddodge. In fact, he basically admitted it to the junior Senator from  I just read in the Washington Post that, onthree separate occasions, the SEC, or the Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote letters directed to Mr.Tillerson himselfseeking more information on these undisclosed dealings during his tenure as CEO and chairman--once on January 6, 2006, once onMay 4, 2006, and again on December 1, 2010.  In general, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. But it gives megreat concern that Mr.Tillerson says he has zero recollection of an SEC inquiry into his company's business dealings withforeign state sponsors of terrorism--real concern. He got three letters from the SEC on a matter of major, major importance thatwould concern the whole corporation--the giant ExxonMobil--and he says he doesn't recall. This is the kind of matter that shouldbe handled and approved by an organization's most senior leader.  Mr.Tillerson presents himself as a hands-on manager. Itdefies credibility to believe he doesn't recall. This is extraordinarily troubling because either one of two things is true.Either Mr.Tillerson was aware of these SEC letters and was familiar with these dealings but didn't want to answer the questionshonestly, or, indeed, he had no knowledge of consequential financial disclosures made by his own company. If we consider that,in concert with all the other things he claimed to have ``no knowledge of''--including the widely reported extrajudicial killingsin the Philippines, whether or not Saudi Arabia was a human rights violator--imagine, he had no knowledge of whether Saudi Arabiawas a human rights violator; people in a fifth grade world history class would know that--whether or not his company was engagedin lobbying against, or perhaps for, energy sanctions--then maybe Mr.Tillerson does not have the necessary management skills orknowledge base to be the chief diplomat of the United States of America, running a Department that is obviously worldwide,farflung, and with thousands and thousands and thousands of employees.  Simply put,we need answers. What did Mr.Tillerson know and when did he know it? The American people expect their Secretary of State to bestraightforward and honest with them--not coy, not dissembling. Most importantly, they expect him or her to have the interests ofthe American people and our friends and allies around the world at the forefront of their mind.  Unfortunately for Mr.Tillerson, and for this country, yesterday's hearings and today's reports raise more questions than answers. The American peopledeserve answers.

For me, it is verydifferent. When you are born in South Carolina, and you are born on the coast near the Atlantic Ocean, the likelihood of yourbeing a Gamecocks fan and wearing garnet and black is about 75 percent. So I must concede that I still pull for the Gamecocks.That is a controversial position to be in when you are talking about the new national champions.  I would also like to say toSenator Shelby--a man of integrity, character, and long service--thank you for making the bet. I am so glad you lost.  Iwould also say to the Clemson Tigers--the ``Tigers Nation''--we are so incredibly proud of what you have accomplished. It isamazing, not only the successful season that you have had on the field but the character that has been the focus of so much ofthe conversation off the field.  We have talked specifically about 4, Deshaun Watson, and the amazing story about hisrelationship with his mother. I have a special relationship with my mom. So I appreciate his focus and determination to honorher when he is on the field and to continue to honor her when he is off the field. That story is a remarkable story thatdeserves more attention. It really does.  As to Coach Dabo Swinney, is an amazing coach, without any question, but he is alsoan Alabama alum. Having won the national championship as a part of the Alabama football team--I believe it was 1992--you have achampion come into Clemson University and making champions by loving compassionately, by challenging on the field, and byembracing these men and the entire apparatus around the university and college athletics. He has done a fabulous job.  Ithink of the walk-on receiver that Senator Graham mentioned. In every facet of the team--whether you are the so-called waterboy, whether you are the athletic trainer, whether you are a physical therapist--people win because of the team that they are on.There are no self-made success stories.

Mr.Speaker, it is unconscionable to me that the majority is prioritizing a repeal of the Affordable Care Act as its toppriority for the 115th Congress as the Nation's infrastructure crumbles and as the cost of education continues to skyrocket. Itis particularly outrageous that this budget puts the wheels in motion, as my colleague has said, for a repeal of the healthcarelaw without there being anything to take its place.  This budget would also increase our Nation's debt by $9.5 trillion over the next 10 years. Apparently the party that hastried to claim the mantle of balanced budgets for years doesn't really care about fiscal responsibility.

298,topic-id,2235,"Madam President, I am not going to get into a lot of the things that SenatorDurbin got into about increasing the lifespan of Medicare or issues that revolve around folks who get charged more justbecause they are a woman. But I do want to approach this health care debate from a standpoint of how it is going to impact ruralAmerica because it is going to impact rural America in a huge way.  Before I start my prepared remarks, I just want to saysomething. For the last 6 years, I have listened to folks stand on this floor and talk about repealing health care, repealinghealth care, repealing health care. Now the folks on the other side of the aisle can do it if they want. But for the last 6years, I have never seen a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, and I[[Page S227]]still haven't seen a plan. I am going to tellyou that if we repeal this bill without a plan to replace it, we will have big, big problems in this country. And if we repealthis bill without a plan that increases accessibility and affordability across this Nation in urban and rural and frontierareas, we will have big, big problems.  I have been visiting for the last--well, it has been over a year but, morespecifically, since the election, with folks across rural America on the impacts of repealing this health care bill. These arefolks who work to feed our country, farmers and ranchers. These are folks who work with their hands to manufacture products thathave that ``Made in the USA'' stamp on it. These are folks who teach our children, who help keep our families safe, who operateretail businesses on Main These folks, in my opinion, are the backbone of this country.  I am proud to be a productof that rural America, hailing from a town with a population today of about 600 people, so I am not here talking about what isgoing on in Chicago or L.or New York or any of the other big cities. I am going to talk to you about communities where youknow your neighbor; communities where you are driving down the street, and you see that pickup, and you know who is in thatpickup; folks who, when you go down to the local grocery store, you know their first name. These are towns where often thehospital is the largest employer and it is the only source of health care, that foundation that keeps families healthy.  I amhere to talk to you about how this Affordable Care Act has been so important to those families in rural areas in States likemine. By the way, all of Montana is rural.  Today, more Montanans have health insurance than ever before. That is undeniable.Folks are no longer denied coverage by insurance companies because they have preexisting conditions like diabetes nor are theyforced to pay higher premiums because they have common ailments like high blood pressure. Children are able to stay on theirparents' insurance policies for a time until they finish their college career or launch lives of their own. Folks who have life-threatening diseases like cancer can now finish the treatments without hitting an arbitrary cap and being kicked off theirinsurance plan. Now they are required to be able to stay on it. And seniors can get out of the prescription drug doughnut holefaster, which was costing them millions of dollars each and every year. In fact, since the ACA was signed into law, Montanaseniors alone have saved $56 million in prescription drug costs and there is enough money in the bank, as I said in my opening,to keep Medicare above water through 2028.  These reforms have made incredible impacts on people in rural But don'tjust take my word for it; listen to everyday I have been traveling across that State, hearing their stories, hearingtheir struggles, hearing their successes.  Just this weekend, a man stood up at a public forum I was hosting in Missoula andtalked about how the ACA saved his life. He told me that he had a heart attack the previous week. He was home and started havingsome chest pains. He picked up the phone, called his doctor--a doctor who he had, thanks to the insurance he received under the Luckily, he survived his heart attack, was able to get the treatment he needed, and was able to come to my roundtablethat I had in He told me: I know myself, if I did not have insurance, and I could not afford to get it without theACA, I would not have called the doctor, and I would have died. As pointedly as that, he would have died.  I have traveledaround I have found that this story is not unique. I can take you to a coffee shop in Havre--population 8 to10,000--where seniors have told me that they no longer have to choose between prescription drugs and heating their homes.  Ican take you to the grocery store in Great Falls, where a man came up to me and said: ``I finally have peace of mind that Iwon't lose my home if I get sick.''  Or I can introduce you to my best friend growing up in Big Sandy, who now lives inSeattle, who no longer can be denied coverage due to the fact that he has diabetes, a preexisting condition.  These are realsuccess stories and real-life impacts across Montana and across this country. But rather than build on the successes of the ACAand fix the problems with the ACA, there are folks in this body who want a full-scale repeal, ignoring any of the progress thatwe have made.  They want to go back to the old health care system. And here is what that would look like in Montana: 152,000Montanans with preexisting conditions will be at risk of losing their health care plans; 61,000 Montanans enrolled inMedicaid--just in the last year because that is when the Medicaid expansion actually went into effect--will lose their health carecoverage. Montana seniors will lose help paying for their prescription drugs. Insurers will be allowed to subject every Montananto lifetime and annual caps on their coverage. And women will lose important protections that prevent them from being chargedmore for coverage than men.  It doesn't stop there, folks. Their plan to repeal health care coverage without presenting areplacement doesn't just impact families. It will wreak damage on our rural hospitals and clinics too.  I will tell you thatif we lose these hospitals and clinics--and we all know how rural America is drying up--it is another nail in the coffin of ruralFolks will not be able to live there if they are over the age of 50 because they will have no access to health care.  The Affordable Care Act has provided rural hospitals and clinics a level of certainty that, quite frankly, they have neverhad before. Every day in rural communities, folks rely on their local hospitals and clinics for everything from basic checkupsto emergency treatments. I know. And as folks age, they have the peace of mind to know that they can visit their hometownprovider without being forced to travel long distances.  But if folks in Congress take us backto the old health care system, they put these local hospitals and clinics at extreme risk.  Take Mineral County in Superior,The county is home to just over 4,000 people--not a lot by national standards but a lot by Montana standards--nurses,schoolteachers, construction workers, all folks who want reliable access to affordable care. According to the Mineral CountyHospital CEO, a repeal of the ACA would mean a real loss to that community. The hospital would be probably shutting its doors.  Without a hospital in that community, folks would be forced to travel over 100 miles to deliver their baby or take anexpensive air ambulance ride, which is a whole other problem, for emergencies that come down the pike, like a broken arm. And ifI am a new parent or senior, I will not be taking that risk. I am going to be moving closer to a hospital. But there are a lotof folks who can't afford to leave their homes--in some cases, homesteads, where their families have lived for generations--tomove somewhere closer to medical care.  I can tell you that in my small community, there are a lot of folks, who, when theyhit age 65, have to move to a bigger town to be able to have access to the kind of specialty care they need. You can move thatage down to age 50 if we lose these hospitals in these rural areas. These rural hospitals not only keep patients alive; theykeep communities alive too. A repeal of the ACA--I am told by the hospitals--would kill those rural hospitals which, as I saidbefore, would be another nail in the coffin of rural  Let's take, for example, the Billings Clinic, which isMontana's largest health care provider. They are responsible for innovating and providing critical resources to rural areasthrough things like telemedicine. But the Billings Clinic will not be able to make this large-scale impact anymore if theirpatients are no longer able to pay their medical bills because they lost their access to Medicaid, cost-free preventive care, orinsurance from the marketplace. Repealing the ACA will restrict their ability to provide quality care and jeopardize theirstanding as a pillar in  It is not just hospitals either. It is community health centers serving over[[Page S228]]100,000Montanans every year, fully one-tenth of our population. They are at risk of losing 70 percent of their Federal funding.  Letme repeat: If health care progress is repealed, the community health centers in Montana will be at risk of losing 70 percent oftheir Federal funding. These devastating impacts are not unique to Montana, but this is how it is going to play out across thiscountry in rural areas with hospitals and clinics--more uncompensated care, more trips to the emergency room without insurance,more hospitals facing the grim reality of having to close their doors.  Oftentimes I wonder if it really matters to Congress.It looks as if they intend to go through with their plan, which will have devastating impacts on the patients, and, by the way,it will have devastating impacts on their taxpayers.  Repealing this health care coverage without a replacement will add anadditional $350 billion--$350 billion--to the deficit and the debt over the next 10 years, and this budget resolution will saddlethe next generation with an additional $9 trillion in debt over the next decade.  You know, it is amazing. When I came tothis body, there were folks talking about the debt all the time. In the last 2 years, I have heard little talk about the debt.With the exception of Rand Paul, everyone who was supposedly a deficit hawk voted to increase our deficit and debt by $9trillion over the next decade. This would push our total national debt to nearly $30 trillion by year 2026. I stand with RandPaul on this one. Hamstringing the next generation with additional debt is unacceptable, especially when you are taking awaytheir health care coverage to boot.  As folks try to jam this bill through Congress, I have barely heard a peep about thisincrease to the deficit. Oh, my, how times have changed.  The folks who are normally card-carrying Members of fiscalrestraint are now swiping the credit card of the next generation. I dare those Members to go back home and tell their neighborsthat you are going to take away their health coverage, and, oh, by the way, you are going to add about $9 trillion to the debttoo. Try to do that with a straight face.  I will be the first to tell you that the ACA isn't perfect. I have heard that alsoin my travels across Costs have gone up. Premiums are rising. Many hard-working middle-class families cannot affordhealth care. That is unacceptable. So we ought to do something about that.  Let's tackle rising premiums. Let's hold healthinsurance and drug companies accountable. Let's put patients before profits. But I am telling you, repealing all the progress wehave made will not do that. We need to build on the successes we have had in the last few years, not tear them down.  Membersof this body, quite frankly, this is not just a debate about health care. It is a debate about our economy, our growing deficit,the foundation of our rural communities.  The folks in this Congress who are pushing to repeal without a replacement willkick families off their health insurance, close down rural hospitals and clinics, and add $9 trillion to the debt if theysucceed.  Rather than go down this dangerous path, I have a suggestion. Let's roll up our sleeves and work in a bipartisanmanner to increase access and affordability, to lower the cost of care, to bring down prescription drug prices. I will tell you,I am willing to work with anyone: Republican, Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, whoever wants to have a serious conversationabout improving our Nation's health care system. But I am not going to allow folks inthis body to take us back to the old days, the days when our friends and families couldn't afford to get sick.  Members ofthe Senate, it really is time to listen to what is going on, on the ground. We have an opportunity to build on the progress wehave made, and work towards a bipartisan solution that will work for the backbone of this country, the folks in rural  I yield the floor.

1178,topic-id,456,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr.Speaker, I completely agree that this is a bipartisan committee. Here we have a large amount of agreement, but we have adifference of judgment on what is best for the country.  I would say to all Members: We are about to do our job, and that is vote up or down on legislation that would allow GeneralMattis to serve.  Now, we are not irrelevant, because if we don't vote for this legislation, he does not serve. That is what Members areelected to do: to vote. We are about to vote, and we have essentially two choices.  Mr.Speaker, as I made clear, I share many of the concerns about the process, about some of the decisions that thetransition team made. There has been a lot of discussion about this setting a poor precedent; but, actually, there is only oneprecedent before us. That was 1950 with General And General Marshall himself did not testify in front of the House orthe Senate on the waiver legislation.  It was only after the waiver legislation was signed into law that General Marshall came to testify in front of the Senatefor his confirmation hearing. But there is nothing that is different from what we are doing today from the only precedent thatexists. So the notion that we are suddenly irrelevant, that we are harming the House, et cetera, I believe is mistaken.  I hope that we do not have a national security crisis on January 21 or 22, but the fact is, unless we pass this bill today,we are not able to have a Secretary of Defense on January 20. I think, given the state of the world and given a number of otherfactors, it is important that we do so.                              {time}  1500  Just two other brief points, Mr. The press is reporting that the White House has indicated that President Obama will sign this legislation. I hope he does.That would ensure that General Mattis, if confirmed by the Senate on January 20, will go ahead and be sworn in and take officeat that point.  There are, as I have said, many concerns about how this was handled--the wording, et cetera. The bottom line, as some of mycolleagues have mentioned, is that there are men and women who have volunteered to serve our Nation even at the risk of theirown lives. There are Americans throughout the country who depend on those men and women to keep them safe and secure. All ofthem deserve to have a Secretary of Defense who is fully functional on day one of the administration. The only way that happensis to vote ``yes.'' I urge my colleagues to do so.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH520.txt,1155,JACKI DIXON MARSH,2017.0,13.0,January

Thischart next to me here shows, all across the country in State after State, premiums have skyrocketed.Citizens also face deductibles that are so high that they try to get by without going to a doctor.  One constituent from Roseville, Illinois, whose insurance costs have gone up 75 percent, stated to me recently: ``This iscrazy. Almost half of my paycheck goes to insurance. How do they expect us to afford this?''  These burdensome costs stifle families and our small businesses' ability to participate in and help grow our economy.

1118,topic-id,1090,"Mr.Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, there are several perspectives, important perspectives, to health care and health insurance: one, value deliveredto patients in terms of insurance plan options, choice of doctors, access to treatment, and, most importantly, health outcomes;two, health insurance premiums and healthcare cost sharing; three, budgetary cost to the Federal and State governments; four,supply of healthcare services, including by doctors and hospitals and through medications; and fifth, indirect costs to theeconomy, such as reduced job creation and labor force participation.  The Affordable Care Act fails on all five counts, and that is why we are here today, to start the process of repealing andreplacing it. The program is dysfunctional, and its costs have become and will become more unsustainable.  Supposedly, the central objective for passing the ACA was to insure those who did not have coverage. I was there.  Yet, the increased government sprawl shown in this chart inhealth care is striking.  The Joint Economic Committee chart from the time of the law's passage illustrates the law's mind-numbing complexity.Unsurprising to anyone skeptical of bureaucratic solutions, the Obama healthcare system has not worked.  Instead of empowering innovators, doctors, patients, ObamaCare has implemented a complex scheme that relies on unelectedbureaucrats. And this chart demonstrates that clearly.  Mr.Chair, ObamaCare means fewer choices. In fact, Kimberly, a constituent in my district, recently told me that she had abrain tumor. She said:       Virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance, so I      am left to changedoctors who I have seen for 30 years and      switch to new doctors who I don't trust and cannot provide      the same healthcare benefitsthat I have received in the past.  Traumatic for her.  Remarkably, the enrollment failure is happening, despite penalties on individuals failing to obtain coverage and onemployers failing to provide it.  Even with billions of dollars in subsidies, in my opinion, this illustrates that many would likely prefer to trade theirsubsidies for more flexibility, the choice of their own doctors, and useful alternatives.  ObamaCare also means higher premiums. Ohioans, on the individual marketplace, have seen increased premiums by 111 percentsince passage of ObamaCare, and now in my State, the average premium is over $5,000.  Republicans agree that the system needs reform, but ObamaCare cannot be reformed. The argument that parts of the Americanhealthcare insurance system were not working previously, and that more people now have health insurance, is irrelevant to thedecision to repeal Nobody claims that the former system was perfect. I certainly don't.  Certainly, the government can increase coverage with subsidies, increase coverage with mandates, but what has it done to theunderlying health care that is being provided?  The extent and method by which ObamaCare increases coverage has caused huge and unnecessary collateral damage to all othersin the marketplace, all others with respect to patient choice of their doctors, the quality of the care that they are receiving,the supply of health care, and, certainly, State and Federal budgets.  The focus of ObamaCare advocates has been almost exclusively on increasing the number of insured by government subsidy andmandate. I get that. I understand that, but not on maximizing healthy outcomes. Those aren't the same things.  Health insurance is not an end in itself. Effective treatment to healthcare problems is.  Private investment is so needed to push forward medical discoveries, innovation, accelerate drug development, personalizemedicine, and harness technology to coordinate our health care and help administrate it.  There is a better way. You will hear from the other side of the aisle that Republicans have no plan to replace ObamaCare.Here are the plans. It is just not true. The goal of the Republican plan is not to go back to the way things were beforeObamaCare; it is to move forward.  We want to facilitate a well-functioning market in health care, and health insurance as well. In the United States, we letthe marketplace work things out. Republicans want to fix those obstacles and make it better.  Among the features of the Better Way is: portability, patient-centered care, insurance across State lines, medical liabilityreform, new mechanisms for small businesses and individuals to power together to negotiate, flexibility for our Governors, apatient-centered, patient-focused program.  The government has a role and a responsibility to provide support for those who can't afford it, for those who fall throughthe cracks. A refundable tax credit is part of our plan, addressing preexisting conditions is part of our plan, and keepingdependents up to 26 on their parents' plan is part of our plan.[[Page H508]]  But the deeper points to recognize are: One, there is no reason why a free market could not offer insurance to individualsthat provides continuous coverage throughout their lives. There is no reason that helping the poor should not limit the choicesand flexibilities of everyone else, which ObamaCare has done, much less interfere with the larger economy.  Moreover, the law has had an impact on employment. I see it every week. Economics Professor Casey Mulligan of the Universityof Chicago estimated that the ACA taxes will affect nearly half of the working population in America, reducing average wages,hours worked, and  And based upon CBO estimates, the overall impact of the ACA on the supply of labor will become progressively worse as timepasses.  ObamaCare took certain problems in healthcare insurance--a large number of uninsured, lack of individual coverage forpreexisting conditions, higher premiums for individuals--and used them as an excuse to create socialized medicine.  The repeal of ObamaCare will take us off that path and replacement will offer shortcomings to other problems.  Going forward, Republicans stand ready to provide support away from ObamaCare through a transition. And getting an improvedhealthcare system in place improves consumer choice.  I understand the anxiety that many are feeling right now listening to the Democrats tell them that health care is going tobe yanked out from under them.  When I was a kid, my dad, a steel worker, lost his job. We lost our health care. We lost our insurance. I know what thatanxiety is like. And I want to assure everyone today, that is not what we are doing here today.  I know what we are doing here today. We are empowering patients. We are empowering doctors, not bureaucrats. We are givingthem more choices, more opportunities, and a better healthcare system.  Mr.Chair, I ask that we support this resolution.  I yield back the balance of my time.

730,topic-id,280,"Mr.Chairman, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act subjects the SEC to enhanced cost-benefit analysisrequirements and requires a review of existing regulations.  By promoting economic analysis requirements during the regulatory process, this bill ensures that regulation writing is datadriven and not done on an ad hoc basis with little thought to the true impact the expanding regulatory net has on businesses andthe economy.  It is a mistake for regulators overseeing our financial system and the capital markets, including the SEC, to promulgateregulations without fully considering the costs and benefits, as well as all of the available regulatory alternatives.  This bill also takes the commonsense approach of requiring the SEC to evaluate whether a proposed regulation is inconsistentwith, or duplicative of, other Federal regulations. When our businesses are being overwhelmed by compliance obligations thatdemand more and more time and resources, it is crucial that our regulators do everything in their power to ensure thatregulations are effective, streamlined, and nonduplicative to minimize impact.  It is important to note that this legislation does not limit the SEC's rulemaking authority in any capacity. The billappropriately strengthens the SEC's existing cost-benefit-related requirements to ensure that the true impact of regulations canbe calculated.  To advocate for the status quo and against this legislation shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the financial system andthe regulatory process. This legislation is a vote of confidence that, with the appropriate tools and a data-driven approach,our regulatory agencies can create a framework of safety and soundness that does not unduly burden our economy.  I am happy to lend my support to this bill and encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense measure. I, again, thankthe gentlewoman from Missouri for her efforts on this legislation.

They are rescinding provisions that prevent insurance companies from charging women more than men, or fromdenying benefits because of preexisting conditions.  This is unconscionable.

183,topic-id,760,"Mr.Chair, last May, Democrats and Republicans came together to pass the first major environmental law indecades, the Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Before this reform, it had been widely acknowledgedthat the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, was broken. The law was hampered by litigation since shortly after it was passedin 1976, and was rendered almost completely ineffective.  It has only been 7 months since over 400 Members voted for this reform, which requires a number of new rulemakings by the A primary motivation to reform TSCA was to remove procedural hurdles that were preventing the EPA from regulating dangerouschemicals. But the bill before us today would impose new, unnecessary obstacles in the rulemaking process, which will impedeagencies that already are struggling with shrinking budgets and time constraints.  Even some of the Members that had concerns with TSCA reform, myself included, would agree that it is imperative that theserulemakings go forward efficiently in order to protect public health and to give the private sector the certainty that it asksfor when it supported the reform effort.  Unlike 233 of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I did not vote for this bill; but I do firmly believe that therulemakings required by this law must be done effectively and quickly. Unfortunately, the bill before us today would underminethat process. For the record, I do not believe any amendments will fix the underlying bill, and I hope my colleagues will opposethis bill later today.  While Congress has moved on to other priorities, the EPA has been hard at work implementing the law as Congress intended.Since being signed into law in June, the EPA has already put into place new processes to review new chemicals, which is exactlywhat this House instructed them to do.  A number of rulemakings will soon get underway focused on how the EPA prioritizes chemicals for evaluation and how it willconduct risk evaluations. Other rules regarding the EPA's chemical inventory and the process for collecting fees will also beneeded.  The Members that worked on TSCA reform deferred many of these procedural decisions to the EPA because we lacked theexpertise necessary to determine every detail of the most effective, streamlined regulatory process.  We are not toxicologists or chemists, so we empowered the scientists that do this work to receive public feedback and createregulations, based on congressional intent, within a reasonable amount of time.  It is clear that an overwhelming number of Members of the House believe that the EPA needed these tools when we passed theLautenberg bill to fix the EPA's chemical program. Let's not tie the agency's hands as it seeks effective implementation. Wehave seen what happens with a broken chemical safety law. Let's not go back to that.  I would also caution against the bill's requirement to choose the least costly regulatory option. People familiar with TSCAwill know the term ``least burdensome,'' which required the EPA to select the restriction that was demonstrated to be the leastburdensome to address identified risks.  In practice, this requirement was so onerous that the EPA was not even able to restrict known carcinogens like asbestos. TheLautenberg bill ended this requirement. Let's not reinstate this problem for our agencies.  Personally, I do not believe my amendment goes far enough. We should exempt every major environmental law responsible forprotecting Americans' air, water, and land from this bill.  We have seen in many cases that these rules do not hurt the economy. They protect public health and provide much greaterbenefits to society than costs.  Many of our bedrock environmental statutes require agencies to review and update their rules periodically. Members ofCongress should not prevent an agency from simply doing the job that is required of it under the law.  But in terms of this amendment and TSCA reform, Congress knew exactly what would be asked of the EPA in order to carry outthe Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act when we passed it by a vote of 403-12 just a few months ago.We cannot tell the EPA to do something and then tie its hands and expect it to get it done.  This amendment is simple. Do Members of this body want to give our regulatory agencies the tools they need to implement thelaws that Congress has passed? And, in my view, it should not matter if these laws were passed 6 months ago or 60 years ago. Orshould we make it more difficult to implement effective rulemakings, even when there is legislative consensus about the need forthem?  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

Agencies are already required to publish relevant data in support of a rule during these rulemaking processes. Rules that donot appear to be based on a reasoned analysis of relevant data may be vacated by reviewing courts as arbitrary or capricious.Moreover, data acquired through federally funded research is already accessible to researchers who have a legitimate purpose.  I am also concerned that because this amendment does not define scientific information or clarify the scope of thispublication requirement, peer reviewed materials may be taken out of context or otherwise misused for political purposes. In sodoing, this requirement may chill feedback in the scientific community, undermine agencies' ability to adopt the best rulespossible, or otherwise manufacture delays in the rulemaking process.  Any additional requirements in this area should strengthen, rather than weaken, the process of science-based[[Page H363]]rulemaking.

Repeal would return everyone to the days of big insurance companiesand their denying of needed care due to annual and lifetime limits on coverage. Repeal would mean higher costs for individualswho seek routine preventative care, like mammograms or birth control.  This is not what the people want. People are sick and tired of Republicans playing political games with their health care.The Affordable Care Act is not perfect. Deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, and prescription drug prices are still too high formany working families. People are frustrated when they are faced with narrow networks or surprise medical bills.  Unfortunately, these are not the problems that Republicans are focused on fixing. In fact, the only problem Republicans seemto be trying to solve is that too many people have health insurance. Republicans want to roll back the progress that has beenmade and create a healthcare system that eliminates the guarantees of affordable coverage, by which families will face evenhigher deductibles and copays--a concept they euphemistically call ``skin in the game,'' and those with preexisting conditions,including expectant mothers, would again face a closed door instead of care.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH453-3.txt,1942,PROVIDING FOR EXCEPTION TO LIMITATIONAGAINST APPOINTMENT OF PERSONS AS,2017.0,12.0,January

He is Christopher He has been mychief of staff for 6 years. After 6 years of extraordinary service, he has decided that he is going to move on to the privatesector. I want to say a few words about Christopher's background and his contribution to my office, to our country, and thepeople of  Christopher is actually from New He is a native of Rye After growing up in NewHampshire, he earned his degree in biology at Brown University and then went on to get a law degree from I can assureeveryone he has recovered from his educational experience to a very extensive degree.  He went into law and practiced at thelaw firm of Latham & Watkins in Los Angeles and He had a very successful time there, but he decided he wanted tocome to Washington and work in government and, specifically, work on the He went to work for Judd Gregg, Senator Greggfrom New Hampshire, and Christopher Gahan, I understand, had almost every job that a Senate office has. He started at the verybeginning, but because of his enormous talents and his ability and hard work, he relatively quickly rose and became chief ofstaff for Senator  When I was elected to the Senate in 2010, I got a call within a matter of weeksfrom Christopher, and he said he wanted to come and meet with me and discuss the fact that I needed a chief of staff. He droveup to We had lunch, and I decided almost immediately that this guy would probably do a great job. He clearly had theattributes that I was looking for.  I should also point out some of the things that are perhaps not as widely known aboutChristopher outside of my office. One is that he is a tremendous athlete. He has been for a long time. When he was in college,he was on the varsity men's water polo team. He was cocaptain at Brown, he was All-Ivy League, and to this day, he gets up at 4or 5 o'clock every morning and usually goes for a run. He occasionally bangs out a marathon and thinks nothing of it. He hasquite a diverse range of talents.  He also has a very peculiar taste in certain things. He loves all things related to cats,except the animals themselves. I don't understand that. Maybe it is an allergy; I am not sure exactly what it is. If you look athis desk area, he has funny photos of cats, little porcelain cats, little masks of cats, and a calendar of cats. He loves allthings cats, except the animals themselves. It is quite remarkable.  Having said all of that about his background, what Ireally want to say is how fortunate Pennsylvania and I have been to have Christopher Gahan serving in this capacity. As I said,from the day that I had lunch with Christopher, I knew he could do a great job. I knew he had that ability. I had very highexpectations for what he could do, and he has exceeded those expectations every day. It has really been quite amazing. He is avery intelligent man, but more importantly, he has great judgment and a great ability to work with people.  The role he hasplayed in my office has been absolutely tremendous. For example, he is very knowledgeable about a number of issue areas, but healways understood that his role was to help the legislative assistants who had responsibilities for those areas. Christopher'srole was to make sure that they were able to do the work they were assigned to do and to really shine and get a chance to exceland to grow personally. While he could have inserted himself in that dynamic, he never did. He always chose to empower[[Page S225]]thepeople who worked under him, and he created an environment where people loved to come to work every day. They loved to workhard. They wanted to do well for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is they wanted to continue to earn the respect ofChristopher  Needless to say, he is extremely well liked, both within the office and on the I know how oftenother chiefs, other Members, people who come to us with concerns from Pennsylvania--they have praised his even-handed, verythoughtful, very hard-working approach. He has truly enabled us to have a very successful office for these last 6 years, and Iam very grateful to him.  He is moving on to the private sector, and I understand that. He has served me and my office, ourState and our country very well. He deserves the change that he has embraced, and I think he is going to do very well. I am surehe will, and I wish him every success. My only insistence is that he stay in touch because he has become a very good friend andhe is just a great source of advice.  Lastly, he is a great patriot. He loves this country. He has served it well, and we aregoing to miss him.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

10,topic-id,610,"Mr.Speaker, House Republicans are playing politics with millions of Americans' health care. Infact, if Republicans go forward with their plan to chaotically dismantle the Affordable Care Act, 30 million Americans will losehealth insurance. In New York State alone, 1.6 million of our neighbors, who gained coverage through ACA, will see their healthinsurance taken away; and 2.7 million New Yorkers who have enrolled in Medicaid could lose coverage.  But let us remember that this is not just about New In fact, the sad irony is that many of the Americans who willlose and be most devastated by repeal of this law are in red States and counties, the places that voted for President-electThose areas have high numbers of Americans on the Medicaid rolls. Already, States like Idaho, Nebraska, South Dakota, andGeorgia are putting Medicaid expansion on hold, waiting to see how action on the ACA plays out. That means half a millionAmericans will have to wait for health benefits.  But let's keep in mind that this is not just about Medicaid and it is not just about those who obtained coverage through theexchanges. What we need to remember is that all the elements of healthcare reform work together. If you start chipping away atone part of the system, you will see disasters in other parts of the market.  This is about the young person, just out of college, who can stay on their parents' insurance until they are 26, giving themtime to secure employment and coverage on their own. It is about patients with a preexisting condition who, until the ACA, werebarred[[Page H306]]from securing quality medical insurance. It is about women who have, time and again, faced gender discrimination inthe insurance market.  Just this past Saturday, New Yorkers in my district rallied together to oppose Republican plans to roll back the ACA andmake America sick again. We heard from our local hospitals and healthcare providers who talked about how they will be affectedby a dramatic surge in charity care. Nationally, healthcare providers could get stuck with $88 billion in 2019 alone and $1.1trillion from 2019 to 2028 in uncompensated care. This will strain resources and make it harder for them to provide care to alltheir patients.  And we heard from ordinary working people who have benefited from the ACA, people like Juana Alvarez, who was able, for thefirst time, to secure coverage for herself and her family through this law. We heard from Susan Maples, who told us she wouldnot have been able to start her own business without the health benefits afforded under These are the people Republicansare planning to harm with their irresponsible, chaotic, and destructive attack on our health system.  Now, let me also note this: The Republican slogan ``repeal and replace'' is a sham.  What are they going to replace the ACA with?  They have never--not once--put together a realistic, defensible plan to replace the The Republican plan is not repeal andreplace. It should be called ``repeal and displace'' because it will mean displacing millions of Americans from their healthcoverage.  So let's be clear. If you are voting to take away the ACA, you are voting to take away health care from millions. And forthose who do retain their employer-based coverage, you are voting to increase their premiums, as millions of healthy Americansare taken out of the insurance pool. This is a recipe for disaster. It is a plan to make America sick again, and it cannotstand.  I urge my colleagues to think about what you are doing. Think about going home and looking in the eyes of your constituentsand telling them you voted to take away their health coverage.

143,topic-id,483,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act has reduced regulatory costs by $130 billion since 1998. However, it could do better. Theamendment I am offering will improve this process.  However, unlike the underlying bill, my amendment is actually aligned with the original statute, which was created toprotect the unique needs of small businesses in the regulatory process, not to stop regulations. My amendment is also much morecost effective to the taxpayers, as the underlying bill creates a massive and unnecessary government bureaucracy. It should benoted that my amendment is based on bipartisan legislation from a previous Congress, which the committee reported by a recordedvote of 26-0.  The amendment makes improvements to the most significant deficiencies facing the Regulatory Flexibility Act without theoverly broad changes contained in the underlying bill. This includes making sure that agencies live up to their obligations toretrospectively review the burdens of existing rules on small businesses. The GAO has reported on numerous occasions that agencycompliance with this requirement was poor. My amendment holds the agencies more accountable by requiring them to report theresults of their reviews to Congress annually.  My amendment also takes steps to make analyses more detailed so that agencies cannot ignore the RFA and simply certify thata rule has no significant economic impact on small businesses. Addressing this matter will ensure that agencies are required toprovide a more factual basis for such certifications rather than just a sentence which dismisses the concerns of small firms.  The most important aspect of my amendment is what it does not do. Unlike H.5, my amendment does not create a newgovernmentwide bureaucracy or foist a truckload of new responsibilities on the Office of Advocacy, which only has a $9 millionbudget.  For instance, H.5 requires the Office of Advocacy to approve size standards, a function already handled by the Thisis like creating a Rayburn cafeteria next to the Rayburn cafeteria. It is ridiculous. This is a complete waste of taxpayerresources and will, ironically, take the Office of Advocacy away from its core mission of monitoring regulations.  Also, another aspect that is very important, what this legislation does is it is setting the Office of Advocacy to fail.They do not have the expertise. They do not have the resources. In addition, H.5 imposes the panel process across the entiregovernment. I will say that again. Across the entire government, including all independent agencies. So much for fiscalresponsibility. There is another complete waste of taxpayer resources, and it will further limit the Office of Advocacy'sability to weigh in on the most important matters affecting small businesses.  Instead, my amendment makes the targeted changes to the RFA that small businesses have called for over the last 5 years. Indoing so, it is cost effective and responsible to the taxpayers.

740,topic-id,341,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, my amendment is simple and straightforward. It will help ensure the SEC fulfills one of its core missionfunctions--protecting investors.  As Members of Congress, we must never forget the lessons of the financial crisis and the Great Americans lost $14trillion, suffering sharp declines in retirement savings, pension funds, and overall wealth. This was due, in part, to beingpushed into abstract and sophisticated financial products and securities that they knew little or nothing about.  I was here in 2008, Mr.I listened to the people. I heard their stories. Unfortunately, for many of them, thefinancial crisis and the Great Recession caused deep and lasting harm. Many may never recover.  I proudly supported the Dodd-Frank Act and believe the SEC has implemented many regulations that will guard against anotherfinancial crisis and help preserve the financial future of American families for generations to come. For these reasons, I amconcerned the regulatory reviews required by the underlying bill do not properly account for investor protection.  To that end, my amendment ensures the SEC does more than just consider how a proposed regulation will impact businesses. Itexpressly instructs the SEC to weigh the safeguards of investors when changing a rule or regulation. My amendment instructs theSEC to continue focusing on investor protection not only when drafting new rules but also when reviewing existing regulations.Let me be clear: it is vitally important that this language be included to ensure investors' needs do not take a backseat toindustry concerns.  We must never go back to the days leading up to the crisis, Mr.By simply instructing the SEC to take into accountinvestor protections when reviewing and considering new or existing regulations, my amendment helps ensure the safeguards we putin place under the Dodd-Frank Act are preserved. This will mean retirement savings and household wealth are more secure, and weare not once again risking deep and lasting harm to our economy and financial markets. For these reasons, I urge the adoption ofmy amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH428.txt,1184,83,2017.0,12.0,January

Mr.Chairman, if Republicans go forward with thisplan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, 30 million Americans will lose health insurance. In New York State alone, 1.6 millionof our neighbors--who gained coverage through ACA--will lose their health insurance and will see their health insurance takenaway, and 2.7 million New Yorkers who have enrolled in Medicaid could lose coverage.  But this is not just about Medicaid, and it is not just about who obtained coverage through the exchanges. This is about theyoung person just out of college who can stay on their parents' insurance until they turn 26, giving them time to secureemployment and coverage on their own. It is about patients with preexisting conditions who, until the ACA, were blocked fromsecuring quality medical insurance. It is about women who have faced gender discrimination in the insurance market. These arethe people Republicans will harm with their irresponsible attack on our healthcare system.  Now, let me also note this: the Republican slogan, repeal and replace, is a sham. What are they going to replace the ACAwith?

Mr.Chair, I am proud to sponsor and bring to the floor H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability This legislationfits perfectly with the theme of the week here in the House to advance key regulatory reform ideas as a change of pace from theoutgoing administration.  For the past 8 years, the amount of regulatory burden that has been placed on Americans and small businesses has beencrushing. In 2015, Federal regulation cost almost $1.9 trillion. That is nearly $15,000 per household in a hidden compliancetax.  The Obama administration issued over 600 economically significant rules, which are those that have an economic impact ofover $100 million. As a result of this wave of regulations, we have been part of the slowest economic recovery in our lifetimes.  We now have an opportunity to enact policy that ensures smart regulation going forward so that we are doing things in thebest and most efficient way. The people have spoken, Mr.Business as usual in Washington is over and it is time to dothings differently. There is, indeed, a better way.  This legislation is really about what everyday Americans do when they are making major life decisions in weighing the costsand the benefits, the pros and the cons. Whether it is buying a car, buying a home, deciding whether to take out a loan to go toschool, everyone must consider the core economic factors when making important life decisions.  The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act places statutory requirements on the SEC when issuing rulemaking that ensures that,first, they identify the problem that regulation is trying to address; second, they weigh the cost and benefits to ensure thatthe benefits justify costs of compliance; and thirdly, they identify and assess whether there are any available alternatives torulemaking.  Additionally, this bill contains a provision that requires the SEC to review its existing regulations every 5 years, at theminimum, to determine whether any such regulations are outdated, ineffective, or excessively burdensome, as well as requiringthe SEC to modify, streamline, repeal, or even to expand regulations based on that review.  As a regulator of our capital markets, the SEC has an immeasurable influence on our economy and the ability of smallbusiness and entrepreneurs to be able to access capital in order to innovate, grow, and most of all, create jobs.  I strongly believe that this legislation is nonpartisan and common sense and what our government regulators should have beendoing in the first place. The American people deserve a break from the irresponsible regulation they have grown accustom to overthe past 8 years. There is a better way.

Mr.I really want to thank Chairman Walker of the RSC, the Republican Study I greatlyappreciate the gentleman's leadership on this event here tonight as well as the great job the gentleman is doing on the Mr.Speaker, we have had alternatives to the Affordable Care Act ever since I have been here. The American Health CareReform Act, as put forward by the Republican Study Committee, has many of the elements we have all been talking about forseveral years: with the Affordable Care Act being forced upon Americans not in a bipartisan effort but strictly by the votes ofone party when they had the majority--the ability--to force it[[Page H379]]through. We are suffering the effects of that now.  One of my colleagues earlier was talking about: Why isn't this being reported? Why isn't this being talked about in thebroad sense of how it is really affecting the Americans who are paying for it?  People in my district, ever since I have been a Member of this House, have been pleading with us to do something about thesehigh premiums, about the high deductibles, about the lack of access they have, especially in rural areas. Why are the proponentscontinuing to prop this up? It is clear that it doesn't work: higher costs, fewer options, unworkable plans. The exchanges--wehave watched in several States--most of them, after billions in investment, are shuttering; they are closing up shop. Where dothose billions go that we have invested as a country into these exchanges?                              {time}  1945  But on a patient level, it is putting even more of our most vulnerable patients on a system already known to beunsustainable without even ensuring access to quality care. In some cases, no care at all.  How are people defining that as a success?  We know that the main reason why so many people are uninsured is the high cost of coverage. But instead of investing vastamounts of money to bring more people into a broken system, let's take this opportunity to start fixing the root of the problem.  One, this is done by increasing competition, giving patients more options, choices. Mr.Speaker, give them a menu of optionsthey can pick themselves, tailor the plan to what they need. A 20-year-old young man has a completely different need than a 30-year-old mom and her family. Let them have the choices.  Also, let's get rid of the costly mandates, the taxes. There are taxes on everything, it seems, to help prop up ObamaCare,the Affordable Care Act, including the cost for students for college. They are paying for some of that.  Then let's build off successes that we have seen in the past and that are part of the proposal of the Republican StudyCommittee and the American Healthcare Reform That could help fill our gaps in the healthcare delivery system.  Community health centers, for example, is a model that is both cost effective and efficient in expanding access to careservices in underserved areas, very rural ones, such as my own district at home.  Healthcare reform affects the lives of every single person in this country, which is why it is high time that we put thehealth and well-being of the American people ahead of partisan politics and legacies.  Let's get to work and deliver actual solutions that empower patients, drive down the costs, and increase access to care inevery part of the country. Let's give back to Americans: ``Keep your plan that you like, keep your doctor that you like.''

It is actually easy, even week afterweek after week, because it only takes reading the news. If we look back at the headlines and dubious milestones of 2016, wefind plenty to talk about.  Last year was hot. NASA and NOAA are expected to certify later this month that 2016 was thehottest year in recorded history, exceeding the previous record set by 2015 and the previous record set by 2014. What this meansis, 2014, 2015, and 2016 have each succeeded the last as the three hottest years on record.  The United Nations WorldMeteorological Organization found that the world was 1.2 degrees Celsius or over 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in 2016 than it wasbefore the Industrial Revolution and the dawn of wide-scale fossil fuel use.  We are careening closer and closer to the 2-degree Celsius mark which scientists say brings, to quote Donald Trump in 2009, ``catastrophic'' and ``irreversible'' climateeffects.  In 2016, climate change continued to make some places almost unrecognizable. Up north in the Arctic things gotbizarre. Thermometers spiked in mid-November to almost 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, with a 37-year low in thenearby sea ice. The peaks were about 50 degrees above normal, and around Christmas it actually rose above freezing at the Imagine, the snow was actually beginning to melt at the North Pole just as Santa was loading his sleigh with  In the tropics, undersea forests of once colorful coral stood bone white as the Great Barrier Reef experienced thegreatest bleaching and coral die-off on record. What happens is that the superwarm water stressed the corals. That forces themto expel the tiny algae that lives symbiotically with the coral, providing them their food, and that is what gives coral reefstheir beautiful color and their life. When the algae go, the coral structures turn ghostly white. They often do not recover.  It is not just the Great Barrier My clips today included a story from Japan, whose biggest coral reef has just beendetermined to be 70 percent dead.  The researchers in Australia found severe bleaching throughout the Great Barrier TheGuardian reported in March that ``93 percent of the 3,000 individual reefs [had] been touched by bleaching, and almost a quarter. . . [had] been killed by this bleaching event.''  By November, around two-thirds of the northern portion of the GreatBarrier Reef had died, with some atolls suffering complete devastation. Warming is at the heart of that catastrophe.  We alsoknow from the physical laws of thermal expansion that as ocean water warms, it does something else. It expands. The oceans alsoare taking in melting water from our shrinking glaciers. Together, those factors are causing sea levels to rise worldwide. Lastyear, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences predicted that at our current pace, over 90 percent of the world'scoastal areas will experience almost 8 inches of sea level rise by 2040. Year 2040 is not that far away. On the Atlantic coastof the United States, it will be more than 15 inches. By 2040, a house that you bought on the coast today could be literallyunderwater before you paid off your 30-year mortgage. The real estate business is starting to take notice.  Zillow, theonline real estate marketplace, has released a tool for users to show how potential sea level rise by 2100 would affect the over100 million U.homes in its database. Around 1 in 50 homes in the United States, or just under 2 million properties, will findtheir ground floors underwater by 2100 if we don't get ahead of this. Thirty-six U.cities would be considered ``completelylost''--those are their words--``completely lost,'' and another 300 cities would lose at least half their homes. This doesn't eveninclude commercial or public properties.  Government-backed mortgage giant Freddie Mac is girding for broad losses fromclimate-driven flooding. ``The economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually,'' it wrote in an April 2016 report,``but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession.''  Let me saythat again. The economic losses ``are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and GreatRecession.''  The report says some of the effects of climate change may not even be insurable and, unlike our 2008 housingcrash, owners of homes that are subsumed by rising seas would have little expectation of their homes' values ever returning and,therefore, little incentive to continue to make mortgage payments through the crisis, and that, in turn, adds to steeper lossesfor lenders and insurers.  Remember that Donald Trump signed, along with his children, this full-page ad in the New YorkTimes in 2009. Here is what it said, speaking as Americans:       [W]e must embrace the challenge todayto ensure that future      generations are left with a safe planet and a strong economy.      . . .  He said to the President inthis advertisement:       We support your effort to ensure meaningful and effective      measures to controlclimate change, an immediate challenge      facing the United States and the world today.  It went on:       Please don't postpone the earth. If we fail to act now, it      is scientifically irrefutable--  Let me repeat hiswords--     scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic      and irreversibleconsequences for humanity and our planet.  That is what Donald Trump and his family said in a 2009 ad, ``catastrophic andirreversible.''  We have been warned.  President-Elect Trump also pledged to ``drain the swamp''here in Washington of corporate insiders and special interests. But we don't see that. We see an alligator pack of climatedeniers, oil executives, and Koch brothers flunkies nominated to fill his Cabinet, his White House, and his executive agencies.  The Koch brothers, Exxon, and other special fossil fuel interests stand on one side. On the other side stand our military,our National Labs, and  Let me put in a little footnote on They have a rover driving around on the planet Marsright now. Do you think their science might be OK? And, on the other side, also, I think, is every university in the UnitedStates of That is the choice: The fossil fuel guys, led by the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil, and the whole array ofphony baloney front groups that they have stood up to try to mask their hand, or the virtually complete science establishment ofthe world, every Nation, our military, our National Labs, and all of our universities. Who are you going to believe?[[Page S230]]Theones with the huge conflict of interest or the people who know what they are talking about?  Well, too many people in thisroom have made the wrong choice, but we need to fix it.  In Rhode Island, some good things happened last year. After over 8years of work, we have the Nation's first offshore wind farm. Thirty megawatts, five turbines came online in December 2016--theBlock Island Wind I am proud of Deepwater Wind for getting it done. I am proud of Rhode Island for establishing a processfor siting an approval that is now a national model. It is part of a transformation that happened, emphasized in 2016, and thatwas jobs in the renewable energy industry taking off.  At the end of 2016, we had 400,000 wind and solar jobs, and by 2020,that number is expected to be 600,000. As employment climbs in these industries, costs for renewable technologies continues todrop compared to fossil fuels.  Last year we saw new records for electricity generation from renewable sources. Texas windgeneration hit a record 15 gigawatts in December of last year, meeting 45 percent of the State's power needs, with 18,000megawatts installed and another 5,000 megawatts under construction.  In Iowa, MidAmerican Energy is planning to add 2,000megawatts of new wind by 2019. Once installed, 85 percent of the energy MidAmerican generates will be renewable.  Wecontinued to make real progress internationally in 2016 as well. Earth Day was the signing ceremony for the historic Parisclimate agreement. Nearly 200 nations pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. By October, we met the threshold forratification of that agreement, when over 55 countries officially joined, and the agreement was fully adopted in  Just this week, over 630 companies and major investment firms, with a combined 1.8 million employees and $1.15 trillion inannual revenue, called on President-Elect Trump, us in Congress, and global leaders to continue to participate in and implementthe Paris Agreement to ``create jobs and boost U.competitiveness.''  This is the business community saying that the ParisAgreement will create jobs and boost U.competitiveness.  Signatories included food giants General Mills, Kellogg's,Campbell's Soup, and Mars; apparel companies VF Corporation, Nike and Levi's; and other corporate heavy weights like Monsanto,DuPont, Intel, and Johnson &  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the ``Business Backs Low-Carbon USA''letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I sure hope President-Elect Trump will heed this callfrom the leaders of the business community.  Closing word: Secretary of State Kerry, in addition to providing greatleadership through this, has also started doing something that I know is precious to him and that is important to me and many ofour colleagues; that is, to give oceans the global attention they deserve. In September, more than 90 countries convened here inWashington for the Our Ocean Nations, nonprofit organizations, foundations, and big corporations all came togetherpledging over $5 billion for marine conservation and committing to protect more than 1.5 million square miles of ocean.Secretary Kerry secured the legacy of the Our Ocean Conference by locking in hosts for the conference for the next 3 years.  So 2016 was a year of worsening climate effects but also of heartening climate action. The dramatic changes taking place inthe Earth's climate are now undeniable, but so is the growing spirit of action among men and women of good conscience across theUnited States and around the world. One can hope that 2017 will be the year when we in this Chamber finally wake up.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record, as follows:                     Business Backs Low-Carbon USA       Dear President-elect Trump,President Obama, Members of the      US Congress, and Global Leaders:       We, the undersigned members in the business and      investorcommunity of the United States, reaffirm our deep      commitment to addressing climate change through the      implementation of thehistoric Paris Climate       We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered      by low-carbon energy. Cost-effective and innovative solutions      can help us achieve these objectives. Failure to build a low-     carbon economy puts Americanprosperity at risk. But the right      action now will create jobs and boost US competitiveness. We      pledge to do our part, in our ownoperations and beyond, to      realize the Paris Agreement's commitment of a global economy      that limits global temperature rise towell below 2 degrees            We call on our elected US leaders to strongly support:       1.Continuation of low-carbon policies to allow the US to      meet or exceed our promised national commitment and to      increase ournation's future ambition       2. Investment in the low carbon economy at home and abroad      in order to givefinancial decision-makers clarity and boost      the confidence of investors worldwide       3. Continued USparticipation in the Paris Agreement, in      order to provide the long-term direction needed to keep      global temperature rise below 2 deg.C       Implementing the Paris Agreement will enable and encourage      businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars      inexisting low-carbon investments into the trillions of      dollars the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity      to all.       Wesupport leaders around the world as they seek to      implement the Paris Agreement and leverage this historic      opportunity to tackleclimate change.       22 Designs, 3P Partners, 3Sisters

312,topic-id,1479,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon to join my colleagues inexpressing support for 3, the budget resolution which, as most Americans now know, is the vehicle we will use tobegin the repeal and replacement of  This is a matter of keeping our word to the American people. This is a matterof keeping our promises that we have made, not only during the last campaign cycle but repeatedly since I voted against thisbill some 8 years ago. It was enacted in January of 2010.  Republicans on this side of the aisle and many Americansrepeatedly opposed the ObamaCare expansion of Federal power. We said it wouldn't work. We said the President would not be ableto keep his promises to the American people and when we got a chance to go back into the majority, we would repeal that act. Onthis side of the aisle, this is a followup on years and years of determination on our part to right this wrong, to keep ourpromises, and come up with a better plan to help Americans have coverage they can afford and a doctor they can keep.  Iintend to support the chairman of the Budget Committee in the votes we will have today and tonight. We have what some peoplecall the vote-arama tonight. A number of votes will be taken in rapid succession, and we don't know how many will actually beoffered by our friends on the other side of the aisle. I believe I will be able to vote against all of these amendments becauseI think keeping a clean bill makes it more likely we will be able to pass this legislation, send it to over to the House ofRepresentatives where it can be tweaked but passed and get back to us for final approval, and actually get a bill to President-elect Trump after he takes office, repealing ObamaCare so we can replace it with something that works.  This is ouropportunity to keep our campaign promise. This is our opportunity to help the President-elect and the Vice President-elect keeptheir campaign promises and show to the American people that elections have consequences and that at least this group of publicofficials intends to keep our word with regard to this piece of legislation. It was well intended, no doubt, but it could notpossibly have worked to do the things that President Obama said it could do.  In 2009 and 2010, the President told us: If youlike your health plan, you get to keep it. It turns out that is a promise that was not kept because it could not be kept.  The President said: If you like your doctor, you can keep that doctor. Again, this is a promise this administration and ourDemocratic friends on the other side of the aisle were unable to keep. That is why so many people around the country are opposedto keeping They want it to be repealed. They want a drastically different approach involving market principles to beput in its place so it will work for patients and work for the American people.  ObamaCare is not working. It is not workingin my home State of It is not working for millions of Americans who lost their health insurance. It is it is notworking for millions of Americans who saw their premiums rise and their deductibles go to unimaginable heights.  Of course, Iknow the Presiding Officer and I have heard from constituents at home, and I am going to take this opportunity to share with yousome of the views I have heard from people in Mississippi who are looking to us in the House and in the Senate to rectify thissituation with regard to this disastrous piece of legislation.  A 62-year-old individual from Madison, MS, wrote to mesaying:       Please explain the term ``affordable'' in the Affordable      Care . . . I recently went toHealthcare.gov to look at      possible health insurance plans. . . . The estimates range      from over $18,000 to over $26,000 per year.That is anywhere      from 13.5% to 18.6% of our gross salary. So forget about      saving for retirement. The system is flawed.  Another Mississippian wrote to me:       I have read in many publications about the increases      inpremiums for ObamaCare, but that is actually a moot point      when the only insurance . . . that my doctor and my wife's      doctor willtake is PULLING out (of the exchange) leaving my      wife with no choice but to possibly return to work just for      the insurance.  A third constituent from Saltillo, MS, wrote:       I just applied at themarket place for health insurance. My      quote was $415 monthly with a deductible of $6850. I work      less than 30 hours a week inretail. There is no way that I      can afford that.  This constituent from Saltillo goes on to say:       What am I supposed to do? I have a car payment and I need      to eat.  Well, I think help is on the way. The action weare going to take this week in sending this resolution over to the House of Representatives is a form of keeping our promise andproviding assistance to this constituent of mine.  These stories go on and on. For a woman in Gulfport whose husband lost hisjob, the cheapest plan in the ObamaCare exchange was $1,042 with a $13,000 deductible. This constituent calls ObamaCare``legalized extortion.''  A 60-year-old constituent was understandably upset when his insurance went up by $113 a month. Hethen noticed that coverage he didn't request had been added to his policy without wanting it or needing it. Pediatric dentistryand birth control were required on this plan, two things neither he nor his wife want to use or want to pay for.  So I wantto remind my colleagues that ObamaCare is hurting individuals--individuals who have written to me, and individuals who havewritten to all of my colleagues, but it is also hurting small businesses in Mississippi and small businesses in Pennsylvania andaround the country. I would remind my colleagues that most jobs in the United States are created not by large corporations, notby the big-ticket manufacturing plants that come into our States and districts that we like to have, but by smallbusinesses--businesses of under 200 people.  A small business owner in South Mississippi wrote to me. Following her husband'sretirement, she had to find health care through the exchange. Her county borders Louisiana, and many Mississippians travelacross State lines for work. The health care network that she has used for 20 years is no longer an option for her becauseObamaCare policies do not allow beneficiaries to use networks in different That is also something we need to addresswhen we finally put in place the replacement portion of this mechanism.  The plan for this nonsmoker, with no preexistingconditions, under the exchange cost her $900 a month in premiums and she was not able to keep her doctor.  It is not justconstituents in my more or less Republican State, among my more or less Republican constituents in the State of Mississippi whoare telling the truth about I want to quote Bill Clinton, speaking on behalf of his wife in Flint, MI, on October 4of last year. Former President Bill Clinton said this:       You've got this crazy system where all of asudden 25      million more people have health care, and then the people who      are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week,wind up      with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.      It is the craziest thing in the world.  PresidentBill Clinton said that just last year in Flint,  I think if we come to grips with this, we will admit that this is acrazy system. It was well intended by some of my Democratic friends but one that has failed; one that has failed the Americanpeople and one that has failed to keep the promises that were solidly made when the bill was rammed through on a strictlypartisan basis. Every Democrat was supporting it. No Republicans were supporting it at all.[[Page S243]]There was no Republican input,no bipartisan input on overhauling one of the most significant systems in our country.  It is time for us to move forward,and tonight is a step forward. We certainly aren't going to get it all done in one fell swoop, and even when we get the billsigned into law by our new President Donald Trump, it will take a while for it to be put into place. Tonight we show that wemeant what we said and we said what we meant, and we are going to follow through. We are going to pass this resolution tonightand begin the process of keeping our promises to the American people to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something thatworks for the millions and hundreds of millions of Americans out there who depend on us for good policy.

But there are times where moving expeditiously is required, and today is oneof those days.  You are not going to see a rule like this come very often because we are considering the FY17 budget resolution today.Historically, as you know, in this Chamber, when we get ready to consider budget resolutions, Mr.Speaker, we are consideringevery single one that any Member of Congress would have an opportunity to write. That process takes place every spring to meetthe statutory deadline of passing budgets by This is not that budget today, Mr. This is a budget, as you know, to move us forward on a reconciliation process to finish up the FY17 budget process, andrather than considering all the amendments that one might have to offer, we have made in order just one.

Mr.Speaker, when it comes to consideration of the measure to waive a statutory prohibition on naming a civilian Secretaryof Defense who has been out of the military for less than 7 years, we are also offering that under a closed rule today. Noamendments are going to be made in order. You may not know, Mr.Speaker, but that is the[[Page H478]]only statutory change that haspassed the United States Senate in 2017.  When we talk about having to move expeditiously, when we talk about whether or not we are going to have an open process or aclosed process, understand that while this body has passed dozens of statutory changes in just these first 9 days of legislativeactivity, the Senate has passed but one. This is in anticipation of an inauguration of a President on January 20.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Woodall) for yielding me the customary 30minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to this restrictive rule, and I rise in strong oppositionto the underlying legislation.  Because of Republican in-fighting, Congress was unable to do one of its most basic jobs last year, passing a full budget forSo now House Republicans have brought this budget bill to the floor, but we all know that this is just a vehicle for themto repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away health care from millions and millions of  For nearly 7 years, my Republican friends have railed against the Affordable Care Their well-funded allies have spentbillions of dollars distorting the ACA and lying to the American people about what it actually does. And for nearly 7 yearsthere has not been a single comprehensive healthcare bill brought to the floor by Republicans as a replacement for theAffordable Care Not one.  We have voted over 60 times to repeal the ACA on the House floor. I will be the first to admit that ACA is not perfect, butrather than work together to tweak it or to make it better, all we get from them are repeal bills, repeal bills, repeal bills.Let me again point out that not once, not once, was there a replacement bill offered.  Not only do Republicans not have a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act and protect access to health care for more than20 million Americans who gained coverage, they can't even agree on a timeline for when they will pass their replacement.President-elect Trump says repeal and replace will be done on the same day, and he wants it to happen now. RepresentativeSteve Scalise said Republicans will replace the ACA over the course of the next fewmonths. Senator John Thune said it could take 2 or 3 years for the replacement to be implemented. Representative ChrisCollins said Republicans have 6 months to work out the replacement plan, and Senator Mitch McConnell refused to even givea timeline, just saying that it would happen.  Well, while the Republicans fight with each other over timelines, I think it is appropriate to ask: If they did have areplacement, what would that replacement be?  Well, President-elect Trump has the answer. When asked what we should replace ObamaCare with, he said: ``Somethingterrific.'' When pressed for further details, and more specificity, he said: ``Something that people will really, really, reallylike.''  Mr.Speaker, you can't make this stuff up. It would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. It is tragic because whatRepublicans are trying to do is take healthcare protections away from millions and millions of families.  Now, no one in this Congress has to worry about health care if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, and the Donald Trumps ofthe world certainly don't have to worry about health care if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. If someone in their familygets really sick, they will just sell some stocks or close down another American factory or not pay their workers, as ourPresident-elect has been known to do on many, many occasions.  But for millions of Americans, it will be a different story. Repealing the ACA would mean over 30 million Americans wouldlose coverage, including nearly 4 million children. More than 52 million individuals with preexisting conditions could havecoverage rescinded or see their premiums dramatically increased. Millions of young adults would be unable to stay on theirparents' plans until they are 26. Over 14 million individuals enrolled in Medicaid under the expansion would lose coverage, andnearly 140 million individuals with private insurance would lose access to preventive services without copays and deductibles.And millions of seniors would see their prescription drug prices increase because it would reopen the so-called doughnut holethat the ACA has begun to close.  Republicans want to slash Medicaid, a healthcare program that does a lot of good stuff and enables mothers to work their wayout of poverty by providing affordable coverage for their children. As someone who represents Massachusetts, this is especiallypersonal because Medicaid is one of the best tools we have in the fight against opioid addiction, providing real care for theaddiction and underlying conditions that drive the opioid epidemic in our communities. Repealing Medicaid expansion under theACA would rip coverage away from an estimated 1.6 million newly insured individuals with substance use disorders.  That is what is at stake, and that is what my Republican colleagues are so happy, giddy, and excited to do. It is sad. It ispathetic, but they are moving forward anyway with no replacement in sight. I suppose they can roll out their oldies but goodies,like health savings accounts or their other healthcare prescription, take two tax breaks and call me in the morning. But thatdoesn't do it.  Mr.Speaker, we have a complicated healthcare system, no doubt. I wish it were simpler. That is why I have always favored asingle-payer system and that is why I favored a public option. But the problem with our system before ObamaCare was that it leftall the decisions up to the insurance companies.  Do you remember the days when insurance companies could charge women more for health insurance because they said being awoman was a preexisting condition?  They can't do that anymore. Why? Not because of my Republican friends. They can't do it anymore because we passed the  This budget bill would also give Republicans a green light to defund Planned To my colleagues who are so anxiousto defund Planned Parenthood just to satisfy their rightwing base, let me ask: Have you ever visited a Planned Parenthoodclinic? Because if you had, you would understand why what you are doing is so wrong.                              {time}  0930  The fact is that Planned Parenthood plays a critical role in protecting and providing access to critical health services forboth women and men. One in five women has relied on a Planned Parenthood health center for care in her lifetime, and PlannedParenthood serves 2.7 million patients each year. One of the most important statistics that my Republican friends like to ignoreis that more than 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does nationally is preventive care, including cervical cancerscreenings, breast cancer screenings, and family planning, not abortion services.  Add to this fact that Planned Parenthood clinics are often one of the few affordable healthcare options available for manywomen. Nearly 80 percent of women using Planned Parenthood clinics have incomes at or below 150 percent of poverty. It is easyto see why a majority of Americans don't think Federal funding should be eliminated. In one recent poll, 63 percent of voters,[[Page H479]]including 72 percent of independents, do not agree with my Republican friends that Federal funding for Planned Parenthoodshould be eliminated.  In fact, we also heard very little about the consequences that defunding Planned Parenthood would have for families acrossthe country. One of the biggest myths perpetrated by Republicans is the idea that our Nation's community health centers, which Ilove and adore and respect, could suddenly pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood is defunded.  For the millions of low-income women who depend on Planned Parenthood clinics, defunding them would mean the loss ofaffordable and accessible contraceptive services and counseling, as well as breast and cervical cancer screenings. Simply put,for the many communities served by Planned Parenthood clinics, recklessly cutting funding would wipe out access to vital healthservices for the people who need them the most.  Let me make something very clear. Zero Federal dollars go towards the abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood--zero.The vast majority of funding that Planned Parenthood receives comes in the form of Medicaid reimbursements for preventive carethat they provide.  Mr.Speaker, it is a cruel thing to do, to take away people's health care. I will say to my Republican colleagues that theyneed to know that we are going to fight you every step of the way on this. There are some battles on behalf of the Americanpeople that are worth having and worth fighting, and this is one of them--making sure that their health care protections remainintact. I came to Congress to help people, not make their lives more miserable.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, let me comment briefly on the other piece of legislation in this rule, 84. General James Mattis hasbeen praised by both Democrats and Republicans, but there is very real concern about civilian control over the military, thelanguage of the underlying legislation, and the duties and responsibilities of the House of  General Mattis has a distinguished career, but we are talking about changing the law here. Approving a waiver for him toserve in the Cabinet so soon after his military service is a serious decision. It is so serious that such a waiver has happenedonly once before in the entire history of the United Now, we should debate this. Instead, the Trump transition teamcanceled General Mattis' testimony before the House Armed Services Committee and now expects us to vote for him willy-nillywithout us being able to ask him any questions.  Congress is supposed to be a check on the executive branch, but if the House is denied the opportunity to meet with andquestion the military officer who is nominated as our next Defense Secretary, how can we fulfill our duty and blindly just votefor him?  I would also say to my Republican friends, this is an early warning sign of the disregard that this new administration hasfor the House of General Mattis was willing to testify, but the Trump team said no. They said no to the Houseof Caving in on this issue will only mean continued disregard for the people's House in the future, and I thinkthat that is regrettable.  I reserve the balance of my time.

The only guaranteed benefit in Social Security is that it is guaranteed to fail. Those are not my words.These are the words of the actuaries who are in charge of protecting Social The nonpartisan actuaries who governSocial Security say that there is not enough money today to pay the benefits that folks are expecting. The law of the land, asit exists today, requires that, when that day comes, benefits will get cut dramatically. Only a 75 percent realization ofbenefits is what the law requires that befalls our senior citizens. If we pass the amendment that is suggested by my friend, wewould be prohibited from considering any solutions to that problem. Means testing, which my colleagues have advocated for years,is off the table under that scenario.  Mr.Speaker, to suggest that anyone on this side of the aisle wants to undermine the commitment that this country has madeto our seniors is ludicrous; but to suggest that I go to a 22-year-old, whose polling today suggests he or she believes they aremore likely to see a UFO in their lifetime than a Social Security check in their lifetime--to suggest that going to that 22-year-old and my thinking that maybe his retirement age would be a year or two higher thanhis great-grandparents' since he is now living decades longer--I will remind my colleagues we came together in a bipartisan wayto raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 in 1983, not because one of us hated seniors and one of us loved seniors, but becausewe all believed in our commitment to seniors.

There is no one in this Chamber who I believe has a biggerheart for men and [[Page H482]]women than the gentleman from Massachusetts, which is why I know that he does notsupport what I see happening to my constituency.  He says people are paying less for their health care today. I dispute those numbers writ large, but I know it is true in mydistrict because the free healthcare clinic has doubled since the passage of Folks once had access to small plansthat they chose for their families. Those plans were outlawed. Now they have high deductible plans that are worthless to them,so they seek care at the free clinics. I know that ripping the plans out from under those men and women in my district was notthe gentleman's intention when he passed the Affordable Care Act, but it is absolutely the result.  I know that when the gentleman set up those exchanges, which all Americans were supposed to be able to go to to buy theirhealthcare plans, he did not intend for those plans to get canceled year after year after year after year, because they wereunsustainable. We all know, of the constituents in our districts who did what the government told them to do, they lost theplans their employers used to provide; they went to the exchanges to buy a plan; and, 1 year later, those plans were canceled.They went through the process again: they picked out other plans; they went through the exchanges and paid their money; and, 1year later, those plans were canceled again and again.  We all know those constituents; so to suggest that the only reason someone would come to the floor today would be to solve anonexistent problem is ridiculous. We all know that there are problems. What is ridiculous are the folks who would come anddefend the status quo. The status quo is indefensible, Mr. When we get together, we can do amazing things. There are vast experiences of the Members in this Chamber, Mr.Speaker, andour bringing those to the table leads to better solutions. We have spent 6 years being stuck in the status quo, and this billrepresents an opportunity to turn the page on that status quo, and I know every single Member has constituents in his districtwho will welcome it.

In 2016, 427,000 individuals in the State have received financial assistance to purchase marketplace coverage; they are atrisk of losing that.  65,000 kids have gained coverage since the ACA was implemented in the State of  74,000 young adults are able to stay on their parents' health insurance until they are 26 because of the  That is all in So I would hope the gentleman would understand what is happening in his own State before he votes torepeal it.

1006,topic-id,683,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I was not in Congress at the time the Affordable Care Act passed, but I remember it, watching from home. We talk about thisas if it was some sort of thoughtfully crafted piece of legislation that folks are so tremendously proud of. I happen to havethe numbers here, Mr. It was H.4872 that moved through the House, that was the authorizing part. We had three votes in the U.House ofRepresentatives on that bill. We had a motion to recommit, as it was not actually a healthcare bill to begin with, and a vote onfinal passage.  Then it went over to the U.Senate where they worked their will on it. They had 43 votes on it, amendments offered, ideas,and changes.  Then it came back to the House where we changed it not at all. There was one straight partisan vote on the Affordable Not one idea from the U.House of Representatives added, not one change from the U.House of Representatives, not onealteration of any kind.  As you recall, Mr.Speaker, they had a filibuster-proof majority in the United States Senate, so Democrats could work theirwill any way they wanted. When they lost that filibuster-proof majority--they only had 59 votes out of 100 instead of 60--theyended debate, they ended discussion, they ended collaboration and jammed what they had passed at midnight on Christmas Eve righton through the U.House of I can't imagine who defends that as the proper outcome of the legislative process.We have a chance to change that, Mr. I am glad that my friend from Connecticut has some constituents that have benefited. I have some constituents that havebenefited. But I have constituents who are being failed, and I know my friend from Connecticut does, too.  I am glad that my friends on the other side of the aisle are talking about all of their success stories, but I want myfriends to join me and grapple with all of the failures.  I will not deny the way the conversation about health care has changed since the passage of the Affordable Care Act--folkstalking about preexisting conditions, folks talking about lifetime caps, folks talking about keeping young kids on theirpolicies until they are 26.  I just don't understand why my colleagues would deny that folks who used to have care, now don't. Folks who used to haveaffordable plans, now don't. Folks who used to be able to take care of their employees through their small business plans, nowcan't. This is undisputed, and we have an opportunity to do better. I hope my colleagues will join me in doing that.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Woodall) is entitled to his own opinions but not his own facts. The facts with regardto the process in which the Affordable Care Act was developed, I think, are worth repeating here.  In the House of Representatives, we held nearly 100 hours of hearings and 83 hours of committee markups. The House heardfrom 181 witnesses, both Democrats and 239 amendments were considered in the three committeesof jurisdiction, and 121 of them were adopted. The bill was available for 72 hours before Members were asked to vote on thefloor.  In the Senate, the Senate Finance Committee held more than 53 hearings. The committee also spent 8 days marking up thelegislation, the longest[[Page H483]]markup in the 22 years of the committee. The Senate Health Committee held 47 bipartisan hearings,roundtables, and walkthroughs on the healthcare reform bill.  So to say that this was not a thoughtful process is just wrong.  Compare that to the way this budget bill is being brought to the floor. There is no committee consideration, nodeliberation. It is just given to us. In fact, most of the committees aren't even organized yet in the House of  So there is a contrast there, and I stand with the way we approached the Affordable Care Act as opposed to the way theRepublicans have approached this budget deal.

Everything the gentleman from Massachusetts said was true, until the U.House abdicated any responsibility whatsoever andpassed exactly what the Senate did with no amendment whatsoever. All of the work product the gentleman talked about, all of thework that the gentleman talked about went for naught in this U.House of  To deny that this is not the bill that folks wanted to have crafted is to deny reality. To deny that this is not the billthat folks wanted to have crafted is to deny the nine different times the Republican House and Senate sent to the Presidentrepeals of ObamaCare, things that were so broken even the President couldn't live with it and he signed those repeals into law.  Mr.Speaker, I am not trying to denigrate any of the motives of my friends on the other side of the aisle. I just can'tunderstand, for the life of me, why they don't want to try to do better.  That pride of authorship, that arrogance, it has a real impact on the men and women that I serve, and I am asking my friendsto partner with me to help me fix it. But if they won't partner with me, I am going to move forward and fix it anyway.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We have been willing to work with our Republican friends to try to improve the Affordable Care Act for nearly 7 years. Theyhave been unwilling to work with us in a bipartisan way. Instead, they just want to repeal, repeal, repeal.  Now, I don't know what their motivation is. Maybe it is because they don't like President Judging from some of therhetoric that we have heard on this House floor over these years, I think some of the Members over there actually hate thePresident of the United States, and this is all driven by this personal animosity.  Let me just say to the gentleman that the Affordable Care Act may have started out with a different bill number, but thefacts remain that there were hundreds of hours of hearings on the Affordable Care Act, 181 witnesses testified; hundreds ofamendments were considered in committee.  The process of using a different bill number is very common in both In fact, the House Republicans have done itseveral times in the past 3 years. Regardless of the bill number, the work that went into forming this legislation was one ofthe most open processes in the history of the Congress, and it has resulted in providing protections and health care formillions and millions of people in this country.

1015,topic-id,507,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am fond of telling folks back home, Mr.Speaker, when they tell me they know exactly what is going to happen over the next2 years, that I don't think they are telling me the truth. Because I confess to you, I have absolutely no idea what is comingover these next 2 years. I think these next 2 years are going to be unlike any we have seen in the history of self-governance inthis land; and, candidly, I am excited about that because the status quo isn't working for the 700,000 people that I represent.  I don't know what's going to happen over these next 2 years, but I believe that, for the first time, we are going to grapplewith some really, really, really hard problems that folks on both sides of the aisle have been ignoring for too long.  Mr.Speaker, I don't question the commitment of my friends on the other side of the aisle to the American people. I questionthe legislation that they use to deliver it. You heard my friend from Oklahoma talk about premiums going up 67 percent for hisconstituents. That is indefensible. It is not okay. We can do better, and, with the passage of this budget resolution, we willhave the tools to do that. I say again, the law will be the same tomorrow as it is today, but we will have the tools to grapplewith these problems.  Eight million Americans were so failed by the Affordable Care Act that they paid a tax penalty instead of accessing care.That is not okay. I don't believe a single Member on the other side of the aisle decided they just wanted to tax young peopleinstead of provide young people with quality care. This budget will give us the opportunity to have the tools to fix thatproblem.  Billions of dollars, Mr.Speaker, have gone into State-based co-ops that have failed, gone bankrupt, and terminated all oftheir plans which not only ripped health care out from under the American people, Mr.Speaker, but threw billions of dollarsaway in administrative costs at the same time. That is not okay. That is indefensible. We can do better. Passing this budgetresolution will give us those tools.  Mr.Speaker, I made a commitment in the Rules Committee last night to do everything I could to stop poisoning the well ofpublic discourse. Then I re-[[Page H488]]upped for the Rules Committee, and I realized that is going to be a tough promise to fulfill.We have difficult work to do, and we are passionate about the quality of that work.  But, Mr.Speaker, we all know the status quo has failed. We all know that we have the opportunity to deliver, and we allknow that a vote of ``yes'' on this budget resolution will give us more tools to deliver that success than we have today. Weneed to do this. We need to celebrate doing this.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the rule and support the two underlying measures that it will bring to thefloor.

1024,topic-id,756,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to remind my colleague that her vote today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 266,000 people fromher State of Tennessee losing their healthcare coverage, 57,000 workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $34.2 billionin gross State product for the State of Tennessee over 5 years.  The so-called budget before us was drafted by Republicans for the sole purpose of repealing the Affordable Care Act anddefunding Planned Parenthood by a simple majority in the It squanders the opportunity to start this new Congress workingtogether to address the concerns and priorities of the American people in a constructive and bipartisan manner.  The Affordable Care Act is making an incredible difference across my home State of Kentucky, as in many other places. Withour expansion of Medicaid and the success of our State marketplace, Kynect, more than half a million Kentuckians in a State of 4million have gained quality, affordable coverage. In Louisville alone, the uninsured rate dropped 81 percent.  In a State with tremendous health needs, we are a national model of ACA success. Even our Republican Senator, RandPaul, and our Republican Governor, Matt Bevin, who are vehemently opposed to the law, know we can't go back to where we werebefore the They now acknowledge that Republicans in Congress should not repeal the Affordable Care Act without immediatelyreplacing it.  Much of the debate about the ACA focuses on the 20 million newly insured individuals, but the law has done much more thanthat. Millions of seniors on Medicare have saved on prescription drug coverage. For people on their employer's plan, out-of-pocket costs are capped, and lifetime limits are gone. If you are one of the 129 million Americans with a preexisting condition,you currently have the peace of mind of knowing that you can always get coverage if you lose your job, change your job, or startyour own business.  Let me tell you about Steve Riggert, my constituent who recently wrote to me. When Steve's daughter Anna was 12, she wasdiagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, a rare disease for a child. This is Over the next 3 years, she was hospitalized 15times. Despite their best efforts and prayers, transplant surgery did not achieve success. She has struggled with diabetes andcomplications. At age 22, she has been hospitalized 26 times for various reasons.  From the beginning, Steve knew that Anna's preexisting condition would make getting medical coverage difficult. So far, hehas been able to cover her medical bills through his employer plan. When the ACA was passed, he was immensely relieved that Annacould always get coverage even though she has had a serious preexisting medical condition.  But the Republican plan to repeal the ACA has now left Steve feeling--and these are his words--helpless, petrified, and,literally, losing sleep. At age 64 and recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, he fears for how much he can support her. Toquote his letter: ``Repeal of all aspects of the Affordable Care Act would place everything I have worked for and those I careabout in jeopardy.''  Mr.Chairman, I am here today to fight for Steve, for Anna, and for all the Americans across the country who are begging younot to take away their health care. Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement will cause chaos. Nearly 30 millionpeople would lose coverage, including more than 4 million kids. Any consumers left in the individual market are likely to facehigher premiums and fewer choices as insurers exit the system.  It has been nearly 7 years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, and Republicans still do not have a viableplan to replace it, period. Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers said this week that the Republicanreplacement plan will guarantee ``no one who has coverage today because of ObamaCare will lose that coverage.''  We are waiting for that plan because none of the bills Republicans will wave from that podium today meet that standard orhas the support of the majority of their Democrats offered a number of amendments to this budget to protect the ACAand make it reflect the priorities of American families. We owe the millions of people who are deeply concerned about thisprocess nothing less. Unfortunately, Republicans refuse to allow a vote on a single one.  Putting American families and our Nation's healthcare system at risk is irresponsible. I, therefore, urge my colleagues tooppose the Republican budget. The American people deserve better. Anna deserves better. Her father and her family deservebetter.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH490.txt,1853,1900,2017.0,13.0,January

1120,topic-id,349,"I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Chairman, everybody in this room wants the same thing. We want the best quality of care available to the most people atthe lowest price. That is what every American wants. That is what Republicans and Democrats alike want.  We have put our plan to do that on the table. We recognize that there are ways it could be improved. But the idea that thereis a plan competing on the other side is just hilarious.                              {time}  1330  Last night, I testified at the Rules Committee before Chairman Chairman Sessions introduced a bill lastyear. He had one cosponsor. That gentleman is no longer in the House, so he has no cosponsors as of now. His plan is called theWorld's Greatest Healthcare I like the name, but I don't know how that relates to any of those other plans. I know thatprobably some of the elements are similar.  This is the problem with the exercise we are going through. We are heading down a road with no final determination ordestination. We are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, eliminating all the protections that we have provided for 300million Americans--expanded coverage, expanded guarantees, benefits, and quality--and we don't know what the alternative is.  Waiving around a bunch of papers does not mean there is a plan. It does not mean that the Republicans can say to theAmerican public: ``Here is what your health care is going to look like when we get finished with our repeal and replace.'' Theyjust can't do that.  That is why only 18 percent of the American people, according to a Kaiser survey, want this course of action, want a repealwithout a replacement.  All I have to say is, if we go down this path, we won't have repeal and replace. What we will have is repeal and repentbecause we are going to owe a huge apology to the American people for the damage that we have caused.  I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH490.txt,1853,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,13.0,January

1127,topic-id,275,"Mr.Chairman, the Republican rush to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, to take health insurance from 30million Americans, introduce chaos into the health insurance market, and give millionaires and billionaires a giant tax cut ismisguided and does not reflect the values of the American people. On top of that, it can significantly damage our economy.  Repeal will upend our Nation's healthcare system. Hospitals will see a spike in uncompensated care, leading to reducedservices, job cuts, or higher prices for every one. It will cost the Nation 2.6 million jobs in 2019 alone, including 44,000jobs in The hit to the economy will be in the trillions of dollars, and it will give corporations and the wealthyhundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts.  Repeal isn't about what is best for the American people. It is solely about politics and what is in the financial interestof the well-off and the well-connected. There is absolutely no logic to this.  That said, if Republicans are determined to rush something through Congress right now using the budget process, we wouldsuggest a totally different approach. Let's look at areas where this Congress and this incoming administration can work togetherto address a pressing challenge facing the country.  Members of both parties and the President-elect have expressed support for repairing our Nation's failing infrastructure,investing in our roads, bridges, ports, and other transportation needs to create jobs and build a stronger economic future. Thesubstitute I have offered today provides the budget procedures needed for such a bill to be considered.  Mr.Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this alternative budget so we can move our Nation forward together.  I reserve the balance of my time.

1134,topic-id,302,"Mr.Chairman, as I said in my closing to the debate on the resolution itself, it would be wonderful if theRepublicans had a plan that they could describe to the American people so that American families would know what would be intheir healthcare future. It would also be nice if they would wait to repeal the Affordable Care Act until they could do that. Ithink the American people expect it. The poll I mentioned from Kaiser, 82 percent of the people preferred to go in thatdirection. Let's find out if there is a better way.  I have said many times in public the reason there has been no Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act is becausethere really are only two alternatives: one is to go back to the era in which insurance companies decided who lived and died,and the other one is to go to single payer, something like Medicare for everyone. I would love to discuss that option. I thinkit would be immensely popular in this country. But, instead, Republicans come up with ideas that are drifting in the otherdirection, again, back to not patient-centered care but back to insurance company-centered care.  The important thing today is that we have an alternative here through which we can actually do something constructive forthe American people, something that will help the economy, something that will make vital investments in our Nation and thefuture economy instead of putting the country's healthcare system at risk. That is what this amendment does. That is why Iintroduced it, and that is why I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.Yarmuth).  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.

63,topic-id,189,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, which was observed this week inhonor of the contributions countless men and women in uniform have made to keep our communities safe and secure.  This year's observance was particularly difficult for our Kansas community. Over the last year, three police officers in mydistrict made the ultimate sacrifice while in the line of duty. Brad Lancaster, Dave Melton of Kansas City, and Brandon Collinsof Overland Park each lost their lives while protecting our community.  Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is a day to remember them and to honor the men and women who remain in the field each daykeeping our children and families safe. They are the ones who run into danger when others run away. They are the true heroes,and we should always regard them as such. It is also a day to honor the United States Capitol Police to keep Congress, ourstaff, and our visitors in this very Chamber safe.  Mr.Speaker, let us never forget the service and sacrifice of our law enforcement officers, and let us continue to honorthem with the gratitude and respect they deserve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH315-5.txt,2021,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,11.0,January
221,topic-id,221,"Mr.Speaker, today is National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, an issue close to my heart.  Human trafficking is nothing more than modern-day slavery. Last Congress, the Foreign Affairs Committee shined a light onthis scourge that affects millions around the world and passed into law the International Megan's Law, which attacks child sextourism by child sex offenders, improves international law enforcement cooperation, and improves notices of child sex offenderstraveling to the U. We have come a long way in creating awareness, but more must be done. According to the Polaris Project, from 2007 to 2015,over 25,000 cases of human trafficking were discovered in the United States, and 7,700 of these were minors. Over 100,000 callswere made to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline.  We all know this is an issue that does not discriminate. It can affect everyone. In north Florida, over Christmas, a man wasarrested for trafficking a woman across five county lines. This case started with him luring her to Florida over the Internetand ended when law enforcement were able to save the victim after seeing her in adult advertisements online.  I want to thank all those who were involved in bringing this person to justice.  On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, we in Congress will not look away. We will continue to fight the scourgecalled human trafficking.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH373.txt,2115,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,11.0,January
235,topic-id,533,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.Walker) for hosting this Special TheAmerican people have spoken, and it is time. The ACA, the Affordable Care Act--which it is not, and we know that.  I want to take you back, a little history here. Back prior to 2009, before the Affordable Care Act came out, 85 percent ofthe people in America had health insurance either through their employer or on their own. Fifteen percent did not have healthinsurance.  Yet, Congress, in their infinite wisdom, instead of fixing it for the 15 percent and getting them into the pool of peoplethat had health insurance, said: No; we are going to change it. We are going to change it and disrupt the whole healthcaremarket and 20 percent of our economy.  This is the epitome of legislative malpractice. This Congress was controlled by one party, the Democratic Party, through theHouse, the Senate, and the executive branch. They passed a 2,900-page bill at the end of the year that nobody read. You can't dothat in any other business without going to jail.  President Obama sold us a bill of goods on a lie. If you want to keep your doctor or your insurance, you can and your pricewill go down $2,500.  Let me share three real-life stories. One was a 54-year-old man that came into our office, single, making a six-figureincome, could afford insurance. He was going through the exchange. He changed his plan and wanted to pay for it right then. Theysaid: Don't worry about it, we will send you a bill. They never sent him a bill, and his insurance got canceled. He could notbuy insurance because it was through the exchange and the sign-up period had expired. He got fined whatever the fine was. He gotfined trying to do the right thing.  Another one is a friend of mine who owns a restaurant franchise. He has 500 employees. He says: I can't afford to pay forthe health insurance. So he moved people from working 32 or 40 hours a week down to 26 hours.  I could tell you a real personal story about a couple I know real well. They came to Their policy got canceled.Their premiums went up by over $11,000. Their deductibles went up and their coverage went down. I know that couple real wellbecause it is my wife and myself.  The American people have spoken and given us the majority for a reason, and that is to fix health care and allow the besthealthcare providers, the best medicine, the best research and the institutions in America to provide that for all Americans anddeliver that care to all  The Republican Congress has a better way, and it starts with putting health care back into the hands of the physicians tothe patients. It has a better way increasing access, the cure, the quality at a lower cost with a stable transition so no one isleft out. And it starts with the repeal of  I appreciate Chairman Walker doing this. This is a message we are going to drive home and home and home. We are goingto fix this, and the American people will be better off and our economy will be better off.

574,topic-id,376,"Mr.Speaker, today I will reintroduce the WINGMAN Act, a vital veterans' bill that will expedite the claimsprocess for veterans who come to our congressional offices seeking assistance with their benefit claims. The current processleaves thousands of veterans and their families remaining in limbo awaiting resolution on their claims. The status quo isunacceptable, and it must change.  No servicemember should have to wait to receive benefits they have more than earned. This ends with the passage of theWINGMAN Act, which removes the middle man and allows staff to access these records directly, after obtaining a privacy releaseform without having to wait on the VA bureaucracy. I think if we just listen, this is about customer service. Yes, they areconstituents, but they are also customers. Every Member of this Congress--all 535 Members--represents approximately 700,000constituents, and I like to think that we are in the customer service business as is the VA, the Veterans  If we can't service our customers, where else can they go?  Last Congress, WINGMAN passed this House unanimously. It passed the Veterans' Affairs Committee unanimously, but it was heldup by one Senator who thought he know more than the 435 Members of this body and that he knew more than the Veterans' Fortunately, that Senator from Nevada is no longer here, and we are resubmitting this. I am hopeful that thisCongress--the Members of this Chamber--will, once again, reform the veterans' claims process and that our colleagues in the upperChamber will as well.  Before I close, I would also like to take a moment to recognize Representatives Rodney Davis of Illinois, KyrstenSinema, and John Delaney for being coleads on this bill. All three of my colleagues have demonstrated their commitment tofighting for our veterans every day of every year that they have served in  We have right now right over 150 cosponsors of this bill, and it is a privilege to have their support. I thank them forhelping to lead the charge to enact this change and others that are so desperately needed to better assist veterans and theirfamilies. Without their support, WINGMAN would not have the broad, bipartisan support that it does now. I urge the remainder ofour colleagues to support WINGMAN as well. Let our Nation's veterans know that we've got their six.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH397.txt,2115,NATIONAL HUMANTRAFFICKING AWARENESS DAY,2017.0,12.0,January
625,topic-id,152,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to bring attention to the burden ObamaCare has placed upon my constituents.  They have seen their healthcare costs rise while their quality of care has lowered. It is imperative that we repealObamaCare immediately.  I also emphasize to the folks here and at home that, as we repeal ObamaCare, we will make sure there is a stable transitionperiod during the replacement so that people do not have the rug pulled out from under them. This transition period will give usthe time we need to ensure our healthcare reform is full of truly patient-centered solutions that allow patients, families, anddoctors to direct their health care.  Congress must focus on the principles of affordability, accessibility, and quality to provide the American people withgenuine healthcare reform, but we can only get to that point by repealing ObamaCare now. I promise to read the bill beforevoting on it, unlike how it was passed.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH404-5.txt,2115,IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR VETERANS,2017.0,12.0,January
