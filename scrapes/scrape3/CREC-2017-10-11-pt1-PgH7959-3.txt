   MaST COMMUNITY CHARTER SCHOOL NAMED A 2017 BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL OF 
                               EXCELLENCE

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize MaST Community Charter School, an incredible institution in 
my district that was just named a 2017 Blue Ribbon School of Excellence 
by the Department of Education.
  MaST is a groundbreaking educational community that emphasizes 
collaborative, technology-driven, hands-on learning. They are preparing 
the next generation of American leaders and visionaries who will change 
the future in ways we can only imagine.
  Blue Ribbon schools are characterized by the highest level of 
academic excellence and by their success in closing achievement gaps 
across student populations.
  These elite institutions are a gold standard of instruction, 
inclusion, and innovation. MaST Community Charter School was one of 
only 342 schools across the country to earn this honor this year.
  I want to congratulate the teachers, staff, administrators, parents, 
and students of the MaST Community Charter School on their remarkable 
and well-deserved achievement.
