                     NOW IS THE TIME FOR TAX REFORM

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the importance of 
comprehensive tax reform for our families and businesses.
  It has been nearly 30 years since hardworking Americans have seen any 
significant changes made to our confusing Tax Code. Our current system 
is broken. I think we all agree on that. Taxes are too high, and our 
families and businesses are the ones paying the price, not to mention 
that nobody understands it.
  Two weeks ago, I was proud to cast my vote to cut, simplify, and 
reform taxes, and now the ball is in the Senate's court. Thankfully, as 
of yesterday, legislation has passed both the Senate Finance Committee 
and the Senate Budget Committee, and now we expect a vote in the full 
Senate as early as this week.
  Under the Trump administration, we are growing the economy, but 
nothing can compare to the effect that tax reform will have on jump-
starting the economy, expanding small businesses, and creating jobs.
  America, it is time to go back to work. We are now closer than ever 
to making tax reform a reality, a new reality for families and 
businesses across America who deserve to keep more of their paychecks 
and have the opportunity to grow their businesses.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe that we will uphold our important promise to 
deliver tax reform legislation to President Trump's desk soon.
