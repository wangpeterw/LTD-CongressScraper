            CONGRATULATING THE PENN MANOR FIELD HOCKEY TEAM

  (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Penn Manor 
field hockey team on their 2017 State championship victory.
  It was a remarkable season for these young women. The State 
championship

victory capped off a perfect 28-0 season, and 23 of those victories 
were shutouts. Mr. Speaker, they scored 148 goals and only allowed 5. 
Leading scorers Gabby Bitts and Emma DeBerdine combined for 64 goals 
and 54 assists.
  But what is also special about this team is their combined GPA. It is 
3.63. It speaks volumes about the team, but also about their coaches 
and parents, because we know that success like this isn't achieved 
alone. I couldn't be prouder to represent these young women, and I look 
forward to the continued success of this program.
  Congratulations to the Penn Manor field hockey team, the coaches, 
their families, and the faculty, staff, and students that helped make 
this championship possible.
