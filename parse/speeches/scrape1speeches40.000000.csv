I am filing my first piece of legislation today, and it is the Veterans, Employees and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2017. In my first hearing as chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, I heard with great concern, and even outrage, that some employees at the VA spend 100 percent of their time on union activity. Even physicians and nurses and folks who are hired to provide health care to our veterans, 100 percent of their time on union activity.  The law says their activity and time on union activities should be reasonable and in the best interest of the public. I don't believe in west Texas, or any area around the country, that it is reasonable and in the best interest of the public to spend 100 percent of your time on union activity and not fulfilling the mission.

14430,topic-id,703,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.288, the Small Business Broadband Deployment I am glad that the House is taking swift action on this bill, which would protect small Internet service providers from the enhanced disclosure requirements laid out in the 2015 Open Internet  After adopting the Open Internet Order, the FCC recognized the importance of exempting small ISPs from these enhanced transparency rules and subsequently granted a temporary exemption to broadband providers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers. However, the Commission failed to reach an agreement to grant another exemption before the deadline last December and, as a result, has left hundreds of our Nation's small providers vulnerable to cumbersome rules.  FCC Commissioners Pai and O'Rielly have taken action, since the exemption expired, to reassure our small broadband providers that the rules will not be enforced until the situation has been addressed by the Commission, but Congress should go a step further and provide certainty to our Nation's small businesses and pass this bill.  Rather than a 1-year exemption to the enhanced disclosure requirements, this bill would exempt for 5 years broadband providers with fewer than 250,000 subscribers from the enhanced reporting obligations, providing them with the regulatory certainty to invest in their business.  At our hearing last January, we heard from multiple witnesses just how cumbersome and burdensome these rules are. One witness described the difference to be as significant as the need to hire regulatory counsel versus the ability to build another tower to provide service. For a small business in a capital-intensive industry, that could be the difference between getting more people connected to the Internet and going out of business.  We cannot let our small businesses and hardworking taxpayers be saddled[[Page H269]]with more onerous rules and the costs that they bring. In addition to regulatory relief for small ISPs, the bill adds certainty for our Nation's small ISPs by extending the exemption for 5 years.  It was disappointing to see the Commission fail to reach an agreement at the end of last year to extend the exemption, and it is why we are here today. Despite overwhelming bipartisan support from Congress and President Obama's Small Business Administration, negotiations fell short, and our Nation's smallest and most competitive Internet service providers were left to bear the burden.  In today's 21st century economy, we need to do more to encourage connectivity, and this bill embodies that spirit. Congress is poised to provide the regulatory certainty small businesses are seeking in order to invest in stronger networks and foster a better consumer experience.  I want to thank Chairman Walden and Mr.Loebsack for acting quickly to reintroduce this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the commonsense measure.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First of all, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Oregon on his new chairmanship. I look forward to working across the aisle on most of the issues. It is a good bipartisan subcommittee. I think we have a lot to accomplish.  The Small Business Broadband Deployment Act, H.288, unanimously passed the House last Congress on a bipartisan vote, unanimous. H.288 provides a 5-year exemption from the FCC's enhanced transparency rules for small Internet service providers that serve 250,000 or fewer subscribers.  This exemption comes with the understanding that there is a 5-year sunset on the exemption and that the FCC report to Congress with sufficient information to help us better understand the impacts on the consumers of a permanent exemption, of a possible permanent exemption. This data will also better inform us whether a longer term exemption is necessary and whether we got the definition of what a small business is right in this case.  It is also worth noting that H.288 would leave intact the FCC's 2010 transparency rules that consumers have come to rely on, such as what they are paying for, Internet speeds they rely on, data quality, and so on. At the same time, these modifications provide certainty for small ISPs while the FCC collects and reports relevant information to  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

14402,topic-id,564,"Mr.Speaker, the campaign rhetoric and politics of the last 7 years now must confront the reality of health care.  No political party can repeal the basic economics. All of the features that make health insurance policies better today--the elimination of lifetime limits on health insurance payments; preventing denial for preexisting conditions; charging women the same premium as men, not more; keeping children on their parents' insurance policies until age 26--are wildly popular, but they all increase the cost of insurance.  We cannot allow people to wait until they are sick to get a policy. That undermines the very concept of insurance, hence, the mandate to have health insurance.  The truth is that the impact of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in healthcare costs rising more slowly than before the act. We have expanded coverage and subsidized care for millions of Americans, while improving the quality of health insurance. All of these reforms are, in fact, working.  A reckless act to repeal something that is now baked into the healthcare system on which millions of Americans rely and benefit from--indeed, the entire system benefits from--would have serious destabilizing effects beyond the loss of coverage for almost 30 million Republican efforts to weaken Medicaid for the poor and disabled and undermine Medicare for the elderly means that almost 100 million Americans have their health care at risk.  We will begin the battle fighting any effort by the new administration and the suddenly empowered Republican majority to act on their campaign rhetoric abolishing ObamaCare but not providing a replacement. A repeal without a clear alternative replacement at the same time is unacceptable. It is not just unacceptable to Democrats in It is unacceptable to millions of recently insured Americans--in fact, millions found in red States--unacceptable to healthcare professionals, insurance companies, hospitals, and the vast array of other people involved with the healthcare industry. Most importantly, it is unacceptable to our families.  The most unpopular feature of ObamaCare was the name, suggesting, perhaps, a simple solution. When identified with the President, the Affordable Care Act provisions were 20 percent more unpopular than when the act was described in exactly the same terms but the name was different. So perhaps we just allow the Republicans to abolish ``ObamaCare'' and then get back down to work doing what we should have been doing for the last 7 years: making the Affordable Care Act better.  By all means, let's look for ways to make the system less burdensome. We can continue to demand accountability, but allow some competition with value-based purchasing and negotiation of prescription drug prices by the largest pharmaceutical customer in the world: the Federal Dealing with skyrocketing prescription drug prices and other outrageous practices by some in the pharmaceutical industry will find broad support in and out of  When the Republican majority and the new administration get serious about a replacement that keeps all of their campaign promises and protects the industry from chaos and consumers from loss of essential coverage, there will be plenty of bipartisan cooperation. But any effort of breaking that fundamental promise by denying coverage and upsetting the healthcare applecart will be met with strong opposition, and, ultimately, they will lose.  For the sake of the American families and the people who provide health care, not only should they lose, they must lose. We must stand strong and united on that proposition.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH240.txt,99,REAL LEADERSHIP TACKLES ISSUES,2017.0,10.0,April

14242,topic-id,1952,"Mr.President, I am here principally to speak about the NICS Social Security Act, Congressional Review Act resolution that is before our Chamber, but events of the last 24 hours really raise before us the urgent and unavoidable issue of needing an investigation into the recent activities of Michael He resigned as the National Security Advisor last night after revelations that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials. He may have misled the President and others in the White House, but there are also very serious questions about who knew what when. These classic what did they know and when did they know it questions must be answered by an independent counsel or commission, and the reason it must be independent is the same very profoundly important reason that I gave to then-Nominee Jeff Sessions, now Attorney  The Attorney General must appoint a special counsel in cases where there is reason to question his complete impartiality and objectivity; the reality as well as the appearance mandate here that there be an independent investigation by a special counsel.  Only a special counsel, independent of the Attorney General and of the White House, can ask with penetrating, aggressive, unflinching analysis whether the President knew before Michael Flynn made those phone calls to the Russian Ambassador and other phone calls to other foreign powers what the subjects of the conversations were, even whether they were going to be made, and only an independent counsel can know, with complete credibility and being regarded that way by the public, as to what happened and who knew what happened and when they knew.  This issue is about more than just a phone call to the Russian It is about the integrity and honesty of public officials, about the protections we give to our intelligence, and about the independence of our justice system.  I certainly have respect for the Office of Attorney General, but Jeff Sessions was deeply involved in President Trump's campaign and in the Presidential transition. I expressed to him in the hearing on his nomination that he would have to distance himself from an investigation of exactly these issues to maintain impartiality and objectivity in that investigation. So I will write to him today, and the letter will be made public shortly, asking for an independent counsel, a special investigator who can produce the information that is necessary for the public to be assured that there has been an inquiry that is impartial, objective, comprehensive, and thorough. It has to be unflinching and unstinting, and it should be done as soon as possible.  Mr.President, I want to address the issue that is before us on the floor relating to the Congressional Review Act resolution that we will vote on shortly and in my view that will undermine existing law if it is passed. Too many times in recent years we have had the terrible responsibility of bearing witness to the trauma and grief that follow gun violence. We see it in our streets every day, not just in Sandy Hook, which every day weighs on our minds and thoughts and hearts in Connecticut but the more than 30,000 deaths every year and countless injures all across the country in big and small towns, the streets of Hartford as well as rural and suburban communities.  I am far from the only one in this Chamber who has borne witness to that trauma and grief. Gun violence has claimed too many lives in too many places, through mass shootings in movie theaters as well as the constant drumbeat of shootings that never make the headlines. Our constituents count on us to make them safe. That is one of the fundamental responsibilities of our government. And by overwhelming majorities, including majorities of Republicans and of gun owners, they support commonsense steps to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. In failing to move forward with legislation that would advance those goals, Congress has been complicit in this ongoing epidemic. It is truly a public health crisis. If more than 30,000 people died every year from disease or other kinds of communicable illnesses, there would be a call for drastic action.  This kind of public health crisis must be met with strong steps. When many of us in this body who believe that Congress must now take action to stem the scourge of gun violence hear one refrain from our colleagues--``enforce the law; enforce the law that already exists''--we must heed that cry.  Enforcing the law that already exists is exactly what this regulation entails. So we must be ready to move forward. Yet, as my friend and colleague Senator Murphy noted earlier, the Congressional Review Act resolution we are about to vote on will not only fail to enforce existing law, it will undermine existing law. Federal law prohibits those who have severe mental health issues--that is to say, issues that would prevent them from safely handling a gun, from possessing a gun.  Federal law also requires agencies that have information indicating that people are disqualified from gun possession to share that information with the NICS background check system. Under this regulation, the Social Security Administration has proposed to do[[Page S1151]]exactly that. Pursuant to the 2007 NICS Improvement Amendments Act--a law passed in the wake of the horrific Virginia Tech shooting to address significant loopholes in the background check system--the Social Security Administration will submit records to NICS for Social Security recipients who meet a specific set of carefully defined criteria. The regulation will apply only to a subset of Social Security disability recipients. It does not apply to those who are receiving Social Security retirement benefits. It applies only to those disability recipients who have been found, based on the Social Security Administration's established criteria, to be severely impaired due to a mental disability and who are therefore unable to perform substantial work or manage their own disability benefits.  Repealing this regulation could lead to great harm, exacerbating loopholes and failings in the background check system that erode public safety.  I have a letter from the United States Conference of Mayors, which represents city leaders from across our country. It says that ``due to loopholes in current law, too many mass murderers are still able to too easily obtain guns. This includes the individual responsible for killing 32 people and injuring 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007 that led to the enactment of the NICS Improvement Amendments These killings must stop and this rule, as implemented last year, will help to do that.''

Dear Senator: I write on behalf of the nation's Mayors to      urge you to strongly oppose Senate Joint Resolution 14 (S.     14), a bill to revoke a rule finalized last year by the      Social Security Administration (SSA), which strengthens our      nation's background check system for gun purchases by adding      the names of people who are severely incapacitated by their      condition and unable to manage their own finances.       The rule implements existing law, which required the SSA to      send the names of those identified as prohibited people to      the National Instant Background Check System (NICS). This      rule finally brings SSA in compliance with the NICS      Improvement Amendments Act (NIAA), a law that Congress passed      on a bipartisan basis and President Bush signed into law in      2007. It also is consistent with ATF's direction for      complying with the law.       The rule has a limited scope but is critically important to      the fabric of our nation's background check system. Under the      rule, people who receive benefits from the Social Security      Administration due to a severe ``mental impairment'' and      require a fiduciary representative to manage their benefits      would be notified and reported to the FBI's The rule      affects anyone 18 and older who qualifies for disability      because of a primary designation of ``mental impairment''      that prevents the person from working and who must have a      ``representative payee'' for handling his or her finances.      This includes people who have been certified to be afflicted      with severe mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia      and other psychotic disorders, personality disorders,      intellectual disabilities, anxiety-related disorders,      substance addiction disorders and autistic disorders. These      individuals have the right to appeal and a clear process for      doing so.       We all know that it is due to loopholes in current law that      too many mass murderers are still able to too easily obtain      guns. This includes the individual responsible for killing 32      people and injuring 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007 that      led to enactment of the These killings must stop and      this rule, as implemented last year, will help to do that.

Dear Senator: On behalf of the 19,000 cities and towns      represented by the National League of Cities, I write to      express strong opposition to Senate Joint Resolution 14 (S.     14) that will revoke a commonsense rule finalized last      year by the Social Security Administration (SSA).

The law requires SSA to send the      names of mentally ill people, who have been determined to be      a danger to themselves or others by a physician, to the gun      purchase background check system. It is troubling that Senate      is now considering S.14, which threatens to undermine      this reasonable, bipartisan legislation that is making      cities, and police officers, more safe.

This includes people who have been certified to be afflicted      with severe mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia      and other psychotic disorders, personality disorders,      intellectual disabilities, anxiety-related disorders,      substance addiction disorders and autistic disorders.       Loopholes in the NICS law have allowed people who are      clearly a danger to themselves or others to obtain guns. This      includes the individuals responsible for killing 32 people      and injuring 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007; killing six      people and injuring 13 others, including Congresswoman      Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson in 2011; killing 12 people and      injuring 70 others in Aurora in 2012; and killing 26 people,      including 20 children in Newtown in 2012.

In fact, I have been a strong advocate over many years of mental health parity, beginning when I was attorney general in the State of The very first Federal law on this issue that was passed was modeled in many ways after the State law that I championed. I was proud to support the passage of a bill last year to provide more resources to those seeking treatment, and I hope that it moves this country toward providing everyone with the care they need.  Mental health issues should be no cause for fear, no reason for stigma, no excuse for shame. Those who have come forward and been open about the treatment they have sought, in fact, have done themselves and their communities and country a great service. If I thought SSA regulations unfairly targeted people with mental illness or that it advanced the perception that they are inherently dangerous, I would oppose it with every fiber of my being, but that is not the regulation we have here.  As Senator Durbin said this morning and my colleague Senator Murphy reiterated, this rule is not one loosely applied to anyone who has some trouble balancing a checkbook; it applies only to those disability recipients with a serious and debilitating mental health issue. That is estimated to be about 75,000 people nationwide out of approximately 10 million Americans who suffer from a serious mental illness. Everyone who suffers from mental illness should have a right to treatment, but not all should have a gun. It is very unlikely that people who meet these criteria will be able to safely handle a gun or to safely store it in their home and prevent its misuse by themselves or by others.  It is possible that SSA's initial determination will be wrong. That is why crucially--please understand--crucially the regulation also provides due process. In fact, these due process protections are necessary when a constitutional right is at stake. This right, the Second Amendment right, must be respected as the law of the land. The regulation entitles those who are affected[[Page S1152]]by it to advanced notice. When going through the process to appoint someone else to handle their benefits, they are told that they will forfeit their firearms right. They are given that notice, and they are given due process. If they believe this is inappropriate or unnecessary, the regulation gives them that process to appeal. It is one that allows SSA to grant relief upon a determination that the beneficiary will not be ``dangerous to public safety,'' a term that has meaning.  SSA is also required to notify the NICS background check system if the name should be removed, whether it was submitted in error or because a beneficiary has recovered from the condition or because they were granted relief through the appeals process. Those are rights with real remedies, with due process, with fairness.  If I thought this regulation failed to provide adequate process that every individual is due, regardless of how much I support its goal, I would oppose it with, again, every fiber of my being because it should be and it is the law of the land.  Of course there may be ways that this regulation, like any regulation, could be improved if the criteria could be better targeted or if the due process protections could be made stronger or if the administration could be made more efficient. We should not hesitate to make those improvements. I would welcome suggestions for enhancements, but the methods chosen by my colleagues to attack this regulation--the Congressional Review Act--prevent any and all of those improvements.  Severely limiting the time for debate denies us adequate consideration. Much worse, it is a blunt-force instrument that will prevent the Social Security Administration from issuing any ``substantially similar'' regulation in the future. So the passage of this resolution will prevent the SSA from complying with the legal requirement for submitting legal records for a background check in the future. It will hamstring this agency and prevent it from fulfilling its obligation to public safety--that is regardless of whether new information comes to light or whether it would be possible to devise a better method of submitting these records.  In the words of the well-known and respected group Americans for Responsible Solutions, using the CRA to undo this rule would ``not only allow guns to be placed into the hands of individuals determined to be legally incapable of using them safely, but it also creates an irresponsible, irreversible precedent.''  As I have always said, I will work with my colleagues on any good-faith steps to stem the tide of gun violence in this country, and I would be more than happy--in fact, I am eager--to work with them to fix flaws they see in this regulation. We need to come together to improve the integrity and efficiency of the national background check system and keep guns out of the hands of people who cannot safely handle them. People who are dangerous to themselves or others--it may be a very small number, but they can do great tragic damage. The resolution we will vote on shortly accomplishes neither of these goals. It does nothing to answer my constituents who ask me time and time again why Congress does nothing to confront the epidemic of gun violence in this country. It would create an irresponsible, irreversible precedent. More important than the precedent is the consequence in real lives of the death and injury that could result. Those deaths and injuries are truly irreversible and irresponsible, and we can help to stop them by taking the right stand on this resolution.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

14391,topic-id,616,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation This bill, introduced by my colleague, Mr.Lucas, is a product of hard work and negotiation over the past two  In addition to Mr.Lucas, I thank Chairman Smith and also Environment Subcommittee chair, Mr.Bridenstine, and former chair, Mr.Chris Stewart, who were great partners in this process. The language before us today is a result of a truly bipartisan and bicameral effort.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is responsible for many important tasks at the cutting edge of science and public service, and weather forecasting is one of the tasks most critical to our country.  In the northwest Oregon communities I represent, my constituents rely on timely weather forecasts to decide when to harvest their crops, when to go to sea to fish, how to navigate the roads safely when there is freezing rain or snow, and to prepare for possible flood conditions.  The National Weather Service provides excellent forecasting products to support our economy, but with the increasing frequency of severe weather events, there can be and should be improvements in our forecasting capabilities and delivery.  For example, forecasts can be more precise regarding what will happen and when. Improved forecasts can provide more lead time to allow communities to prepare, especially in severe weather events. Forecast information should also be communicated more effectively to the public and those in harm's way to reduce the loss of life and property. This bill is designed to address those important goals.  The bill connects the research side of NOAA, the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, more effectively to the forecasting needs of the National Weather This research-to-operations pipeline is essential for the continued improvement of our weather forecasting enterprise.                              {time}  1715  The bill contains several provisions that will improve interactions and information sharing between NOAA's researchers and the National Weather It also improves communications between NOAA and the broader research and private weather communities.  The bill also establishes interagency coordination, through the Office of Science and Technology Policy, across multiple agencies outside of NOAA that share responsibilities for weather research and forecast communications. This is essential as we face budget constraints, and it will help speed the adoption of best tools and practices across the various agencies.  H.353 also recognizes that even the best forecasts will not serve the public's needs unless there are effective communications systems. The bill directs NOAA to do more research, listen to experts, and improve its risk communications techniques.  The bill also reestablishes a program that allows NOAA to give awards to people who save the lives of others through NOAA's Weather Radio All Hazards program. The bill also formally establishes the pilot program currently operating at NOAA to engage in contracts with the commercial sector for weather forecasting data.  Additionally, the bill requires NOAA to examine the benefits and costs of different sensors by running simulations of different configurations of instruments and datasets on forecasting accuracy. It is important that these requirements are not too prescriptive so that NOAA can use the most efficient, accurate, and cost-effective model for this situation.  This legislation will produce advances in weather forecasting and capabilities that will result in better development of forecast innovations and technology. Ultimately, this will save American lives and property.  I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle for their input and support. Also, I would like to thank the hardworking committee staff on both sides of the aisle for their efforts to continue negotiations to move this bill forward.

14393,topic-id,470,"Mr.Speaker, every year that I have had the honor to serve Oklahoma's First Congressional District, I have also faced the unfortunate reality that I will lose constituents to tornadoes, as will many of us who represent constituents in This terrible fact has motivated me and others from our delegation to work hard for policies that will save lives and property and move us to a day where we have zero deaths from tornadoes or other extreme weather events.  I would like to thank Chairman Smith, Vice Chairman Lucas, and Environment Subcommittee Ranking Member Bonamici for their tireless efforts to see this bipartisan legislation move forward.  The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 is the product of extensive negotiations between the Environment Subcommittee, which I chair, and the Senate Commerce Committee, and I am proud of the bipartisan and bicameral agreement that this bill represents.  H.353 directs the NOAA Administrator to prioritize activities that will save lives and protect property. Again, this is critically important to my State, which is in the heart of tornado alley.  This legislation will help NOAA develop more accurate and timely warnings for hurricanes, tornadoes, and other high-impact weather events. It calls on NOAA to develop a plan to maintain forecasting capabilities that are second to none in the world, primarily because, by some metrics, we lag behind our counterparts in Europe, the U.and  The bill encourages better cooperation across NOAA offices and enhances collaboration with universities, such as the University of Oklahoma, which is a national leader in weather research.  It will also ensure that innovative methods and technologies, such as warn on forecast, currently being developed at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma, are rapidly deployed in operational status so that the American people can benefit.  Further, beyond improvements to short-term forecasts of extreme events, the bill directs NOAA to improve our understanding of seasonal forecasts, which can be immensely useful to industries such as agriculture.  Mr.Speaker, I am particularly pleased this bill finally authorizes a commercial weather data pilot program. H.353 authorizes $24 million over the next 4 years for a pilot program for NOAA to purchase commercial space-based weather data and test it against NOAA's proprietary data. This can improve forecasts and save the Federal Government money. This will allow NOAA to continue to expand upon the two pilot contracts it awarded in September of last year.  Mr.Speaker, this has the potential to be a paradigm-shifting provision. Commercial weather data can augment the data we receive from systems such as JPSS and GOES, while also serving as a mitigation strategy in the event we experience a gap in weather data from these systems. More data from innovative sources has a real potential to improve our forecasting capabilities.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

14316,topic-id,2488,"Mr.President, I come to the floor tonight to start debate on what is called the Congressional Review Act of the stream protection rule. For people who are probably saying ``I don't understand any of that; could you explain it to me?'' what we are going to do tonight is to start this debate, which is really about clean water, and it is about making sure that polluters clean up their messes, particularly when it comes to streams and the beauty we have in our country that is used by many people. And it is about making sure that rules for polluters paying are enforced in law and, clearly, agencies which have developed those rules in conjunction with laws that are already on the books continue to have those laws in effect.  We are in a new administration, and already the debate is starting where people would like this end result to be clean water, 0; Donald Trump, the new President, 1. That is because this administration is starting a war on clean water, and tonight that debate is coming to the Senate floor. It is coming to the Senate floor because the last administration worked for more than 5 years on producing something to make sure that we had safe drinking water and safe stream water for fishing and to make sure that industries that are known for polluting ensure that their level of pollution is cleaned up.  After more than 5 years in the implementation of that rule, after thousands and thousands of hours of discussion and debate, as it has become a rule, now there is one thing that can stop it. There is one thing that can stop it; that is, if Congress uses its authority under the Congressional Review Act to repeal it within the 60 days of legislative action that it has become effective.[[Page S564]]  What is happening is that the Trump administration and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying to say that we want to repeal more than 5 years of hard work of clearly outlining a stream protection rule to protect streams in the United States of America from pollution caused by certain types of mining activity.  Let me show you a picture of what I am talking about. This stream could be anywhere in It could be anywhere in the United States of It is probably a good picture. Why? Because it shows the great outdoors. Probably for me, it is somewhere I would like to hike. It shows a stream, but it shows the degradation of that stream with the pollution in the stream.  Whether you are Trout Unlimited, which supported this rule, or you are the Wilderness Society, or all the hunting and fishing groups that supported this rule, or you are just one of the many citizens in a State where mining exists and you are happy that it exists there but you also want them to be clean up their messes--these are the people who do not want to see this level of degradation in the streams.  Why don't they want to see it? Because first and foremost they obviously don't want to see it, but if you are a fisherman and you are out fishing, you certainly don't want to see the impacts that selenium is causing on fish.  There are a couple of incidents here where the impacts of selenium on fish are shown in this diagram. Deformation both here in the tail and here in the mouth of fish are impacts from selenium in streams. We do not want to see selenium having that kind of impact on our fish.  What do we want to do? We want to make sure that we are measuring selenium in the streams and that we are cleaning it up. That is what we want to do. The notion that somehow people have described a rule for stream protection that is about having safe drinking water and having safe fishing water is about a ``war on coal'' is just wrongheaded. This is about making sure that we don't overturn something that took over 5 years to get in place. And I should say, it is the first time in 33 years that we have updated this rule.  For 33 years, the Department of the Interior has said that the hydraulic impact of mining on a stream should be mitigated. What has changed in the last 33 years is that we now have better technology and we have more information about selenium. We know that it impacts fish, and we want mining companies to measure their impacts on headwaters and make sure they are doing something to minimize this selenium impact.  I know people think that maybe in this process for 5 years--somehow that created a decrease in the amount of coal in the United States of America, even though the rule was just getting started. Let's look at the real issue. The real issue is that natural gas becoming cheaper in the United States of America has pushed down the demand for purchasing coal, a more expensive product that had nothing do with this rule.  I have been in business and, yes, you plan for the future. And if you think your business is going to have to increase its insurance or change its business practices, yes, you consider all of that, but this chart clearly shows that our electricity grid has gone from having 50 percent of it supplied by coal now down--as this line is crossing here--to about 30 percent of our electricity grid from coal.  This rule was not in place. Saying that you want to have safe drinking water has nothing to do with what has happened in the marketplace as natural gas has become a more viable option than coal. This chart shows it.  We have another chart that also shows this 23-percent decline in coal. Why? Again, because of natural gas consumption going up. For those on the other side who would like to say this is somehow about a war on coal, I will tell you, we should not denigrate anybody for the job that they have done to support their families. In fact, I believe we should make sure they have a pension, make sure they have health care.  It is a tragedy that we bailed out Wall Street from the U.Treasury, and as pension programs all across America imploded, nobody wanted to bail out the pension program for miners so they could retire with the kinds of health benefits that other people do. If we want to help individuals who are suffering in coal country, I suggest that we take care of their pensions.  In the meantime, what we should do is make sure we are preparing for the health and safety of people who depend on these streams for multiple uses; that is to say, there are those in an outdoor economy who count just as much on those streams and count on them not being polluted because of certain mining activities.  This chart can be shown in just about every State of the United The outdoor economy in our States--the people who like to go fishing, the people who like to go hunting, the people who like to navigate our rivers and want to do so when they are not polluted--is 6.1 million direct jobs in the United That basically dwarfs the coal industry.  This isn't about saying one job is better than the other, but the notion that somehow we are hurting our economy because we want to have clean streams and we want people to be able to safely catch fish without selenium in them is basically ignoring the facts. By not regulating the coal industry to make sure they are cleaning up their mess, you are hurting the 6.1 million jobs that depend on having clean streams.  I know people here probably understand that Montana is full of streams. That movie, ``A River Runs Through It,'' is iconic in the Northwest as an example of why people love the outdoors because they want to fish. They want the experience of going and being outdoors and having the wonder of that.  I personally have been in the streams of West Virginia and have had a fabulous time. I want other people to understand that these streams are worth protecting all over the United States of But the movie is not called ``A River Runs Through It and a Mine Sits on Top of It.'' We don't have people moving to Montana and buying ranches, making investments, hiring people, and diversifying because they want to see the mines in They want to see the beauty of the outdoors. They want it to be pure and pristine, and they want people to clean up their pollution. If we are talking about an economy and you want to talk about jobs, do not ruin the $80 billion in tax revenue that comes from an outdoor industry because you want to allow an industry to continue to pollute.  I am going to continue for the next year to make this point to my colleagues in the West who are going to try to overturn every rule they don't like because they think somehow that they want to claim it impacts jobs. We are going to have this discussion, and we are going to show that the outdoor economy is just as important and is actually producing more jobs and producing more revenue. The only point of conflict, I think, is when one impacts the other to the degree of creating pollution and then taking a beautiful stream away from us--because no one wants to fish in a stream with that level of pollution.  Why are we here? We are here because certain types of mining--particularly, mountaintop removal mining--make it way more challenging to protect those streams. As I mentioned, for the last several years, people have been discussing what to do to make sure that these companies are making sure the environmental impacts are minimized. The production of these mines has actually fallen a great degree in the last several years.  We have been working, as I said, during this time period to make sure that we implement the right kind of regulations so that people will clean up this mess. As I mentioned, it has been basically since the early eighties until this level of attention was given to a new rule. Why do we want to change a rule that was from 1983? Because it says that you must minimize the disturbances to the prevailing hydraulic balance at the mine site and offer areas and quality of water and ground water systems, both during and after the mining operations.  President Trump did not invent that. That has been in law all along. The notion that somehow that has changed is not correct. It has been in the opening days of the Trump administration that people are trying to say that stewardship doesn't matter, that somehow, yes, we want to have immaculate water[[Page S565]]and immaculate air--as President Trump said--but it is OK if regulations cause a problem for business. What business? The outdoor industry or the coal industry? Because right now, you are talking about making a change to what is protection of those streams and repealing a law that is about safe drinking water. We don't want to eliminate that.  We want to make sure that we use the best technology available to minimize the disturbances, address the impacts on fish and wildlife, and any other related environmental issues. We know a lot more about mining and fishing. As I showed you one picture, I will show you another impact of selenium. Basically, it is showing the deformation. What we now know much more about is how selenium does impact these areas.  What is at stake if you kill the stream protection rule? Our sportsmen--groups like the National Wildlife Federation and Trout Unlimited--say this:       The resolution is an ill-conceived tool for jettisoning a      very useful rule that protects mountain head water streams      and communities throughout the coal country in We      urge you to oppose striking this rule, and to instead work      with the Department of Interior to protect these streams, and      make necessary improvements to improve the CRA, instead of      using it as a cleaver.  They go on to say:       150,000 passionate trout anglers work to conserve, protect      and restore our Nation's trout and salmon fisheries and their      watersheds. And our members give back to the resources they      love by investing dollars and hundreds of thousands of      volunteer hours to conserve streams.  So you can see that they feel passionately about this. They feel passionately because this is part of our outdoor economy and what people have passion about.  In my State, people would say: Well, you have these other jobs. No, actually, in our State, there are 250 abandoned mines in Yes, if we don't clean them up, and if we don't make sure there is reclamation, there is still pollution.  We have had a mine history in our State, but we want responsible mining and we want responsible cleanup. With today's rule that is in place and that you are trying to repeal--to repeal safe drinking water, basically--that would take those tools away and allow pollution to continue. What is the cost of that? It is very small. You would think that the way some people go on about this, that somehow this is astronomical amounts of money. Basically, it is about 0.1 percent of the industry's annual revenue. When you are in business, you think about your costs. You think about your cost of doing business. Yes, the cost of doing business has to include making sure that you clean up pollution. To me, this is an industry that makes way more than this in its annual revenue.  Am I empathetic to my colleagues who represent States that are changing in their energy mix and resources? Do you think we need to have a plan for that? Do I think we need to have a plan for how we are going to diversify? Yes, I do. But this is not an economic debate about how we are going to save jobs. In reality, as I showed in the chart before, the natural gas prices are driving coal to a much lower level of our electricity grid than ever before in our history, and that is not going to change.  Let's make sure we clean up our streams. Let's make sure we use the best technology available to make sure we are detecting that pollution and require people to have a minimal amount of responsibility in the cost of what it takes to make sure that selenium is not in drinking water or impacting our fish.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from North                        Spirit of Bipartisanship  ",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgS562.txt,172,THE JOURNAL,2017.0,1.0,March
14322,topic-id,1500,"Mr.President, I know my colleague from Oregon is around somewhere and wanted to speak on this rule, and when he shows up on the floor, we will certainly give him the time to do so. I want to make a couple of points while we are waiting for him.  First, in this discussion here with my colleagues, there is some discussion and I guess the start of what will be a continuing theme that somehow, if you get rid of regulations, we are going to restore competitiveness to the U.economy. Nothing could be further from the truth.  If you ask businesses what we need to do to be competitive as a country, they will say: Make sure we have a great education system. Make sure we invest in R&Let's develop new technology.  If we look at where businesses are locating, they want to locate in beautiful, pristine places because they know that is where their employees will want to locate. So, first of all, that somehow the government is going to restore the economy by deregulating and letting polluters pollute is just not correct. It is not what America wants. What people want is to have safe drinking water, and they want an outdoor economy that is supported by having a great environment.  So I want to say a couple of other things. Obviously, this rule that we are talking about and that has been developed over a long period of time is an[[Page S571]]improvement over the 1983 rule because it gives us a better idea on the pollution that is happening. Now, if people don't want to know that information, I guess that is The court, counter to what my colleague from West Virginia said, did not say that it was suspending the rule. It said that it was still in effect, that the pollution had to be cleaned up. It said: Come back and look at the economic impact. But somehow, some are saying that the Supreme Court decision on the MATS rule gave EPA and others a get-out-of-jail-free card; you don't have to look at pollutants. They have to look at pollutants.  So what is this issue about? It is about clean water.  Mr.President, I wish to enter into the Record a couple of articles that I have seen from constituents. My colleague from West Virginia mentioned a few people. These are the real people in America who want this.  One of them is a gentleman named Ben Kurtz, who happens to be from Grand Junction, This is what he says:       It's often said that drag is a fly fisherman's greatest      enemy. The truth, however, is that a wet fly or heavy drag is      irrelevant if you don't have clean water to fish. Our lakes,      rivers, streams and the fish that inhabit them are all      extremely sensitive to pollution. And right now, many of      these streams all across our country are being threatened by      dirty groundwater stemming from coal mines.       Despite this, it's been nearly a decade since the      Department of Interior has updated its Stream Protection      Rule--an inadequate, Reagan-era regulation governing impacts      to waterways from coal mining which was weakened even further      under the Bush administration.       For the last six years, DOI has been engaged in the process      of updating and gathering input on the rule, with the      ultimate goal of revising it to make it more effective, in      line with the challenges our waters face today as well as the      law Congress passed in the 1970s to create it. While it has      been a long time coming, that process now appears to be      coming to a close.       Once finalized, the revised rule would establish common-     sense new protections that would safeguard the health of our      waterways, and by extension, the communities that are      impacted by them. For example, the rule would strengthen      baseline requirements for water quality testing to ensure      that coal mining operations are not polluting streams in a      manner similar to that of the old hardrock mines throughout      the       In addition, the revised standards would require coal mines      to develop a plan for how to protect fish and wildlife while      also putting in place measures that will reduce impacts on      habitats and improve reclamation of mines that have      shuttered.  I mentioned earlier as a side note to this letter that we have 250 such mines in our       These proposed changes are just common sense: The rule is      low-cost (independent analysts have calculated that the      safeguards would cost between 1 and 60 cents per ton of coal      that's mined) and while the revisions are expected to result      in cleaner waters and improved public health, its impact on      jobs will be slim to none.       Still, the issuing of a strong final Stream Protection Rule      is not a foregone conclusion, as the coal industry is intent      on maintaining the status quo. Were that to transpire it      would mean streams that are at greater risk of being polluted      with coal mine waste and runoff.       Taking all of this into account, it's clear that whether      you're a fly fisherman or not, the revised rule is something      we should all support. Cleaner waters not only mean better      fishing but cleaner and healthier communities too.       Speaking on behalf of my fellow fly fishermen, I applaud      the Department of the Interior for its ongoing efforts to      enact sensible safeguards that protect the federal lands we      all support and enjoy. It's time for DOI to push the Stream      Protection Rule update across the finish line so we      fishermen--  Obviously, this letter was written before that--     can go back to worrying about the little things--like what      color fly to cast--rather than fretting over groundwater      pollution that threatens our vibrant ecosystems and      jeopardizes our health.  Well, I think Mr.Kurtz said it the best.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Protection for Our Rivers and Streams Is Long Overdue                             (By Ben Kurtz)       It's often said that drag is a fly fisherman's greatest      enemy. The truth, however, is that a wet fly or heavy drag is      irrelevant if you don't have clean water to fish. Our lakes,      rivers, streams and the fish that inhabit them are all      extremely sensitive to pollution. And right now, many of      these streams all across the country are being threatened by      dirty groundwater stemming from coal mines.       Despite this, it's been nearly a decade since the      Department of Interior has updated its Stream Protection      Rule--an inadequate, Reagan-era regulation governing impacts      to waterways from coal mining which was weakened even further      under the Bush administration.       For the last six years, DOT has been engaged in the process      of updating and gathering input on the rule, with the      ultimate goal of revising it to make it more effective, in      line with the challenges our waters face today as well as the      law Congress passed in the 1970s to create it. While it has      been a long time coming, that process now appears to be      coming to a close.       Once finalized, the revised rule would establish common-     sense new protections that would safeguard the health of our      waterways, and by extension, the communities that are      impacted by them. For example, the rule would strengthen      baseline requirements for water quality testing to ensure      that coal mining operations are not polluting streams in a      manner similar to that of the old hardrock mines throughout      the       In addition, the revised standards would require coal mines      to develop a plan for how to protect fish and wildlife while      also putting in place measures that will reduce impacts on      habitats and improve reclamation of mines that have      shuttered.       These proposed changes are just common sense: The rule is      low-cost (independent analysts have calculated that the      safeguards would cost between 1 and 60 cents per ton of coal      that's mined) and while the revisions are expected to result      in cleaner waters and improved public health, its impact on      jobs will be slim to none.       Still, the issuing of a strong final Stream Protection Rule      is not a foregone conclusion, as the coal industry is intent      on maintaining the status quo. Were that to transpire it      would mean streams that are at greater risk of being polluted      with coal mine waste and runoff.       Taking all of this into account, it's clear that whether      you're a fly fisherman or not, the revised rule is something      we should all support. Cleaner waters not only mean better      fishing but cleaner and healthier communities too.       Speaking on behalf of my fellow fly fishermen, I applaud      the Department of Interior for its ongoing efforts to enact      sensible safeguards that protect the federal lands we all      support and enjoy.

14323,topic-id,1107,"Mr.President, I can read others, but these are the people who are concerned about this rule. These are the individuals who want to know whether we are going to do our job and to say that polluters must pay. I believe that if we have the technology and the rules to do that, why would miners object? Why would the mining industry object to having the correct information?  I will read another letter from a Montana rancher this time.       As a long-time rancher of north of Billings, water supply      has been a 70-year-old struggle for my ranch. The coal      industry has posted a threat to my water supply since the      1970s, and more recently increased mining, spurred by fast-     growing markets and the export to Asia, which has sparked      water damage across the The limited water we are      talking about in the West makes it doubly valuable and in      need of protection. As the saying goes: ``Whiskey is for      drinking and water is for fighting.'' So it is absolutely      essential that we protect the water we have, and sometimes      that means a stronger rule from the Federal       Most cattle ranchers in the Bull Mountains where I live      rely on a combination of wells and natural springs to water      our livestock. And like other nearby operations, my ranch is      currently being literally undermined by coal mines using      massive and destructive long wall machines that make it      difficult for efficient mining because of surface      disruptions, impairing coal aquifers, subsiding recharge      areas, and they pull surface streams underground. I can think      of no industry that degrades water in such a reckless and      cavalier way as the coal industry. From acid mine drainage      and thousands of mines' buried headwaters across Appalachia,      to eating streams on the prairie that are destroying wells      and springs in Montana's Bull       While Montana surface mining laws require reclamation of      the area over long mines, reclamation is a slow and uncertain      process, and water in the existing mines in Montana has not      been reclaimed, according to the bond-released statistics.      These proposals for mining are to be included along these      rivers and even moving along tributaries, to get it out of      the way of coal mining. In Wyoming, Angelo Creek is slowly      being eaten by a coal mine. With all of it as a backdrop, I      am happy to see the proposal by the Department of the      Interior to update this regulation put in place over 30 years      ago.[[Page S572]]       So the proposed Stream Protection Rule would safeguard      communities from destructive coal mining practices and keep      pace with our current science and modern mining practices.      These new rules would minimize impacts to surface and      groundwater such as springs on my property by requiring      companies to avoid mining practices that permanently pollute      and diminish streams, requiring coal companies to test and      monitor the conditions of streams that their mining might      impact before and during and after operations.       The proposed rule would also require companies to restore      streams and other waters that they were using and that were      capable of supporting, like in the ranching area, prior to      the mining activities. The Department of the Interior could      also improve parts of the stream protection rule by providing      technical assistance.       It is very well to have good standards and test these out      in rules, but if they are poorly implemented on the ground      and over time, the results will be like no rule. So the      Interior Department's work to update and modernize these      decade-old rules and regulations is absolutely essential if      we are going to keep a bad situation from getting worse.      Clean water in the West is too precious to let coal companies      pollute it or diminish it.  This happens to be from a woman named Ellen Pfister who has a cattle ranch in the Bull Mountains area of Shepherd,  So these are just two examples of people who really want to see us do something. Why? Because clean water is so important to them. It is so important to the outdoor economy, and it is important to this particular rancher who wants to make sure that clean water is an aspect of their farming.  There are a couple of other points I wanted to make about the rule and this notion that somehow overregulation has destroyed the pension program. It is so amazing that here in the Senate, somebody thinks that overregulation could blow that big of a hole into the pension program. The pension program had a more than 23-percent drop in the implosion of the economy in 2008 and 2009. So that kind of hole was there before this process. It is sad that now miners who are going to reach a retirement age won't have a pension to retire on. I think it is appalling that we bailed out Wall Street and we don't want to help with a pension program that basically took a major hit during the downturn. What are we saying to people? We don't care about those pensions, but we will turn over the keys to the Treasury to someone else?  So the notion that, somehow, standing up for clean water is equated with the pension program is just not true. We support those workers. We will do anything to help them from all aspects of that picture, including giving them a pension and making sure they have health care and retirement. We have had that discussion, and many of my colleagues had that discussion here late into the night just at the end of last year. I am sure that we are waiting for a response from Leader McConnell as to when he is going to put that kind of legislation on the Senate floor. But, unfortunately, what we have instead is a rule trying to hold back making sure that we have safe drinking water, safe fishing water, and an outdoor economy that can count on these things.  I thank my colleague from Hawaii for being here earlier and talking about this issue, as well as my colleague who is the ranking member from the EPW committee, Senator Carper from Delaware, making an eloquent statement and talking about the West Virginia economy, as he is a native of West Virginia, and now my colleague from Oregon, who is also addressing this issue. I appreciate their coming to the floor tonight and being part of this discussion.  This is so important to all of us and really to all of our country. I think making sure that people understand how important clean water is to various aspects is so important.

14319,topic-id,2163,"Mr.President, I am here to speak in support of the Congressional Review Act on the stream protection rule.  I want to say to those who participated in the last election--where part of the discussion was the Federal Government knows all and needs to be in your life and in your business life every day, and it knows the best one-size-fits-all way--that help is on the way today. A lot of the talk of the election is now going into action in the form of the Congressional Review  In particular, the stream protection rule was a last-minute power grab that was aimed at giving more power to the Federal  Now, at the onset, I would like to say this: I don't have any charts. I don't have any pictures, but then I thought, you know what. Yes, I do. I have a lot of pictures on my device here, which I will not open up because it is against the rules and you will not be able to see anyway. But in these pictures, you will see a picture of me fishing in a beautiful stream in West Virginia, where trout is unlimited. You will see me riding an ATV on a Hatfield-McCoy Trail, which is the old mining trails and the old lumber trails in southern mine country in West Virginia, where thousands of people come every year. You will see me visiting a school or a business park that is built on the top of what is a reclaimed mountaintop removal.  If you have ever been to West Virginia, they don't call us the Mountain State for nothing. It is mountain after mountain after mountain, difficult terrain, and in some ways it is very difficult to have any kind of economic development.  So when the laws are enforced--the laws that we have now, in terms of water protection and reclamation--after the mining is finished, we have been able to have some economic development projects that have been to the benefit of many communities there.[[Page S568]]  So I have no charts. I live there. This is my home. I can drive 4 miles and be at a coal mine very easily, probably less than that.  I heard the argument about outdoor recreation, that people want to have outdoor recreation. I just described three outdoor recreation activities in my State, and the ranking member was talking about how she fished in West Virginia and enjoyed it and had good luck, I hope. Anyway, we have beautiful trout streams, but the outdoor recreator doesn't want to see a coal mine. I would bet the outdoor recreator doesn't want to see a nuclear plant, probably doesn't want to see a windmill farm, probably doesn't want to see a natural gas plant because when you are getting away to recreate, I don't know that anybody would want that, but I can tell you what they do want.  They want the steel that is in their truck to get them there. They want the electricity that they have to have when they go home at night to cook their food or clean their clothes or all the different things that electricity does.  There are tradeoffs to everything. Certainly coal has provided the baseload of the industrial revolution for this country, and we still, I think, have a great role to play.  There are estimates with this rule. The other thing is, it was said that there were no rules in place until we had this rule. That is absolutely false--absolutely false. This rule was rushed in. It was worked on for 5 years, yes. It had 10 State regulators. Let me go back.  The regulation, under the Clean Water Act, is done by the States through the EPA, in conjunction with State and Federal, with the EPA overseeing what the States are doing to make sure they are meeting the minimum standards.  So there are protections in place, and we welcome those protections. Where we live, where everybody lives, we want that. Can we do better? Absolutely, we can do better. We should always strive to do better.  This rule has been in the making for 5 years. Ten States came to this table, 10 States which were most heavily impacted, to try to help the Department of Interior develop this rule.  Our DEP Secretary Randy Huffman says that this proposed version of a stream protection rule--and this is not a Republican-Democrat thing. This is a Democratic Governor's DEP commissioner saying that it was ``an unnecessary, uncalled for political gesture.'' He went on to say that ``the combined administrative record developed throughout the history of mining regulation under SMCRA is totally devoid of any indication of a need for this radical rewrite of the regulations governing the way coal is mined in America.''  Other States have made comments as well. We had the Ohio Chief of Mineral Resources Management Lanny Erdos testify before our EPW ``OSM has not provided for meaningful participation with the cooperating or commenting agency States.''  Basically, these State regulators who were charged with the primacy of putting forward the water standards in their States and overseeing mining in their States were basically invited into the party and then put in another room and not listened to. Then, eight of them walked away. That has to tell you, this wasn't an even playing field and was probably a very insincere effort to include everybody's opinions.  In Wyoming, Todd Parfitt said: ``The failure to engage cooperating agencies throughout this process is reflected in the poor quality of the proposed rule.''  We have heard a lot about the empathetic voices of the job losses: 60,000 miners since 2011, many of them in my Many of these men and women who were making $80, $90,000 a year no longer have a job. They are living in communities that are decimated.  Our State is $500 million in the hole. We are trying to transition. We are trying to do the right thing, but rules like this that we are about to overturn through the CRA process are such an overreach of authority.  The EPA has already gotten slapped down by the Supreme Court for the match rule. They put a stay on the Clean Power There are definite questions as to the authorities that the past administration has put forward.  United Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts says: ``We are especially concerned with the long-term negative impact this rule is very likely to have on future longwall coal mining in the United States and associated employment impacts on our miners.''  We have heard about mountaintop removal. There is a strong belief that this will impact our underground mining as well. That is pretty much--I wish I knew the exact percentage, but I would say well over 70 or 75 percent of the mining and maybe more than that.  I hosted Senate committee field hearings centered on energy jobs in Beckley, Logan, and Bo Copley, a coal miner who lost his job, talked about the impact regulatory policies were having on him, his young family, his community, and his former colleagues.  We heard about the fact that the health and pension of our miners is in deep trouble. I have been very much on board. Senator Manchin and I have been working hard--along with Senator Portman, Senator Brown--with those more affected regions to make sure the health care and pensions of our miners are funded and that those miners know that the benefits that were promised will be there for them and their families. The promises made will be promises kept, but this downturn in the coal industry heavily affects the ability for the pension funds to be solvent and for the health benefits to be carried on. So there is a direct correlation between the overregulation we have seen and the effects in the health and pension funds.  The ranking member on the Energy Committee--and we just had a good conversation. I will paraphrase what she said: Sometimes I think we are sort of talking by one another. And I think maybe she is right in certain respects, and she mentioned the effect of natural gas on the coal industry. Yes, that has had an effect on the coal industry, but this rule that was proposed, rushed in at the last minute by the Department of Interior, would have an even more devastating effect than the combination of regulations to this point, the combination of the natural gas and market conditions.  So you ask: Oh, how rushed in was it if it was being worked on for 5 years?  Well, they didn't publish the rule until December 20, 2016, after the election--the election in which overregulation was one of the key factors that was discussed during the election and the effect on economies and businesses and the ability for American workers to continue to work hard and keep their jobs, but Americans rejected the continuation of these policies.  So they published the rule on December 20, 2016, and then it was made effective January 19, 2017.  What is January 19, 2017? It was the day before President Obama left office. There is no irony there at all, I don't think.  I am here to say that Senator McConnell and I have put this forward. It is one of the first ones that has come forward in terms of the Congressional Review Help is on the way, and the President will sign this. He has said in his Statement of Administration Policy: ``The administration is committed to reviving America's coal communities, which have been hurting for too long.''  Again, I can tell you about it. I could probably show you pictures of it. I live there. These are my friends. These are folks I see every day. I see them in the grocery store. And we have seen the effects in our region to the point of six of our counties are in deep, deep depressions.  So I want to congratulate the House of Representatives for passing this earlier today. I want to thank West Virginia Representatives David McKinley, Evan Jenkins, and Alex Mooney for voting yes and getting a strong vote. I would like to thank Leader McConnell for his leadership on this and the 27 other cosponsors of this bill.  Lastly, I would like to say, we heard the Senator from Hawaii talk about how this is really going to create jobs. Well, I found an article from the Wall Street Journal on December 20, 2016, and I am going to quote from it.       Interior's projections about the economic impact are      laughable. OSM reckons the rule would cost a mere 124 coal      mining jobs a year--  Whereas, other estimates are almost as much as one-third of the jobs--[[Page S569]]       but instead of visiting operating mines, the wizards at OSM      built their estimates on computer models. They even reported      a net gain in jobs--  And I think this is what the Senator from Hawaii was talking about--     as miners are replaced by workers implementing the rule.  Less mining but more workers--genius.  This reminds me a little bit of when we were talking about all of the regulatory burdens of Dodd-Frank, which I am sure we will be getting into in another I was on the Financial Services Committee over in the House for a long time, and we learned, when Dodd-Frank went into effect, within a year and a half, the largest growing profession was bank auditors. So the government has created jobs for bank auditors to put forward their rules. It sounds a lot like that is what OSM has done with this rule.  I would just like to close with this. We are going to move forward with this because it is important to our region. It is important to a lot of working people. It will not and does not in any form or fashion allow fowling of the water, fowling of our streams. There are protections that are carried forth through our State regulators who came to the table for this rule, who felt they were not being listened to and, over the course of 5 years, all drifted out. I don't think they were invited back. I am confident this will have an effect of saying: America, you voted to unleash the American economy, to let our regulators regulate, to let our clean water statutes move forward in conjunction with State and Federal regulators, to let Americans know that the Federal Government is not going to be reaching into every aspect of your life and it is going to result in losing your job, creating hopelessness, 72 teachers being laid off in my county last month because we have lost people, real estate values going down, and the loss of a valuable resource that leads to the strength and to the viability and to the security because energy security is security for our country, for our whole country.

14320,topic-id,918,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to this effort under the Congressional Review Act to block implementation of the stream protection rule.  CRA offers Congress an important tool, as we know, to consider potentially egregious rules that are promulgated usually at the end of Presidential terms. The stream protection rule, which we are considering this evening, is not one of those.  I live in a State--Delaware--whose citizens can be adversely affected by the upstream actions of others and border States whose citizens could be compromised by the things we do.  I take it as a matter of faith that we should treat other people the way we want to be treated. We call that the Golden Rule, and I know that not everyone shares my passion for the Golden Rule, even though it appears not just in my faith, those who happen to be Catholic or Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist--it appears in all faiths, the idea that we ought to treat other people the way we want to be treated.  I also believe the Federal Government should act to protect citizens from the harm of the actions that other citizens would do to them. This stream protection rule is, I believe, one of those actions.  I am a native West I was born in Beckley, WV, a coal mining town in South Central West I understand well the role coal mining has played in supporting families in my native State and communities there for longer than any of us can personally remember.  I also know that mining operations have had a devastating impact on the lives of those who have endured compromised drinking water and destroyed natural habitat, with a loss of the fish and wildlife that define the fabric of my native State and all other  This rule has been a long time coming, as we have heard this evening. Indeed, we are living with rules governing mining conduct that go back, I believe, as far as 30 years. It is time for an upgrade, and I think the rule before us is a sound, responsible, and carefully developed answer to that need.  In what is becoming an art form in this country, there are myths--some call them alternative facts--that are swirling around this rule. As ranking member and the senior Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, I want to address a couple of them.  Some would attack this rule's provisions as redundant and inconsistent with State obligations under the Clean Water I am also a former Governor and am keenly aware of the problems of inefficient governance and avoided at all costs conflicts between State agencies. It wasn't always easy, but we didn't need Federal actions to compound those frictions. I am happy to say that the drafters of this rule heard those concerns, and this rule promotes collaboration and coordination between mining and environmental agencies and clarifies their roles, preserving their authorities under the surface mining and clean water laws.  Both the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers concurred with the final rules, and in doing so, EPA said: ``We have concluded that nothing in the Stream Protection Rule is inconsistent with the provisions of the Clean Water Act and that the final rule does not inhibit the EPA's Clean Water Act authority to require that surface mining activities comply with all applicable provisions of the Clean Water Act, particularly those provisions related to water quality.''  The EPA goes on to say: ``The final Stream Protection Rule incorporates measures to limit duplication and avoid inconsistency in the implementation of Surface Mining and Reclamation Act and Clean Water Act programs, while supporting complementary, comprehensive, and effective environmental reviews of proposed surface coal mining operations.''  Some would say that the stream protection rule allows the U.Fish and Wildlife Service to veto Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act permits. That is not true. It is true that section 7 of the Endangered Species Act does require the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement of the Department of the Interior to consult with the U.Fish and Wildlife Service if any action ``may affect'' listed terrestrial and freshwater species.  The stream protection rule allows permit applicants and regulatory authorities to achieve ESA compliance in a variety of ways but does not provide the Fish and Wildlife Service any veto authority over permits. Indeed, this past year, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement and the Fish and Wildlife Service completed consultation under the Endangered Species Act, resulting in what is known as the 2016 Biological This new Biological Opinion smooths the way for more efficient Endangered Species Act compliance, while providing important protections to industry and State regulators regarding possible impacts of mining operations on protected species.  I think it is important to note that if we kill this rule, that protection for industry and State regulators will go away. Let me repeat that. I think it is important to note that if we kill this rule, that protection for industry and State regulators will go away, and those players will have to resort to a more cumbersome case-by-case review under the Endangered Species Act for all activities that might affect protected species. That would be a shame for a struggling industry.  For those and a host of other reasons my colleagues will offer today, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution.

I rise not just to pay tribute to his life, his work, and his success but, most importantly, what he meant to the people of Pennsylvania--all that he did above and beyond in addition to his great business success.  I want to extend condolences to the Boscov family--to his wife Eunice, their children and grandchildren, and, of course, to the people of Reading and[[Page S1156]]Berks County, and, by extension, our entire Commonwealth because of what Al meant to his community and the larger community in eastern Pennsylvania but also all the way up to my home area of northeastern  I live in One of his stores was, and still is, in the downtown business district in So this is personal to me as well.  Al leaves two generations who will carry on his legacy in so many ways: his three daughters, Ruth, Ellen, and Meg, and his five grandchildren.  Al was born on September 22, 1929. He was the youngest son of Solomon and Ethel He first made a name for himself as an expert flycatcher in his father's neighborhood store at Ninth and In those days, when he was just learning skills that would help him later in the business world, obviously people could see a great future for this young man.  He was a graduate of Reading Senior High He also graduated with a business degree from Drexel University, where he started his first business--a delivery service for hero sandwiches--which would presage a great career in business.  Al received an honorary doctor of humanities degree from Albright College in Reading, a doctor of arts and letters degree from King's College in Wilkes-Barre, PA, and, finally, a doctor of public service from Kutztown So three distinguished Pennsylvania universities paid tribute to him by way of a doctorate degree.  He served in the Navy during the Korean war. After service, Al returned home to join the family business and, in 1962, opened Boscov's first full-service department store, Boscov's West, in suburban Since that time, the Boscov chain has become the largest family-owned department store chain in the Nation, with 45 stores in 7 States, employing some 7,500 coworkers.  Here is what Al said about his store, which shows the attitude he conveyed as a businessperson and a member of the community. When he talked about people visiting his stores, he said:       We like to give people a reason for coming to Boscov's even      when they don't want to buy anything. They enjoy themselves      and hopefully we make a friend.  What a great attitude for any business leader, especially one who opened his business in the town in which he grew up.  Al's family remains especially proud of his continual efforts to fight prejudice and promote cultural understanding. For example, at times of growing racial tension in Reading years ago, Al used his three Reading stores to present a heritage festival, providing the opportunity for the African-American community to share various aspects of Black culture, whether food, art, writing, or entertainment.  Similarly, Al Boscov presented a Puerto Rican heritage festival in both his Reading and Lebanon stores--Lebanon being in the middle of Pennsylvania--again, bringing together the Hispanic, White, and Black communities with a theme of ``Knowing is Understanding.'' His belief that we all must take time to know each other and to take care of each other remains as one of the most important and, his family hopes, lasting legacies.  As the chairman of Boscov's, Al set new standards for successful retailing, community involvement, and civic duty. He founded and led the nonprofit Our City Reading, Inc., to assist Reading in restoring abandoned homes and to bring about a resurgence in downtown Under his leadership, more than 600 families had the opportunity to own and live in a new home. He led the efforts to equip a senior citizens center in downtown The Horizon Center provides seniors with hot meals and activities. I could go on and on, but I will not this afternoon.  It is clear from his life that he was very successful. It is also clear from his life that he gave and gave, not only to his home community of Reading, but well beyond. I know from my own personal experience what he did for northeastern Pennsylvania, for Lackawanna County, Luzerne County, and a lot of other counties as well.  So we are thinking of Al Boscov today, remembering his generosity, remembering his legacy, and remembering the many contributions he made to the Commonwealth of  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

14435,topic-id,298,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.288, the Small Business Broadband Deployment This commonsense, bipartisan legislation does two important things. First, it extends the temporary exemption granted to small businesses by the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, from the burdensome disclosure requirements for Internet service providers and the FCC's own Open Internet Order by 5 years. Second, it increases the number of small businesses that can utilize the exemption by raising the threshold from 100,000 subscribers to the much more realistic 250,000 subscribers.  Small businesses frequently feel that the Federal Government exercises its most creativity in looking for new ways to get in their way. Oftentimes, small Internet providers are the only ones willing to take the risk and deploy broadband to particularly hard-to-reach areas of rural The last thing they have time for is the FCC imposing a greater regulatory burden on them, diverting precious resources to make Washington bureaucrats busy instead of doing what they do best, providing high quality broadband services to millions of Americans in every corner of our country.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and help reduce a portion of the tedious regulatory burden on small businesses.                              {time}  1545  Mr.Mr.Speaker, in closing, I just want to say that the bill passed unanimously in the last It is bipartisan. It gives small ISP providers a certain amount of time and it allows the FCC to decide if it is overburdensome or not, to require them to disclose information to their customers. This allows us to give customers the amount of protection that is due them as well.  So it is a good compromise. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.  I thank my colleagues for their hard work.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH268.txt,186,CALIFORNIA WATER INFRASTRUCTURE,2017.0,10.0,March

14240,topic-id,1263,"Mr.President, for the last several weeks, we have been doing all we can to take up and consider the President's nominations for his Cabinet, even though we have had little or no cooperation from the other side of the aisle.  Last night, we confirmed the President's top economic adviser--something you would think people would think was pretty important--the Secretary of the Treasury, and we did confirm the President's Secretary of Veterans Ironically, the vote for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs was 100 to 0. So maybe somebody can explain to me what was the necessity of delaying the confirmation of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for 3 weeks, leaving that important agency without a designated and Senate-confirmed head?  Earlier today, we considered the nomination of Linda McMahon to serve as the next head of the Small Business Administration, to help our country's job creators reach their potential. Again, we had an overwhelming vote for Linda McMahon for the So, again, my question is, What purpose is served by delaying, by foot-dragging, and by obstructing the President's choice of his Cabinet members?  We are glad we finally confirmed them, but to be honest, it is not much to celebrate. By carrying out this unprecedented obstruction of qualified nominees, our friends across the aisle are simply precluding the Senate from considering other acts of legislation that would actually be helpful to the American people. From my vantage point, it is pretty clear. While they are headed down this self-destructive path, our friends continue to listen and, sadly, cater to radical elements of their own party that simply haven't gotten over the election and have decided to obstruct the President and his agenda at all cost.  But we know for a fact, from our private conversations, that our Democrat friends are not--well, they are fractured. Some of them remembered what happened in 2014, when, under the leadership of then-Majority Leader Reid, essentially everybody was frozen out of offering legislation or amendments to legislation on the floor, including Members of the majority party--then, Democrats, at the time. That strategy really backfired, resulting in a huge Republican class of outstanding Senators in 2014.  People don't like that across the country. They think we are sent here to solve problems, and we work together and make progress on behalf of the American people. This sort of mindless obstruction or foot-dragging for foot-dragging's sake doesn't make any sense to them, and it doesn't make any sense to me either.  Now, I realize the minority leader--the Democratic leader--probably has the toughest job in Washington, DC--to try to keep the far left fringes of his party happy, while trying to do the work of the American people who sent us here to legislate. I do know that there are Members of the Democratic caucus who are very interested in trying to demonstrate their effectiveness by working on bipartisan legislation. Some of them happen to be running for election in 2018 in States carried by President You would think they would be incentivized to tell the leadership of their own party--or the far left of their party, which wants to do nothing but resist the Trump agenda and our bipartisan agenda in the Senate--to stand down or that they are not going to participate in that sort of mindless obstruction, because I think their enlightened self-interest tells them that not only is this what the American people sent us to do--to be productive on a bipartisan basis--but it is also in their electoral self-interest, as well.  As long as the Democratic leader caters to the fringe of his own party and resists any sort of cooperation, I think they can expect the same sort of results after Senator Reid led his party down that path in 2014. We are now headed into the fourth week of the new administration, and we have only confirmed a handful of this President's Cabinet picks. That is bad news not just for us but for the American people, as well.  Surely, after the election of November 8, when President Obama said he wanted to make sure he participated in a peaceful transition of power to the next administration, he was appealing to the better angels of all of those who perhaps were disappointed by the outcome of the election. But that is what[[Page S1150]]we do as We pull together in the best interest of the entire country. We get together and we fight, perhaps, and we take opposing parties in elections. But once the election is over, after the ballots are counted, we work together in the best interest of the American people.  But that is not happening, and that is really not just bad for the That is bad for the country. Our job in the Senate is to consider these nominees and to move on them so that the President of the United States can be surrounded by the people he has chosen to help him lead the country. I will tell you that I have been incredibly impressed by the quality of people he has selected. So as we begin to consider the remaining nominees put forward by President Trump, I hope our friends on the other side will start to realize the ramifications of their quest to stop the Senate or to drag out these deliberations and preclude us from doing other constructive work.  One thing I can promise you is that, thanks to the efforts of Senator Reid in the last Congress, all of these nominees will be confirmed. Our colleagues face the same choice they have had all along. They can either work with us to help get these advisers vetted and then confirmed, or they can make it painful for all of us for no good reason and reveal to the country just how ineffective they truly are when it comes to trying to obstruct this confirmation process.  My hope is that they will decide to course-correct and determine for the good of the entire country that the right thing to do is to move forward on these nominees.

14246,topic-id,653,"Mr.President, today I wish to urge support for H.40. The Second Amendment to our U.Constitution reads, ``A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' The fact that our Nation's Founding Father's penned this constitutional right to follow another central freedom--the constitutional right to free speech--speaks to the importance of this basic right.  H.40, the resolution currently under consideration, would protect Social Security beneficiaries from having their constitutional rights arbitrarily revoked by the Social Security As a cosponsor of the Senate companion resolution introduced by Senator Grassley, I support this critically important effort. The resolution would halt a rule issued by the Social Security Administration in the waning days of the outgoing Obama administration.  The previous administration, I might add, continuously sought to take away the Second Amendment rights of Americans through Executive orders and rulemaking. This is yet another example of an unjust leftover of that effort that needs to be corrected. In December 2016, under the direction of the Executive branch, the Social Security Administration issued a final rule to gather and submit information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS, on individuals who are determined to be what NICS refers to as ``mentally deficient.'' In this case, a person can be reported to NICS simply for using a representative payee in managing their benefits.  It is not uncommon for the Social Security Administration to appoint someone to act as representative payee for a beneficiary who may need assistance to manage their benefits. The use of a representative payee is not indicative of mental deficiency. In fact, over 8 million beneficiaries need help managing their benefits, according to the Social Security Statute requires that, for an individual to be deemed ``mentally deficient,'' a court, board, or other lawful authority must find that the person is a danger to themselves or others or is unable to contract or manage their own affairs.  Under the rule that went into effect last week, SSA will be required to report individuals who have been appointed a representative payee to The Social Security Administration is not a court of law, and SSA officers are not a ``lawful authority.'' Equally alarming is the lack of an established appeals process to enable the removal of names from the system once entered. The Administration's lack of regard for due process is unacceptable.  We must reject the Obama administration's improper assumption that individuals are a danger to themselves or society because they participate in SSA's representative payee system. A January 2016 White House fact sheet estimated that SSA's rule would add 75,000 beneficiaries to the NICS list each year. The number of law-abiding individuals who will be added to the NICS list will likely be much higher. Thousands, if not millions, of Americans stand to lose their Second Amendment rights.  Over 91,000 comments were submitted to the Social Security Administration following the publication of the proposed NICS rule. I, along with several of my colleagues, wrote the Social Security Administration on four occasions to express our concerns about the proposed rule. Our concerns, and the concerns of 91,000 Americans, were clearly not factored into the rulemaking process.  Old age does not make someone a threat to society, and having a representative payee is not grounds to revoke constitutional rights. Millions of seniors are at risk of having their Second Amendment rights arbitrarily revoked on behalf of an Executive that is no longer in office. This is a brazen attack on our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Please join me in stopping this outrageous rule that was finalized in the waning weeks of a lameduck administration. Join me in protecting the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Lankford). Who yields time?  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.

14230,topic-id,908,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize an extraordinary public servant and a dedicated leader of the U.intelligence community, Francis Xavier Taylor, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, I&A, at the Department of Homeland  I had the pleasure of presiding as chairman of the Intelligence Committee for the confirmation hearing for General Taylor in 2014 and have witnessed his leadership over the past 2 and a half years as I&A has made perhaps the most impressive progress of any intelligence agency over this time.  After nearly 40 years of honorable service to our Nation, Under Secretary Taylor retired on the last day of the Obama administration.  Prior to his work at DHS, Frank Taylor served for 31 years in the U.Air Force and at the U.Department of State as an ambassador for counterterrorism and head of diplomatic security. He also served as vice president of security at General For the past 2 years, he has applied the leadership skills, understanding of security at home and abroad, and his close personal friendship with Secretary Jeh Johnson to transform the Office of Intelligence and  I&A's mission is to equip the Homeland Security Enterprise with timely intelligence and information it needs to keep the homeland safe, secure, and resilient. It provides critical intelligence to the leadership of the DHS and its components; State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and private sector partners. The office itself was formed after the creation of DHS through the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and has seen significant change and disruption in its short lifetime. Due to Under Secretary Taylor's leadership, I&A is much further along on its vision of becoming a premier element of the IC, driving information sharing and delivering unique predictive intelligence and analysis to operators and decisionmakers at all levels.  During his confirmation hearing, General Taylor was asked why I&A needed to exist, given the domestic mission of the FBI and the analytic work of the National Counterterrorism He was asked to justify the office's existence if it produced one analytic product per employee per year. Members questioned him on the need for State and local fusion centers and the support provided to them by the Federal I focused my questions on why an intelligence agency should have more than 60 percent of its staffing come from a contractor workforce.  As we begin 2017, those questions are no longer applicable. Under Secretary Taylor has transformed the organization. He removed internal I&A stovepipes and realigned the organization to more closely reflect the intelligence cycle. Where homeland intelligence analysis had too often relied on repackaging products from other members of the IC, DHS collection now forms the basis of I&A production. Under Secretary Taylor also ordered that finished intelligence include DHS and State-local-tribal Partner data. Within 1 year, the organization achieved great success on this front, ensuring 80 percent of finished intelligence in fiscal year 2016 included unique homeland-derived data. Under his leadership, I&A is fulfilling the unique homeland-focused role that Congress intended. The contract workforce is below 25 percent and the office is producing valuable intelligence analysis, tips to law enforcement, compiling and improving the quality of DHS data for intelligence purposes, strengthening our watch listing capability, and lending expertise to decision makers from the President down to the cop on the beat.  Under Secretary Taylor has worked tirelessly to mature and strengthen the Department's relationship with the State and local fusion centers and make information sharing a priority, changing the way the IC analyzes the domestic threat picture. When I have visited my local fusion center in San[[Page S590]]Francisco, I receive nothing but praise for the support that I&A provides and the importance of local, State, and Federal information sharing. The most recent example of this partnership is the Field Analysis Report, FAR, an intelligence report written by State and local intelligence analysts in coordination with I&A for the State and local audience. This is an important development from intelligence handed down from intelligence agencies inside the Federal beltway that, at times, misses the mark of what the local customer needs. FARs are among the most highly rated finished intelligence products coming out of I&A and are a direct result of General Taylor's vision.  Under Secretary Taylor also took to heart the need to invest in the workforce and address extremely low employee morale. He has restructured the workforce, drastically reducing the ratio of supervisors to workers, streamlining management and developing what he calls ``seed corn''--young, junior intelligence professionals brought in to rejuvenate the organization and help develop a truly homeland-focused workforce. Besides shifting the balance of the staff, Under Secretary Taylor focused on hiring, growing, and investing in the workforce and ensuring that inherently governmental work is done by governmental employees and clear communication between the workforce and the leadership.  Members of the Intelligence Committee spend most of our time on international events and the often controversial practices of the CIA, NSA, and We have had the luxury in the recent past not to have to worry on the intelligence coming from and provided to our homeland security professionals because of the leadership and uncommon skill of Under Secretary Frank We owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude.

They provide an extraordinary service to our community. Most notably, the trail systems provide an alternative means of transportation, physically linking our community in creative ways along creek beds and underpasses, through open plains and wooded areas, and beside the wooden fences between residential neighborhoods. These trails also link us in a more profound way. They link us to the values of healthy exercise, neighborliness, and the beauty of nature--even in the setting of the urban city environment.  Now, Mr.Speaker, I received an unusual media request recently. New York Magazine wished to speak to me. I took the meeting because I wanted to give a broader perspective on the issue of environmental stewardship, particularly in light of policy debates about energy and the environment. Since this topic can be so toxic, I thought it was important to reframe the issues with some prairie perspective, if you will. Perhaps, Mr.Speaker, it is time to spike the football and focus on solutions and activities that all of us can agree on and that all of us see are beneficial.  Mr.Speaker, for the 21st century, we must harmonize environmental and economic security.

This ZEEC concept would reward reduced emissions through a tax credit[[Page H1284]]system. In this way, the government is not picking one technology over another or fighting over one regulation versus another, but positively valuing the diminishing externality cost of polluting emissions.  Mr.Speaker, environmental initiatives can also take many other forms. I am very proud to be recently named the co-chair of the International Conservation Caucus, called the It is one of the largest bipartisan caucuses in the  The ICC works to ensure the sustainability of both persons and wildlife, works to promote market innovation, as well as proper stewardship of our precious natural resources.  As an example, not long ago, in the African country of Mozambique, in the midst of a civil war, the Gorongosa National Park was completely stripped of wildlife and devoid of people. A once lush microecosystem is dead, primarily due to political disagreement.  Interestingly, fascinatingly, extraordinarily, a mere 10 years later, thanks to the work of a major philanthropist and a receptive government, a park system now teams with wildlife, with indigenous people reintegrated back into their homeland, who are engaged in now good and sustainable farming methodologies, engaged in park management, as well as conservation, all creating an atmosphere in which the entire ecosystem once again thrives.  Mr.Speaker, I don't know anyone in this body or anywhere else who wants dirty air or dirty water. However, as another example, if you live in Beijing, polluted air alone costs you 5\1/2\ years off your life. Parts of India are perhaps worse.  By the way, the Chinese Government was infuriated with the United States because we created at our embassy a pollution monitoring device, and then publicly released that data to Chinese society. It had a major effect. As one Chinese person once whispered to me: What is the point of all this economic development if it kills you?  Economic development without a soul strips us of the capacity to fully prosper. On the other hand, one of the prime contributors to environmental desecration is economic underdevelopment. Persons who have diminished economic options will use the resources at hand, sometimes merely to survive.  The tragedy of the commons occurs when there are fractured social linkages, a lack of access to technology and information to feed, clothe, and house in a more sustainable way.  Mr.Speaker, I believe this: as new technologies emerge, we may see exciting opportunities to build our own sustainably sourced microenergy economy, one that harmonizes with the environment and creates new economic opportunities and linkages.  This doesn't mean we all live on game preserves, but through proper public policy and innovation, we may be on the trail to environmental, economic, and community security, and perhaps create a new type of Great Plains Energy  Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend, Congressman King, for the various aspects of leadership he has provided, particularly today, on an essential issue: a pro-life issue.

14341,topic-id,4191,"Mr.Speaker, I welcome Mr.Raskin and others who spoke before me as they consumed their Special Order hour in a very unique way, which is not often seen here on the floor, and that is a colloquy between our Republican freshmen and Democratic freshmen.  I want to take up issues that I know were covered by many of the freshmen as they discussed their hopes and dreams about what we might actually be able to accomplish in  Let me start with a photo. This is the largest waterfall in California, and I dare say the largest waterfall in the entire United It is not a natural waterfall. It is actually a manmade waterfall. With all of this turbulence and enormous churning of water below, it is a failure of a manmade spillway in This is the Oroville Dam that has been much in the news over the last several days.  As many probably know, California suffered through a 5-year drought. As a Representative of the great Sacramento Valley of California, my Sacramento Valley and my State of California suffered mightily. That drought tore apart communities, seriously injured the economy of California, and the health of many businesses.  So we went from famine to feast, and we are suffering serious indigestion as a result of the feast of water that we presently have.  Oroville Dam was built in the 1960s and completed in 1968. This is the spillway presumably capable of carrying well over 150,000 cubic feet of water. What you see here is the result of a failure right here in the concrete in that spillway, resulting in a massive hole in the spillway and this extraordinary churning and erosion over here on this side. This went on for some time.  The operators of the dam, the Department of Water Resources in California, said: Well, we are going to have to shut this down and take a look at the problem.  They did. And the problem was, while they were expelling 100,000-acre-feet of water, there was 200,000-acre-feet of water coming into Lake  I am going to take a few moments to explain this and then explain how California has successfully dealt with what could have been a serious tragedy.  Oroville Dam is the highest dam in California, some 770 feet high. The concrete spillway that I just showed you the picture of the largest waterfall in the Nation--not as high as Yosemite Falls, which is over 1,200 feet--is 700 feet down here to the river. It is 770 feet, actually. Right here is where the damage occurred. This is the emergency spillway, which was never to be used.  When this dam was built in the 1960s, they said: Well, we will build the regular spillway, but we will put this emergency spillway in here. This is a 30-foot-high concrete wall. Below it is the natural Earth and dirt of the Sierra Nevada mountains and foothills.  They shut down the spillway and 200,000 cubic feet of water comes into the reservoir. The reservoir rapidly rose to the point of where it was going over the top of the emergency spillway. Lo and behold, when you run 12,000, 15,000 cubic feet of water per second over the top of that spillway, you hit the dirt on this side and it drives down the river with incredible erosion.  This entire area was eroded. But most importantly, the erosion moved back towards the base of that 30-foot-high concrete wall, jeopardizing the integrity of that 30-foot-high barrier against millions upon millions of gallons of water stored in the reservoir.  All of this occurred on Sunday, 3 days ago. The call went out from the Department of Water Resources, Oh, my, we have a potential problem, as they observed the potential erosion against the foundation of that 30-foot-high wall. They said it is possible that that erosion could cause a catastrophic failure of the 30-foot-high wall, sending down into the river channel a 30-foot tsunami, the result of which would be a catastrophe downstream.  This might be a little hard to observe, but I am going to give it a try. Here is the dam right here. Adjacent to the dam is the town of Oroville, just downstream from the dam. Then, the Feather River continues down through my district, Marysville and Yuba This is all farm county up here with some significant towns like Gridley in this area, and Live Oak further down, which I represent. This area is represented by my colleague, Doug LaMalfa, who represents the northern San Joaquin  The reservoir is here. The spillway is here. There is a 30-foot wall of water cascading down the emergency spillway, hitting the river and spreading out 30 miles across the Sacramento Valley, all the way to the west side of the valley where the Sacramento River is. This red area is 100 feet deep in 1 hour. The city of Oroville faces a catastrophic event: 100 feet of water above the community within 1 hour of the breaking of that 30-foot wall on the emergency spillway.  It spreads out. Over here it is still 10 feet deep, 30 miles away. Of course, the water is going to flow down the river also. Two communities down here of 150,000 people, within 7 hours, would be facing water that would be 10 feet deep.  That is why they called for an emergency evacuation Sunday afternoon around 6 o'clock. Nearly 200,000 people left this area, all the way over to the west and all the way down some 30 miles down river, moving out to high ground up north to Chico, up into the Sierra foothills, and down towards  The water continued to spill over the emergency spillway. The Department of Water Resources, seeing the erosion, reopened the gates on the main spillway and sent 100,000 cubic feet of water down the spillway, creating an incredible but not lovely waterfall.  Fortunately, the water flowing into the reservoir very quickly diminished, from a couple hundred thousand acre-feet on Saturday and early Sunday to around 40,000 acre-feet toward Sunday evening and on into So the mathematics began to work in favor of the communities and in favor of the entire region.  Slowly, the level of the lake began to recede and eventually the water no longer flowed over the top of that emergency spillway. Nonetheless, you still had 30 feet of water behind that spillway and you had the integrity of the spillway in question.  They continued to reduce the water level in the lake and, marshalling resources up here, began to find a solution to the problem. When the sun came up Monday morning, the engineers went out and said: Oh, my.  There were four specific areas of serious erosion against the base and the foundation of that 30-foot wall with 30 feet of water still behind it. They decided to take emergency action to bring in by helicopter 100,000-pound bags of rock to stack in those four eroded areas.  Downstream, the communities of Marysville, Yuba City, Gridley, Live Oak, and other small communities were literally ghost towns. People were sheltering in various churches, fairgrounds to the north, fairgrounds to the west, east, and south. Nearly 200,000 people had moved out.  As this water receded and the emergency response began to take hold, people looked at this situation and said: Maybe this was the great would have, could have, and should have--would have, could have, should have.  Maybe when the dam was built, a concrete apron should have been built on the downside of that emergency spillway.  Maybe in 2005, when this entire project went back for re-licensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the call by the environmental community to concrete the down slope should have been taken into account and should have been done in 2006, 2007, but they decided it wasn't necessary or it was too expensive or whatever reasons, and so it was not done.  It will be done now. The cost of repair to the main spillway and to the emergency spillway will probably be over $200 million.  So the question arises for all of us: Do we want to wait until there is a disaster to take cautionary steps to put it back together, or do we want to get ahead of these potential disasters?  It is a question for all of us here. It is a question for the Congress and the[[Page H1169]]Senate and the It is called infrastructure.  You heard some of our colleagues earlier on from the freshman class talk about their desire for infrastructure improvements. Here is a prime example. Unfortunately, not the only example, but I want to share with you what actually is happening down river by the communities of Marysville and Sutter  There are 70 miles of river downstream from this point that has been in the process of significant levee improvement. Some $700 million has been spent over the last 5 to 6 years by the community, by the State of California, and by the Federal Government to bring the levee on the west side of the Feather River to a 200-year status. It is nearly completed, but not completely completed. There is another piece to be done even as this flood event takes place.  But a community stepped forward. It is called The Sutter Butte Flood Control Agency has undertaken that work--good for them--in the city of Marysville, which is a community surrounded on all sides by 20-, 30-foot-high levees. The Feather River and the Yuba River come together at that point at Marysville, a community that has seen catastrophic flooding in the past.                              {time}  1800  That community, too, together with the State of California and the Federal Government, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Yuba County Water Agency have been in the process of rebuilding and enhancing the levees around that community. These are positive examples.  Further down, the State of California has put together a flood control program for the entire Central Valley, from Shasta on the north all the way to the Tehachapi Mountains on the south, an extraordinary 600-, almost 700-mile stretch of the most fertile land in the world and major communities like Sacramento, with millions of people at risk of flooding. Different communities putting together their own flood control programs, reaching out to the Federal Government over the years, providing Federal assistance together with the State assistance to control the flooding that has been historic in  We need to continue this. We are not nearly finished yet in We are going to spend the $200 million here, and this will be concrete in the years ahead, and this main flood control system will be rebuilt.  But this problem is not just floods. We have seen the flood of Katrina in Mississippi where we discovered that, oh, my, the levees really could not handle a major hurricane. I will share a story of my own. When I was deputy secretary at the Department of the Interior, we were studying major storms, what would happen in a period of climate change, would we see stronger hurricanes. This was in the mid-1990s when I was there as number two in the Department of the We anticipated a major hurricane coming across from Cuba into the Gulf area and hitting New We were so concerned about this that Secretary Babbitt said: John, I want you to go down to New I want you to talk to the local officials down there.  I remember sitting in the editorial office of the newspaper, The Times-Picayune, sitting there telling them, showing them the map and saying: Here is what we believe could happen, and we, the Federal Government, together with the community, need to enhance your levees.  A decade or so later, I was sitting in I looked at the television set, and I said: Oh, my God, it is precisely what we predicted in the mid-1990s, and it came to pass. These are the lessons of history.  Here is another lesson of history. This is the Interstate 5 Bridge, the last bridge before you get from the United States to Interstate 5 goes from the Mexican border all the way through California, through Oregon, Washington, and then into Vancouver, British This is a bridge that collapsed.  How many other bridges have we seen collapse? We have seen the bridge collapse in Minnesota, and people died. We have seen rail bridges collapse. In California this last week, the main Union Pacific Railroad going north and south between Sacramento--well, all of northern California--way down to southern California over the Tehachapis, the Union Pacific Railroad Bridge just south of Sacramento collapsed. The rail cars, at least a day ago, were still sitting there in the water as they were busily trying to repair that rail bridge. A good third of all the bridges in the United States do not meet safety standards and are subject to collapse, and in some cases deadly collapse.  As we go through all of this, we need to be aware of the extraordinary need that our Nation has for infrastructure improvements. I think some of us remember the comments of our former Vice President Biden when he landed in LaGuardia, New York, and made a comment about that facility. I won't repeat it here because I am sure my New York friends might find that to be somewhat degrading. But it was a comment that was well deserved about the quality of that airport. The unfortunate part is that that is repeated in airport after airport around the United States: inadequate, old, not up to standards, and very poor in providing the efficient transportation that we require.  We can go on and on. We can talk about the highway system. The Department of Transportation estimates that we need over $836 billion just to maintain and bring up to standards the American highway system, both highways and bridges.  The public transportation system has a $90 billion backlog for public transit for the state of good repair. This isn't expansion. This is just to have good repair for what we need in our transit systems.  We can go on and on. Bridges, $20 billion. As I said, one in three of the bridges in the Nation--it is actually one in four--are structurally deficient and functionally obsolete. Sixty-five percent of our Nation's roads are in less than good condition. Our rail and bus transit systems face a $90 billion backlog, as I just said.  The 59 busiest ports in the United States only operate at 35 percent of capacity because the channels are filled with silt, and modern ships are unable to enter those ports.  The FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration, has identified a need for $32 billion for improvement of our airports. It goes on and on and on.  America does not want to face this kind of devastation, with the failure of dams. I don't have the exact number of dams in the United States--I think there are some 83,000--but a good percentage of those dams are structurally deficient from many different ways. Obviously, Oroville Dam was one of them. It didn't have a sufficient spillway to handle the extraordinary flows of the river.  Another one central to California's water system is the San Luis Reservoir, a 2-million-acre-foot reservoir south of Sacramento, east of San Jose, that is central to the water supply of California, both for southern California, for the San Joaquin Valley, the farmers there, as well as for Los The Oroville Dam is the key dam for the California water system, which supplies water to Silicon Valley, to the San Joaquin Valley, as well as to Los  We have work to do all across this Nation, and we can do it. There is a lot of talk going on about the infrastructure program. Our new President has suggested a trillion dollar infrastructure program, somehow financed with private investment. Now, I don't know how that would work in repairing a dam such as Oroville or San I am not sure how a private investor would fit into that, but undoubtedly there are models in which there can be public-private partnerships. But that will not suffice.  There are programs that have been suggested by my colleague here in the House, by Mr.Mr.DeFazio has what he calls ``a penny for progress.'' It is a program that would provide nearly a trillion dollars of infrastructure investment for highways over a 10-year period. We would borrow the money, and then pay it off with a one-penny increase in the excise tax for gasoline and fuel as it would keep pace with inflation. A novel idea, one that probably would work if we could find the votes for it.  Over on the Senate side, the Senate minority leader, Mr.Schumer, has introduced a $1 trillion package of all[[Page H1170]]types of investment in infrastructure, and it is a project that deserves our attention. It is a project that would provide significant money for highways. In his proposal, he would create 15 million jobs over the next 10 years for investment in many different kinds of infrastructure.  He has something that I have talked about here on the floor now for 7 years. We call it Make It In America, Buy America, use our tax money to buy American-made products, bring our manufacturing back. If you are going to use rebar to rebuild that spillway, then use American steel. If you are going to put a pump in this dam to drain some facility, buy an American pump. After all, it is our taxpayers' money. It is my money. It is your money. Use the Buy America principle.  He has a couple of other principles that I think are very important. He wants protections for American workers, and this is both life and health and safety protections but also wage protection, the Davis-Bacon and the prevailing wage programs, all of which I think pull up the bottom with good working wages for men and women in the construction industry. Also, make sure that there is an opportunity for minority- and women-owned businesses, and of course the environmental protection. These are kind of the principles of his program, which I happen to think are appropriate.  So what would he spend the money on? He would suggest that we spend $210 billion repairing the roads and bridges. Now, remember, that is about one-quarter of what the Department of Transportation said is needed for the backlog, but, nonetheless, that is a good start. For roads and bridges, $210 billion over the 10-year period. That is 1.3 million new jobs.  He would also want to spend $110 billion for new water and sewer systems. Not bad when you talk about places like Flint, Michigan, and the contaminated water in their water supply. In our own Central Valley of California, we have numerous communities that have inadequate water and, in many cases, water that is contaminated with various chemicals, both natural and from the business environment.  Senator Schumer suggests that we spend $180 billion to expand and replace our rail and bus systems. That is more than just the transit programs. I suppose that is to make sure that the Union Pacific bridges don't collapse.  He would also have $200 billion for vital infrastructure projects. These would be the most critical, the high-priority projects across the I would suggest to the Senator, Mr.Speaker, that the Senator might consider rebuilding the spillways on the Oroville  He would also invest $75 billion on American schools so that our schools are new and modern and meet the needs of our students, another $70 billion on the ports. Remember, I was talking about this earlier, about the ports that are inadequate. This feeds back to what Mr.DeFazio has suggested, that we have the harbor maintenance fund. These are fees that are collected on every good that arrives or every container that arrives at our ports, and that money be spent on the ports, both in the water as well as on the dock.  That money, unfortunately, is not spent just there. It winds up in the Treasury for who knows what purpose. So we would bring that money back to spend on our ports, modernizing them. Keep in mind that Panama, the new Panama Canal, has been expanded, bigger ships, deeper draft, so we need to dredge these ports, we need to build the wharves, the docks that can handle them.  Senator Schumer would also recommend that $100 billion be spent in energy infrastructure to meet the needs of a modern energy system that is not dependent upon coal and oil but, rather, renewable sources of all kinds. And broadband, which is exceedingly important. In my district, which stretches 200 miles up the Sacramento Valley, broadband is not available. So these are infrastructure investments that I would think all of us should agree on, that we need to build a modern infrastructure for a modern economy and a growing economy, and along the way create as many as 13 million jobs to do that, a project that would go forward over the 10-year period ahead of us.  So we have got the President suggesting a trillion dollar program, public-private partnerships, of which I suspect there are some right there, we have got Mr.DeFazio with a financing program for highways and transit systems and ports, and we have Senator Schumer on the other side with a trillion dollar program that would deal with virtually every part of the infrastructure, from broadband communications to ports, highways, bridges, and the like.  So we have, I think, an opportunity here in this Congress to address a critical need for America's future, not only for the safety of Americans so that all Americans can avoid the kind of catastrophe that California came very, very close to having on Sunday, with the collapse of a 30-foot dam on Lake Oroville, creating not this, but something that would be several times bigger than this cascading down the river and inundating communities to the depth of 100 feet or more.  It doesn't have to happen. We should never be penny-wise and pound-foolish. We should never delay these infrastructure investments because we know that bridges will collapse, and along with it the transportation system.                              {time}  1815  We know that dams are in jeopardy. We know that our highways are filled with potholes. We know that many of our airports are ancient and, in many cases, decrepit and certainly not up to modern safety standards and certainly passenger convenience. We know that our ports need to be dredged and new wharfs and docks built. We know that we need to have intermodal systems so that we can efficiently move cargo from the ports to the trucks, to the trains, and across the country.  We know the needs. The question for all of us is: Are we ready to meet those needs?  I would suggest to you that we can. We can do creative financing, as Mr.DeFazio has suggested. There is a role for public-private partnerships in all of this, as the President has suggested. There is also a place in all of this for us to make choices about how we spend the taxpayers' money.  This is one that I want to bring to the attention of We are in the process of making a choice to spend $1 trillion over the next 20 years or so to rebuild our entire nuclear arsenal. All of it. All of our nuclear bombs, all of the ICBMs in the silos in the upper Midwest, new submarines with new intercontinental missiles with new bombs on top of those missiles, new stealth bombers such as the new B-21, new cruise missiles with new bombs. All of these things. New, fast, stealthy, unobservable, extraordinarily dangerous because the rules of the old Cold War or the old nuclear standoff don't apply.  One trillion dollars for what purpose?  We need to ask that question and we need to make choices. There are many other choices that we will be making here. Choices about building a $30 billion wall rather than repairing the bridges, in this case to Choices about nuclear weapons.  Our job--your representatives here in Congress--is to make choices that are wise, choices that protect you, choices that give all of us an opportunity to have good, well-paying jobs, a modern infrastructure on which the private sector can then grow and prosper, and men and women can earn a good middle class living.  Or we can make choices on things that really do not provide any of those benefits. It is about choices. It is about being prepared for tomorrow. It is about avoiding collapsed bridges and reservoirs that might fail and send a cascade of water down upon the communities.  So I ask my colleagues to consider, to ponder the needs of your communities, and to make choices that are wise, that look to the future, and build a solid foundation that won't fail when that 30 feet of water presses up against that foundation. I hope and I pray we make wise choices.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1167-2.txt,1973,SMALL BUSINESS BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT ACT,2017.0,14.0,February
14424,topic-id,787,"Mr.Speaker, I greatly appreciate my friend, colleague--actually, dear friend--Steve King, and his points he is making--right on track.  I hesitated for a number of days now about making public reference to this, but it needs to be addressed and it needs to be looked at, and people need to be aware so that mistakes do not continue to be made. This is a story from John Stanton, February 2, 2017, BuzzFeed: ``Congressional IT Staff Under Investigation In Alleged Procurement Scam.''  And this is February 2, so several days ago--5 days ago. It says: ``A lawmaker briefed on the matter had said House officials had told staff from affected offices that contractors had been arrested, but late Thursday night US Capitol Police spokesperson Eva Malecki told BuzzFeed News that no arrest had been made. The USCP is investigating House IT support staff.''  Now, that is the technologically proficient staff members that work on congressional computers, that work on our technology, so it was quite disturbing to see this some days back.  This says: ``Five men who had access to the House of Representatives' entire computer network are under investigation Thursday evening following a months-long investigation by federal law enforcement officials, according to a lawmaker briefed on the raid.''  Well, it sure wasn't me because I didn't know anything about this until I read it a few days ago.  ``Although the lawmaker said House officials had told staff from affected offices that contractors had been arrested, late Thursday night, US Capitol Police spokesperson Eva Malecki told BuzzFeed News that no arrest had been made, but that USCP are investigating members of the House IT support staff.  `` `At the request of Members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff,' Malecki said in a statement. `No Members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. It should be noted that, administratively, House staff were asked to update their security settings as a best practice. We have no further comment on the ongoing investigation at this time.'  ``According to the member, the chiefs of staff for 20 lawmakers were summoned to a closed-door meeting with House administration officials, who briefed them on the incidents. The chiefs were told the men were conducting a procurement scam, although officials acknowledged the men--whose staff were told were brothers--had access to virtually all of the computer systems used by the affected lawmakers. Members were also told Thursday night to change the passwords to their email and other applications.  ``The news has rattled nerves on Capitol Hill, especially after the series of high-profile political hackings over the last year. `They said it was some sort of procurement scam, but now I'm concerned that they may have stolen data from us, emails, who knows,' the lawmaker said.''  Then this was added: ``This post has been updated and corrected with new information from US Capitol Police, which said no arrests have been made but there is an active investigation ongoing into IT staff who were involved in alleged procurement scam. A lawmaker briefed on the situation had told BuzzFeed News that arrests were made.''  And then yesterday we had this update from Politico, ``House staffers under criminal investigations still employed,'' by Heather  ``Multiple Democratic lawmakers have yet to cut ties with House staffers under criminal investigation for wide-ranging equipment and data theft.  ``Imran Awan, a longtime House staffer who worked for more than two dozen Democrats since 2004, is still employed by Debbie Wasserman[[Page H1073]]Schultz, though his access to the House IT network has been blocked since last week.  `` `At this time we are continuing to gather information from House officials and will determine the best approach to move forward once we have reviewed that information,' David Damron, communications director for Wasserman Schultz, said in an email when asked by POLITICO if Awan was still working for the Florida Democrat.''                              {time}  1930  Mr.Speaker, I might insert parenthetically that although you can't judge much from a name, one can't help but wonder, because of all of the outcry about the Russians, if maybe these brothers--well, I started to ask--have some Russian connection, but there doesn't appear to be any.  ``Multiple relatives of Imran Awan, including his wife Hina Alvi, Abid Awan and Jamal Awan--all House staffers until recently--are also being investigated in connection to the alleged procurement scam, according to a senior House official close to the investigation.  ``Alvi has worked for more than a dozen House Democrats and the House Democratic Caucus since 2007.

Just to continue on, Ken Klukowski has a terrific article, ``Travesty of Legal Errors in Immigration EO Lawsuit.'' It is a great article pointing out problems with Judge Robart's decision.  Then, this article from Hans von Spakovsky on February 6 from Daily Signal, he points out:  ``This fact is obvious from an examination of his seven-page order, which contains absolutely no discussion whatsoever of what law or constitutional provision the president has supposedly violated. That temporary restraining order is now on an emergency appeal before a panel of the 9th U.Circuit Court of Appeals.''  It contrasts a 21-page opinion issued by Massachusetts District Court Judge Nathaniel ``Unlike Robart, who totally ignored the federal statute, 8 U.S.1182(f), cited by Trump in his executive order, Gorton bases his decision denying the temporary restraining[[Page H1075]]order on an examination of the extensive power given to the president under that statute. . . . ''  The article goes on: ``That is exactly what the president has done.''  Whether you agree or disagree, he had the power to do it.  The order signed on January 27 on Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States suspends for only 90 days, unlike the 180 days President Obama did for Iran, the issuance of visas to anyone--not Muslims--just to anyone from those countries of concern as classified by the Obama administration.  And then Gorton goes on to make further notes, saying ``the decision to prevent aliens from entering the country is a `fundamental sovereign attribute' realized through the legislative and executive branches that is `largely immune from judicial control.' ''  And then it goes on in this article to quote the Supreme  ``Robart's opinion ends with a claim that seems like a joke.  ``He says that `fundamental' to his work is `a vigilant recognition that--the court--is but one of three equal branches of our federal government. The work of the court is not to create policy or judge the wisdom of any particular policy promoted by the other two branches.  ``Instead, says Robart, his job is `limited' to `ensuring that the actions taken by the other two branches comport with our country's law, and more importantly, our Constitution.'

14247,topic-id,688,"Mr.President, we have a very bad regulation that has been put out by the Social Security Administration that needs to be obliterated, so we are using a process called the Congressional Review Act to show Congress's displeasure with the Social Security Administration and to get this regulation off the books.  Now, there has been a lot of talk about how the Congressional Review Act is the wrong vehicle to repeal the disastrous regulation. So I want to quote a contrary opinion from the National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery saying this:       The CRA--  Meaning the Congressional Review Act--     is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory overreach,      and NCMHR urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In this      particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of      people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their      basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCMHR feels that      utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only      warranted, but necessary.  I would add to it that it is obviously necessary.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            National Coalition for                                       Mental Health Recovery,                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:      I write on behalf of the National Coalition for Mental Health      Recovery (NCMHR) regarding the final rule the Social Security      Administration (SSA) released on December 19th, 2016,      implementing provisions of the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of      2007, 81 FR 91702.       In accordance with our mandate to advise the President,      Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,      programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with      disabilities, NCMHR submitted comments to SSA on the proposed      rule. In our comments, we cautioned against implementation of      the proposed rule because there is no causal connection      between the inability to manage money and the ability to      safely and responsibly own, possess or use a firearm. This      arbitrary linkage not only unnecessarily and unreasonably      deprives individuals with disabilities of a constitutional      right, it increases the stigma for those who, due to their      disabilities, may need a representative payee.       Despite our objections and that of many other individuals      and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed      rule, the final rule released in late December was largely      unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional      right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule      legitimizes, NCMHR recommends that Congress consider      utilizing the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this      rule.       NCMHR is a nonpartisan, is nonpartisan nonprofit with no      stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control      other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun      possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual      disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to      whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to      themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.      Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction      on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only      after the individual has been afforded due process and given      an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not      able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her      disability. NCMHR believes that SSA's final rule falls far      short of meeting these criteria.       The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory      overreach, and NCMHR urges its use advisedly and cautiously.      In this particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the[[Page S1154]]     essential mission of an agency that millions of people with      and without disabilities rely upon to meet their basic needs.      Therefore, in this instance, NCMHR feels that utilizing the      CRA to repeal the final rule is not only warranted, but      necessary.           Sincerely,                                        Daniel Fisher, MD, PhD,                                                      Chair  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1149-2.txt,457,1230,2017.0,14.0,February
14248,topic-id,1539,"Mr.President, there has also been talk about how supposedly dangerous it will be if this Social Security regulation is terminated. I don't see how that can possibly be realistic if the Social Security Administration doesn't even determine whether a person is dangerous in the first place--and ``dangerous'' meaning in regard to whether or not they ought to be able to make use of the constitutional right of the Second Amendment to own and possess firearms.  Others in this debate continue to mention that mentally ill people will be able to acquire firearms. Now this is very important. The Social Security Administration does not determine a person to be mentally ill prior to reporting their names to the gun ban list, and being on the list denies you your constitutional rights. The agency has confirmed this in writing to my office:       Yes, you are correct. The Social Security Administration      does not diagnose individuals as mentally ill.  Supporters of this gun ban failed to address why individuals are not provided formal due process before reporting their name to the list. Supporters have also failed to talk about how the regulation is inconsistent with the statutory standard of ``mental defective.''  An existing statute requires agencies to report individuals to the gun ban list who are ineligible under current law for possessing firearms. That requirement does not require the existence of any regulation to be effective. So it is plainly wrong to claim, as was said this very day by the people opposed to what we are doing, that if the regulation is disapproved, agencies will no longer have to report prohibited persons. The reverse, in fact, is true.  The regulation usurps unlawful authority to report people to the gun ban list who are not barred from owning guns under current law and that the agency is prohibited from reporting under current law, especially without the adjudication that is required under current law.  Opponents of the regulation base their opposition on the language of the regulation, existing law, and the Constitution, citing the Constitution to say that you don't have a constitutional right to own arms under the Second Amendment, which is contrary to two recent Supreme Court decisions that verify that that applies to an individual. That is why the regulation's supporters must resort to arguments that lack legal and factual foundation.  Supporters of this gun ban also fail to address how overly broad this regulation is, as written. It will capture innocent Americans, denying innocent Americans their constitutional rights. Sadly, then, we know how this will play out if this regulation were allowed to go forward because we have the example of the Department of Veterans Affairs reporting hundreds of thousands of veterans to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System without adequate due process. That is the same system that Social Security was going to report people to.  Veterans were reported just because some lonely bureaucrat wanted to report them, with no opportunity to first have a neutral authority hold a hearing, finding that that individual is dangerous or actually has a dangerous condition. These were veterans who needed financial help managing their benefit payments.  It is common sense that needing help with your finances should not mean that you have surrendered a fundamental constitutional right of self-defense that you have under the Second  Just like the Social Security Administration, the VA does not determine whether a veteran is dangerous before reporting his name to the gun ban list and denying that veteran his Second Amendment constitutional rights to own and possess firearms. The VA regulation is eerily similar to what the Social Security Administration wants to do.  On May 17, 2016, Senator Durbin and I debated my amendment that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to first find veterans to be a danger before reporting their names to the gun ban list. Now that is common sense; isn't it? You ought to find out if they are really dangerous before they are denied a constitutional right.  During the course of that debate, Senator Durbin admitted that the list was broader than it should have been. He said:       I do not dispute what the Senator from Iowa suggested, that      some of these veterans may be suffering from a mental illness      not serious enough to disqualify them from owning a firearm,      but certainly many of them do.  Senator Durbin also said:       Let me just concede at the outset, reporting 174,000 names      goes too far, but eliminating--  As my legislation proposed to do--     174,000 names goes too far.  For the record, though, it wasn't really 174,000 names going too far. It was actually 260,381 names that the VA sent to the gun ban list. Now that happens to be 98.8 percent of all names that are in the alleged ``mental defective'' category.  The Department of Veterans Affairs reported more names by far than any other agency without sufficient justification. Senator Durbin's staff and mine have met over these issues since that debate, and I appreciate and thank him for that outreach.  Now we have the Social Security Administration problem and, through the Congressional Review Act, we can do something about it. We don't have to pass a separate piece of legislation, like we are going to have to do to straighten out the So the Social Security Administration is about to make the same mistake as the VA unless we stop it right here and right now.  If this regulation is not repealed, the agency has informed my staff that approximately 15,000 to 75,000 beneficiaries of Social Security may be reported annually, denying them their constitutional right to bear, possess, and own firearms. That figure of 15,000 or even more so--the higher figure of 75,000--will add up very quickly.  In my earlier speech today on this topic, I made clear that the agency regulation is defective in many ways; namely, the regulation does not require the agency to find a person dangerous or mentally ill. The regulation provides no formal hearing before a person is reported to the gun ban list.  Supporters have also said that repeal of this regulation will interfere with enforcement of gun prohibition laws. Such a position is without any merit--denying people constitutional due process.  As I made clear in my earlier speech, important Federal gun laws are still on the books, even if the agency rule is repealed. This is so because this new regulation is actually inconsistent with those existing Federal gun laws. For example, individuals who have been determined to be dangerous or mentally ill will be prohibited, as will those convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, and the same for those involuntarily committed to mental institutions.  While discussing the faults and defects of the rule, I think it is important to highlight that the issues I have pointed out are also the solution to the problem. If the supporters of the agency rule want the Social Security Administration to report individuals to the gun ban list, changes need to be made. Individuals must first be determined by a neutral authority after a fair hearing meeting the requirements of the U.If they are dangerous and have a dangerous mental illness, then they could constitutionally be denied that right. Constitutional due process is a very important part of that process.  If we do not act, the agency will erroneously report tens of thousands of people per year to the gun ban list, and not one of them will have been adjudicated to be dangerous after a hearing with due process, not one of them will have been adjudicated to be mentally ill after a hearing with due process, and all of them will have had the government's burden shifted to them to prove they are not dangerous in order to get their name off the gun ban list. It is common sense, isn't it? It ought to be that you are innocent until proven guilty. If you can't have a gun, common sense tells me you ought not have[[Page S1155]]to prove that you can have a gun to the government; the government has to prove that you should not have a gun.  Any way you look at it, the regulatory scheme is patently unfair. If the government wants to regulate firearms, it needs to produce a clearly defined regulation that is very narrowly tailored to identify individuals who are actually dangerous and who actually have a dangerous mental illness. The government must also afford constitutional due process.  What we are dealing with here is a fundamental constitutional right backed up by two Supreme Court decisions in the last 10 years. With that type of constitutional status, the Second Amendment requires greater effort and greater precision from the government in order to fairly regulate how the American people exercise that constitutional right. This regulation simply doesn't meet that standard.  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of disapproval.  Mr.President, I don't know whether anybody else is coming to seek the floor. If I am infringing upon somebody else's time, I will yield the floor, but in the meantime, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1149-2.txt,457,EQUAL PAY DAY,2017.0,14.0,February
14249,topic-id,1017,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss some criticism I have heard about the nominee to fill the seat on the Supreme That nominee is Neil  My colleague, the minority leader, met with the nominee last week. Afterward, he told reporters that he had ``serious, serious concerns'' about the judge. Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised--after all, it seems the minority leader had concerns about the nominee even before the nominee was announced.  Before Judge Gorsuch was announced, the minority leader made clear that any nominee must be ``mainstream.'' But it became clear immediately that this nominee is widely regarded as a mainstream judge with impeccable credentials. Liberal law professor Laurence Tribe says that ``he's a brilliant, terrific guy who would do the Court's work with distinction.'' Alan Dershowitz, who certainly is no conservative, says that Judge Gorsuch will be ``hard to oppose on the merits.'' Even President Obama's Acting Solicitor General, Neal Katyal, said Judge Gorsuch ``would help to restore confidence in the rule of law.'' The chorus goes on.  Apparently, because the nominee is so obviously mainstream, the benchmark for my colleague's concerns keeps changing. The minority leader has conveniently developed a new test. Now he says the benchmark is independence: ``The bar for the Supreme Court nominee to prove that they can be independent, has never, never been higher.''  Well, fortunately for the minority leader, Judge Gorsuch passes that bar with flying colors, just like he passed the ``mainstream'' test with flying colors. The nominee's record makes clear that he is an independent and fairminded judge who is deeply committed to the separation of powers.  Here is just one example from his many opinions on this point. Just last year, Judge Gorsuch had to decide a case about the authority of the Board of Immigration Appeals, or the BIA, which answers to the Attorney The BIA wanted to change the Attorney General's power to waive immigration requirements for illegal immigrants, and it wanted the new rules to apply to undocumented immigrants whose waiver applications were already in the works. The nominee said no to this executive agency. To be clear, Judge Gorsuch was asked to decide whether an executive agency in charge of immigration laws could change the law on a whim in a way that many believed was unfair to immigrants who had already sought waivers. He said no.  With due respect to my friend the minority leader, there is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch would say no to this or any other part of the executive branch that oversteps its bounds.  Here is what the nominee wrote about the separation of powers and executive branch overreach. For him to defer to the executive agency in that case would be ``more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design.'' That is because doing so would allow agency bureaucracy to ``swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power,'' which the Constitution assigns to separate branches of government. So the nominee was concerned about the separation of powers. He was concerned about people whose liberties might be impaired, and because of those concerns, he said no to the immigration agency's policy whim of the day.  Judge Michael McConnell, a former colleague of Judge Gorsuch on the Tenth Circuit, makes the same observation about this case. He says the scope of executive power arguably ``will be the most common Supreme Court issue of the coming decade.'' He says the nominee analyzes that issue in a way that is faithful to the Constitution and to the independence of the judiciary, and he points to the nominee's thinking on this question. Judge Gorsuch wrote:       What would happen . . . if the political majorities who run      the legislative and executive branches could decide cases and      controversies over past facts? They might be tempted to bend      existing laws, to reinterpret them . . . [this would] risk      the possibility that unpopular groups might be singled out      for this sort of mistreatment--and [would] rais[e] along the      way, too, grave due process, fair notice, and equal      protection problems. . . . It was to avoid dangers like      these, dangers the founders had studied and seen realized in      their own time, that they pursued the separation of powers.  That is the writing of an independent judge who believes in the separation of powers.  You know, there is a bit of irony to some of the criticism I have heard leveled against Judge On the one hand, I have heard that he will have to be independent and that he won't rubberstamp the President's agenda. On the other hand, I have heard that he will be way too tough on the executive branch as it fulfills the President's agenda. It is quite obvious that, common sense tells us as we look at those two arguments that we can't have it both ways.  Judge Gorsuch has shown he is faithful to the separation of powers in the That means he will be an independent judge who will say no when the other branches of government overreach.  You don't need to take my word for it. Listen to President Obama's Acting Solicitor General, Neal He is no fan of the President's Executive order, but he says that Judge Gorsuch ``will not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him.'' Instead, the Solicitor General said the nominee ``would help to restore confidence in the rule of law.''  Judge Gorsuch's record and reputation leave no room to doubt that he is a mainstream, independent judge. He will apply the law fairly, and he won't be afraid to say no when the Constitution requires it.  Every time my colleague the minority leader has set out a standard for filling this Supreme Court seat, this judge has met it. He is mainstream. He is independent. And when my colleague chooses a new standard, I bet the nominee will also meet that new standard.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

14301,topic-id,907,"Mr.Speaker, for the last 2 weeks, we have lurched from one fiasco to another, played out on a national and international stage. There were press briefings and Presidential statements filled with official lies. We have witnessed tragedies, late night firings, policy changes, and clarifications, also known as backtracking, and then we have come back for another round of fiascos.  We are told we will not have a National Security Council as we always have had, one with the top minds of the intelligence community and the head of the Joint Chiefs of No, instead, we will have a nationalist security council, with Breitbart's Steve Bannon and his personal experience as a former Navy officer right there in the situation room. I am not feeling safer already.  The President has acted to criminalize immigrants and to make every immigrant an equal priority for deportation. Trump actually buried a requirement in his executive order to count, every week, the number of crimes committed by immigrants and to have the government officially tally every single week the number of Mexican rapists, criminals, and drug dealers--the ones Donald Trump has been talking about since he launched his campaign.  But interestingly, by law, the Federal Government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cannot conduct research into how many people are killed by guns--that is outlawed--and how we can prevent gun violence--that is outlawed. No, the NRA and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Republican Party, has outlawed that. But the new immigrant rape report is ripped from the headlines of Breitbart and other rightwing websites, except that now it is the basis of government policy. We are really getting a lesson in who is and who is not a criminal in this post-``1984'' world of newspeak.  We all know that there are millions of undocumented immigrants from all over the world, but this administration keeps whipping out that Mexican thing. Let's face it, the people thinking up these policies think all Latinos are Mexicans and all Mexicans are immigrants. So if you are an immigrant from Mexico, except for a few good ones, you are a criminal, a rapist, or a murderer.  Millions and millions of people who the President wants to deport are people with traffic violations. They drove without a license in many States because the State in which they live and pay taxes does not issue driver's licenses to them. They are moms and dads who came back after they were deported because that is what moms and dads tend to want to do: to be with their children, watch them grow up, nurture and love them. And Trump's targets include young people and teenagers who are listed on a ``gang registry'' because a local cop thought they dressed or acted like they might be in a gang.  But if you hire maids or nannies and do not pay the proper amount of Social Security and FICA taxes, or if they are undocumented immigrants and you don't pay the taxes, you are not called a criminal. No, you are called a Cabinet In fact, we will put you in charge of the budget, including Social Security, the one you failed to pay.  Or you can run the Department of Commerce, yes. If your business engages in the shady business of foreclosing on grandmas and widows, you get to be the Secretary of the  If you close down the Department of Energy, that is what you want to do, close down the Department of Energy, guess what you get to do. You get to run it.  If you oppose public schools, you get to be Secretary of  And if you have opposed every inch of progress for civil and human rights in this country with every fiber of your being--immigrant rights, gay rights, basic civil rights for people of color, basic protections to make sure that everyone's vote counts equally--well, in that case, guess what you get to do, you get to run the Department of Justice, the agency ultimately charged with making sure everyone gets equal protection under the law.  Up is down, down is up, and it is only his second week.[[Page H824]]  I feel our new President has some learning to do, and a lot of that learning has to do with the three branches of government, like what the executive branch should do when a Federal judge tells them to stop doing something they shouldn't be doing in the first place.  I think the new President has a lot to learn about the freedom of religion, the separation of church and State, and how our refugee policies work. I think the people of Chicago could teach him a lot about the Fourth Amendment and its ban on unreasonable search and seizure and the illegality of holding immigrants in jail without a warrant.  So I am offering to give the President my copy of the Constitution, autographed by Khizr Khan, the father of a U.Army captain killed in Iraq in 2004, who asked a question I don't think any one of us knows the answer to.

In my home State of Massachusetts, it would immediately deny access to care to nearly 10,000 patients covered by MassHealth.For these men, women, and children, it is not as simple as walking to the nearest community health center, because over 50percent of Planned Parenthood centers across our country are found in medically underserved communities.  For the elderly woman in need of cancer screening, there would be nowhere else to turn. For the young expectant mother inneed of prenatal care, there would no longer be a community doctor that she can trust. For the dad whose son is in need of strepthroat treatment, the only option left may be an unaffordable trip to the emergency room.  Mr.Speaker, if this is intended to be a warning shot on a constitutionally guaranteed right to have an abortion, myRepublican colleagues are missing their target and, instead, they are aimed right at poor  I urge every Member of this House to talk to their constituents who have received care at Planned Parenthood centers beforevoting on this bill.

14315,topic-id,2351,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice on the U.Supreme  Confirmation of anyone appointed to the Federal judiciary is a big deal. Confirmation of someone appointed to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States is an exceptionally weighty matter. I therefore approach this with the seriousness it deserves. I approach this as one who has argued in front of Judge I found as a lawyer that he is an exceptional judge, an unusual judge--a judge who comes to argument with an unusual degree of preparation, having read all the briefs and apparently all of the cases and all of the statutes cited in the briefs.  There are some judges who at oral argument are constantly asking questions, but they are not necessarily questions that need to be asked. Perhaps some judges want to hear the sound of their own voices. That is, of course, something that would never happen here, in the U.Senate, but it happens sometimes with other people. There are other judges who might be quiet throughout an argument. Then there is a unique category of judge, a judge who doesn't necessarily speak constantly but a judge who listens attentively and then pounces at the moment when he or she sees the pivotal moment in the case arising.  The late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., used to say there was a point of contact in every case. When asked, he pointed out that the point of contact in any case is the place where the boy got his finger caught in the machinery. I learned that quote when I was in law school. I have never entirely understood what it means, but it reminds me of the fact that in every case, there is a pivotal fact and a pivotal aspect of the law which, when properly understood, can help lead the court to a proper disposition of the legal question at hand.  Judge Gorsuch is one of those rare judges who is able to seize upon the point of contact in any case. He does so with seeming effortlessness. Yet I know he does it in a way that requires a lot of effort because these things don't just come naturally. They come only as a result of faithful study of the law, of faithful attention to detail in every case, reading every brief in every case.  Judge Gorsuch does this in part because he was well trained. When we look at his background, we can see that excellence has always been something we have been able to see from him. He graduated with honors from Harvard Law School and received a doctorate in jurisprudence from He clerked for three brilliant and very well-respected jurists: Judge David Sentelle on the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and Justice Byron White, as well as Justice Anthony Kennedy of the U.Supreme We could not ask for a better legal education or a stronger record of accomplishment from a young lawyer.  After his clerkship, Judge Gorsuch entered into private practice, where he was a trial attorney for 10 years. In 2005, he joined the U.Department of Justice as Principal Deputy Attorney General, and he became a judge on the Tenth Circuit in 2006, where he has served for the last decade.  Judge Gorsuch has what I would consider--and I think what most would acknowledge--is the correct approach to the law. He is a judge's judge, both literally and figuratively--literally, because he sits on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth He literally judges the rulings of other judges. It is his job to decide whether other judges have done the right thing. And he is a judge's judge figuratively in the sense that he has the characteristics that all judges aspire to--or at least should. He decides cases based on what the law says and not on the basis of what a particular judge might wish the law said.  I particularly enjoyed last night listening to Judge Gorsuch speak at the White House, his reference to what he considers an important, telltale sign of a good judge or a bad judge. He said: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.'' So a bad judge is one who necessarily likes all the results he reaches, and it naturally follows that a good judge will, from time to time, necessarily disagree with some of the judge's own rulings. In other words, the outcome of the case doesn't necessarily match up with the outcome the good judge would prefer--or the judge, an all-powerful ruler who had the power not only to interpret the law but also make it, establishing rules, embodying policies that would govern in all cases.  This is the essence of the conservative legal movement--the judicial conservative movement, we might say--in which Justice Scalia was so influential, which is why it is so fitting that Judge Gorsuch has been named to replace Justice  Judges do not have a roving commission specifically to address all of the evils that plague society. They don't have a roving commission to decide big policy questions of the sort we debate in this Chamber every day. The judge's role, rather, is to apply the facts to the case at hand, and, in the case of the Supreme Court, to provide guidance to lower courts so they can resolve difficult and consequential questions of law. Judge Gorsuch understands the difference between being a judge and being a legislator, and that is very much reflected in his work on the bench.  When I had the privilege of practicing law and appearing in front of Judge Gorsuch, I was able to be the beneficiary of his skill as a judge and of his commitment to the rule of law. Over the last few days, I have had the privilege of reading many of his opinions. I spent hours upon hours poring through his opinions. Knowing that he might well be named to the Supreme Court, knowing he was one of the potential nominees made me want to learn more about him than I already knew. I have to say, every single opinion I read, without exception, was impeccable to an unusual degree. They are methodical. They are careful. They are studious. They reflect a degree of academic and professional craftsmanship rarely seen. He treats the parties appearing before him with dignity and respect. He takes their arguments seriously, and he respectfully explains their arguments as he addresses them.  I know from my time in the practice of law that no one likes to lose a case, but I doubt any litigant has read a Judge Gorsuch opinion and felt like he failed to understand their position or that he failed to take their views seriously with the credibility and dignity they deserve. This is a crucial yet, sadly, often underrated factor when reviewing the work of any judge.  Most of all, his opinions are just brilliant. They are digestible to lawyers[[Page S563]]and nonlawyers alike. This is crucial because the judiciary belongs to everyone in this country, not just to attorneys. Judge Gorsuch's opinions are memorably written without being snarky, and he scatters his opinions with literary and philosophical references to highlight the legal points he is making while also just making the opinion much more interesting. As someone who has read more than my fair share of judicial opinions, I can tell you that Judge Gorsuch's opinions are among the very best I have ever read. I don't just mean a few of them, I mean every single one of them that I have read, which is a lot of them. They are very, very good. In fact, they are Supreme Court caliber.  Judge Gorsuch has written hundreds of opinions, but there are two recently decided cases I wish to highlight.  He is a critic of an obscure but very significant legal rule known as the Chevron doctrine. When the Supreme Court decided the Chevron case back in 1984, the Justices may not have thought they were deciding a big case. They might not have realized the extent to which the decision in Chevron v. NRDC--the extent to which that case would have such a profound impact on the Federal judiciary and on the state of the law in the United States of America, but Chevron is in fact one of the most important Supreme Court cases that most of us have never heard of. It says that the courts must defer to an agency interpretation of a statute if the statute is ambiguous.  The problem with Chevron, as Judge Gorsuch has pointed out, is that it tends to divest the courts of their obligation to ``say what the law is,'' as Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in Marbury v. It has led to a system in which executive agencies not only make and enforce the law but also interpret the law, arrogating to themselves, in effect, some aspects of the powers allocated to all three branches of the Federal This is a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers, one of the most important protections in the Constitution, one of the two fundamental structural protections in the Constitution, as important as any other provision in our founding document.  Worse, doctrines that have developed in response to Chevron allow agencies to stake out a legal position, lose in court, and stake out a new legal position that reaches the same outcome. As Judge Gorsuch points out, that creates fair notice and equal protection problems.  Now, there are two additional points to make about First, in the coming days, we will undoubtedly hear some of my colleagues complain that getting rid of Chevron will somehow make the air less clean, our food less safe, our financial system more unstable, and cause a whole lot of other problems, but as Judge Gorsuch has written, ``We managed to live with the administrative state before We could do it again. Put simply, it seems to me that in a world without Chevron, very little would change--except perhaps the most important things.''  Second, it is important to note here that the Chevron doctrine is not a particularly ideological one.  Indeed, in the 1980s, Chevron primarily assisted the Reagan administration's deregulation efforts, and junking the doctrine today would constrain the Trump administration's use of regulations. So eliminating the doctrine would affect equally Republican and Democratic policy goals. In any event, I am sure, based on his background and on his record, Judge Gorsuch's critique of the doctrine is not about politics; it is about first principles. At the end of the day, Chevron is neither Republican nor Democratic; it is neither liberal nor conservative. It is simply wrong.  In another notable case, Judge Gorsuch was the lone dissenter in a case in which an 11-year-old student was arrested for generating fake burps in class. As heinous a crime as some might perceive this to be, it is not ordinarily the kind of thing that results in calling the police. Judge Gorsuch would have concluded that clearly established law prevented the arrest and that the child's parents should prevail in a lawsuit against the school officials who decided to call the police in response to this childish act in class. This is not uncommon for Judge Gorsuch, who has voted not to provide qualified immunity in several cases and has voted in many cases for the underdog, for someone who might otherwise not have had a chance in court but for the willingness of one very brave and astute and diligent judge to study the law and the facts of that case aggressively so as to make sure that justice was accorded to the parties.  There are other important areas of the law where Judge Gorsuch has made an important contribution during his time on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth I will be talking about some of those at length in the days and weeks to come. He has been a staunch advocate for the First He has read criminal statutes to constrain the government's power, where appropriate, and has voted in several cases to withhold qualified immunity. All of these are important, and I look forward to discussing them with my colleagues.  Before I close, I want to talk a bit about the confirmation process. In 2006, Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Tenth Circuit was so uncontroversial that it lasted 26 minutes--just 26 minutes, less time than a ``Brady Bunch'' episode. He was confirmed on a voice vote. Among other notable Members of the Senate the day that Judge Gorsuch was confirmed were Minority Leader Schumer, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee Feinstein, Senator Durbin, and Senator  Already, prominent liberal lawyers are praising his nomination. Neal Katyal, who served as Acting Solicitor General under President Obama, has a New York Times op-ed in which he urges liberals to support Judge Katyal writes:       I, for one, wish it were a Democrat choosing the next      justice. But since that is not to be, one basic criterion      should be paramount: Is the nominee someone who will stand up      for the rule of law and say no to a president or Congress      that strays beyond the Constitution and laws? I have no doubt      that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help restore      confidence in the rule of law. His years on the bench reveal      a commitment to judicial independence--a record that should      give the American people confidence that he will not      compromise principle to favor the president who appointed      him.  Judge Gorsuch is exactly the type of judge who should be confirmed, who should be allowed to serve on the Supreme Court of the United This vacancy was a central issue in the 2016 election. The people have now spoken, and I plan to honor the results of this election by working as hard as I can to see Judge Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Perdue).

14390,topic-id,861,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I first thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman Smith, for his continued leadership on the Science  H.353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, prioritizes improving weather forecasting for the protection of lives and property at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric This bill does so by focusing research and computing resources on improved weather forecasting, quantitative observing data planning, next generation modeling, and an emphasis on research-to-operations technology transfer.  As a Representative from Oklahoma, I understand the need for accurate and timely weather predictions firsthand. Every year, the loss of life from deadly tornadoes in my home State is a stark reminder that we can do better to predict severe weather events and provide longer lead times to protect Americans in harm's way.  I am proud that the legislation has a dedicated Tornado Warning Improvement The goal of this program is to reduce the loss of life from tornadoes by advancing the understanding of fundamental meteorological science allowing detection and notifications that are more accurate, effective, and timely. Constituents in my home State will benefit greatly from longer tornado warning lead times, which will save lives and better protect property.  H.353 makes clear that NOAA will prioritize weather research and protect lives and property through a focused, affordable, attainable, forward-looking research plan at the agency's Research  The bill also encourages innovations and new technology capacities by creating a joint technology transfer fund in NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric This transfer is[[Page H215]]essential to get new forecasting, models, and technologies out of the research side of NOAA and into our operational forecast to better protect our country.  The bill directs NOAA to develop plans to restore our country's leadership in weather forecasting. It is no secret that many people in our weather community are distraught that our forecasting capacities have deteriorated in recent years.  While other countries are making great strides in weather advancements, Americans are paying the price for diminished leadership with their lives and their wallets. This is yet another reminder that we can do better.  This legislation directs NOAA to actively consider new commercial data and private sector solutions to further enhance our weather forecasting capacities. The bill also includes a pilot project, which will provide NOAA a clear and credible demonstration of the valuable data from commercial technologies available today.  H.353 is the result of 4 years of work to craft a meaningful package that will create new and real improvements to our country's weather forecasting systems. The time has come for Americans to have the most accurate and timely weather predictions. They deserve nothing less.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

14408,topic-id,358,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.560, my bill to reauthorize limited commercial vehicle traffic along Route 209 through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Tomorrow marks 16 months during which uncertainty has reigned over this 21-mile stretch of road running through my district.  Over 30 years ago, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania transferred Route 209, then a State road, to the National Park As commercial vehicle traffic is banned on roads within our national parks, it would ultimately be restricted on this stretch of Route 209. But at that time, a 10-year exemption was made to support the local freight transport industry and because acceptable alternative routes were unavailable.  After multiple extensions, the most recent commercial vehicle authorization expired at the end of September 2015. To address the problem, county and township officials from the surrounding areas met with the National Park Service and my staff to negotiate a new plan. They recognized a continuing need to allow some commercial vehicles access and settled on the carefully crafted language we are considering today.  The work to produce this extension acknowledges the continued need of the employers, businesses, and homeowners in Pike and Monroe Unfortunately, although the House passed identical language in the 114th Congress and the Senate moved it to the floor, this important legislation failed to become law. The resulting uncertainty created hardship for families and businesses in the communities neighboring the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation  The lack of access to this stretch of road has cast a cloud on a wide range of local businesses from heating fuel and package delivery to plumbers and electricians. Homeowners cannot access the services they need and countless jobs are in jeopardy. This is a critical piece of legislation for my constituents. We must pass it today and urge the Senate to act just as quickly.

14245,topic-id,812,"Mr.President, it is Valentine's Day, and Senate Republicans and President Trump want to deliver a love letter to their sweetheart, the National Rifle To the Republicans and President Trump, nothing says ``I love you'' like ``let's weaken background checks on gun sales'' because that is exactly the issue before us today.  Today, Republicans in Congress and President Trump want to gut a commonsense safety measure that would help keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. After the tragedy in Newtown, CT, the Obama administration undertook a comprehensive review of Federal law to identify ``potentially dangerous individuals'' who should not be trusted with firearms.  The Social Security Administration was required to identify and report to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System those people who received Social Security benefits due to severe mental impairment and who require a fiduciary representative to manage those benefits.  That is a sensible policy. If you can't manage your disability benefits because of a mental impairment, you probably shouldn't be trying to manage a gun. Indeed, current law prohibits individuals from purchasing a firearm if a court, a board, a commission, or other lawful authority has determined that a mental health issue makes them a danger to themselves or to others or that they lack the mental capacity to contract or manage their own affairs.  The purpose of the rule is, simply, to include in the Federal background check system information from the Social Security Administration that it already has about beneficiaries whom current law already prohibits from possessing a firearm. Even this fair, reasonable, and commonsense limitation on gun purchasing is too much for the NRA and its Republican congressional allies. So they have turned, this afternoon, to the Congressional Review Act to roll back this rule. By doing so, they would block the Social Security Administration from issuing a similar rule on this subject in the future. This is shortsighted on the one hand and very dangerous on the other for a long, long time in our country because it is these loopholes in the background check system that have already allowed people to obtain guns, despite being judged a danger to themselves or to others, especially family members.  Loopholes in the system allowed the Virginia Tech, Tucson, Aurora, and Newtown shooters to obtain guns. We need to close loopholes like the ones that allow people who are mentally impaired from buying guns. Repealing this rule only keeps the loophole open.  Recent polls show that 92 percent of Americans support background checks for all gun buyers--including 87 percent of Republicans in our country support background checks on who is, in fact, purchasing a gun in our country--but not the National Rifle The National Rifle Association sent an action alert to its membership on this current attempt to repeal the background check rule stating: ``The first pro-gun legislative act of the Trump era and Congress is on the verge of success, but it needs your help to get it over the line.'' That is all you need to know.  So on this Valentine's Day, the U.Senate should show some real love and compassion. Let us open our hearts to the American people who overwhelmingly are demanding commonsense gun control efforts like the one this rule puts in place. Let us defeat this ill-advised effort to roll back this rule which keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.  This is the job of the This is the carnage we see in It is the indiscriminate issuing of licenses for guns to people who have not gone through the background checks that ensure they are qualified for the handling of a weapon within our society. Everyone else can get the weapon. Everyone else who goes through the check gets the weapon but not people who should not have them.  So this is a big moment here. It, unfortunately, gives an insight into what the Republican agenda is going to be this year. It is a radical agenda. It is an agenda which says to the National Rifle Association: We are going to pass your agenda, no matter how radical, out here on the floor of the What the American people are saying is they want the NRA to stand for ``not relevant anymore'' in American politics. That is what they want it to say, especially with the polling so overwhelmingly bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans, in terms of commonsense[[Page S1153]]background checks that are in the law to protect innocent families in our country.  All I can say is this isn't anything that is radical, this regulation. It is something that is common sense. It is something that protects American families, and I urge strongly that the U.Senate reject the removal of this regulation from the statutes of our country.

14324,topic-id,3360,"Mr.President, I appreciate the comments just delivered by my colleague from Washington Our two States are roughly the same size. They have similar amounts of coastline. We have citizens who share a lot of perspective on the country and that may be apparent in the comments I am about to make.  Mr.President, from our earliest days, long before the Founding Fathers gathered in Philadelphia to declare that 13 disparate colonies were united and ``absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown'' and long before they sought to ``form a more perfect Union,'' our streams, our rivers, and our lakes have been the economic lifeblood of our They have supported commerce and trade, fishing and agriculture. They have facilitated the ability to travel the vastness of this continent. They have sustained our growing communities and served as critical resources for public health.  It is no wonder, then, that generations of Americans have worked incredibly hard to protect these natural resources to keep them clean and safe. That is why here, in the Senate and in the House, in 1972, we passed the Clean Water Act that formed the foundation for our Nation's water regulations. It is why, 2 years later, the House and Senate developed and passed the Safe Drinking Water Act, to make sure that public drinking water supplies are safe throughout the  I recall the impact of these acts in my home State of The Klamath River was considered extraordinarily polluted. You could boat down it and see pipes dumping into it at regular intervals. Then, over time, as the State worked hard to identify those pipes, remove those pipes, and make sure that all pollution went through water treatment, the river got better. It got healthier.  Now, it is not without its problems. Its problems still exist. There is still nonpoint pollution that affects life in the stream. But it is a far more beautiful and far healthier river than it was before we passed the Clean Water  We have proceeded to be fairly fierce about our enforcement. We have prosecuted polluters who have bypassed the law and dumped the results of their processes directly into our streams and our waterways. We have worked to protect wetlands, and we have worked to protect estuaries, understanding more and more about the role these various bodies of water play in our economy and play in our natural system and making sure they can continue to play that role so that we have a sustainable environment, one that is not at war with our economy.  We have made the two work very well together, and we have accomplished all this through the debate and dialogue that we have had in the Senate and in the House and that the experts have brought to bear in our committee hearing rooms. We have accomplished it through the testimony of concerned citizens across the Nation who have identified one particular problem or another problem and have brought those challenges to us here in this body, and we have worked to address them. If you have ever visited a nation that didn't have this kind of process and seen the intense, incredible pollution of its waterways, then you know what a difference it makes to have this public process. I invite you to visit China and see what happens when there is no public process for taking into account and rectifying the challenges when industrial waste is simply dumped into our waterways.  We take a lot of pride in protecting our streams, our rivers, and our lakes. That process has continued over these past years at the Department of the Interior, where the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement was working on the stream protection rule.  I am going to show a picture to give some scale to the type of mining that the Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement was trying to address. We see here the little tiny tractor. This is actually a massive tractor dwarfed by the scale of this massive mine. Indeed, in many cases, the entire top of the mountain is blown off to get at the coal seams underneath. In the process, a tremendous amount of rock debris is created and a tremendous amount of fracturing that can lead to water that moves through the water table eventually finds its way into streams.  The goal has been to find a way that this type of mining can be done in respectful balance with the streams that are further down the mountainside. That is the challenge, and it wasn't easy to address. That is why this rule has been under development for 7 years, from 2009 right up through December of 2016--virtually the entire length of the Obama administration. During this period of consideration, there have been multiple reiterations of what the rule could look like and[[Page S573]]what actually works in the real world, with stakeholder after stakeholder after stakeholder saying: This is what you have to do to make it work. The goal was that this type of mining would be done, but not in a fashion which would destroy the streams. That is why it took so much hard work to do this.  There were hundreds of hours of meetings, responses to over 114,000 comments on the rule. But here we are in the evening, with little attention being paid by the vast bulk of Senators spending just a couple hours and planning to undo this work.  Under the Senate rules under the Congressional Review Act, we have just 10 hours of debate. Some of that can be yielded back by one side or the other, so maybe it will only be a few hours of debate. In those few hours, we hold in our hands the fate of the streams downstream from this mining. This is the premise: Will they conduct this mining in a fashion and followup with restoration to protect the streams that will otherwise be devastatingly impacted?  I am going to say yes. Let's take to heart the 100,000-plus hours of work or the 114,000 comments and the multitude of meetings over 6 years, the work of professionals who talked to every stakeholder. Let's take to heart their work and not undo it in just an hour or two here on the floor.  The Senate works in a way now that, even with something that has such a profound impact, Senators aren't here listening to each other; thus, we are not sharing our thoughts back and forth the way the old Senate used to debate. It is almost in silence that we are undoing or potentially undoing all of this work. Shouldn't we be celebrating that so many folks came together to craft a strategy that would not cause this type of mining to destroy the down-mountain streams?  Let me show an example of what a down-mountain stream looks like. This is a stream that probably ran blue not too long ago. It now runs orange. It is full of toxic metals and who knows what. I rather doubt that any Member of the Senate would volunteer to go and take a cup of water from this stream and drink it. We can just look at it and know it is deadly.  So we are trying to keep in place a rule carefully crafted so this stream--which not so long ago ran blue or ran turquoise or deep green because it was a natural stream without this devastating pollution--will stay in that natural state. That is the goal. That is the point of this rule.  I want to be very clear that the stream protection rule is designed to enable mining and stream sustainability to go hand-in-hand. Coal mining is changing in It has adopted a number of practices that have made it safer. Machinery has also gotten bigger in ways that mean far fewer people are employed in it. It is also changing because the economies of the energy market are changing. We see that natural gas prices have dropped so low that many utilities are shutting down their coal plants and they are opening up natural gas plants or they are investing in wind or solar renewables. But we need to recognize that for 150 years coal mining families have worked incredibly hard, at great personal risk to their health, to put meals on their tables and to provide power to our So let's have this conversation about protecting our streams with a full respect for the mining economy and the families that have put their lives at stake and worked to put food on the table.  There is no reason we can't do what we have done in so many other parts of our economy to make the industrial process or the manufacturing process or the mining process be one that works in harmony with our environment, instead of at odds with the environment. That is the goal of the stream protection rule. It updates our 30-year-old coal mining regulations to better reflect the industry as it is today, in 2017.  The fact is, we know a great deal more about the impacts of various coal mining processes on both the people and communities and environment--much more now than we did when most of the regulations were put together decades ago. We know that when we use explosives to blast the summit of a mountain as is done in mountaintop removal, everything gets blasted up into the air and pushed down into the valleys where it ends up in rivers and streams. What is the result of that? If that newly blasted rock doesn't block the flow of the river and streams entirely, it is still in constant contact with them, leaching out pollutants into the water, and those pollutants include things like heavy metals and other toxics that pose enormous threats to the region's fish and to the plants and to the animals and, yes, even to the people who live downstream. There are pollutants like selenium, a metalloid that is toxic to fish even at a very low level, causing deformities, causing reproductive failures, causing death.  One way to tell the health of a stream is that it has life in it, but I doubt anyone would come out and say: Last year, I fished here when this was a blue-green stream, but this year I am not because with one glance at this stream, you know all the fish are dead.  There are other pollutants like cadmium, a pollutant that is not safe at any level and has been tied to cancer in humans. So as cadmium goes down into water, flows into the streams and cities and small towns further down, it adds to the health risks of the folks living in the areas.  Waste dumps called valley fills are left in place even when the mining is completed and the company moves on. We know that the rubble from mountaintop mining is impacting our streams and waterways because we have measured it. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's statistics, valley fills from mountaintop removal are responsible for burying 2,000 miles of vital Appalachian headwater streams. Now, 2,000 miles is a lot of streams. Picture 2,000 miles of a blue-green stream reduced not just to a toxic red stream but to no stream at all because it has been completely covered and eliminated. That is a lot of fishing holes that are gone forever.  In addition to that, we know the fish populations downstream have been reduced by two-thirds from the places where mountaintop removal is occurring.  We know that communities nearby are contending with contaminated drinking water and that babies are being born with higher rates of birth defects. I think about the birth of my two children. Like every parent, we pray and hope that the child is going to be born free of birth defects.  So this rule is about something very close to our hearts. For some, it is the beauty of natural streams. For some, it is the opportunity to fish and see wonderful natural places. But for others, it comes straight to the question of whether their children are going to be born with birth defects. At the other end of life, we see downstream elevated levels of lung cancer, elevated levels of heart disease, elevated levels of kidney disease, elevated levels of hypertension.  So I ask: Is it right that here, in the dark of night, with just a few hours of discussion and virtually no one here in the Senate Chamber, we are going to undo 7 years of work designed to reduce birth defects, reduce lung cancer, reduce heart disease, reduce kidney disease, reduce hypertension, reduce contaminated drinking water?  In just a few short hours, we will be making a decision that will result in an impact on thousands of people, as well as thousands of miles of streams. The stream protection rule is pretty straightforward in its design. I will give a few details about what it is intended to do.  One is that it improves construction standards for waste piles. What is a waste pile? Well, it is pretty much what it sounds like. It is a pile built from accumulated rock waste that is removed when you do mountaintop mining. Why do we need to improve their construction? Because these piles grow to enormous size. They can involve millions and millions of tons of rock and debris. Over time, erosion in the soil around them can create dangerous, unstable slopes that can eventually produce landslides. So how you design it matters. These coal piles can have high levels of coal dust or hydrocarbons. And then there is the acid rock drainage. As water comes down in rain and it percolates down through these, it ends up seeping out into the groundwater or into the stream and poisoning the groundwater or poisoning the stream.[[Page S574]]  That is why it matters how you have a construction standard for a waste pile. Isn't it smart to have such a standard in place and one that has been developed over hundreds of meetings over 6 years so that mining is much more compatible with clean streams and healthy people?  Another thing this rule does is it enhances restoration by strengthening bonding requirements. It is not unknown, unfortunately, that coal miners would just abandon the mine once their operations were finished, leaving all sorts of undone business that adds to the enormous contamination that even a small amount of mining can do.  In 1977, Congress passed a law saying that miners needed to restore the land after their mining operation was completed and that they needed to provide a bond up front to pay for the cleanup cost just in case the company decided it didn't want to follow through on the cleanup after it completed extracting the coal. Strengthening that and making sure the bonding process actually works right, that the bond is actually there to do the cleanup, makes a lot of sense.  Years ago, I was immersed in first developing housing with Habitat for Humanity and then building affordable multiplexes for a nonprofit, Human Companies that were being paid to do their work had a construction bond. The bond made sure that if the company somehow disappeared in the middle of the night, the work was going to get done. That bond was very important to the nonprofit, that what they were investing in--the payments they made were actually going to result in what was contracted to be delivered. That is the same thing here. A company that comes in and says: We got permission to mine--it is saying to the public, with a good bonding system, yes, you can be confident that the cleanup work will be done. That needed to be strengthened because often it is not done. That is another piece of this puzzle.  Then there is another piece that is related to coal slurry and reducing the odds of coal slurry causing a lot of damage. Coal slurry is liquid waste generated when mined coal is washed off. You have a lot of water that is thickened with debris from washing the coal, and it can be held in a basin, but if the walls of that basin fail and that coal slurry gets into the streams, it does massive damage.  That transpired in Martin County, KY, 16 years ago. An estimated 306 million gallons of slurry spilled into two tributaries of the Tug Fork How much is 306 million gallons? It is a lot of swimming pools, almost more than you can imagine. Another way to look at it is it is 30 times larger than the Exxon Valdez oilspill, one of the worst environmental disasters ever.  There it is. It was a big, massive pond that spilled into the forests and into the rivers in that situation in Martin Overnight, one of the tributaries, the Coldwater Fork, a 10-foot-wide stream, became 100 yards of slurry. In some places, the spill was over 5 feet deep. It spread out and covered people's yards on the banks. Hundreds of miles of the Big Sandy River were polluted as a result as the stuff washed down the stream. The Ohio River was polluted. The water supply for 27,000 people was contaminated.  It is not that it has just happened once; it has happened other times. It happened in Buffalo Creek Hollow, WV, in 1972. In that case, it was 132 million gallons of slurry. That is about a third of the size of the other spills, so I guess you could say that instead of being 30 times Exxon Valdez, it was only 10 times Exxon But it did a lot of damage. It created a wave going downstream that was 30 feet high. Can you imagine how much material is required to create a wave of--a flash flood of coal slurry 30 feet high? This didn't happen away from human civilization; this wave of coal slurry killed 125 people. This wave of toxic coal slurry hit and injured over 1,000 more people--1,121 more people. It left 4,000 people homeless, wiped out their homes and their towns.  That is the type of damage that can occur, so why not have a rule that has looked at how these ponds are created and said, here is a standard so that the pond is not overloaded or overtopped or the wall does not collapse and cause a tidal wave that will kill more than 100 people or injure more than 1,000 or leave 4,000 people homeless. Having a standard is the logical thing to do. It helps the companies because then they know exactly what they need to do to make that pond safe.  Those are some examples of what is in this rule.  I think it is important to understand another factor. This rule requires careful mapping before the mining is done so that the restoration process can be held accountable to restore the contours that existed previously, or as close as you can get. Without an understanding of what the land looked like beforehand, it is hard to say what it should look like when it is restored.  Those are commonsense measures. That is it. Common sense. Common standards for safety, for protection of the streams and the wildlife and the people. Isn't that what we should be all about? Shouldn't we not be undoing that, as we will be in a couple of hours, in a deserted Senate Chamber in the middle of the night? That is wrong.  If you want to change these standards--and I say this to my colleagues, and I know many do care a great deal about the environment--then have the courage to do it in daylight. Have the courage to do it in a committee. Have the courage to invite the public in to testify. But here we are tonight, hiding from the population across America, undoing this important work for the safety of our people. That is wrong.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

The Mattatuck Drum Band's performances have captivated audiences in Connecticut since before the founding of our Nation and deserve recognition for continuing this important musical tradition over so many years.  During the marching band's formative years in the early 1770's, it was known as the Farmingbury Drum The group performed at Farmingbury church events, where churchgoers were called into services by drumbeat--a common practice for churches without a bell. During the American Revolution, many members of the band served as wartime fifers and drummers, providing military field music for soldiers fighting for American independence. Shortly after returning home from the war, the band grew in popularity and changed their name to the Wolcott Drum  In the 19th century, many band members continued their service to the military during the War of 1812 and in the Civil War, participating in rallies and recruiting events to ``drum up'' support for the militia. Following the Civil War, however, many band members relocated, and interest in the group waned. The group was revived in 1881, when the remaining active members of the band moved the group to Waterbury and renamed it the Mattatuck Drum The uniform first donned by this group in 1884 is still worn by the Mattatuck Drum Band today.  As the band continued into the 20th century, their main purpose shifted from rallying support for the militia to bolstering the morale and feelings of patriotism amongst the public.

14362,topic-id,606,"Mr.President, for years, I have been working to make sure that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has reliable tools to forecast hurricanes. Today the Senate will come together on legislation to get us closer to that goal. In May 2016, just before the start of hurricane season, the Commerce Committee held a hearing on preparedness. At that hearing, I asked the then-Director of the National Hurricane Center, Rick Knabb, about the fact that NOAA has two P3 propeller aircraft that fly into the storm, but only the one Gulfstream jet that can fly high enough and long enough to get above the storm. Flying above the storm is critical because the scientists drop sondes out of the belly of the aircraft that fall through the storm sending measurements of the entire vertical profile. This is vital to telling us where the storm is headed and whether it is weakening or strengthening.  Having only one Gulfstream is a single point of failure because, if the plane is out of commission, we do not have a backup ready to go. Unfortunately, my fears were realized a few short months later. During a Hurricane Hermine reconnaissance mission, NOAA had to ground the Gulfstream for emergency corrosion repairs. Luckily, a plane owned by the National Science Foundation and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research was not on a mission at the time and was able to fill in for the NOAA Gulfstream, but you can imagine that this will not always be the case. While the hurricane season seems to be getting longer, the NOAA plane is getting older. We must have a reliable backup. So, in January, I filed 153, legislation to require NOAA to acquire sufficient backup capability for our hurricane hunter aircraft. I am pleased today that the Senate will unanimously pass this measure as part of a broader weather bill.  I take comfort that even in times of great divisiveness, the Senate can come together on matters of public[[Page S2116]]safety. The power of Mother Nature must be taken seriously. Consider the flooding in California or the devastating tornadoes that hit Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida early this year. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew took 46 lives in the United States alone. In addition to requiring backup capability for the hurricane hunters, the broader bill we will pass tonight, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, will improve NOAA s ability to understand, predict, and--most importantly--to warn people about all kinds of weather events that dramatically affect the economy and people's daily lives. It also includes a reauthorization of the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research These provisions will give NOAA the tools to protect life and property and to support continued economic growth. It is my hope that the House follows suit.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the Thune substitute amendment at the desk be considered; the Cantwell amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; the Thune substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.

14321,topic-id,1241,"Mr.President, during the Presidential campaign last year, President Donald Trump promised the American people he would nominate an unwavering supporter of the U.Constitution to the Supreme He has now kept that promise.  I personally applaud the President for nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.Supreme He is an outstanding choice. Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has been a stalwart, standing strong in support of the U.He has repeatedly shown his commitment to our country's founding principles of economic opportunity, fiscal responsibility, limited government, and individual liberty. These principles have served to[[Page S570]]make our Nation exceptional throughout our history. Each branch of government has the shared charge of preserving and protecting those rights for all Judge Gorsuch has had a remarkable career in both the public and private sectors and has demonstrated a keen understanding and appreciation of the law.  He has an outstanding academic record. He is an outsider to the political nonsense here in this town. He has an impeccable judicial record, and he is actually called a ``judge's judge'' in the Scalia mold. He is a mainstream judge.  Actually, when he was confirmed in his current position, he was confirmed by 11 Democrats who are still in this body today, including Senators Lee, Feinstein, Schumer, and Clearly, Judge Gorsuch will honor the formidable and impressive legacy of defending the Constitution left by Justice  Throughout last year, I and other Members in the Senate held our ground in saying that no nominee to the Supreme Court should be confirmed until after the Presidential election. We believed the American people deserved a voice in the process. We also knew that the hyper-partisanship and politics of a Presidential election cycle should never have any place in the nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice, which we all know is a lifetime appointment. The integrity of the advice and consent process, clearly spelled out in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, was at stake. In protecting the integrity of the sacred constitutional process, we did our job.  Our position was exactly the same, ironically, as held by former Vice President Biden, former Minority Leader Harry Reid, and others in earlier times and earlier debates.  Now that President Trump has announced his nomination, it is time to continue doing our job. I hope the minority leader and Members of the minority party will walk away from the hypocrisy they are already demonstrating this year.  Last June, the current minority leader tweeted: ``In order for justice to remain a pillar of this nation, we must have a functioning judicial branch. The [Supreme Court of the United States] must have nine [sitting Justices].'' Later that same month, the minority leader said before the U.Senate: ``Every day that goes by without a ninth Justice is another day the American people's business is not getting done.'' So why would the current minority leader and some of the Democrats in this body now say they will filibuster any nominee to the Supreme Court before even knowing who would be nominated?  The minority leader railed on the Senate floor. Yet last month he went on CNN and said: ``We absolutely would keep the seat open . . . we will fight it tooth and nail, as long as we have to.''  Again, this was before a nominee was even announced.  The political theater of 2016 has no place in the confirmation process this year. Now is the time to govern, not to engage in the far-off political theater of 2018 and 2020. As we move forward in this process, I hope the minority leader and my colleagues across the aisle will remember that. I hope they will put the integrity of the Constitution before the scope of their political ambition and their bitterness about last year's election outcome.  I would remind my colleagues across the aisle that Republicans put aside political theater to confirm two Justices to the Supreme Court under both President Obama and President Now President Trump has nominated Neil Gorsuch, who is a principled judge who will put the Constitution of the United States and the rights of all Americans at the forefront of any decision he takes. Judge Gorsuch's record of service and his commitment to the Constitution is quite clear. I am looking forward to voting to confirm his nomination and to ensure that we have a fully functioning High  I strongly urge my colleagues across the aisle to put aside their partisan self-interest and do what is right for our country. Our children and our children's children deserve nothing less.                               Travel Ban  Mr.President, I also would like to speak momentarily to the President's recent Executive order to strengthen our refugee screening process that he thinks will protect America, and I agree with him.  The minority leader's tear-jerking performance over the past weekend belongs at the Screen Actors Guild awards, not in a serious discussion of what it takes to keep America safe. Folks back home are fed up with Members of this body stirring up global hysteria to score political points.  Let's be clear. This temporary action is not a so-called Muslim ban, and no Muslim ban has been put into place. As a matter of fact, the five countries most heavily populated with Muslims around the world were not included in this temporary pause on movement. In fact, almost 90 percent of the world's Muslim population is not even remotely affected by this temporary pause.  The seven countries that were included in President Trump's Executive order--Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen--were included for specific reasons. Each of these nations was previously identified by President Obama as posing national security threats to the United  This is not a target at any religion; it is simply a temporary pause in the movement of individuals from nations of concern in order to assess whether our current screening system is in the best possible shape to protect I am apoplectic that Members of the minority party and the former President of the United States would actually say or imply otherwise. Their comments encouraging civil unrest and disobedience are both deplorable and unacceptable.  The failed foreign policy of President Obama in Syria and the broader Middle East has made the world more dangerous than at any time in my lifetime and has helped to create the current refugee crisis around the world. We are at war with ISIS, and we know they have identified and targeted our refugee system as a point of weakness. They have already exploited the refugee systems of nations in Europe, carrying out terrorist attacks and killing innocent people.  It would be malfeasance for our President not to take action and immediately review our current screening process to ensure we are helping those in need and keeping terrorists out. This temporary pause will allow us to assess our current screening process and strengthen it as needed. Moving forward, the implementation of this temporary pause must be efficient and effective.  During this screening review period, we should avoid overreacting to the responsible steps that have been taken to prioritize the protection of all It is totally irresponsible and ridiculous for the minority leader, Members of this body, the former President, President Obama, and others to suggest that it is anything other than a rational, responsible step to keep America safe and deal with the ISIS threat once and for all.  I yield my time.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgS562.txt,2286,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,1.0,February
14443,topic-id,711,"Mr.Speaker, when Queen Helen of Sparta was abducted by the Trojan prince Paris, Helen's jilted husband convinced his brother, a Greek king, to lead an expedition to retrieve her. He was accompanied by a fleet of more than a thousand ships. They crossed the sea to Troy and demanded Helen's return.  The siege, punctuated by all sorts of battles and skirmishes, lasted more than 10 years until one day when Odysseus had a bright idea. He said: Hey, guys, let's build a really massive wooden horse. Let's pretend like we have given up and sailed our fleet behind some island, but really about 30 of us will hide inside the horse. We will have someone tell the Trojans that it is some kind of gift to Athena, the goddess of war, and they will haul it into their city. When they are asleep, we will all sneak out, open the gates for everybody else, and totally kill everybody in the city.  And that is the legend of the Trojan horse.  So what is the moral of that story and why am I reciting Greek lore on the floor of Congress today?  Well, because history has a way of repeating itself. Today we have our own Trojan horse, a so-called GOP healthcare bill, TrumpCare, that professes to be about health care but, in reality, is a Trojan horse to give tax breaks to the wealthiest in the country.  Let's take a serious look at it. We are told that it is the replacement to the Affordable Care Act, a bill that has offered insurance to over 20 million people in this country. Now that replacement is supposed to fix the problems of the Affordable Care Act and ensure health care for everyone, as promised by President  But the covert part of TrumpCare was that he got busted last week when the Congressional Budget Office, our nonpartisan agency that evaluates bills, said that, in reality, the bill does little to improve health care. In fact, it[[Page H2293]]said 24 million people would lose access to health care, not gain it. And it said older Americans would pay more for health insurance than under the Affordable Care Act and get fewer subsidies, and that more people on Medicaid would lose access to health care as well.  So how can a supposed healthcare bill actually reduce health care?  Well, when it is only a pretend healthcare bill.  And what else did the CBO say?  Well, they said this bill also includes almost $600 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals in our country, insurance companies, and Big  It gets worse. Those tax cuts for the wealthy, just how bad are they?  Well, the 400 richest families in the country making more than $300 million a year will get an annual tax cut of $7 million each. So Charles Koch and Betsy DeVos get $7 million a year while a retired farmer in Janesville, Wisconsin, in Speaker Ryan's district, earning $26,000 a year may have to pay $14,600 for the same health care she got under the Affordable Care Act, but the old cost was only about $1,700. That is a 750 percent increase on low-income, older Americans so the richest can bank millions.                              {time}  1015  And the CBO said another tax cut in TrumpCare provides about $275 billion in tax breaks that only the top 2 percent of Americans can get, while 98 percent of us will never see a dime.  And who else gets tax cuts? Insurance companies get a tax break of about $145 billion, drug companies get a tax break of $25 billion, and medical device companies get a break of about $20 billion. That is almost $600 billion worth of tax cuts for the wealthy, and what do we get? Less health care for more money.  That is not a serious healthcare alternative. That is a tax cut for the wealthy disguised as health care, and you and I get to foot the bill.  That is what is called a Trojan horse. And you have to be especially careful these days because Trojans are a little bit different than they used to be, and they are only used when you get--well, the same thing this will do to America, Mr.                         ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2292-2.txt,2171,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,22.0,February

14332,topic-id,614,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to share thestory of Mary and her son, two of my constituents from the Lakeview community of Mary wrote to me on her son's behalf,expressing their deep appreciation for the Affordable Care Act and what the law has meant for their family.  In 2001, Mary'sson was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease called Addison's disease. It occurs when your body produces insufficientamounts of certain hormones produced by your adrenal glands. When left untreated, Addison's disease can be life-threatening.  At the time of his diagnosis, Mary's son was fully insured through his employer. Then, in 2011, Mary's son left his employerto pursue the American Dream of entrepreneurship and start a small business on his own. Leaving his employer to bravely chasethe American Dream meant leaving behind his insurance coverage, too. He did not anticipate being denied coverage due to apreexisting condition.[[Page H57]]  Up to this point, because of treatment covered by his insurance plan, he had been able to workto provide for himself and to live independently. As he got his new business off the ground, he went uninsured and, as a result,encountered several crises with his health. He avoided going to the doctor due to high costs and eventually ended up in theemergency room. As we all know, preventable emergency visits are a major contributor to the overall high healthcare costs thatharm the entire system.  Thanks to the President and Congress passing the Affordable Care Act, Mary's son was finally able toobtain affordable care when the health insurance marketplace first opened in October 2013.  Mary wrote me to share her son'sstory. He is one of tens of millions of Americans who have directly benefited from the ACA's improvements to coverage, consumerprotections, costs, and quality. Today, Mary is fearful of what the repeal of ACA will mean for her son.  Unfortunately,despite having 7 years to produce an alternative, the majority has failed to offer a true replacement. And what about the partsof the ACA that share bipartisan popularity?  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the President-elect insistthey will craft a plan that maintains popular parts of the law, while rejecting the less popular components. Of course, thatsounds great, but there is one real problem: they have offered absolutely no way to pay for any of it.  In reality, repealand replace is more simply repeal and go back to before--tearing down a much-needed house before a new one is built, back to atime when 47 million Americans--nearly 18 percent of the population--were uninsured. Mary's son and countless others like himcannot afford to go back in time. Repealing ACA will leave 20 million Americans, including her son, without affordable healthinsurance, effectively disrupting their care and potentially putting their lives at risk.  To remind us all of the highstakes riding on the ACA repeal, Mary wrote, saying: ``As a former Republican and now an Independent voter, I am speaking frommy heart. The 2016 election result has me truly frightened for the health of my son and for my husband and me.''  Repealingthe Affordable Care Act will create a chaotic situation that will put real lives in danger. We all share in the responsibilityto protect the health care of all Empty rhetoric of repealing the ACA is dangerous, but when transformed into reallegislative action, it can be catastrophic for the constituents that elected us to serve and represent them in this body.  Onbehalf of Mary's son and other Americans in districts across the country, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle toabandon their efforts to strip health care from those who need it and, instead, work with us to make our country a healthierplace for all.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgH56-3.txt,1967,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,4.0,February
14338,topic-id,696,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) for the exemplary act of civility in allowing me and another late-arriving colleague to be part of the freshman class presentation about our collective commitment to promoting and practicing civility both within our class and within the Congress of the United States as long as we are here.  It is a great honor to be part of the freshman class of the 115th I am thrilled to make this commitment to civility--and even friendship--across the aisle with whatever Republican colleagues are willing to hang out with a liberal constitutional law professor.  Despite my great passions as a liberal and a progressive, I dedicate myself to civility for three reasons, and I think they are all consistent with my political values and beliefs:  First, I am a middle child, and so it is in my nature to try to bring people together. If you study the theory of birth order advanced by Frank Sulloway in his great book ``Born to Rebel,'' you will find an exemplary middle child in Reverend Martin Luther King who believed in the power of love for reconciling different views in society, and you will find a theory of the effectiveness of nonviolent struggle for progress and change, a theory that doesn't try to wish away or blink away real conflict that people have but embraces conflict as the possibility for uplifting everyone in the process.  Second, I am from the great State of Maryland, one of the original middle States tucked between New England and the In Maryland, we have a habit of working across party lines for the common good. Many of the big bills that I introduced in the Maryland Senate I introduced with Republican friends, like my friend Senator David We did the medical marijuana program together. He is a fellow cancer survivor and felt very strongly about that.  I did a number of criminal justice reform measures, including abolishing mandatory minimum drug sentences, with a Republican colleague named Michael Hough in Frederick County, who lives within my congressional district.  I even introduced a bill which succeeded for fiscal transparency in government, putting up all government expenditures over $10,000 online within 48 hours, with Congressman Alex Mooney from West Virginia, although then he was a State senator in Maryland who served with me in  Third, as a law professor, I believe that all of our ideas, passions, and feelings about politics are refined, perfected, and improved through the process of political dialogue, testing, and questioning.  So I know that our Republican colleagues make us stronger on the Democratic side of the aisle, and I hope that we make them stronger, too, that we all grow together and that we are able to improve each other's ideas, change each other's minds sometimes, and work on issues of common concern like infrastructure, which I think is a pressing problem that we can gather consensus around in this body, like the environment and the perils of climate change.  Our greatest Presidents have always called us to civility. George Washington invited Americans to place our patriotic love of liberty first above partisan and sectional feeling. Thomas Jefferson said that we are all Republicans, we are all federalists at a time of great division in the country. In his first inaugural address, President Lincoln said: ``We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.''  So the bonds of affection might seem like a romantic dream given the divisions and polarization in the country today, but I do think that, if at least we start with civility and respect, maybe we will be able to attain the level of recovering the bonds of affection that should unify all of us as  The word ``party'' comes from the French word ``partie,'' a part, and we have got to remember--each of us, all of us--that our party is just one small part of the whole, and we are all here to try to advance the common good.

14318,topic-id,1093,"Mr.President, I rise to speak on the stream protection rule. One of the first things we learn as kids is that if you make a mess, you are responsible to clean it up. It is good manners, but it is also a matter of ethics. It is about doing the right thing. This is the spirit, this is the idea behind the stream protection rule. It simply tells coal companies doing mountaintop mining that they need to clean up their mess if they make a mess. It seems pretty common sense to me.  Opponents of this rule argue that this is somehow an unfair burden on coal companies because coal is doing poorly in the emergency markets. Opponents seem to want to say that asking companies to be responsible to clean up whatever mess may have been made makes it harder for them to compete.  The truth is, coal is having a very difficult time in energy markets, but it is not because they are being required to clean up after themselves. It is because other energy resources are becoming cheaper. Solar is cheaper now than ever. The natural gas revolution is now in competition with coal. It is very difficult to get a new coal-fired powerplant on line. It may be even more difficult to recapitalize an old one. So coal is struggling, but the reason is not the stream protection rule.  There is another aspect of this, which is, since when is there no cost to doing business? Since when are any companies allowed to come in, pollute, and then walk away without doing anything about it? If you hired a contractor to work on your house and they left a pile of materials in your kitchen, you wouldn't say: Well, that is just the cost of doing business. You would say: Clean up the mess. That is part of the job.  There is no question that coal mining is a tough business, but it also can sometimes be a messy business. That is a simple fact. If we ignore the pollution that is caused, if we ignore the cost the public bears when toxic substances are dumped without proper treatment or when coal-fired powerplants spew carbon pollution into the atmosphere, for that matter, we are ignoring the cost of doing business.  To be fair, we have to make sure every industry, including the coal industry, plays by the same rules as everyone else. Up until December of last year, some coal companies just were not playing by the same rules. Mountaintop mining had leaked dirty water and waste into the streams. Researchers estimate that this has destroyed 2,000 miles of stream in the United States of  That destruction has a domino effect. It threatens the health of people who depend on those streams for their drinking water, it poisons fish, birds, plants, and it reduces the quality of life for people across the country. That is why the stream protection rule was established. It is there so parents don't have to worry when their kids go play by the stream or go fishing behind their house. It is there so ranchers don't have to worry about a nearby mine that could harm their land, and fishermen don't have to worry if the salmon catch is poisoned or if there are fewer fish because salmon are dying from pollution.  This rule is so communities don't have to worry that their daily lives will be changed because a company is not being responsible and cleaning up after itself. This may surprise some people, but the rule will actually create jobs. People like to talk about how burdensome regulations are, especially in the environmental space, but the truth is, it will not lead to fewer jobs.  The Department of Interior predicted it will actually create hundreds of jobs a year, not take them away. Most of all, it is going to have a real positive impact on the world we live in. Over the next two decades, researchers estimated that the stream protection rule would protect or restore 6,000 miles of streams. That is more than the distance between eastern Maine and my home State of  So if you care about protecting local water supply, if you care about having a place for your kids to go hiking and fishing, if you care about holding everyone to the same standard, then don't let this bureaucratic mumbo jumbo get in the way. This rule was created to fix a specific problem, and repealing it could effectively exempt mountaintop coal mining from modern regulation indefinitely.  This is a very important point that has to be made about Congressional Review Act votes. We are going to have a slew of them over the next probably 2 or 3 months. Here is the thing about a CRA vote because it gets rather technical. It is not just overturning a regulation. The way the law works, is that not only is the regulation overturned but an administration can never touch this issue again. We can't do anything that is ``substantially similar.''  So if you want to do something about the stream protection rule, make a law; override the rule that was just made and craft legislation. You have a working majority in both Chambers, work with the bipartisan group. You have four or five Democrats who voted for the Let's legislate.  What is going to happen when the CRA vote succeeds is we are never going to be able to touch the question of pollution from mountaintop removal again--literally. That is how CRA works. So every time we have a CRA vote, it is not just whether you like the particular rule and want to overturn it, it is whether you never want to touch this subject matter again. That is a rather serious threshold that we have to come through.  We are going to do a lot of I know everybody on the Republican side is raring to go to sort of undo all the rules that were done under the Obama administration. Fair enough. We understand. You have the You have both It is certainly your prerogative to take up all of these CRAs, but be careful because you are not going to be able to touch these issues again. You are forfeiting your prerogative to touch these issues again.  So for the sake of public health and in order to leave a better world for our kids, we need to keep this rule in place.

14276,topic-id,1268,"Mr.President, before I get into the substance of my remarks, I was listening to our Republican leader talking about compromise--not that he ever engaged in very much of it when he was leader last year--but compromise requires something to compromise over. We have nothing from the administration, nothing on infrastructure, nothing on trade, nothing even on  You want to sit down and talk? Let's see what your plans are. See if you can get your own act together before you are pointing the finger at  The President's speech--let me say this: This President's speech was detached from this President's reality. The President, in this speech and in so many others, talks like a populist. He talks to the working people of America and promises them things. When he governs, it is nothing like that at all. He is favoring the very powerful special interests, making their lives easier, and putting more burdens on the backs of the middle class and people trying to get to the middle class.  A metaphor for this was his speech at the inauguration. He gave a speech--also aimed at the working people--and within an hour after that, he signed an Executive order that helped the banks and added about $500 to the mortgage of every new homeowner.  You can't just talk the talk, Mr.You have to walk the walk. On issue after issue, we haven't seen anything--or negative things for the working class.  We heard about infrastructure. A month ago, the Democrats put together an infrastructure plan of $1 trillion. It was a strong plan. It has a lot of support throughout the country.  Where is the President's infrastructure plan? We haven't heard a peep about it. Some of his White House folks leaked that we will not get to infrastructure until next year. Mentioning it in a speech--infrastructure--is not going to employ a single new worker.  What about trade? The President talked about trade, putting America first. My views tend to be closer to President Trump's than they were to President Bush's or President Obama's on trade. Again, what we hear in the speech and what the President actually does are contradictory.  Throughout his campaign, the President took an issue near and dear to my heart and to the heart of Senator Graham of South Carolina--China manipulating its currency. He had said over and over again in the campaign: On the first day I am President, I will sign an Executive order that labels China a currency manipulator.  They are. We know they manipulate their currency, and it has cost America hundreds of thousands, if not millions of good-paying jobs and caused a load of wealth to flow from our country to theirs.  This one didn't require congressional approval. This one didn't require a single Democrat to join in. All the President had to do was sign the order. We are now 40 days into this administration. Not only has he still not signed the order, but he is saying he may back off.  Last night, the President talked about research, wiping out rare diseases. Yet with the budget they proposed, given that they want to slash domestic discretionary spending by tens of billions of dollars and exempt veterans and Homeland Security, there is no alternative to the fact that the President in his budget, at the same time he is talking about medical research, is going to slash it.  He talked about the great issue of education. The same thing: His budget is going to slash education to smithereens, hurting our students, hurting our teachers, hurting our schools.  Perhaps the most hypocritical of all was draining the swamp. That was one of the President's main themes when he was President-elect: Drain the swamp. Look who is in his His Secretary of Treasury, his Secretary of Commerce, and his NEC adviser are from Wall  Is this the same man who said that we are going to go after Wall Street if we get elected? Wall Street is running the economic show. The Cabinet is filled with bankers. The Cabinet is filled with billionaires, not people who feel for the average In fact, if you add up the net wealth of his Cabinet, it has more wealth than one-third of the American people total--close to 100 million people. That is cleaning the swamp? Give me a break.  The problem with the President's speech is very simple: His actions don't match his words. His words in the campaign are not matched by his actions. His words in his inaugural speech are not matched by his actions, nor are his words in his speech last night.  It was so funny that he spoke to a bunch of cosmopolitan news anchors, and he mentioned that maybe he will change his views on immigration. The media got into a buzz about that. Then, the speech he gave was one of the most virulently anti-immigrant speeches that we have heard any President ever give. He is saying one thing, doing another.  It is not the hypocrisy that bugs us, although it is there. It is the fact that he is not helping middle-class It is the fact that he is not making it easier for more people to travel and get into the middle class because he seems to have governed from the hard, hard right. The hard right is very far away from where the average American is.  Mr.Mulvaney's idea of a budget--maybe 10 percent of America, mostly ideologues, would support it. It is even far away from where the average Republican is. Yesterday, when the President proposed his budget, we had one of my colleagues on the Republican side saying it is dead on arrival. We had the majority leader saying that you can't cut the State Department foreign aid in half. He is far over, and that is hurting him and hurting us, hurting the American people.  The first 40 days have been a pretty rough 40 days for President It hasn't worked out very well. Why? It is not because he hasn't given a few good speeches. It is because he is governing from the hard right. He is governing far away from what the American people want. He is governing way off to the extreme.  A speech isn't going to change that. A speech isn't going to create one job or one infrastructure plan or one trade law that makes our trade laws, which need to be changed, fairer. No, no, it takes action. Unfortunately, when the President takes action, it is quite the opposite of what he says in the speech on the issues that affect the middle-class and working-class people.  If President Trump does not change how he governs--how he governs, not what speeches he gives--in the near future, then these 40 days, which have been of tumult, of contradiction, of turning one's back on the working class, will be 6 months and then will be a year and then will be 2 years.  The problem with the Presidency does not lie in the speeches the President gives, even though I might object[[Page S1511]]to a lot of the things he puts in them. It lies in how he governs, and he is not governing well. He is not governing down the middle. He is not governing in a way that lends itself to compromise. We Democrats will continue to hold the President accountable. That is our job. That is what the Constitution says we should do, and we will continue until we see the President change his course in governing. No speech is going to change that or affect that.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgS1510-2.txt,1036,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,1.0,January

On Friday, we saw the outline of the Republican plan. Like every single draft plan that Republicans have come up with, the outline we saw on Friday would raise costs and provide fewer benefits to average Americans and put the insurance companies back in the driver's seat. Average Americans under this Republican plan will get less, and they will pay more.  Today, President Trump is meeting with the insurance companies about this plan. What happened to the President we saw on the campaign trail railing against the special interests? It[[Page S1422]]turns out that the special interests are getting their way at the expense of working Americans--less coverage, higher premiums, fewer sick people insured.  My Republican friends listened to the outcry from their constituents: Don't repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a threadbare health insurance plan that puts insurance companies back in charge.

Mr.Sessions' conduct as U.Attorney, from his politically-motivated voting fraud prosecutions to his indifference toward criminal violations of civil rights laws, indicates that he lacks the temperament, fairness and judgment to be a federal judge.''  ``A person who has exhibited so much hostility to the enforcement of those laws, and thus, to the exercise of those rights by Black people should not be elevated to the federal bench.  ``The irony of Mr.Sessions' nomination is that, if confirmed, he will be given life tenure for doing with a federal prosecution what the local sheriffs accomplished twenty years ago with clubs and cattle prods.''  ``The actions taken by Mr.Sessions in regard to the 1984 voting fraud prosecutions represent just one more technique used to intimidate Black voters and thus deny them this most precious franchise.''  ``In these investigations, Mr.Sessions, as U.Attorney, exhibited an eagerness to bring to trial and convict three leaders of the Perry County Civic League including Albert Turner despite evidence clearly demonstrating their innocence of any wrongdoing.''  ``In fact, Mr.Sessions sought to punish older black civil rights activists, advisors and colleagues of my husband, who had been key figures in the civil rights movement in the 1960's.''  ``Therefore, it is my strongly-held view that the appointment of Jefferson Sessions to the federal bench would irreparably damage the work of my husband, Al Turner, and countless others who risked their lives and freedom over the past 20 years to ensure equal participation in our democratic system.''  Clearly, if these criticisms set forth in this statement--the entirety of which will be made part of the House Record--indicate, as they did to the United States Senate in 1986, that Mr.Sessions should not be a district court judge, they also argue that he should not have been confirmed as Attorney General of the United                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-13-pt1-PgH1101-5.txt,1526,CALIFORNIA WATER INFRASTRUCTURE,2017.0,13.0,February

14317,topic-id,2502,"Mr.President, I want to thank my colleague from Utah and his eloquent comments about the Supreme Court nominee. I would like to associate myself with everything he said. He has the kind of experience and insight that I hope so many Members on both sides of the aisle will listen to.  I am here to talk about the spirit of bipartisanship and getting things done. I submitted an editorial to my local newspaper down in Charlotte a couple of weeks ago. The whole premise of my opinion was that in November the voters did not vote for a Republican mandate; they voted for a results mandate. They are tired of the gridlock they see up here in They are tired of people promising things they know they can't deliver. They are wanting for a leader in President Trump and in the congressional leadership people who want to produce results. They want people who want to work across the aisle and come up with bipartisan solutions to a lot of the problems that confront this  You would have thought that I changed my registration and became a member of the minority party with the criticism that I got from people on my side of the aisle. I was called a For those of you who don't know what that is, that is a Republican in name only.  When I was the speaker of the house in North Carolina, the last thing I was ever called was a We worked on a conservative agenda that made sense. We gained the support of a number of Democrats along the way. North Carolina is a lot better place because of the courage of those folks who were willing to work across the aisle to help our great State, to go from one of the laggards in terms of economic performance to one of the leading States in the Nation for economic performance over the course of about 4 years.  I don't really care about the criticism from the talking heads--from the far left or the far right--because I consider them one of the great threats that we have to actually turning this Congress around and getting things done. I am going to do everything I can to reach across the aisle and produce solutions to some of the most vexing problems we have.  There are solutions within our reach. If you think about immigration reform, there is a 40-year-old failure on the part of the Republicans and Democrats to address the immigration problem. Everybody wants their position on one end of the spectrum or the other versus what the American people want or a solution to the problem--a solution that makes sure the American worker is respected and taken care of, that our borders are secure, and that we end this 40-year-old failure on the part of Washington to solve the problem.  They want solutions on criminal justice reform. We have many people in prison who, after they get out, are more likely to go back into prison because we really haven't thought about commonsense ways to help them enter back into society and have productive lives, beyond just going back into a criminal enterprise. We can solve that problem, but we can only solve it if we have Republicans and Democrats come together--and silence the voices who want their perfect version based on their ideology--on a solution that makes sense to the average  The agenda that we want to complete can only be completed if we have people who have the courage to come to this floor and do what I consider to be political courage. It is not courageous for me as a Republican to stand up to a Democrat and oppose their view. That is my job. I am a conservative. I am a proud conservative. Courage, in terms of someone who would walk onto this floor, is someone who can look at a person--a fellow Republican and conservative--and say: We are not going to go where you want to go because we are here to get something done--not just to make speeches, not to talk about an unachievable goal, but to make progress on things that are sound, conservative policies. But maybe we have to make some compromises. Maybe we have to go a little bit further than we want because we want to get something done. We want to pass things that are good. If we wait to only pass things that are perfect, then we will be guilty of doing exactly what many other people have done in this body--to promise a lot and deliver very little.  I took a lot of hits for my op-ed and my public comments about bipartisanship, about compromise, about respect, about reaching across the aisle. I am willing to take those hits because I would rather go down as someone who is willing to go get something done than someone who is willing to only settle for the perfect, knowing that perfect never happens here. The Founding Fathers didn't expect perfect. The Founding Fathers introduced defects, if you read the Federalist Papers, that[[Page S566]]prevented any one ambition from prevailing. To have ambition set against ambition is foundational to our democratic institution here. We are not going after perfect. We are going to go after good.  I was really excited. I got some great comments from my friends across the aisle. I thought this is an area where we can work together. There are a lot of areas where we can't work together because our world views are so different. Let's not focus on those. Let's focus on things on which we can work together. I thought we had a minority leader who was actually committed to that. At least that is what I thought. But I have to say I am beginning to wonder if we haven't gotten a different sort of view of the leadership. Comments today do not reflect the comments of not so long ago. In 2012, the minority leader said:       Everything doesn't have to be a fight. Legislation is an      art of working together, building consensus, compromise.  I could have written that. I absolutely agree with that principle. That is why I got criticized by folks on my side of the aisle--or the talking heads, anyway, the conservative talking heads--because I wasn't willing to take a purist position.  Now, you fast forward. And the minority leader made this comment when he was not the minority leader. But today this is what we are hearing just within the last month: ``The only way we're going to work with him''--that would be President Trump--``is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues.''  Does that sound like bipartisanship? Does that sound like somebody who wants to reach across the aisle and work on immigration reform, criminal justice reform, sentencing reform--things where I believe there is a majority of people in this body, as many as 60 or more votes--who would be willing to move legislation? I don't think so.  We have to make sure that people like this are accountable to the American people, the so-called real people. I will get to that in a little bit. That is not bipartisanship. That is not leadership. That is divisiveness. That is gridlock. That is the stuff that inspired me to run in 2014. That is the thing I am against, whether it is a Democrat saying it or a Republican saying it.  I think we can also expect more of what really stems--or what you can infer from the latest position of the minority leader, more gridlock. We will go to the next chart. The sort of a double standard here, duplicity, really drives me crazy. Situational ethics I will call it or situational principles. On the one hand, you stand firm on something. You fast forward because you didn't like the outcome of the election, and suddenly you no longer take that same position.  People can rationalize it any way they want to, but I think the real people, the real voters, the folks out there, see this for what it is. It is taking a so-called principled position when that particular position benefits your agenda, not necessarily something that is bipartisan, something that actually serves a political agenda.  The Supreme Court, I think that is what we are going to see here. I have presided. I have been a freshman for 2 years. We get to preside a lot. I get to hear a lot of these floor speeches. I heard endless speeches talking about how we needed to do our job, how we actually--here is another quote from the now minority leader:       The Supreme Court handles the people's business. As      President Reagan put it, every day that goes by without a      ninth justice is another day the American people's business      is not getting done.  Now what we are hearing is that same group of people say they are going to use every lever they can to stop us from seating a ninth Supreme Court What has changed, except for the fact that you are not happy with the outcome of the election? So I think we need to recognize that the American people are sick of Democrats and Republicans promising things, but if they don't get their way in the election outcome, if they are not able to set the agenda, then they are no longer interested in bipartisanship.  I have a lot of confidence in this body. I have a lot of confidence in a number of people on the other side of the aisle. I think there is a pent-up demand among Members here who want to see results--not perfect, but good. I am going to do everything I can to work with those. I will do an equal amount of time focused on those who I don't think are acting in the best interests of their own constituents. They are not listening to the real people in America, the real people who did not endorse a Republican mandate in  They said: It is time to stop. It is time to get things done. It is time to treat people with respect on both sides of the aisle. It is time to accept good, and it is time to stop pretending that this body can produce perfect. Now, I have to say I am glad to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are starting to look at the so-called real people.  Last week, the Republicans were in We were at a retreat. At the same time, there was a group of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who were meeting up in West There was a Politico article that I thought was particularly interesting. This was a part of the published agenda that was reported by Politico, an agenda that says they are getting people together. They want to talk about speaking to those who feel invisible in rural America, listening to those who feel unheard, and a discussion with Trump voters.  There was another entry in the agenda, I believe, that says talking to real people. I am here to talk to the real people tonight. You have Members in the Senate who want to get things done. We know you are hurting. We know the government has failed you, Democrats and We have failed to actually take the tough votes. We have failed to deliver. It is time for us to deliver.  I believe we have a President who expects us to reach across the aisle and solve problems. I am going to be a part of solving that problem. We have a great opportunity here with the Supreme Court nomination. It is time to get past the election results, get over it, and get to work. It is time to recognize that the real people, the people who sent a mandate here--but the mandate was not Republican, it wasn't far right, it wasn't far left--all they said was produce results.  I am going to produce results. I am going to expect my Members to produce results. I am going to go into my conference, when it looks like we are going down the path of taking an intransigent position that does not produce a result, and I am going to call them out. I am also going to hold my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to the same standard.  I am going to hope to find folks who want to solve the immigration problem in a respectful, methodical way. I want to work with people on the other side of the aisle who want to solve the criminal justice problem, the sentencing reform, the judicial reform bills that are moving through that have, I believe, far more than 60 votes to support it.  We have to work on these. We will save the other ones where we simply can't find common ground, and those will be the arguments that we can have that can influence future elections, but for the next 2 years, let's get work done. Let's actually be able to go back to our State and proudly proclaim that we had the courage to stand up to people on our side of the aisle when getting to perfect was at the expense of doing something good.  If we do that, we will have one of the most productive legislative sessions. The 115th Congress could go down in history as one of the most productive Congresses in the last 100 years. I want to be a part of that story. I want to go back to North Carolina and be proud of what I did, proud of the compromises, proud of the bipartisan relationships that we did to solve these problems.  I am going to go to other States who may be up for reelection in 2018 and either thank the Members on the other side of the aisle who worked with us for those solutions or campaign against them because they failed to actually look at their constituents and do the right thing.  There are a lot of opportunities here. I, for one, am going to spend every waking hour to make sure I do my part, and I can be proud of the work I did to produce results, to answer that mandate by the electorate that came in November to produce results.  I have every confidence that there are enough Members here to join us.[[Page S567]]With that, we will do great things. We will fulfill the promises we made. There is nothing more rewarding than being able to look your constituents in the eye and say: We did it. We listened to you. We compromised. We treated people with respect. We delivered.  I call on all my Members to think again about what they can do to be a part of providing the solutions.

14254,topic-id,914,"Mr.President, I think a little background will be helpful. The Social Security Administration has promulgated a rule regarding when its employees should be sending names to be added to the NICS system. The NICS system is the system by which a person, when they are added to it, may not legally possess a firearm.  The rule has been finalized, but it has not yet gone into effect. It is scheduled to go into effect on December 19 this year. I wish to say, I think the rule has the right intention. Under Federal statute, the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 stipulates that every quarter each Federal agency must send to the Attorney General any information it has showing that any person is disqualified from possessing a gun.  Each agency also has the responsibility to correct or update any information it sends to the Attorney There is no question the Social Security Administration has a duty to send information to the NICS system.  The purpose of the rule is to send to NICS the names of individuals who are dangerously mentally ill and thus are not legally entitled to a firearm. There are some protections that are provided in this rule. For instance, under the rule promulgated by the Social Security Administration, a third party cannot get a gun owner declared mentally ill without the gun owner's knowledge or consent. Under this rule, the individual has to file a disability claim for himself or herself.  The rule provides some mechanisms for individuals to challenge their inclusion in the NICS system if they wish to do so. There is serious disagreement and confusion about some other very important aspects of this rule.  For instance, I have heard from advocates for people with disabilities. They are very concerned that the list of mental illnesses, for instance, is to too expansive and might very well sweep in people who have mental health issues but are not at all dangerous to themselves or to others.  These advocates for people with disabilities have also expressed the concern that the rule doesn't require that a medical professional actually be involved in the determination of whether a person is dangerously mentally ill.  These disability rights advocates raise the concern that an agency bureaucrat without any medical expertise could potentially add someone to the NICS system without a doctor being involved and without that person being in any way dangerous.  These advocates also argue that there is not a sufficient process for individuals who are wrongly denied their Second Amendment rights. For instance, under the rule, it appears it could take years for an individual to adjudicate this question if there was a case of mistaken identity or they were deemed to have a mental health issue that they challenged. It could take years for them to resolve. All that time they would be disqualified from owning a firearm. Even if that individual prevailed and it turned out that the Social[[Page S1157]]Security Administration had mistakenly put them in the NICS system, their legal fees would still have to be incurred by the individual, despite the fact that they had no responsibility for this.  I agree something ought to be done in this area, but I am not fully confident this rule gets it exactly right. My preferred outcome here, my ideal, would be for the Social Security Administration to produce a new rule--one that takes into account these legitimate concerns that have been raised, especially by people in the disability rights community. I would look forward to working with the Social Security Administration, and I could very well support such a rule, and I would support such a rule if they addressed these things properly.  I would further say that we have time to do this. As I mentioned earlier, while the rule has been finalized, it has not yet gone into effect. It doesn't go into effect until December 19 of this year. We have over 10 months to reconsider and get this right.  Some have suggested, wait a minute, we will never have a chance to redo this if we pass the Congressional Review Act, which repeals this rule because it will preclude the Social Security Administration from promulgating a new version of the rule.  People say that because the Congressional Review Act states that if we enact this resolution of disapproval ``a new rule that is substantially the same as such a rule may not be issued.''  It is my opinion that a new rule issued by the Social Security Administration that addresses appropriately the concerns I mentioned would certainly not be substantially the same as the current rule. It would be a very different rule. Since it would not be substantially the same, it would be permissible under the Congressional Review Act for the Social Security Administration to correct these flaws and come up with a new rule.  I want to ask the senior Senator from Texas, the majority whip and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is it your opinion that if subsequent to passage of the Congressional Review Act with respect to this rule, if the Social Security Administration promulgated a new rule that met the standards I have set forth, that in that case, the new rule would not be substantially the same as the current rule and therefore would not be precluded by passage of the Congressional Review Act; is that the opinion of the Senator from Texas?

Mr.Halona was born January 1, 1922, in the Chuska Mountains near Tohatchi, His maternal clan was the Ashiihi, Salt People Clan, and his paternal clan was To'hani, Near the Water People He was the son of sheep herders, Barney and Annie One of his sons tells the story of Mr.Halona's mother going into labor with him as she was herding sheep in the middle of winter. She stopped to give birth, outside in the cold, and then went back to herding. He came from strong stock.  This is the second time I have had the privilege to honor Mr.The first was on November 20, 2012, at the Pueblo Indian Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mr.Wilson was a World War II hero, but had not received the recognition he deserved. Almost 60 years after the war, his family worked to make sure he received the acknowledgment and medals he earned for his bravery and service.  Mr.Halona was part of the D-Day invasion. Serving in the Army, he and his fellow soldiers landed in Normandy, on Utah Beach, in July 1944. They were part of the third wave of American soldiers to land, and there were already many casualties scattered on the beach.  Mr.Halona was a gunner. As he and his battalion started moving inland, they encountered heavy gunfire from Germans who were dug into mountaintops along the beach in cement bunkers. The American troops returned the gunfire and fought for over 3 hours before they destroyed two German bunkers. Mr.Halona's battalion stopped further casualties and took control of the beachfront.  They headed to Brussels and then on to Bonn and Luxembourg, where the U.had established a military base. Winter came upon them, and they were snowed in for 4 months. After the snow cleared, the battalion moved to take over Munich, where they saw firsthand the death and destruction of the In Stuttgart, they drove out the Germans, captured Hitler's top generals, transferred them to jail in Nuremburg, and kept guard. Mr.Halona himself guarded Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering for several hours. Mr.Halona credited his Navajo traditions and prayers for helping him during and after the war.  When Mr.Halona was finally given the honors owed in 2012, he received the Good Conduct Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one Silver Service Star, World War II Victory Medal, the Honorable Service Lapel Button WWII, and the Sharpshooter Badge with Rifle Bar I was deeply honored that he asked me to present his medals.  Mr.Halona served the Navajo Nation with distinction as well. He was a member of the Navajo Nation Council for four terms and president of the Tohatchi chapter for eight terms. He was first appointed to the advisory board for the Navajo Housing Authority and then served as its first chair. He was instrumental in developing the housing authority--The Navajo Housing Authority was one of the first tribal housing authorities to be funded by the U.Department of Housing and Urban Development--and making sure that Navajo people had better living conditions. He worked to develop the Indian Health Service within the Navajo Nation and to build schools on the reservation. He even helped create the Navajo rodeo association. Mr.Halona's service to his tribe stretched far and deep.  Mr.Halona was married to his wife, Ruby Arviso, from 1942 until her passing in 2013. He had 7 children, and is survived by 5, along with 16 grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren.

14297,topic-id,1280,"Mr.President, I rise today to oppose President Trump's nomination of Wilbur Ross for Secretary of Mr.Ross is a Wall Street billionaire with a long history of profiting from the suffering of others. He also has shady ties to Vladimir Putin's That is just his record. Because of that record, I do not have confidence that he will protect the interests of the American people as Secretary of  This administration's disturbing ties to Russia have been all over the news. Here is what has been publicly reported as of today.  Our intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian Government conducted a successful series of cyber attacks against the United States designed to help Donald Trump get elected Our intelligence agencies are actively examining a dossier alleging that the Russian Government has collected compromising information on President Trump, and numerous press reports indicate that investigators have already corroborated some of that dossier's contents.  The President's National Security Advisor resigned in disgrace and is the subject of an FBI counterintelligence investigation for his conversations with the Russian Government before the inauguration, conversations that may have been illegal and conversations that he has apparently lied about in public.  Knowingly or unknowingly, the Vice President of the United States has repeated these lies on national television. According to CNN, high-level advisers close to then-Presidential nominee Donald Trump were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to U.intelligence.  CNN confirmed the New York Times' original investigation with ``multiple current and former intelligence law enforcement and administration officials.'' Our allies documented regular calls between the Trump campaign and the Russians, confirming the reports of U.intelligence agencies. According to reports published in Newsweek, ``the British government obtained information that people acting on behalf of Russia were in contact with members of the Trump campaign.''  Many news outlets have reported on U.intelligence worries that NATO allies will no longer share sensitive information because they fear the new administration could share it with When asked about the regular points of contact between Russian intelligence operatives and his most senior campaign staff, President Trump refused to take the question seriously. He claimed the multiple reports of staff communications with Russian were ``fake news.''  Behind the scenes, Trump's chief of staff was pressuring the FBI to help cover up the links between Russia and the Trump campaign. We are 1 month into the Trump I wish this were not happening. I wish things were normal, but this is not normal. It is shameful if we ignore all of it as we evaluate the President's nominees to critical foreign policy and national security jobs.  In this context, Mr.Ross's connections to Russia raise dangerous issues. We know that Ross installed a former KGB official and close associate of Vladimir Putin as the vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, a bank that Mr.Ross controlled and a bank that was flooded with Russian money. Now, how closely connected was this former KGB official to Vladimir Putin? Here is one hint. He was so closely connected to Putin that he was given a $100 million payout by a Russian-controlled mining company as a golden parachute. He wasn't even the only Putin pal on Mr.Ross's board. That is right. Mr.Ross wanted the bank he controlled to have multiple board members from Putin's inner circle.  Mr.Ross surrounds himself with Russian oligarchs, and he has invested financially in their success. As he explained during his testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, Mr.Ross has no intention of divesting from Diamond Shipping, a company that operates 33 oil tankers and jointly charters with even more. So a man who personally selected multiple Vladimir Putin associates to serve with him on the board of the bank he controls has been totally open about his plan to continue profiting from oil tankers shuttling over $1 billion worth of crude oil through international waters while serving as Commerce  It is not just one shipping company. Mr.Ross is retaining his investments in 11--11 separate entities, mostly private companies registered in the Cayman Among his retained interests, the state-owned China Investment Company will be one of Mr.Ross's largest fellow investors.  We have never seen a Cabinet like this in history. Like many of President Trump's other nominees and like President Trump himself, this nominee seems to see his time in public service as a chance to increase his own wealth. In other words, on any given deal, he might be working for the American people or he might just be working for himself. We will have no way to know.  President Trump has apparently asked Mr.Ross to lead American trade policy. He claims to want aggressive enforcement of antidumping and currency manipulation rules, which sounds great, but when Ross actually has this job, is he really going to be thinking about American workers or will he be thinking about how to make his KGB buddy from the Bank of Cyprus just a little richer or will he be thinking about how to help out his own oil tankers circling the globe or will he be thinking about his offshore companies and his coinvestors from China or will he be thinking about the next billion dollars he plans to make?  The American people should not be left guessing about who Mr.Ross will be working to protect. There is significant reason to believe the President of the United States has substantial financial ties with Russia, but nobody actually knows any of the details because he has failed to reveal his tax returns.
