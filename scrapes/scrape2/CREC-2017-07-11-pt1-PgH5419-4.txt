 UTILIZING UAS FOR INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND DISASTER 
                                 RELIEF

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, during the full committee markup of the 
fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the House Armed 
Services Committee came together to produce a strong bipartisan bill 
that will ensure investment in and oversight of our military. We also 
recognized how valuable the Department is to international humanitarian 
assistance and disaster relief efforts as well.
  During markup, I offered an amendment that will require the 
Department to assess the viability of unmanned aircraft systems in 
support of international humanitarian aid missions. Although it is well 
understood that the DOD has operated UAS platforms effectively for over 
a decade in offensive roles, I believe it is also important we 
recognize the capabilities of UAS platforms to increase the speed and 
quality of response forces providing disaster relief and medical 
assistance to those suffering around the world. Think of critical 
disaster efforts, whereby vital medicine and supplies are needed 
quickly. UAS could very well make all the difference between life and 
death.
  I am pleased that this amendment was adopted during markup, and I 
thank my colleagues for their support of this endeavor.
