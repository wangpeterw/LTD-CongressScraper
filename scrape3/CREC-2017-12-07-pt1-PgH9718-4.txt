                              GOP TAX SCAM

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this holiday season the 
Republican majority has been working overtime on a tax plan that gives 
permanent tax cuts to wealthy families and corporations funded by 
raising taxes on middle class families.
  As the Republican majority tries to disguise its tax plan as a 
beautifully wrapped gift, the American people need to know that there 
are negative healthcare effects hidden inside the plan.
  By passing this tax plan, there would be automatic cuts to Medicare 
to the tune of $25 billion a year. In addition, this plan could cause 
an extra 13 million people to become uninsured. The tax bill will 
explode our debt or will cut Medicare and Medicaid.
  It has been more than 2 months since Congress should have 
reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program and federally 
qualified health centers. This is the first time in history that these 
programs have been held hostage to the legislative process.
  Instead of racing to reauthorize these popular bipartisan programs, 
the Republican majority instead has neglected children across the 
country solely to provide tax cuts to corporations and wealthy 
individuals.
  Mr. Speaker, this plan is not for the many, but it is only for the 
few.
