           WISHING LIEUTENANT JEFF NEVILLE A SPEEDY RECOVERY

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, in my hometown of Flint, 
Michigan, there was a violent attack on a police officer at Flint 
Bishop International Airport. And like many in my community, I am 
shocked and horrified by this cowardly attack.
  My thoughts are with injured officer, Lieutenant Jeff Neville, and 
his family; and I am relieved that he is in stable condition. He is 
expected to recover. I have known Jeff for decades, dating back to our 
service together in county government. He is a true public servant, and 
he is deeply committed to the community that he serves.
  His actions to subdue the attacker, even while he was under attack, 
are truly heroic. He helped save others from potential harm.
  I also want to thank those individuals who put themselves in harm's 
way to help Lieutenant Neville, including the Bishop chief of police, 
Chris Miller, and an airport maintenance worker who stepped in, Richard 
Cruell. Their actions saved lives.
  I am thankful that the FBI, the Michigan State Police, the Flint 
Police, and other agencies are investigating this terrible attack as a 
potential incident of terror.
  I just hope all my colleagues will join me in extending their prayers 
to Lieutenant Neville and his family in hopes for his speedy recovery.
