                      CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, technology connects the 
world in ways like never before. From everyday conveniences at our 
fingertips to improved communications, technology plays an ever-
increasing role in our lives.
  We are becoming more dependent on applications, or apps, and the 
students of today will become the leaders of tomorrow by developing 
such technology. That is why my office is proud again to participate in 
the Congressional App Challenge.
  This competition allows K-12 students from across the country to 
practice their code-writing skills by developing an app. Winning apps 
will be displayed in the Capitol Building later this year.
  The 2015 winner from my office, Lachlan Campbell, created an app to 
store recipes and discover new dishes. I am proud that this State 
College student was able to show off his talents in our Nation's 
Capitol.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that students from across Pennsylvania's 
Fifth Congressional District will put their skills to work, create an 
app, and submit it to the Congressional App Challenge.
  Submissions will close on November 1, and I can't wait to see what 
our students create.
