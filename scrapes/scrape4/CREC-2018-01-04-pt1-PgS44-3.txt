                       TRIBUTE TO JUNE RYCHALSKI

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct 
honor of recognizing June Rychalski for her service with the Montana 
Department of Military Affairs. She has served Montana with grace, 
diligence, a positive attitude, and genuine care for the people of the 
Treasure State.
  During her 35 years of service, June has been secretary to the senior 
Army adviser, administrative assistant to the adjutant general, and 
next month will complete her career with the Montana Veterans Affairs 
Division. June demonstrated compassion and professionalism on a daily 
basis. Her ability to help a grieving family member navigate the 
challenges of veteran burial honors or steer a distressed veteran in 
the right direction to attain benefits is highly commendable. Her 
presence in the Montana Department of Military Affairs will be missed, 
but the mentorship she provided agency personnel over the years will 
ensure that her legacy endures. To her coworkers, June was regarded as 
their greatest advocate.
  When June retires, she plans to do what she has always done: continue 
to take good care of others. At age 83, June's example is inspiring. 
Her work ethic, compassion, and commitment to excellence represent the 
best of Montana values.
  Thank you, June, for your service. I wish you the best in retirement 
and appreciate all you have done for our State.
