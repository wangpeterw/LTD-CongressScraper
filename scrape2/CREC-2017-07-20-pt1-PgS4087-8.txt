                               HEALTHCARE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the President for having our 
conference over to the White House yesterday. The President and his 
administration understand the American people are hurting under 
ObamaCare. They have been long engaged in the effort to bring relief. 
Nobody could have been more involved in this effort than the President, 
the Vice President, and the entire team, with numerous phone calls and 
meetings. They have been all in, and I want the President and his 
entire team to know how much we appreciate their deep involvement in 
this and their commitment to getting an outcome.
  Dealing with this issue is what is right for the country. The fight 
to move beyond the status quo of ObamaCare was certainly never going to 
be easy, but we have come a long way, and I look forward to continuing 
our work together to finally bring relief.
  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
