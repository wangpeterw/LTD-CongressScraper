                         HONORING BILLY GRAHAM

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege today to rise to honor the 
life of America's pastor. Last week we mourned the loss of Reverend 
Billy Graham, who passed away at the age of 99 in his beloved home of 
North Carolina.
  As one of the most influential pastors of the 20th century, Reverend 
Graham traveled the world to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ to 
millions of people. In fact, he preached to more people than anyone who 
has ever lived.
  As a young man, I have very fond memories of my family all coming 
together to sit in front of the television to watch Reverend Graham's 
crusades. His message of God's love, mercy, forgiveness, and justice 
deeply influenced not only me but also many in our Nation's history. In 
today's day and age, we desperately need another Billy Graham to give 
hope to a deceived, confused, and hopeless populace.
  Reverend Graham preached the truth. He lived it. And we know that the 
truth will set us free. But more importantly, Billy Graham has heard 
the words from the Savior of the world: Well done, my good and faithful 
servant.
  Billy Graham will be sorely missed, but his memory will live on in 
the hearts and minds of those millions of people he helped. And as 
Billy Graham would say, all glory be to God.
