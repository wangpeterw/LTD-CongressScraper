MOURNING THE DEATHS OF FOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM YORK COUNTY, 
                             SOUTH CAROLINA

  (Mr. NORMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. In the 
early morning hours of Tuesday, January 16, four law enforcement 
officers were ambushed while responding to a domestic call in York 
County, South Carolina.
  Mr. Speaker, Detective Mike Doty, who had been with the York County 
Sheriff's Office for 12 years, was slain in the line of duty.
  Today, Detective Doty will be laid to rest, and our hearts grieve and 
mourn at the loss of one of our bravest. Our hearts especially ache for 
all his loved ones: James, Katherine, Joshua, Patricia, Michelle, 
Christina, Diana, Shane, and his twin brother, Chris, who served with 
him. They will continue to remain in our prayers.
  In the Gospel of Matthew 5:4, we are told that God heals the 
brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. May we take solace in this 
verse and always remember that the Lord is with us.
  May God bless the family of Michael Doty.
