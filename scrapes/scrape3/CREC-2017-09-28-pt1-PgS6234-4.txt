                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1894

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at 
the desk, and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1894) to exempt Puerto Rico from the coastwise 
     laws of the United States (commonly known as the ``Jones 
     Act'').

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and, in 
order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule 
XIV, I object to my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be 
read for the second time on the next legislative day.
