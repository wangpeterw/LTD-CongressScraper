          CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF MONSIGNOR FRANKLYN CASALE

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career 
of Monsignor Franklyn Casale, who will retire this coming spring after 
serving as president of St. Thomas University for the past 24 years.
  Monsignor Casale has led an exemplary life of service, including many 
leadership positions. In south Florida, we are most thankful for the 
monsignor's distinguished presidency of St. Thomas, which included the 
expansion of campus facilities, positioning the university as a leader 
in the fight against human trafficking, and the establishment of the 
university's first doctoral program.
  During his tenure, Monsignor Casale created a legacy of committed 
service, which transformed St. Thomas into one of the Nation's leading 
universities, and prepared thousands of his graduates to become leaders 
in their fields.
  Once again, congratulations, Monsignor Casale, on a well-deserved 
retirement and on a remarkable career advancing St. Thomas' legacy of 
academic achievement and spiritual development. Your lifelong emphasis 
on Catholic values, diversity, and student success has helped empower 
many students to take on the world with compassion and strong 
conviction.
  ``Congratulations, my friend,'' ``Felicidades, mi amigo.''
