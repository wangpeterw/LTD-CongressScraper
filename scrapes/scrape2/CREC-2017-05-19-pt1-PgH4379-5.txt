                              COMMON SENSE

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, the Republican healthcare repeal bill is 
a giant step backwards. It will leave millions of Americans without any 
insurance and many more paying more money for less coverage. Worse, it 
will reduce protections requiring insurers to treat fairly those of us 
with preexisting conditions.
  Instead of this disastrous plan, we should be working together to 
improve healthcare, building on the progress of the ACA, and finding 
solutions to what isn't working.
  Let me offer one example. I recently introduced the Common Sense 
Employer Notification of Special Enrollment Act, or Common SENSE Act. 
This bill would require employers to inform people leaving a job that 
they not only qualify for COBRA but also qualify for a special 
enrollment period to purchase insurance on the ACA marketplace or 
enroll in Medicare, which is often less expensive than COBRA.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill will help Americans save money and seniors 
avoid last-minute enrollment penalties. I urge my colleagues to support 
the Common SENSE Act and join me in finding commonsense ways to improve 
our healthcare, not to dismantle it.
