                         TRIBUTE TO TED HAMPTON

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to 
congratulate Ted Hampton, of Knox County, KY, who was named the 2017 
Man of the Year by the Knox County Chamber of Commerce during an event 
at Union College's student center. For more than 50 years, Ted has 
served as the CEO of Cumberland Valley Rural Electric Cooperative. At 
his hiring, Ted was one of the youngest distribution managers in the 
country. Now, he has the distinction of being the second longest 
serving in the country.
  Throughout his tenure leading the organization, Ted has overseen the 
building of a new headquarters, a branch office, and the hiring of 
hundreds of employees. One of his colleagues spoke highly of Ted's 
service, saying his greatest accomplishment has been keeping his 
employees as safe as possible.
  At the awards ceremony, Ted was joined by his wife, Margie, and their 
8-year-old granddaughter Tori. During his remarks to accept the award, 
Ted warmly acknowledged all of his coworkers for their work to serve 
the area. I would like to join the Knox Country community on 
congratulating Ted on this award, and I urge my colleagues to join me.
