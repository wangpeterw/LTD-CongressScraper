      CHINA SHOULD TAKE THEIR CRIMINAL ILLEGALS BACK OR LOSE VISAS

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Qian Wu was held up at knifepoint and 
brutally assaulted. Her attacker, a Chinese citizen who was illegally 
in America, was captured and sent off to prison for the assault. He 
should have been deported as soon as he finished his sentence, but 
China would not take back the outlaw. So, under American law, the 
attacker could not be held indefinitely in our prison and was turned 
loose on American streets. As soon as he was released from prison, he 
tracked down Qian Wu and murdered her.
  Mr. Speaker, the law requires that a person who illegally enters the 
United States and is ordered deported must be repatriated to their 
native country. The lack of cooperation from countries that refuse or 
delay repatriation allows criminals like Qian Wu's killer to remain in 
America and commit more crimes.
  My bill, the Timely Repatriation Act of 2017, restricts diplomatic 
visas to countries that deny the repatriation of criminal aliens 
deported from the United States. Countries like China must take back 
their lawfully deported criminal citizens or pay the price of losing 
diplomatic visas.
  And that is just the way it is.
