                       TRIBUTE TO CLARENCE FLOYD

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today I would like to recognize the 
efforts of Clarence Floyd, a proud Korean war veteran, from Pulaski 
County, KY. At the age of 84, Clarence still works to serve his 
community, taking up a campaign to erect reserved-parking spaces for 
area veterans. These signs are a salute to the men and women who served 
our Nation in uniform.
  As the honor guard commander of Somerset's American Legion Post 38, 
Clarence cares deeply about America's veterans. To arrange reserved-
parking spaces for veterans, Clarence works with local businesses and 
the city of Somerset's street department. Then, he and his wife, Nancy, 
install the signs themselves. He says, ``It takes me about 20 minutes 
to put up two signs.''
  To date, there are 10 locations with veterans-only parking throughout 
Pulaski County. Clarence is also working with other local businesses to 
install more in the near future. I would like to thank Clarence for his 
service to our country and to his fellow veterans, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to join me in doing so.
