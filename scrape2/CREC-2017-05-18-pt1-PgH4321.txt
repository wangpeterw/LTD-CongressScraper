                              WESTERN WALL

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Banks) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, President Trump will 
embark on his first international trip as our Commander in Chief. I am 
very pleased to see that one of the first countries our President will 
visit is Israel, a nation that is a cherished American ally and a 
beacon of freedom in a troubled region.
  This visit comes at an important time, as recent comments by an 
administration official created uncertainty as to whether the U.S. 
Government considers the Western Wall to be within Israeli territory. 
Located in the heart of Jerusalem's Old City, the Western Wall is one 
of the holiest sites in the world and a place where millions have 
gathered to pray and seek the presence of God.
  Jewish tradition teaches that the Western Wall was an integral part 
of the Temple Mount and has been an important site in Judaism for more 
than 2,000 years.
  It is vital that the United States Government recognize the Western 
Wall as part of Israel and that the President should affirm that 
position during his upcoming trip. I am hopeful that recognizing the 
Western Wall will be part of a process to formally recognize Jerusalem 
as the capital of Israel.
