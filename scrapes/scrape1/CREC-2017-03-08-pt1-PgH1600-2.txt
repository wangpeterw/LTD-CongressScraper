                          COACH STEVE CHAPMAN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Farenthold) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Speaker, today I am here to congratulate 
Calallen High School baseball coach Steve Chapman on his recent 
induction into the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame.
  Coach Chapman was born and raised in Hallettsville, Texas. After 
graduating from Hallettsville High School, he attended Blinn College 
and the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor, where he received a degree in 
education. After graduation, he began his coaching career at Victoria 
Stroman High School as an assistant coach. In 1983, he became head 
baseball coach at Calallen High School.
  In Coach Chapman's 33 years at Calallen, his Wildcats have won or 
shared 25 district championships and have been to the Region 4 finals 
19 times. The Wildcats have reached the UIL State tournament on 12 
occasions, played in the State championship game 8 times, and have won 
3 State championships. Coach Chapman's overall record is 967 wins, 204 
losses, and 2 ties.
  Coach Chapman's induction into the Hall of Fame is a testament to his 
hard work and the thousands of lives he has touched while coaching the 
Wildcats, including my long-time legislative director, Blake Adami. I 
offer my congratulations to Coach Chapman, his family, and everyone at 
Calallen.
