      MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING FORMER CONGRESSMAN JERRY KLECZKA

  (Ms. MOORE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise, along with the Wisconsin delegation, 
to honor the former Congressman, Jerry Kleczka, my predecessor, who 
passed away on October 8, 2017, at the age of 73.
  He was a very serious, hardworking legislator who served on the Ways 
and Means Committee. He had a strong work ethic. He was a particularly 
fantastic steward of our seniors, and he was proud to serve the people 
of Wisconsin's Fourth Congressional District.
  I am pleased to stand here with my colleagues from the Wisconsin 
delegation to honor his service to our Nation, to the State of 
Wisconsin, and to the Fourth Congressional District, and I ask our 
colleagues to join us in a moment of silence.
