                      RECOGNIZING ANTONIO PAGLIARO

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Antonio Pagliaro. 
Antonio recently lost his battle to cancer, leaving behind his wife, 
Nicole, their children, Alexis, Antonio, and Kylie, as well as his 
parents, Tony and Richetta, and his brothers, Peter and Michael 
Pagliaro.
  As a graduate of the T.R. Proctor High School class of 1999, Antonio 
began his professional destiny and purpose in life to help people in 
need by serving in the emergency medical services industry. His passion 
was to provide critical help and comfort to those in need, especially 
in his hometown in the city of Utica, New York.
  Antonio was a paramedic supervisor with Kunkel Ambulance for 15 
years. He was also a 10-year volunteer with the Schuyler Volunteer Fire 
Department.
  Antonio was a courageous public servant who served our community 
selflessly. He put his life on the line every single day for the 
betterment of all of us.
  Along with being a dedicated public servant, Antonio was a passionate 
cook, number one dance dad, a gardener, and a parishioner of the Church 
of Our Lady of Lourdes, and so much more.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Antonio Pagliaro, a true 
hometown hero. Our community is lucky to have had such a selfless, 
loving person as Antonio, and we wish his family prayers and positive 
thoughts to the entire family from all of us and my colleagues.
