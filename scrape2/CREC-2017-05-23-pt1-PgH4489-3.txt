                           HUMAN TRAFFICKING

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of millions of 
people worldwide, whose lives have been irreparably harmed by the 
scourge of human trafficking.
  Tragically, human trafficking is a $32 billion industry. This 
horrific practice is often difficult to detect, yet there are nearly 21 
million victims of human trafficking throughout the world each year. It 
is estimated that 55 percent of these victims are women and young 
girls.
  Sadly, most incidents of human trafficking go unreported, while the 
victims suffer in silent pain. It is for these reasons that we must 
raise awareness of this terrible practice and work to combat the 
growing threat against these vulnerable people.
  As a member of the State assembly, I championed bipartisan measures 
to combat this modern-day form of slavery, including the Trafficking 
Victims Protection and Justice Act.
  Yesterday, to continue this fight, I worked alongside my colleagues 
in the House to pass bipartisan measures to eliminate the scourge on 
humanity at the Federal level, and also today.
  Millions of men, women, and children are suffering at the hands of 
human traffickers and sex abusers. Thus, it is our duty to hold those 
who commit these vile acts accountable and to ensure justice for all.
