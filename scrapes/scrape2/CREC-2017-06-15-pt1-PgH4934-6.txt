  LOVE NOTE TO MADISON AND HARRISON SCALISE AND SPEEDY RECOVERY TO ALL

  (Ms. SPEIER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to join with all of my 
colleagues in recognizing the heroism of David Bailey and Crystal 
Griner, wishing them a speedy recovery, and that they take time to 
recover emotionally as well.
  I also want to extend a love note to the children of Steve Scalise. 
This is a love note to Madison and Harrison:
  Father's Day is on Sunday, and I know for both of you it is going to 
be

really difficult because dad is in the hospital, and you are concerned 
about his well-being. He loves you very much, and he is beloved here in 
this Chamber. Know that he will recover. He will be able to read with 
you and play ball with you. And what he needs most from you on this 
Father's Day is just to have you there, to hug him, and to love him, 
and to kiss him, and to know that he is the best dad in the world.
  God bless you both.
