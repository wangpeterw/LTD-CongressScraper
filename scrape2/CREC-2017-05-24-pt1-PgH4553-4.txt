                        PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUDGET

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, it has been said that a budget is more 
than a series of statements or line items. It is really a statement of 
your values and of your priorities.
  If that is true, then Donald Trump's anti-working families budget 
shows he doesn't understand the challenges facing honest, hardworking 
Americans. Let's be clear: the Trump budget was written by some of the 
wealthiest Americans for the benefit of the wealthiest Americans.
  This budget is a major setback for the middle class, and it makes 
life even harder for anyone who is trying to punch a ticket to the 
middle class.
  This budget eliminates hundreds of millions of dollars for job 
creation, it zeros out funding for workforce training and good-paying 
manufacturing jobs, and it makes it even harder for young people to 
succeed by cutting teacher training, eliminating afterschool programs, 
and making it harder to pay off student loans.
  The American people deserve better. This is not a budget that any 
Member of Congress should be comfortable supporting.
  Democrats are speaking out today against the Trump budget. It is time 
Republicans do the same.
