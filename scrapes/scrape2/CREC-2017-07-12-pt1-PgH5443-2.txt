           MAJORITY OF VOTERS BACK PRESIDENT'S TRAVEL VETTING

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a recent Politico/Morning Consult 
poll shows that 60 percent of registered voters support ``new 
guidelines which say visa applicants from six predominantly Muslim 
countries must prove a close family relationship with a U.S. resident 
in order to enter the country.'' Only 28 percent oppose. Also, 
respondents trust Republicans in Congress more than Democrats to handle 
the issue of immigration.
  The new, nationwide poll demonstrates strong approval by the 
electorate for the President's effort to keep America safe, despite a 
question slanted to make respondents think his action is based on 
religion.
  Had the question noted that the six nations that require additional 
visa scrutiny were also selected by the Obama administration as 
national security threats, the poll likely would have revealed even 
more support for the new guidelines.
  When it comes to immigration policy, the American people support the 
President.
