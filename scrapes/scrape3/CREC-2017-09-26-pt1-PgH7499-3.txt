       CENTRAL ARKANSAS VETERANS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HELPS HOUSTON

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks we have seen the 
unity, courage, and kindness the American people offered to those 
affected by the destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and now 
Maria.
  Today I would like to take a minute and acknowledge the Central 
Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System in Little Rock, where employees 
extended help to assist with incoming calls from the VA in Houston, 
Texas. All calls were forwarded to Arkansas during the relief efforts.
  While the Little Rock VA usually takes in 200 to 300 calls a day, in 
the days following the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, our VA team in 
Little Rock averaged 2,900 calls a day from those seeking refuge and 
help. Employees worked 8-hour shifts to provide 24/7 service.
  I thank these Arkansans in the Central Arkansas VA for helping our 
neighbors in Texas in their time of need.
