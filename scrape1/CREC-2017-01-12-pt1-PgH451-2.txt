     IN SUPPORT OFNOMINATION OF SECRETARY OF EDUCATION BETSY DeVOS

  (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to voice my strong 
support for President-elect Trump's outstanding choice forSecretary of 
Education, Betsy DeVos.
  A fellow Michigander, Betsy has worked tirelessly on behalf of the 
children of our country, striving to improve educationand return 
authority back to those who know best--parents and the States. Not only 
has Michigan benefited from her efforts, butshe has worked across the 
country to improve test scores and promote the highest level of 
academic achievement. She is committedto not only promoting strong 
schools, but she has also worked on an individual basis by personally 
mentoring children andinteracting with their parents.
  I have no doubt that Betsy will continue to be a strong advocate for 
our children and that she will ensure that oureducation is as it should 
be--the greatest in the world.
