                          SHAME ON REPUBLICANS

  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it is a dark day; $3 trillion in revenue 
cuts, in tax breaks; three quarters of that goes to corporations under 
the premise that they will use that money to employ people. The last 
time they got this kind of a break, 93 percent of the money went to 
stock dividends, buybacks, and executive bonuses, and it will be no 
different this time--squandering America's wealth for the wealthiest 
among us.
  Eighty-three percent of the remainder goes to people who earn over 
$400,000 a year. They are going to trickle down on us, yet again.
  At the same time, there is no infrastructure package. The Trump 
administration, the DOT says, we just don't know where we can find the 
money.
  Well, imagine if they used a fraction of these tax giveaways for 
infrastructure--15,000 jobs per billion invested. We could have had 
$1.5 million with 3 percent of the money they just wasted on these tax 
cuts.
  Shame on them.
