                  CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE WINNERS

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
winning team for the 2017 Congressional App Challenge for the First 
District of Georgia: Cole Goldhill, Luca Dichiera, Joseph Kim, and Ryan 
Cranford.
  Over the last 4 months, 190 Members of Congress hosted the 
Congressional App Challenge in their districts, where students compete 
to code original apps. 4,100 students participated, submitting over 
1,000 original apps.
  The winning team in Georgia's First Congressional District is from 
Richmond Hill Middle School and created the app, ``Wing Finder.'' This 
app enables individuals who enjoy viewing butterflies to find more 
information about those butterflies, comparing their wing colors to a 
database containing numerous facts about them.
  I am proud of these students in Richmond Hill for doing such a great 
job coding and creating this app. Seeing what these students can 
achieve

through technology truly gives me great hope for the future of our 
country.
