                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Lord God, we rejoice because of Your power. We are dependent 
upon You to rescue us from ourselves and from the unseen consequences 
of the challenges we face.
  Guide and sustain our Senators, enabling them to know the joy of 
having You as their sure defense. May Your unfailing love, O God, which 
is as vast as the Heavens, motivate our lawmakers to make faithfulness 
their top priority. Use them to give justice a chance to thrive in a 
threatening world. Lord, infuse them with the spirit of humility that 
seeks first to understand rather than to be understood. May they find 
their strength and confidence in You alone.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
