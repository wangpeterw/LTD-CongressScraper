                  SPRING CREEK TROUT UNLIMITED CHAPTER

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 
Spring Creek Trout Unlimited Chapter located in Pennsylvania's Fifth 
Congressional District for receiving the National 2016 Gold Trout Award 
as the Nation's most outstanding Trout Unlimited chapter.
  The Spring Creek Chapter's conservation and angler science activities 
this year are world class, with more than 1.5 miles of riparian habitat 
planted, 13 in-stream structures built, water quality monitoring, redd 
count and angler surveys totaling more than 4,500 hours. These 
volunteer efforts are valued at more than $210,000.
  Beyond this outstanding conservation activity, the chapter reaches 
into the community, hosting events and activities. The Veterans Service 
Partnership program serves hundreds of veterans, with the power of 
healing and a sense of community.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to joining the members of the Spring 
Creek Trout Unlimited Chapter this Saturday for the 44th annual dinner 
to celebrate the chapter's gold trout award. It is just 1 of 400 Trout 
Unlimited chapters across the country. This outstanding achievement 
shows the power, dedication, and teamwork from local Trout Unlimited 
members.
