          CELEBRATING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF CAROLANN GARAFOLA

  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the public service 
of Carolann Garafola, mayor of Warren Township, New Jersey, as she is 
honored by the Somerset County Federation of Republican Women as the 
recipient of the Millicent Fenwick Award for Outstanding Public 
Service.
  Carolann's service as a public official began on the Warren Township 
planning board 30 years ago. She then became the township 
committeewoman for that township, a post she has held for 20 
consecutive years, 6 as mayor.
  Carolann began her professional career working with special needs 
children in Glen Rock, New Jersey public schools, and is currently in 
her fifth year as executive director of Mt. Bethel Village in Warren, 
an apartment community for adults with autism, developmental 
disabilities, and traumatic brain injuries.
  The Millicent Fenwick Award for Outstanding Public Service is awarded 
to a woman who serves in the tradition of the late Congresswoman 
Fenwick, one with a strong work ethic, high integrity, and a 
willingness to assist those in need.
  I congratulate Mayor Garafola on this well-deserved recognition.
