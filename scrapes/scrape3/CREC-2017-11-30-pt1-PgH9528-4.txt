                       WELCOMING DUCKS UNLIMITED

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome the more than 40 
volunteers from 26 States representing Ducks Unlimited who are on the 
Hill today.
  As an avid outdoorsman and waterfowler myself, as well as a member of 
Ducks Unlimited for over 25 years, I have seen the wonderful firsthand 
benefits this group provides. Ducks Unlimited has conserved more than 
14 million acres of land in its 80-year history, 25,000 of which are in 
my home State of Kansas. I send a big thank-you for all those folks up 
north of us who have done such a great job raising these ducks.
  Work like this is vital to ensuring that the natural resources of our 
land are protected and monitored so that our children and grandchildren 
can come someday to rural Kansas, from Cheyenne Bottoms to the Quivira 
Wildlife Refuge, and enjoy those great outdoor moments.
  I thank the folks at Ducks Unlimited for their work, and I welcome 
them to Capitol Hill.
