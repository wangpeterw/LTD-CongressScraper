                 HONORING THE MEMORY OF CANDICE BOWERS

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Candice 
Bowers.
  Candice was a single mother to her three children: Kurtis, Katie, and 
her recently adopted daughter, Ariel.
  She was a hardworking waitress who was selfless and always ensured 
she was able to take care of her family. Candice had a loving heart, a 
big smile, and an infectious laugh.
  She went to the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas with her best 
friend so she could take some rare time for herself.
  Candice was known for her strength, fierce loyalty, and generosity. 
She would give her last dollar to anyone who was in need.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Candice's family and 
friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas and the whole country 
grieve with you.
