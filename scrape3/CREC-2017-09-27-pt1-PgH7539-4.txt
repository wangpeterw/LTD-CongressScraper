                     IN SUPPORT OF 800,000 DREAMERS

  (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 800,000 DREAMers 
abandoned by this administration. Any doubt about the administration's 
senseless cruelty was put to rest on September 5, when they chose to 
end DACA.
  Immigrant youth and their families fuel our economy and help create a 
more dynamic society.
  Terminating DACA is a heartless and vile act that will upend lives, 
ruin families, and disrupt local economies.
  DREAMers are the embodiment of America's promise, the idea that no 
matter where you are from, the color of your skin, or the God you 
worship, if you come here, believe in our values, work hard, and 
contribute to our country, then you deserve a place here in the United 
States of America. That is what we are fighting for: to keep the 
promise of this great country.
  To my Republican colleagues: you can't profess to support the 
DREAMers yet fail to support the Dream Act. It is time to put up or 
shut up. I call on my colleagues to sign the discharge petition and 
support a clean Dream Act.
