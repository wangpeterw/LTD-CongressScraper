                      CONGRATULATING AYESHA AHSAN

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ayesha Ahsan, a 
resident of Arizona's Fifth Congressional District, who has earned a 
significant achievement: the Congressional Award Gold Medal. Ayesha has 
completed 400 hours of voluntary public service, 200 hours each of 
personal development and physical fitness, and a 5-day, 4-night 
expedition.
  She is one of five Arizonans and only 373 Americans to win this 
prestigious award in 2017.
  Ayesha volunteered at her local hospital in outpatient services, 
where she was responsible for registering patients who needed vital 
tests.
  For her personal development requirement, Ms. Ahsan participated in 
weekly study groups with her friends to prepare for the SAT exam; and 
for physical fitness, she worked out at the local gym. For her 
expedition, she traveled to Sedona, Arizona, where she enjoyed hiking 
and exploration of that town.
  Congratulations to Ayesha on these achievements. By completing the 
benchmarks for this award, Ayesha has learned perseverance and 
diligence, traits that will last her a lifetime.
  I thank her for her example and service to our community, and I wish 
her well with her future endeavors.
