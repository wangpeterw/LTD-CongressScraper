                    HONORING THE LIFE OF MIKE ILITCH

  (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passing of a 
great American, Mike Ilitch.
  Born to Macedonian immigrants on the west side of Detroit, Mike 
Ilitch became one of the most successful businessmen in the history of 
our country. From humble beginnings, he built one of the largest food, 
sports, and entertainment empires of our time. He personified the 
American Dream, a constant reminder that anyone from anywhere who is 
willing to work hard and dream big can enjoy the opportunities in 
America.
  However, he was more than an icon. He was a pillar of our community. 
During our city's most challenging times, he never turned his back. 
When so many others gave up on Detroit, he never lost faith in the 
resilience of the city and the people he loved so much.
  All of us who have enjoyed ``pizza-pizza,'' or Redwings hockey, or 
Tiger baseball, or the Fox Theatre know of Mike Ilitch's success. But 
what we will miss most is Mr. I's kindness, generosity, and compassion 
for others.
