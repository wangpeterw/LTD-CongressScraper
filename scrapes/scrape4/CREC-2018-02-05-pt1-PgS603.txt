                          policy justification

   Finland--RGM-840-4 Harpoon Block II+ ER Grade B Surface-Launched 
   Missiles and RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II Grade B Surface-Launched 
                                Missiles

       The Government of Finland has requested a possible sale of 
     one hundred (100) RGM-84Q-4 Harpoon Block II Plus (+) 
     Extended Range (ER) Grade B Surface-Launched Missiles, twelve 
     (12) RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II Grade B Surface-Launched 
     Missiles, twelve (12) RGM-84Q-4 Harpoon Block II+ ER Grade B 
     Surface-Launched Upgrade Kits, four (4) RTM-84L-4 Harpoon 
     Block II Grade B Exercise Surface-Launched Missiles, and four 
     (4) RTM-84Q-4 Harpoon Block II+ ER Grade B Exercise Surface-
     Launched Missiles. Also included are containers, spare and 
     repair parts, support and test equipment, publications and 
     technical documentation, personnel training and training 
     equipment, technical assistance, engineering and logistics 
     support services, and other related elements of logistical 
     support. The estimated total case value is $622 million.
       This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and 
     national security objectives of the United States by 
     improving the security of a partner nation that has been, and 
     continues to be, an important force for political stability 
     and economic progress in Europe.
       Finland intends to use the missiles on its Hamina class 
     ships, Multirole Corvette ships, and Coastal Batteries. The 
     missiles will provide enhanced capabilities in effective 
     defense of critical sea lanes. The proposed sale of the 
     missiles and support will increase the Finnish Navy's 
     maritime partnership potential and increase regional security 
     capability. Finland has not purchased Harpoon Block II+ ER 
     previously, but will have no difficulty incorporating this 
     capability into its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The principal contractor will be The Boeing Company, St. 
     Louis, MO. The purchaser typically requests offsets. Any 
     offset agreement will be defined in negotiations between the 
     purchaser and the contractor.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will require up to 21 
     U.S. Government personnel to travel to Finland providing 
     support over a period of ten years.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.
