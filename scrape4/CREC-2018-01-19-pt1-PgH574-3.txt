  (Mr. AL GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the many 
people around the country who have supported the cause of impeachment.
  I rise to thank the many Members of the House. Today, 66 voted to 
advance the cause of impeachment. Previously, 58 voted to advance the 
cause.
  I rise to thank all who have been supportive and who are advancing 
the cause to protect democracy, to protect the Republic, and to make 
sure that what we have is never eliminated from the face of the Earth, 
and that is the greatest country on the face of the Earth.
