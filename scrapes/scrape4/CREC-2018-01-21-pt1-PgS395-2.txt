                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God Almighty, who rules and reigns forever, as our lawmakers 
seek to solve the problem of this government shutdown, remind them of 
the miscalculations in our history. Give them the wisdom to remember 
that those who sow to the wind often reap the whirlwind. Provide them 
with the faith to trust You to direct their steps as they discontinue 
the blame game and strive to do the most good for the most people.
  May our Senators be grateful for the opportunity to serve You and 
country in these grand and challenging times.
  We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.
