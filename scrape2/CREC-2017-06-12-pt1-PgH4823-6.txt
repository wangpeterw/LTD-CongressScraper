                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving and gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  Help us this day to draw closer to You so that with Your spirit, and 
aware of Your presence among us, we may all face the tasks of this day 
with grace and confidence.
  Bless the Members of the people's House as they return from a long 
weekend back in their home districts.
  With fascinating and rather dramatic political developments taking 
place around the world, may we Americans remain all the more committed 
to our constitutional form of government. May Your gifts of wisdom and 
insight pour forth on this assembly, so that the wisdom of our Founders 
might be further enhanced by the work being done in this place.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.

                          ____________________
