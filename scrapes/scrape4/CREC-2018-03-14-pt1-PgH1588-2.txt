                          THE WALK UP MOVEMENT

  (Mr. STIVERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, as co-chairman of the House Civility and 
Respect Caucus, I want to talk about something that people aren't 
talking about today.
  There is a movement called the walk up movement, where a lot of kids 
around this country are taking action. They are walking up to the kid 
who sits alone and asking him to join their group. They are walking up 
to the kid who never has a voluntary partner and asking them to be the 
partner. They are walking up to teachers and saying, ``thank you.'' 
They are walking up to people and just being nice.
  Civility and respect is for everyone. It makes a difference in our 
lives. There are a lot of people recognizing a lot of things today, but 
I just want to recognize, today, that the walk up movement is 
constructive, it is helpful, and it is going to change people for the 
better.
