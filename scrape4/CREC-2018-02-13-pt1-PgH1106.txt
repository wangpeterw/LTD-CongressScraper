                        FEBRUARY IS HEART MONTH

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for more than 50 years, we 
have observed February as American Heart Month.
  Heart disease is the Nation's number one killer. During this month, 
we reaffirm our commitment to combating heart disease and educating all 
people about the benefits of a healthy, active lifestyle.
  Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I worked for nearly 30 years 
as a therapist rehab manager and licensed nursing home administrator. I 
understand the unique challenges facing individuals who have suffered a 
stroke or other life-changing injuries. Often, it is a long road to 
recovery. But an active lifestyle can help lower blood pressure, boost 
levels of good cholesterol, improve blood flow, and more.
  Cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and stroke, remains 
the leading cause of death globally with more than 17.9 million deaths 
each year. But by making healthy choices--including a balanced diet and 
regular exercise--individuals can lower their risk for cardiovascular 
disease by as much as 80 percent.
  I hope that Heart Month 2018 inspires more Americans to take control 
of their cardiovascular health and begin a healthy lifestyle journey.
