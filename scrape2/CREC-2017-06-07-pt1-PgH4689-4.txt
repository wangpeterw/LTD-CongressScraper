                       INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today, President Trump visited Ohio to tout 
his infrastructure plan. Well, Ohio needs the good jobs that direct 
national investment in infrastructure could provide, so my Democratic 
Ohio colleagues, Mr. Ryan, Ms. Fudge, Mrs. Beatty, and I sent President 
Trump a letter encouraging him to take a wide view of what 
infrastructure should encompass in States like Ohio.
  We urged the President to consider upgrading our foundational assets, 
such as drinking water systems, our national electric grid, energy 
efficiency, roofing and lead removal in individual homes, plus 
modernizing roads and bridges, our seaports and waterways, our airports 
and rail systems. Indeed, infrastructure investments present the best 
opportunity to revitalize our battered domestic steel industry as well.
  We hope President Trump's infrastructure plan won't lead to more 
broken promises like with his budget, which zeros out assistance for 
our Great Lakes. The President's plan lacks quantifiable specifics, but 
some warning signs are there. Privatization and tax breaks mean bearing 
down more costs on taxpayers through user fees and tolls.
  Mr. Speaker, Americans expect more than showmanship. It is time for a 
real bipartisan jobs and infrastructure plan to help modernize America 
from stem to stern and keep her great for years to come.
