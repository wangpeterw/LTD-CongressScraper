                UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL MARIJUANA INDUSTRY

  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, Attorney General Sessions 
stated we won't be a better, healthier Nation if marijuana is sold at 
every corner grocery store. His Justice Department also signaled that 
it would raid a marijuana industry convention being held on tribal 
lands in my State of Nevada.
  While it is pretty clear that the Attorney General has some other 
problems to worry about now, I would note that his statement and his 
department's actions demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of 
the legal marijuana industry.
  The industry, which is highly regulated in States that have chosen to 
legalize marijuana, does, indeed, face challenges in banking, taxes, 
advertising, security, and working with veterans. These need to be 
addressed by Congress.
  But in the meantime, I invite Mr. Sessions: Come to Nevada. Meet with 
members of the industry. Find out how it really works before you make 
rash decisions about enforcement that will counter the votes of many 
people across this country.
