Each day these Americans go to work willing to put their lives on the line for the security of their fellow  We often hear the remarkable stories of our law enforcement officers. These men and women work long hours and late shifts, often being called into work and called away from their families. These are the people who risk their lives to protect our very neighborhoods, schools, communities, while asking nothing in return.  These professionals exhibit the greatest love of all, and that is to offer their lives to protect another.  I pray for those who have lost their lives, like Sergeant Greg Meagher, a 33-year veteran of the Richmond County Sheriff's Office who lost his life earlier this year in the line of duty. We will never forget his ultimate sacrifice.

9679,topic-id,213,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The purpose of H.1678 is to establish a statute of limitations for FEMA to recover disaster assistance payments. This bill would provide some finality in disaster assistance, and it would minimize administrative costs.  This is a bipartisan issue, and I appreciate my colleagues from Florida for their continued leadership on this issue.  H.1678 reinstates the 3-year statute of limitations on FEMA's ability to reclaim funds when there is no evidence of fraud, waste, or abuse.  In my district, I have seen FEMA tell a community that a project is eligible for funding, allowing the town to move forward to complete a disaster recovery project, only to have FEMA change its mind years later and take the money back. Not only is this devastating to the community and to disaster recovery, but the administrative time and red tape involved in second-guessing is a waste of taxpayer dollars.  Again, my thanks to the gentlewoman from Florida and the gentleman from Florida for their continued work on this issue and for introducing this bill.

9633,topic-id,646,"Mr.Speaker, I listen to my friend from Ohio, and I am just kind of wondering how he gets to his position.  The Affordable Care Act didn't do away with health savings accounts, and that is a fact that can be easily verified. Or the notion that somehow Medicaid is a negative because it was expanded, and the gentleman's own Governor has been arguing here against the Republican plan because it would eviscerate Medicaid provides more healthcare than any other program in  Sadly, what we have seen is that the proposals that have been coming forward are way off the mark, just like my friend from Ohio a moment ago. The claims that it would not cut Medicaid, claims to make the system better, and save the Affordable Care Act from collapse are mythology.  The Congressional Budget Office report--these are the independents scorekeepers, and, in fact, the head of the Congressional Budget Office was appointed by the Republicans, their 49-page report that is available online to any Member of Congress, to the public--pointed out that the health exchanges are not collapsing. They are actually in pretty good shape and they could be made stronger with relatively simple changes, because what we have seen for the last 7 years, the Republican plan has been to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, to make it worse, to create more uncertainty. Recently, the administration refused to advertise to help people join this year's enrollment period and eliminated enforcement of the mandate, making the market even more unstable.  How do we have such an alternative universe?  Well, I suggest that one of the problems is that my friends on the Republican side of the aisle who crafted the House bill and who are working in secret in the Senate crafting the Senate bill listen to the wrong people. They listen to a small group, some of whom benefit from the Republican approach because there are extra subsidies that go to them, or people who benefit from massive tax cuts that, frankly, they don't need. They listen to people who are all about political talking points and not about the facts of healthcare in Most of all, they don't talk to real people on the ground who would be affected.  In what universe is a $773 billion cut over the next 10 years to Medicaid not a reduction?  Tell a 75-year-old widow who is looking at being in a nursing home for the rest of her life--6 percent of our Medicaid funding goes to people in nursing homes. It is almost half of the total funding. Tell them that that is not going to be a cut, that that is not going to reduce services, maybe not make it available at all. Sixty-four percent of people in nursing homes rely on  There are 15 million people who are not going to have healthcare if the Republican proposal goes into effect, according to the objective independent scorekeepers. But you can look at the calculations yourself as a member of the public. The Kaiser organization has a calculator where you can figure out if people are better off under the existing plan or under the Republican alternative. A person in Utah making $15,000 would pay $400 after tax credits, but have a $6,000 deductible. They are not talking to real people.  A situation in Baker City, Oregon, a 40-year-old is going to face a 128 percent increase if the Republican proposal goes into effect.  A 60-year-old woman in Strong, Maine, making almost $40,000 a year is currently eligible for a credit of about $7,000, which means she gets a comprehensive policy in 2020 for $4,500. But the Republican Senate plan would result in her costs in 2020 being $15,000 a year, one-third of her income.  Mr.Speaker, I invite the public to investigate for themselves and see who the Republicans aren't listening to.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-28-pt1-PgH5236.txt,99,HONORING BRIGADIER GENERAL PATRICK D.

Bill's exceptional service to our country in the U.Air Force, his dedication as a public servant in Pennsylvania, and his unwavering commitment to underserved communities throughout his career are worthy of recognition. His contributions to the Commonwealth will never be forgotten.  I ask that the obituary from Gregory Sesler from May 26 be printed in the  The material follows:       Thank you to the hospital care takers, physicians, pastors,      friends, relatives, church community and family.       I was on my way home from the hospital last week after      having just left my father and after the decision had been      made by the family to put him on palliative care. It was      hard, my mother was awesome. A wave of sadness swept over me      as I began to think of all of the things I would soon not be      able to with him again in this world. But then I thought of      all the things we had been able to do together and what a      blessed life he had lived.       Maybe we wouldn't climb Mount Washington together again,      but we did it once. No longer would we sail the Chesapeake,      go iceboating, travel on the German autobahn, see the      Reformation Wall in Geneva, go to Africa to Ngorongoro      crater, or go transatlantic on the QE II, but we had had a      chance to do them all before. We had travelled thousands of      miles and done dozens of business deals together, eaten lunch      together at the Maenerchor Club hundreds of times. No he      wouldn't drive my Jaguar way too fast again, or sail our      Catalina sailboat or visit Civil War Battle Fields or see the      wild horses of the Outerbanks, or see the Northern Lights in      Alberta or the great cathedrals of Europe, or return to      Kenyon College for another reunion or read his letters to the      But we had been able to do all of those things      together.       We got the chance to shoot pheasants in South Dakota, geese      in North Dakota, go to Mexico with his grandchildren, see the      cliffs of Western Ireland, listen to Pavarotti at the Warner,      smoke cigars on the back porch, banter about an article in      the New York times, argue about business decisions, drink too      much wine on a fishing trip in Canada, and enjoy over 50      Christmas parties together.       Although I will never again have to endure his criticism or      crave his praise or chase a bear out of our campsite within      the Smokey Mountains, I have been able to do all of those      things with him.       Although he won't be bursting into my office on December      23rd and having me accompany him to buy an apartment's worth      of furniture for a refugee family, or feeling the pride of      seeing my aged parents volunteer in the homeless shelter, I      did get to do that with him once.       There may be no more deer hunting or trout fishing trips to      Potter County or camping on the Outer Banks, or horseback      riding in the Allegheny Forests, or watching World War II      documentaries or going to James Bond movies on my birthday,      but not everybody gets the chance to create this wealth of      memories and for that chance I have been very blessed.       But while Dad loved to travel and do and experience life in      a very full way, and to share those experiences with his      children and grandchildren generously, it was his transfer of      character, drive, and confidence to us that was his greatest      gift. He also instilled in us an innate curiosity of the      world. We both thank him and curse him for our restless      discursive minds. My mother once said that one of the reasons      she married my dad 59 years ago was because she knew her life      would never be boring. She was right.       My dad was a non-politically correct liberal. He cared for      people and believed in government as an agent of good, but he      wasn't shy about criticizing the slothful or undisciplined.      He wasn't afraid to refer to sloppy or vague thinking as      He admired the great planners who got things done. General      George Marshal was one of those. He was not an admirer of      Donald After William had been in the ICU for four days      and we were able to wean him from the ventilator, he asked      for his New York His first comment when opening the      paper was ``He fired Comey? What the hell!''       I had a special relationship with my dad. After returning      to Erie from law school in 1984 we worked together for 33      years. Logged thousands of miles together, built 15 office      buildings together, had many triumphs and losses, made money      and lost money. We had fights, we had love, and I wouldn't      trade any of it. Thanks Thanks for helping with my kid's      college tuition, thanks for helping me buy a house, thanks      for teaching me about the law and making me a better lawyer.      Thank you for making me a more careful thinker, thank you for      being my business partner, for being the family patriarch and      also a great dad.       He was a man who was confident, direct, capable, and      precise, who valued careful thinking, reasoning and planning,      he could be a tough dad and a demanding boss, and even though      he was often a critic you didn't want to hear, you often knew      in the back of your mind that the criticism was justified.       You were also a patriarch who greatly loved and cared for      your family and were so generous to all of us, monetarily,      intellectually, spiritually, and emotionally--you gave us so      much. You made our lives and the lives of many people who we      will never know so much better with this love, your public      service and the resolve to get things done.

While off duty, Specialist Marteney displayed remarkable selflessness and courage in the rescue and treatment of a fatally wounded civilian.  On May 27, 2017, a motor home traveling in Oak Grove, Kentucky, collided with a civilian building. With complete disregard for his own personal safety, Michael pulled his car over to the site of the accident and rushed to the scene. The front of the motor home was crushed, and Michael saw that the driver had life-threatening injuries to his head and leg.  With gasoline still rapidly spilling from the vehicle, Michael was able to gain access to the passenger side of the motor home and fashion a makeshift tourniquet. Oak Grove Police Officer Sergeant Havens arrived on scene and handed Michael a combat application tourniquet, which he swiftly applied.  Despite the imminence of fire or explosion, Michael went into the back of the motor home to locate a first-aid kit.

9768,topic-id,779,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to act together in a bipartisan fashion to improve the state of our Nation's infrastructure. It is long overdue.  This week is National Infrastructure Week where we recognize the challenges we face in addressing America's transportation systems, its water systems, its ports, its harbors. Sadly, what we have to recognize isn't particularly positive.  This year, the infrastructure grade that we received from America's Society of Civil Engineers, a national organization that is made up of some of the best and the brightest engineers in our country, gave our Nation a D-plus. That is not a good grade. Never has been.  As a matter of fact, this same organization has estimated that, to rectify our Nation's infrastructure, we need to invest over $1 trillion, $1 trillion of new investments, to provide the sort of transportation, water and ports and harbors, that our Nation needs and deserves.  So we must do better than a D-plus. Literally, we are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents made a generation and two ago, and it is an aging infrastructure.  We know from our country's history that the infrastructure projects that move forward most effectively are those combined with local, State, and Federal funding; all the governments doing their part with private participation.  We, in California, are no strangers to infrastructure problems caused by a lack of investment, but we are stepping up to the plate to make the necessary crucial improvements.  In my own district, the counties that I represent, Merced, Madera, and Fresno Counties, have all increased their local sales tax in order to pay for crucial road repairs, new road projects, highways, and other essential transportation needs.  Last month, the California legislature enacted legislation that Governor Brown signed into law to increase the State's gas tax and vehicle fee to pay for roads, bridges, and other transportation improvement projects.  Clearly, these are tough decisions, and they come with policy implications and political risks. I mean, let's face it, it is never popular, whether it is your local, State, or Federal level, to raise taxes to pay for these much-needed improvements, but it must be done. The last time we increased the gas tax nationally was 1994.  In California, Governor Brown's decision to pursue high-speed rail, among other efforts, is a long-term commitment in the 21st century to do what is necessary to create the inner city rail and auto and air transportation, the interconnectivity that comes with that.  There is a reason why we must do this. California has 40 million people today. By the year 2030, it will have 50 million people; the sixth or seventh largest economy in the world.  So why are we not doing this on a national level? It is simple. What is lacking is the political will--the political will to come together on a bipartisan basis. Now is the time for the Federal Government to face this challenge head-on in a bipartisan fashion. And we know we can do this.                              {time}  1030  Not only has the process begun in California, but many other States across the Nation have stepped up to the plate to put in resources to rebuild their infrastructure, and we must get serious about that. President Trump has made a proposal for infrastructure, and I think we need to ensure that that infrastructure proposal also includes water.  Water is critical not just in California but in Western States and throughout the country. We need to significantly improve our water storage or water delivery and our drinking water systems. We have taken initial steps to meet these challenges by acting at the State and Federal level.  In 2014, California passed Proposition 1, which authorized $7.12 billion for water infrastructure projects. Late last year, after hard work by many of my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion, the California delegation passed the Water Infrastructure Improvement Act, or the WIIN Act, that was signed by President Obama last This law authorized vital new water projects across the State, including, in the valley, additional storage at the New Exchequer Dam, and San Luis Reservoir in Merced County, as well as funding for water recycling projects like the North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program, and it will provide 50,000 acre-feet of additional water for both Merced and Stanislaus  Although we have made some significant efforts to improve California's water infrastructure, this first good step indicates that we must build upon that and do more at all levels of government. That is what we must do on a bipartisan level. Let's take President Trump's suggestion and make this a bipartisan effort. This is an opportunity to invest.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgH4318.txt,1774,HONORING PULSE NIGHTCLUB VICTIMS IN ORLANDO,2017.0,18.0,May
9764,topic-id,535,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the servicemembers and civilians who served on Wake Island in World War II, as the last gathering of the Survivors of Wake-Guam-Cavite, Inc., is scheduled to be held in Boise in  Survivors of the defense of Wake Island and their families have held annual reunions and other get-togethers for the last nearly 71 years. Idaho became home to annual reunions of Wake Island survivors and their families. Many of these gatherings have been organized by Alice Ingham, whose husband was on Wake Island, but since many Wake Island survivors have now, unfortunately, passed away, the organization has decided to wind down their reunions, noting, ``We would like to honor all of our Wake men--the living, the deceased, and those who never made it home from the war--with this final reunion.'' The last worker from Idaho, Joe Goicoechea of Boise, passed away this past year.  The astounding Americans who served on Wake Island and their families are lasting examples of courage and resolve. The history of World War II and the bravery of the American servicemembers who fought for our Nation and its allies are familiar parts of our collective national history, but an often overlooked part of this legacy is the service of the civilian workers on Wake Island who were swept into the war. The civilian workers, including many Idahoans, working for Morrison Knudsen Company, building infrastructure on the island, when it was attacked the same day as the attack on Pearl Harbor, immediately became soldiers. Their service cannot be forgotten. I thank all those who have helped keep the memories of those who served on Wake Island alive.  In Veterans Memorial Park in Boise, a memorial honoring Americans who served on Wake Island gives the following account: ``Five hours after bombing Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941, Japanese forces attacked Wake Island, a tiny island midway between Hawaii and The United States was constructing a runway essential for planes to refuel on their way through the area. There were 449 Marines, 68 Sailors, 6 Army Air Corps, and 1146 civilians employed by the Boise-based Morrison Knudsen Company on the island. Approximately 250 of the MK workers were from For 15 days the military and civilians bravely defended the island from the Japanese forces. Wake Island fell to the Japanese on December 23, 1941.  ``Following the battle, 98 civilian construction workers were kept on Wake Island to labor for the When their work was complete, they were forced to dig their own graves before being executed. The remaining defenders of the island, both military and civilian, were taken as prisoners of war by the Japanese and held for 44 months. These brave heroes endured exceedingly harsh conditions, serving as slave labor for the Japanese government in Japan and Many died in captivity. In 1981 the civilian MK employees were granted Veteran status in recognition of their service in the War of the Pacific . . .''  Those who survived and returned home have enriched our communities. Thank you to those who served on Wake Island and their families for the immeasurable service you have given to our country and for your enduring examples of devotion and strength.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-20-pt1-PgS4108-4.txt,250,HONORING PULSE NIGHTCLUB VICTIMS IN ORLANDO,2017.0,20.0,June

9613,topic-id,410,"Mr.Speaker, as I stand here tonight before you, in my hometown of Orlando, thousands of people are gathered at Lake Eola Park like they were 1 year ago to mourn, honor, and pay tribute to the 49 lives we lost on January 12, 2016. We were with them earlier today. We would love to be with them tonight, as we were last year, but we are here doing the job we were elected to do.  I am joined tonight by my colleague--I am absolutely honored to serve with him--Representative Darren We stand here tonight on the floor of the House of Representatives together so the world will not forget the lives we lost in the Pulse nightclub shooting.  It was supposed to be like any other Saturday night for the men and women inside the Pulse nightclub. I can only imagine the excitement they shared that evening as they celebrated birthdays and friendships. Mr.Speaker, they were out for what my bishop likes to call late-night fellowship.  Then, at 2:20 a.m., when everyone was closing their tabs for the night and about to head home, it was then that an ISIS-inspired gunman, motivated by hate, walked into the club and opened fire. Within a matter of minutes, he was able to kill 49 people and wound so many others. The innocent men and women in the club didn't stand a chance against him that night.  We lost 49 lives. Their full potential will never be known, and we will always wonder, when we think about their lives, what could have been. Many others continue to recover from their visible and invisible wounds.  In the days and weeks following the Nation's deadliest mass shooting, we saw our community come together in beautiful ways. We mourned with those who lost their loved ones. We came out in droves to donate blood for the survivors who needed it. We showed support and gratitude for our law enforcement officers, our first responders, and the nurses and doctors who acted with courage and bravery in the face of unimaginable tragedy.

Mr.Speaker, no one can tell the story better than the family members who lost their loved ones that night, the survivors who were within the club that night. At this time, we would like to share some of the letters from family members and survivors.  The first letter that I would like to share comes from a mother who, if you were watching at all during the early hours of this tragic incident, this particular mother was going around asking anyone who she could about her son, trying to find him, trying to get word of him. I would like to share a mother's story from Christine  ``My son was one of the 49 people killed at Pulse Nightclub on June 12 of 2016. Those were 49 humans who collectively could have lived another 2,500 years. That is longer than we have had civilization. They were moms, dads, siblings, kids, straight, gay, Latino, Asian, They were your constituents. They deserved better than to die in a flurry of bullets.  ``My son Chris was a happy, quirky, goofy young man and had been from baby on. He was every mother's dream to hit the kid lottery. He was an only child, and I never married. I couldn't have loved him more.  ``He became a licensed mental health therapist. He loved his work and his personal life.  ``Chris had many friends. Chris and his boyfriend, Juan, were one of at least three couples to die together that night: another Juan and two Chris was one of two Christophers to die that night and at least six Christophers who died or survived. The magnitude of the killing is that there were so many names repeated.  ``My son was a loving and giving person. He was someone who was going to be my right-hand man as I became old and incapacitated. Now I have no one.  ``Chris lived his life with love and kindness. He was a walking, talking United Nations, inclusive of all; not by design, but because he cared about character, not race, gender, sexuality, or ethnicity. He lived a life of inclusion. You would have loved him if you knew him, whether he was your child or friend or cousin or coworker. The world has a little less joy without him in it.  ``Hugs and kisses, Christopher's mom.''  And at this time, I would like to yield to my colleague from Florida (Mr.Soto), who will continue to share.  ",CREC-2017-06-12-pt1-PgH4845.txt,99999999999999,PAYING TRIBUTE TO J.

I would like to continue to share letters from the survivors of The next letter that I will share comes from Brandon  ``It is hard to believe it has been a year. That Saturday night was like any other: loud music, skinny jeans, cheap drinks. Alongside my best friends, Drew Leinonen and Juan Guerrero, I was as free as ever. Standing outside on the patio, in his typical way, Drew tossed his arm around my shoulders and spoke his last words to me: `You know what we never say enough? That we love each other.' ''  Those were the last words that Drew spoke that evening.  `` . . . I learned a lesson from Orlando's recovery: that equality and unity aren't trophies, and the journey we are on isn't over. We can't take our eyes off the prize or forget what lies ahead.  ``We have to disarm hate. Silence it. Snuff it out. Replace it with the same message Drew had for me: love.  ``Brandon Wolf.''

The horrifying emotions and feeling of that night have not fleeted. Instead, they lay dormant in the recesses of my mind, bubbling up like lava in a moment's notice from unforeseen triggers.  ``It is like living on a roller coaster: having great moments over the past year, making things feel absolutely normal; and extreme lows, feeling as if I will never come out of the darkness.  ``Even through the disturbing images of the past, I am optimistic about the future I have ahead of me. I can fully grasp that life will never go back to the normal that I once knew, but this experience has helped me focus on what is needed in the world. That is love and inclusion for all people.  ``Over the past year, I have had the most amazing support system of friends and family, who have been there for me as I have cried and battled the demons that lay with me when I sleep.  ``These feelings have not changed since that night, but I remain positive and stand with my LGBTQ and Latinx brothers and sisters for a better future for everyone.  ``Regards,  ``Eric Borrero.''  Mr.Speaker, I would like to share that, today, Representative Soto, Representative Stephanie Murphy, and I introduced a resolution to recognize and mark one year since the Pulse tragedy. We were joined by 143 Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, who are standing to show the community of Orlando that we stand with them in support; that Congress will not forget the victims, the survivors, the first responders, and the communities that are shattered by the hands of domestic terrorists; and that we will do everything we can to prevent future mass shootings, and take care of the people who are left standing in the wake of these tragedies.  Mr.Speaker, our community declared June 12, 2017, Orlando United Day, a day of love and kindness. All across our community, people are coming together to honor the victims by volunteering and attending vigils and memorials.  We are a community that will never forget. We won't forget those 49 innocent men and women who were sons, daughters, mothers, husbands, wives, students, teachers, entrepreneurs, and dreamers, who had a lot of life left to live. We are a community that will continue to honor these men and women, not through our words, but through our actions.  Mr.Speaker, I thank God for Representative Soto, for his service to our community.

9699,topic-id,698,"Mr.Speaker, this is a very troubling time in American history. Our national security is endangered, the very future of our democracy is at stake, and without the continued engagement of millions of people across this country, this troubling time could become much worse.  There is an old adage: ``Loose lips sink ships.'' But it is also true that when it comes to the abuse of Presidential power, sealed lips can sink a democracy.  We have gone through a period where it would appear that some of our Republican colleagues are in a witness protection program because they have been unable to come forward with any words to comment on the continued abuse of power that we see played out each day, with one being more incredible than the one before.  All United States intelligence services agree that the Russians interfered in our last election. Russia deserves sanctions, not secrets, not rewards. A President of the United States invited Putin's gang right into the Oval We don't know what they left behind to listen to the rest of the conversations, although they may not need to learn them surreptitiously since President Trump, in such a cavalier way, proceeded to share secrets with them.  At long last we wonder, what will awaken these Republicans from their partisan stupor? We need them to speak out as well.  Last night we learned that Trump asked FBI Director James Comey, before firing him, to drop the investigation into National Security Advisor[[Page H4230]]Michael Flynn, whom Trump had been advised before he fired him that he was subject to being compromised by the Russians in his operations.  Our Republican colleagues need to decide whether they want to be accessories to Trump's obstruction of justice as he continues to endanger our national security.  Trump's firing of Director Comey is a shocking example of incredible duplicity that threatens the very fabric of the future of American democracy. It is a Nixonian dismissal that is designed to obstruct further inquiry into collusion between the Trump campaign and  Trump even said himself during his NBC interview with Lester Holt that, ``regardless of the recommendation from the Department of Justice,'' he was prepared and planning to fire the FBI Director because of what he was doing with the Russian investigation.  And that is part of a pattern: he fired the U.Attorney in New York City, he fired Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, and he then fired Mr.If you are perceived as crossing the line with President Trump, it is like an episode out of that old TV series ``The Apprentice:'' You are fired.  But this is not make-believe. This is the future of American democracy.  Every day we hear new coverup evidence. What could possibly explain the continued Republican silence, the callous indifference?  Well, Trump is the Republican's golden ticket to denying healthcare coverage to 24 million Americans and, at the same time, already showering, with a bill passed in this House, almost $1 trillion of tax breaks to the superrich and a handful of special interests.  He is their winning ticket to awarding multinational tax dodgers more tax breaks while blowing a hole in the deficit that can change Medicare and Social Security forever.  Trump reportedly told Comey: ``I hope you can let this go.''  My fellow Americans, FBI Director Comey could not let it go; and now that he is gone. We cannot let this go. This is not business as usual. This is not just more tax breaks for the superrich, as Republicans are urging at a hearing tomorrow in this We cannot let this go.  History will be unkind to those who could not find their voice at this critical time in American history. I say it is time to truly put America first. Reject Reject partisanship. Help restore confidence in our democracy by supporting an independent special counsel and the type of independent, nonpartisan, nonpolitical inquiry that I have been calling for since last November into this Russian interference.  Mr.Speaker, too much is at stake to remain silent. We must join together to address this challenge to our future.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

9726,topic-id,1748,"Mr.President, 20 years ago, when I was elected to the U.Senate, a group of people came to me and asked me to sponsor a bill. It was a bill that had been sponsored many times by Senator Bill Bradley of New He retired shortly before I arrived.  The bill related to the Utah wilderness. I remember saying to those who approached me: This isn't my It is the State of  They said: This is a bill which we are having some controversy with when it[[Page S2560]]comes to the Utah congressional delegation.  Secondly, I said: It is a wilderness bill about a part of the world that I have never seen. I don't feel right introducing it.  They said: Why don't you come out and look at it?  I did just a few weeks later. My wife and I went and took a look at the Red Rocks Wilderness area in I will tell you, initially, as a midwesterner, when I looked at the stark landscape, I looked around thinking, what are we trying to preserve here? I took a closer look, which everyone should, and found a unique part of America--a wilderness area which can't be found anywhere else and a wilderness area which boasts archeological and historic and environmental significance way beyond what many people in the rest of the lower 48 might appreciate.  Today, I am reintroducing the America's Red Rock Wilderness It would safeguard 9.2 million acres of Park Bureau Land Management land in Utah as wilderness--some of the last great wild places in the lower 48.  Throughout my time in the Senate, I have worked with the committed volunteers of the Utah Wilderness Coalition to protect the stunning, fragile desert landscape. These unique lands are rich in archeological resources and provide a habitat for rare plants and species. They offer unparalleled research, educational, and recreational opportunities for scientists, teachers, outdoor enthusiasts, and families.  The Bureau of Land Management has confirmed that the vast majority of the majority of the lands meet the qualifications for a wilderness designation. However, despite their pristine condition and their historical significance, these lands are threatened by oil and gas development, as well as rampant off-road vehicle use.  Although these activities are appropriate in some places, they don't belong in such a fragile landscape. Designating these lands as wilderness would safeguard wildlife, protect ancestral lands, help mitigate climate change, and provide access to future generations of hunters, anglers, hikers, boaters, and lovers of the natural world.  Last December, President Obama took an important step in protecting some of Southern Utah's fragile lands by designating the Bears Ears National Monument, which contains some of the lands that would be protected by my Red Rocks bill.  The 1.35 million-acre swath of land covers forested mesas and red rock canyons, and the designation protected the region's abundant Native American cultural resources. The monument contains well over 100,000 cultural and archeological sites. Let me say that again. Over 100,000 cultural and archeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings, granaries, burial sites, and kivas, as well as spectacular pictographs and petroglyphs strewn upon rock walls and boulders all across the region.  Artifacts range from 700 to 12,000 years old, providing tribes with an incredible insight into the shared history of their ancestral homeland, bolstering their deep spiritual connection to the land itself.  The Bears Ears National Monument, designated by President Obama, is the first monument of its kind to be proposed and advocated by a united coalition of five Tribes who sought its protection because of its importance in their respective culture. In total, 30 Native American tribes with ancestral, historical, and contemporary ties to the Bears Ears region supported the designation.  The Tribal coalition's original Bears Ears proposal was 1.9 million acres. You see them here. It is slightly larger than the 1.35 million-acre designation by President  Many in the Utah delegation, including one of my colleagues in the Senate, have raised concerns about President Obama's decision to protect this area and even the size of the designation. One of the critics of the size of the designation is the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, Rob  Last Congress, before President Obama designated the Bears Ears region a national monument, the same Chairman Bishop introduced a bill that would have protected part of the Bears Ears region while opening other areas of land for oil and gas development.  Look at the two here in comparison. Chairman Bishop's proposal protected 1.28 million acres--only 17,500 acres smaller than the area protected by President  As you can see from these maps, the areas protected by Chairman Bishop's Public Lands Initiative are not that much different than the areas protected by the Bears Ears National To argue that the designation is so much larger than anyone anticipated is to ignore what the chairman submitted in his own legislation last year. Both are much smaller than what the Tribes originally requested, which is the third map here.  Despite that, Utah's congressional delegation has called the area ``well beyond the areas in need of protection'' and they pushed President Trump to consider shrinking or overturning this wilderness monument designation. Yet Utah's Salt Lake Tribune called Utah politicians' determination to rescind these designations ``blindness.''  Let me quote the Salt Lake Tribune:       That blindness can be sourced to Utah's one-party political      system that has given us leaders who are out of touch with      their constituents.  They then continue and say:       The Bears Ears monument may be with us forever, and there      is no bucket of gold waiting if it does go away. The      presidential proclamation bent far toward the same boundaries      and shared management [Utah Rob] Bishop pursued with his      public lands initiative.  They saw the same maps and said: Why is this acceptable and this objectionable?  Today, President Trump is planning to sign an Executive order. It is going to call on the Department of Interior to review previous national monument designations under the Antiquities  While the President's Executive order will target the Bears Ears National Monument first, the order is going to go well beyond Utah and consider changes to all of the national monuments that have been designated since 1996--more than 50 different sites.  These are areas designated ``national monument protected areas'' by Republican and Democratic Presidents with bipartisan support. Yet President Trump is going to insist with his new order that he can review and change every single one of them.  Let me tell you the list of places and sites of great cultural significance that could be impacted: A portion of Sequoia National Forest in California, Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historic Park in Maryland, African Burial Ground National Monument in New York, and in my home State of Illinois, the Pullman National  It is rare for any national monument designation to be changed by another It happened once. The last time a President used the Antiquities Act to adjust the borders of a national monument was over a century ago, in 1915. Then-President Woodrow Wilson shrunk Washington State's Mount Olympus National Monument so they could harvest more timber resources from this land.  A lot has changed since 1915, including our views on conservation. Attacks on conservation seem to have remained consistent. One of our greatest conservation Presidents, Teddy Roosevelt--a proud Republican, I might add--faced a great deal of opposition to his designation of a national monument that most of us are familiar with--the Grand  Most Americans can't imagine our country without the iconic Grand Canyon because it is truly a national treasure. At the time of its 1908 designation by President Roosevelt, groups were opposed to protecting that area. For years after its designation, oil and gas miners fought additional protections for the Grand  The attacks on the Bears Ears designation doesn't seem all that different from the attacks on the Grand Canyon, but the attacks on the Bears Ears National Monument also attack the Native people who have worked so hard to get this area protected.  Let's be very honest. When we look at how Native Americans were treated by our government and the settlers, we certainly look back with some shame and some embarrassment. What the Tribes are asking for here is a protection of areas that are of special significance to them and special significance to the environmental legacy, which we should be leaving to future generations.[[Page S2561]]  The President's decision to review these national monuments puts the future of these resources in jeopardy and threatens our culture, history, and heritage. If President Donald Trump decides to use the Antiquities Act to reverse one of these monuments, he would treading in uncharted water. Never before has a President used the Antiquities Act to repeal a national monument. For what purpose? For oil and gas exploration? For off-the-road vehicle use?  These monuments themselves help promote tourism and outdoor recreation. Regions with national monuments saw increased employment and personal income growth--exactly the opposite of what the critics promised. Specifically, rural counties in the West, with protected lands, saw jobs increase by 345 percent over areas without protected lands--345 percent. Despite the opposition from Utah's elected officials, many in the State, including the Tribes, want to protect those areas, and I want to help them.  Teddy Roosevelt once said:       It is also vandalism wantonly to destroy or to permit the      destruction of what is beautiful in nature, whether it be a      cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird. Here in the      United States we turn our rivers and streams into sewers and      dumping-grounds, we pollute the air, we destroy forests, and      exterminate fishes, birds, and mammals--not to speak of      vulgarizing charming landscapes with hideous advertisements.      But at last it looks as if our people were awakened.  That was said by that Republican President over a century ago. Since Teddy Roosevelt's time, we have made progress in protecting our lands and waters, but these recent attacks and this recent Executive order by President Donald Trump show that we still have a long way to go.  I urge this administration, this Republican administration, to heed the words of Teddy Carefully consider the legacy they will leave to future generations. It would be foolish not to protect Bears Ears and other monuments, just as it would have been foolish to listen to the critics and refuse to protect the Grand  These monuments are for all of us, and we must ensure that they remain in their current natural condition for future generations to enjoy.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgS2554-3.txt,326,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK,2017.0,26.0,April

9724,topic-id,637,"Mr.President, Arizona is home to more than a half million veterans. They have served in every conflict from World War II to present-day operations in the Middle Nothing makes me prouder than to shake the hand of one of these veterans and to call them an  Fortunately, many of these veterans have the support of friends and family, as well as their fellow veterans with whom they served, but far too many who have served our country lack a support system that can help them successfully make the transition back to civilian life.  For those who have post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury, this could be particularly difficult. Studies have shown that veterans often do not seek out medical health treatment due to concerns about stigma, negative career prospects, lack of awareness, or logistical challenges in accessing care. For those who go without treatment, it can lead to substance abuse and, in some cases, run-ins with the law.  While there is no justification for criminal behavior, it is important to recognize when certain actions may be symptomatic of the harrowing experiences a veteran has endured during years of service. This is something the criminal justice system often fails to deal with. By not providing treatment that actually addresses a veteran's underlying service-connected issues, our criminal justice system sometimes creates a vicious cycle. It overcriminalizes service-connected mental illness, undertreats incarcerated veterans, and increases recidivism.  To address the problem, the VA created the Veterans Justice Outreach Program in 2009. The program was established to remove veterans from the regular criminal justice process and to provide specially tailored treatments to address many of these underlying issues. These veterans treatment courts have a proven record of preventing initial incarceration and reducing recidivism.  The lifeblood of the program is the veterans justice outreach specialists, VJO specialists, who link veterans to available court services. These outreach specialists identify veterans in jails and local courts, they assess their health status, and they help them develop the rehabilitation treatment program specific to each of their needs.  I recently had the opportunity to observe the veterans docket and meet with some of these dedicated specialists while visiting the Mesa Municipal Court earlier this month. Let me tell you, there is no substitute for seeing this firsthand. Even though it is a courtroom setting, there is a comradery and collaboration that you don't see in traditional courtroom proceedings. I was amazed at how many[[Page S2556]]organizations there are to help these veterans--to help them successfully transition and help them with treatment.  The collaboration I am talking about comes from having a judge and hard-working staff who have served in the military themselves. They understand the hardship of multiple deployments for servicemembers and their families. They understand the mental and physical tolls of combat. They understand that the transition back to civilian life can mark the beginning of a new battle for veterans.  The program has experienced remarkable success. The unfortunate reality is that the VA doesn't have enough outreach specialists to ensure access to already available treatment for justice-involved veterans. Demand for VJO specialists is outpacing the program's ability to serve eligible veterans. This means future veterans treatment courts can't be established, existing courts will go understaffed, and veterans will go unserved. That is not right.  That is why today I am introducing the Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act to ensure our veterans receive swift and appropriate access to justice. This legislation will provide 50 additional VJO specialists for veterans treatment courts nationwide. By increasing the number of dedicated specialists at these facilities, Congress can ensure that more veterans have access to the treatments they have earned with their service. This is bipartisan legislation. I will work to inform my colleagues about the need for this program and additional VJOs in the coming weeks and months.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgS2554-3.txt,1633,ROBERT T.

9603,topic-id,978,"Mr.Speaker, I am disappointed to hear that the Senate will not be able to take up the healthcare bill this week, but this is a tough issue. It is a tough issue because, at least on my side of the aisle, we want to do the right thing. We want to make sure that people can buy health insurance that is affordable and accessible, and not pull the rug out from under people who have issues.  In the House, we passed a bill, and one of the big issues was preexisting conditions. We made sure that people with preexisting conditions can buy health insurance that is reasonably priced, similar to people who have no preexisting conditions, but then we kicked in billions of dollars to subsidize those premiums to help those people be in the insurance market because I think it is important that those people are in the insurance market and have access to insurance that is affordable.  I think it is really un-American to pull the rug out from people because they got sick.  ObamaCare is imploding. In Ohio--and this is from the Health and Human Services Agency--ObamaCare in Ohio, since 2013, premiums have increased 86 percent. We had almost 236,000 families pay almost $44 million in penalties because they couldn't afford their health insurance.  Then there is also a myth out there that the price is going through the roof, it is collapsing because of the current administration. Well, if you look at the facts, the average premium skyrocketed by nearly $3,000 across the country during the previous administration's final term. Eighty-three insurers left the market, and the average exchange premium spiked 25 percent last year alone. Americans living in roughly one-third of our Nation's counties have only one option of healthcare coverage precisely because this law has continued to fail. All this has occurred prior to the current administration.  Mr.Speaker, I got a phone call last night from a lady whom I have known for over 30 years. She is self-employed, running a service-type business, and she was struggling to pay for her healthcare under the ObamaCare exchanges. She has prayed these last few years that she wouldn't get sick because she wouldn't be able to meet the deductible. She works 12-hour days. She is in one of those at least 20 counties in Ohio that will not have an insurer on the individual market for next year. She has no options to buy health insurance next year. She called me up and said: I don't know what I am going to do.  I didn't have a good answer for her. That is why we need to get this done.  Prior to ObamaCare--I don't know if a lot of people realize this--when I was a self-employed farmer, I bought my health insurance through association plans. ObamaCare did away with association plans and forced people onto the exchanges and mandated what kind of coverage you had to buy.  Ironically, as a Member of Congress, I am required to be on ObamaCare, and I am. But the ironic thing is, next year, if things don't change--and I was forced to be on the D.exchange, but if I was forced to be on my county exchange back where I live, my county does not have a health insurer in the individual market next year. I think it is ironic as a Member of Congress, if I wasn't on the D.exchange, I wouldn't be able to buy insurance through my exchange back home because it will not be available.  How do we fix this?  I think we have to incorporate free-market principles. We have to get the cost down, and then the market will work.  How do we get the cost down?  We have to have price discovery, and how you get that is through competition. I think health savings accounts is one way you will get competition and personal responsibility. People will shop around on a nonemergency-type basis, and it will help drive the cost down.  ObamaCare did away with health savings accounts.  Also, tort reform. We need to make sure that doctors practicing medicine don't have to worry about frivolous lawsuits and fight defensive medicine. That is really important.[[Page H5236]]  We need to be able to buy insurance across State lines. We have it in property and casualty insurance. We have it in auto insurance. We ought to have it in health insurance. It ought to be portable, you take it with you. And you also have your health savings account that you can take with you and be portable.  These are some of the things that we can do, but we have to let the market work. That is my hope. And this is a tough issue. The Senate is working through it. They want to do the right thing. They want to make sure that Americans have affordable, high-quality health insurance coverage that they can buy. We need to work through that, and I think the Senate will get there. Hopefully, we will get a bill on the President's desk so my friend, whom I have known for over 30 years, can buy health insurance next year and not have to worry about the risk of what happens if she gets sick, or if she will have to go on  Mr.Speaker, one out of four Americans today are on That is not really a good option.

9722,topic-id,620,"Mr.President, I have long been a champion of domestic biofuel production, including ethanol, biodiesel and cellulosic fuels. Domestic biodiesel production supports tens of thousands of jobs. Replacing traditional diesel with biodiesel reduces emissions and creates cleaner air. Homegrown biodiesel improves our energy security by diversifying our transportation fuels and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Biodiesel itself is a very diverse fuel. It can be produced from a wide array of resources such as recycled cooking oil, soybean and other plant oils, and animal fats.  I am proud of the success of the American biodiesel industry, and I am glad to be introducing today the American Renewable Fuel and Job Creation Act of 2017, which will ensure the continued success. I appreciate Senator Cantwell's leadership in joining this effort. I also appreciate the support of Senators Roberts, Hirono, Blunt, Whitehouse, Ernst, Heitkamp, Thune, Udall, Heinrich, Shaheen, Klobuchar, Franken, Donnelly, and This bill will modify the biodiesel fuel blender's credit to a domestic production credit starting this year and extend the credit through 2020.  Congress created the biodiesel tax incentive in 2005 when I was chairman of the Senate Finance As a result of this incentive and the Renewable Fuel Standard, biodiesel is providing significant benefits to the nation.  Senator Cantwell and I have been advocating the mixture credit be modified to a producer credit since 2009. Converting to a producer credit improves the incentive in many ways. The blenders credit can be difficult to administer because the blending of the fuel can occur at many different stages of the fuel distribution. This can make it difficult to ensure that only fuel that qualifies for the credit claims the incentive. It has been susceptible to abuse because of this.  A credit for domestic production will also ensure that we are incentivizing the domestic industry and associated American jobs, rather than subsidizing imported biofuels. A credit for domestic production will also ensure that we are incentivizing the domestic industry and associated American jobs, rather than subsidizing imported biofuels. Since 2014, we have seen imports increase from 510 million gallons to about 1 billion gallons in 2016, and already in the first quarter of 2017 imports are 10 percent higher than they were last year at this time.  We should not provide a U.taxpayer benefit to imported biofuels. By restricting the credit to domestic production, we will also save taxpayer money. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated a similar amendment adopted in the Finance Committee in 2015 would have reduced the cost of the extension by $90 million for 2016 alone.  Importantly, modifying the credit will have little to no impact on the consumer. Much of the credit will continue to be passed on to the blender and ultimately, the consumer. Additionally, the U.biodiesel industry is currently operating at approximately 65 percent of capacity, which does not even account for idled capacity. The fact is, the domestic biodiesel industry has the capacity and access to affordable feedstocks to meet the demand of U.consumers.  The current biodiesel credit expired at the end of 2016. Adoption of the American Renewable Fuel and Job Creation Act of 2017 should be strongly considered as part of tax reform efforts currently underway. Absent tax reform, Congress should include it as part of any tax legislation extending expired tax provisions.  Modifying the current blenders credit to a producers credit will ensure that the credit is doing what Congress intended--incentivizing investment in domestic biodiesel production and promoting American jobs. Surely we can agree that we should not be providing a U.taxpayer subsidy to already heavily subsidized foreign biodiesel imports. I therefore urge my colleagues to support the production of American biodiesel and this commonsense, cost reduction reform.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgS2554-3.txt,457,COMMENDING ARMY SPECIALIST MICHAEL MARTENEY FOR HIS HEROISM,2017.0,26.0,June

If the President can be interrupted by his grandchild to shake up an interview that isn't going so well, I can ask my grandson to help me make a point here in  Here is Luis Luis Andres is my grandson. You see, in the Gutierrez family, grandparents and grandchildren are pretty close family members and have a bona fide family connection. In fact, Luis Andres lives downstairs from me with his mom and dad in the ground floor unit of a two-flat in Portage Park in Chicago, and growing up with Grandma and Grandpa upstairs has distinct advantages. There is always someone to feed you, watch you, help you study, or just joke around.  Throughout much of the world and throughout American history until fairly recently, the idea that families do not include grandparents is laughable. Multiple generations live together or very nearby, and grandparents, even great-grandparents, are an integral part of the family unit and share child rearing responsibilities.  So when you are in Syria or Yemen, Central Africa or Central America, places where surviving day to day without being killed by gunmen, government, or gangs is not easy, extended, multigenerational families not only live together and support each other, occasionally they have to flee to safety together.  But not if Donald Trump has his way they don't, or at least not when it comes to coming here to  Thankfully, the American court system disagrees with our President on this. Hawaii sued the President again and won an injunction again, and the Supreme Court, which would ultimately determine the fate of America's commitment to refugees and religious tolerance will determine the case later this year.  But in the meantime, over the objections of the President, grandparents are officially part of the family and have a bona fide relationship that allows them, under the law, to bypass the President's attempt to keep them out.  Thank you, courts, for recognizing and defending families and giving our President a lesson in the obvious.  Mr.Speaker, on Sunday, I learned about a tragedy in San Antonio where a truck packed with immigrants was discovered and at least 10 people were killed. The truck had no ventilation or air-conditioning. There was no water for those inside who had paid a lot of money to risk their lives to live in America--10 dead and another 20 near death, some of them children, under the hot Texas sun in an apparent smuggling operation.  You see, if you cut off legal immigration channels and make people wait decades for a visa, if they are eligible to apply at all, it strengthens the hands of smugglers. If you turn asylum seekers around, in violation of our own laws and international law, those seeking freedom are driven into the arms of smugglers.  If, by going through our legal system in requesting asylum, your entire family becomes vulnerable to deportation, being sent back to a place you fled because death was a certainty, then people will pay smugglers to go around our system because there are no ways to go through it.  A border wall like the one Republicans will slip into the military spending bill this week in the House will not help matters, but only make them worse. Forcing people to enter the black market because there is no way to go through our visa system will undoubtedly increase the number of times we hear about tragedies like the one in Texas and the number of parents, grandparents, and children who lose everything because we have failed to create and maintain a functioning immigration system.  When Luis Andres turns 18 and is able to vote, just like a million young Latinos like him every year are eligible, I know he will remember which party stood for and stood by families and which ones did not. Grandparents, they are part of the American family even if the Republicans don't seem to think so.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6217-5.txt,478,NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK,2017.0,25.0,June

9668,topic-id,481,"Mr.President, tomorrow, April 26, is World Intellectual Property Day, an opportunity for people around the world to appreciate and learn about the role of intellectual property rights in promoting innovation. Our Founders believed that the right to enjoy the benefit of one's own inventions was so important to the progress of science that they included it in the More than 200 years later, limited exclusive rights for inventors continue to incentivize the research and development and make the United States the global leader in innovation.  In the spirit of this year's theme, ``Innovation--Improving Lives,'' I am proud to partner with Senator Grassley to reintroduce the Patents for Humanity Program Improvement Patents for Humanity is a perfect example of how intellectual property rights encourage inventors to develop creative solutions to some of the world's most pressing humanitarian challenges.  Since 2012, the Patents for Humanity Program of the U.Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, has honored patent holders whose inventions apply cutting-edge technology to meet global challenges in medicine, nutrition, sanitation, energy, and living standards. The winning inventors receive a certificate to accelerate future PTO processes, such as a reexamination or additional patent applications. The Patents for Humanity Program provides an important incentive for talented innovators to use their expertise and intellect to enhance the public good.  The winners of the Patents for Humanity Program have addressed some of the toughest challenges in the developing world. One lab developed a vaccine cooler that has been used in the fight against the Ebola virus. A nonprofit organization created a strand of rice enriched with vitamin A to prevent a nutritional deficiency that is the leading killer of children globally. A social enterprise made a low-cost solar light that can replace dangerous kerosene lamps in areas without electricity. These life saving inventions are exactly the kind of innovations that our intellectual property system should incentivize.  In 2012, the Director of the PTO testified before the Judiciary Committee that Patents for Humanity would attract even more innovators if the winners could transfer their acceleration certificates to a third party. Frequently, successful small businesses and individual inventors are unable to continue their projects or are prevented from taking advantage of the accelerated process because of acquisitions and reorganizations. Transferability of the award certificates would increase the incentive for these small businesses and individuals to develop innovative technologies that would benefit the public and international development.  This bipartisan legislation would allow Patents for Humanity winners to transfer their acceleration certificates. This straightforward, common sense reform to the Patents for Humanity Program passed the Senate by unanimous consent last I am hopeful that it will again this Congress and that we can finally enact into law this simple improvement to a successful program. We should take every opportunity we can to encourage and support enterprising Americans with bright ideas that will benefit both our country and the world.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-25-pt1-PgS2532.txt,1383,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,25.0,April

Michael first came to Florida in 1960 and eventually returned in 1966 to teach at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami, a move that would keep him in the Sunshine State for the rest of his life. His tenacity intelligence led to critical medical breakthroughs, But it didn't come easily.  Michael's first invention, ``Harvey''--the cardiopulmonary patient simulator used across the globe--was initially viewed with contempt and suspicion amongst his contemporaries. But that did not discourage And thank God for that, because the once-ridiculed invention has since been used by many in the field of cardiology around the world. His relentlessness and ambition served as a testament to his character. He was a man with unfailing dedication to the well-being of others.  He also created UMedic, a system fostering research and learning in cardiology. Michael also devised training for first responders, which undoubtedly saved many lives over the years. He founded the Medical Training and Simulation Laboratory, which was eventually named the Michael Gordon Center for Research in Medical The center focused on the mission of improving medical techniques and training paramedics and firefighters.

Beginning as a midshipman at the U.Naval Academy, the Navy recognized his potential early on and designated him an engineering duty officer, where he served in various assignments.  Upon selection to flag rank in 2010, Admiral Syring served as the program executive officer for Integrated Warfare Systems, where he managed integrated weapons systems for ships, submarines, carriers, and aircraft within the Fleet and Joint  His intellect, work ethic, and ability to deliver complex weapons systems resulted in his being nominated and confirmed as the ninth Director of MDA in November 2012, the first naval officer to assume the directorship of this multibillion-dollar He oversaw MDA's worldwide mission to develop and deliver to the warfighter a capability to defend the United States against ballistic missile attacks. He has done an outstanding job.  During his time at MDA, the Agency and the Department of Defense made significant progress in addressing current and emerging ballistic missile threats of all ranges. The progress made is even more remarkable considering the budget cuts sustained during that time. In response to the growing North Korean ICBM threat, Admiral Syring implemented a program to expand the capacity of homeland missile defenses. His leadership brought acquisition rigor to the critical Ground-based Midcourse Defense--GMD--Program and laid the foundation for the Agency to implement ground system modernization, a robust ground-based interceptor--GBI--Stockpile Reliability Program, as well as the Redesigned Kill Vehicle  Under Admiral Syring's steady hand, the Agency successfully fielded a new data terminal at Fort Drum, NY, providing the warfighter the capability to improve communication with homeland defense interceptors.  He also oversaw a strategy to improve the overall sensor and discrimination capability of the Ballistic Missile Defense With the Long Range Discrimination Radar--LRDR--Program, MDA will deploy an improved persistent midcourse BMDS discrimination capability to enhance the Pacific architecture. The program today is within cost and is on schedule to deliver an initial capability to the warfighter in 2020. Those most familiar with major defense acquisition programs know that this is no small accomplishment.  Overall, Admiral Syring's advocacy for additional interceptor capacity, improved GBI reliability, a redesigned kill vehicle, and LRDR resulted in a fielded system that meets the threat today and is well-positioned to be expanded upon for future challenges.  Admiral Syring was also responsible for major BMDS asset deployments around the globe. He strengthened regional defenses by continuing deliveries of terminal high altitude area defense--THAAD--interceptors and Standard Missile-3--SM-3--Block IBs for use on Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at Aegis Ashore sites. He took steps to ensure that the United States remained committed to the planned European phased adaptive approach--EPAA--deployments.  He oversaw the delivery of the Aegis Ashore system in Romania in support of EPAA Phase 2, which was accepted for operations by the warfighter in May 2016. In addition, under his leadership, construction of the Aegis Ashore[[Page S3284]]site in Poland commenced to improve European NATO defenses against medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. He kept the Agency on track to deliver by the end of 2018 the initial SM-3 Block IIA missiles developed in cooperation with Japan to support EPAA Phase 3.  Additionally, Admiral Syring supported successful negotiations between the United States and the Republic of Korea, ROK, on the deployment of a THAAD battery to the ROK, shoring up defenses against the growing threat from North Korean ballistic missiles.  In order to deal with future missile threats, Admiral Syring pursued an advanced technology program with the goal of reducing the cost of engaging increasing and complex ballistic missile threats.  Finally, Admiral Syring successfully initiated the development of an experimental space sensor layer for the BMDS, a new, low-cost program called Space-based Kill Assessment, The program will increase the performance of the BMDS by collecting data on missile intercepts, a critical capability of which the significance cannot be overstated.  Our Nation has long hoped and, indeed, expected that we will always be able to recruit and retain capable individuals with a strong sense of patriotism, who will spend their careers ensuring that our country is safe in peacetime and capable in time of war. The contributions that VADM James Syring made to the Missile Defense Agency, the U.Navy, and the national security of the United States of America over his career have again shown our Nation's hopes are not too great to be met. As he retires after more than three decades of military service, I wish him and his family well, and I hope he has a deep appreciation of his legacy to this Nation and of the gratitude of his fellow citizens.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-06-pt1-PgS3283-2.txt,1049,HONORING BRIGADIER GENERAL PATRICK D.

One year ago this very day, we were devastated to feel the loss of so many lives from every part of all of Yes, Pulse by name was a gay nightclub, but it was attended by everyone and all walks of life felt safe dancing and having a good time for more than a decade.  ``As the night became dawn and the horror of the extent of what happened became painfully available by every media outlet, I didn't need to listen to news reports because I live right across the street from The sound of the blades from the helicopters above my house cut through June air, day after day, looking for a better camera angle. Out of so much pain came so much love.  ``Immediately Orlando went into action. The outpouring of love from everywhere in the world is still so incredible. The help came from faith-based organizations, the small stores, corporate Most of all, it came out of love and our neighbors. I hope this never happens to your community or any community, but it most likely will. Let me offer some advice.  ``Love thy neighbor, know your neighbor, and take care of your neighbor. Do not wait until another tragedy. Talk to your children about violence. Let's help the persons that suffer from mental illnesses.  ``There is a significance and real difference between a city that is tolerant, a city accepting, and a city that embraces the LGBTQ and all its communities and individuals within those communities. I am proud to live in a city and a county that embraces! We are Orlando Strong and we are Orlando United.''  ",CREC-2017-06-12-pt1-PgH4845.txt,99999999999999,RUSSIA INVESTIGATION,2017.0,12.0,May

9657,topic-id,163,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in recognition of drug courts and veterans treatment courts in  No one disputes the issues of rampant drug use and abuse in our Nation and the tremendous hardship it is placing on families, on businesses, and our criminal justice system. Recently, I met a remarkable young man from Arkansas who epitomizes the critical need to expand these lifesaving programs.  Blayne was facing 20 years in prison because of a 10-year addiction to opioid prescription drugs that spiraled out of control while experimenting in college. Today he is a father to three beautiful children, owns his own home, and is giving back to his community--all because a drug court in Arkansas saved him.  This month is National Drug Court Drug courts represent one of our Nation's most successful strategies for intervention.  I support drug courts and veterans treatment courts. I am counting on my colleagues to ensure they are properly supported and funded. The return on investment is incalculable.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-19-pt1-PgH4361-6.txt,1991,DRUG COURT SUPPORT,2017.0,19.0,May
