CELEBRATING THE 106TH BIRTHDAY OF THE GIRL SCOUTS OF THE UNITED STATES 
                               OF AMERICA

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Girl 
Scouts of the USA on their 106th birthday and to commend the 
organization for helping girls become leaders in their communities and 
in our Nation. It is fitting that the Girl Scouts' birthday falls 
during Women's History Month.

  In 1912, Juliette Gordon Low founded the first Girl Scout troop, with 
18 girls, in Savannah, Georgia. 106 years later, more than 50 million 
women are Girl Scout alums, and the program reaches nearly 2 million 
girls. Today, Girl Scout alums launch rockets into space, serve as CEOs 
of international companies, sit on academic boards, and more.
  As we celebrate the Girl Scouts' 106th birthday this week and Women's 
History Month, I applaud the Girl Scout councils that serve girls in my 
State for building girls of courage, confidence, and character, who 
make the world a better place.
  I am proud that this program was founded in the First Congressional 
District of Georgia and in my hometown of Savannah, Georgia.
