      IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE PATIENTS

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor and supporter 
of the bipartisan Dialysis PATIENTS Demonstration Act, which provides 
better care for patients who are suffering from end-stage renal 
disease, also known as kidney failure.
  Currently, there are about 9,000 Minnesotans who suffer from end-
stage renal disease. Many of these patients spend hours and hours 
enduring multiple hospital visits each and every week to treat this 
disease; and, on top of that, they oftentimes also have to travel to a 
different location to get treatment for other health conditions they 
may have as well.
  This legislation will allow dialysis centers to provide integrated 
care for patients by bringing in providers so that people can receive 
comprehensive treatments all in the same place. These patients will 
also be able to see additional benefits, like transportation services, 
dental care, and vision care.
  Mr. Speaker, let's pass this bill so we can improve the quality of 
life for this vulnerable patient population by coordinating the care 
system and making it easier for them to receive their treatments.
