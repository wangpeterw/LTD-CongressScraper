                   BACK THE BLUE AND FIRST RESPONDERS

  (Mr. McCAUL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, this week we honor the brave men and women 
who make it their life's duty to protect and defend our citizens, our 
Nation, and our way of life. Police officers across the country wake up 
every morning unaware of the challenges they may face, the threats they 
must overcome, and the lives they will affect and protect in the 
process.
  The badge officers don is a symbol of their altruism and their 
devotion to the common good. I believe in ``Backing the Blue'' and 
visit first responders throughout my district in Texas to express my 
unyielding support.
  America's police officers represent the best in all of us and are the 
finest our country has to offer. For their service, their sacrifice, 
and their selflessness, we are eternally thankful.
