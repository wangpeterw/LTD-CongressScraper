                      LET'S GET A CLEAN DREAM ACT

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to share the story of 
Miguel from Salem, Oregon, and to once again urge Republican leadership 
to put aside partisan politics and include a clean Dream Act in this 
week's short-term budget extension.
  Miguel was brought to the United States when he was 7 years old by 
his parents. For years, he lived in the shadows, not knowing whether 
college would ever be an option for him. In 2012, Miguel, along with 
nearly 800,000 young folks in this country, was able to apply for DACA; 
and thanks to DACA, he was able to earn not one, but two bachelor's 
degrees. He now works as a human resource manager for a business in 
Salem.
  Miguel pays taxes and he contributes to our community. Miguel's 
future is uncertain due to the congressional Republican leadership's 
unwillingness to allow a vote on the Dream Act.
  Every day, another 122 DACA recipients like Miguel lose their legal 
protections that allow them to go to school and to work. It is inhumane 
that Congress continues to hold these young folks hostage for partisan 
political purposes.
  Let's do the right thing. Let's get a clean Dream Act passed so this 
country can move forward.
