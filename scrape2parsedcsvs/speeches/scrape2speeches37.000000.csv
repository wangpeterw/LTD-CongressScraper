11096,topic-id,291,"Mr.Speaker, make no mistake: the anti-arbitration rule recently finalized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is not consumer protection. It is a giveaway to special interest trial lawyers that will expose financial firms to ruinous liability; limit consumer access to affordable, high-quality financial services and products; and undermine consumers' ability to resolve disputes more quickly and more cost-effectively than class action lawsuits.  The Bureau's own study found that, while trial lawyers earn millions of dollars in fees, in 90 percent of class action lawsuits, consumers were awarded absolutely nothing--nothing. Of the remaining 10 percent, the average payout to consumers was a mere $32. That same CFPB study found that the average arbitration payout was almost $5,400, or over 150 times more than the average class action recovery.  Even more troubling, the Bureau's unilateral decision to ban alternative dispute resolution will result in increased litigation costs for financial services firms, undermining their safety and soundness, forcing consumers to pay higher prices and making it more difficult to obtain credit cards and other financial services and products. That is not pro-consumer.  For these reasons, I am a proud cosponsor of Congressman Rothfus' bill that would disapprove this misguided resolution to the Congressional Review  Congress should be making the laws of the land, not unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats at the CFPB circumventing the democratic process. That is why, in addition to invalidating this bad anticonsumer, pro-trial lawyer, anti-arbitration rule, Congress must act swiftly to rein in the Bureau and subject this agency to the congressional appropriations process, reclaiming Congress' constitutional power of the purse over this out-of-control agency.

10998,topic-id,777,"Mr.Speaker, today I voted for H.3364, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Roll no. 413). This legislation is an important step forward in punishing Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and for the country's alleged interference in the 2016 United States presidential election.  The bill also updates and expands sanctions on North Korea at a time when the country continues to pursue dangerous weapons programs.  Further, I commend leadership and committee members in the House and Senate for ensuring that the Iran sanctions portion of this legislation does not violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached between Iran, the United States, and five major world powers, including Russia and While the Iranian ballistic missile program is deeply concerning and must be addressed, undermining the nuclear agreement, which has forced Iran to remove thousands of centrifuges from service and halt all uranium enrichment, would be a mistake of tragic proportions.  The bipartisan support for the bill should be a signal to the administration to refrain from taking action that would encourage Iran to change course.  To be sure, Iran has some unsavory hardline people in key positions of leadership, but these hardliners just suffered a major defeat in the Iranian elections. President Hassan Rouhani has been a voice of and a force for moderation--and people voted for him.  We must proceed with the utmost caution and develop a thoughtful approach to ensure we continue to keep Iran away from the nuclear threshold, while also countering the regime's nefarious activities.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.3364--but with reservations.  I strongly support the section of this bill that provides a role for the Congress before any president may waive sanctions or provide relief from sanctions against Russia sought to undermine America's 2016 election. It attempted to subvert our democracy. It did so deliberately, methodically, and ruthlessly, spreading lies and misinformation and exploiting weaknesses in computer systems and records to steal private information and release it in sensationalistic fashion.  These attacks against our democracy were and are totally unacceptable and must be condemned. I remain bewildered that the current president of the United States still fails to acknowledge that these actions happened and that the Russian government, at the very highest level, is responsible--even though there is a consensus among all U.domestic and international intelligence and law enforcement agencies that this is the case.  Sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration in response to this multifaceted operation were lifted by President This legislation rectifies that situation by re-imposing those sanctions and ensuring that they cannot be removed without congressional consultation and consent.  In addition, Russia continues to threaten its neighbors, especially Ukraine, for which economic and military sanctions are now in place.  But I am somewhat reluctant in my support for this legislation because of the provisions included on Like all my colleagues, I am worried about Iran's continued testing and development of ballistic missile technology. It is threatening and provocative to Iran's neighbors and the region. I also oppose Iran's support for regional militant and terrorist organizations, and for choosing to side with the brutal regime of Bashir al-Assad in the Syrian conflict, as did  I do support, however, Iran's continuing compliance with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)--or the Iran nuclear deal. I worry that the sanctions against Iran included in this bill will be used and manipulated to undermine the I am worried that we now have a president and an Administration actively seeking to abrogate this international nuclear agreement. And I strongly oppose any action that would violate, let alone abandon, the  The Trump Administration--and the White House in particular--seem hell-bent on putting us on a path that leads to yet another costly war in the Middle East and to a nuclear-armed This would be a calamity of the greatest order, one that would place our friends and allies in the region in even greater danger than what they now face. We must not go there.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.111, a resolution that will undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and allow financial institutions to continue taking advantage of consumers.  The CFPB's arbitration rule protects consumers, including students, servicemembers, and seniors, by allowing them access to justice in court and to participate in class action lawsuits against unscrupulous financial institutions.  I am a former consumer protection lawyer. I have no problem with arbitration clauses when they are agreed to by parties with equal bargaining power, but we have seen what happens when institutions include nonnegotiable forced arbitration clauses in the fine print of consumer contracts.  Private student loan providers, payday lenders, credit card companies, and banks have consumers sign away their rights to access the court system when they are cheated. The CFPB rule will address that inequity and provide consumers with a remedy.  We must reject this effort to roll back consumer protections and allow the CFPB to continue to do their important work.

10942,topic-id,851,"Mr.President, today, with great humility during National Police Week, I wish to recognize the brave men and women of law enforcement across the country. These individuals have answered the call to serve and every day they put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. I especially want to honor those who have lost their lives in the line of duty and observe the sacrifices of their families.  First, I especially want to recognize three law enforcement officers who lost their lives in New Jersey last year. These three men made the ultimate sacrifice for their communities, and we owe them and their families our sincerest respect. On July 1, 2016, the New Jersey Department of Corrections lost Nikeelan ``Nick'' On March 7, 2016, the New Jersey State Police lost Sean On December 5, 2016, the New Jersey State Police also lost Frankie  These officers dedicated their lives to protecting our communities, and they served our State with valor and integrity. I feel privileged to call them fellow New Jerseyans, and my thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family and friends of these brave public servants. As we continue to mourn and remember Officer Semmon, Trooper Cullen, and Trooper Williams, let us pledge to honor their sacrifice by working every day to emulate their devotion to public service through acts of service and love.  It is in that spirit that I want to talk about the important work that still needs to be done to support law enforcement. Congress plays a critical role in supporting law enforcement, both at the Federal level and at the State and local level. There are few bills I want to mention that I believe we must pass to uphold our commitment to brave men and women in law enforcement.  First, on February 16, 2017, I introduced the bipartisan Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Unfortunately, due to a technical error, nearly 30,000 Federal law enforcement officers classified as GS-0083 police officers did not receive enhanced benefits under the U.For example, certain officers who work for Federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.Postal Service, U.Mint, National Institute of Health and many more, receive lower pensions as compared to other law enforcement officers with similar responsibilities.  The Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act would expand the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' for retirement purposes to include all Federal law enforcement officers. The change would grant law enforcement officer status to the follow individuals: employees who are authorized to carry a firearm and whose duties include the investigation and/or apprehension of suspected criminals; employees of the Internal Revenue Service whose duties are primarily the collection of delinquent taxes and securing delinquent returns; employees of the U.S Postal Inspection Service; and employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs who are department police offices. These officers face the same risks and challenges as the men and women currently classified properly under Federal law as law enforcement officers, and they deserve the same benefits. We must pass this bill.  I am also a proud cosponsor of the Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship This legislation would increase the amount of Pell grant funds available to children of fallen law enforcement officers, firefighters, EMS workers, and fire police. First responders across the country put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. When most people are running away from danger, they are running towards it. For those who put themselves in danger on a daily basis, we must honor their sacrifice and support their families in times of tragedy. Helping children of first responders pay for an education is the least we can do to honor the sacrifice of someone who fell in the line of duty. We must pass this bill.  I am also a cosponsor of the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017, which I am pleased to say passed the Senate yesterday. We all know the stress and unique challenges police officers across our Nation face in doing their jobs. They risk their lives and are often exposed to traumatizing incidents. The Federal Government must do all it can to support police who suffer from trauma or other mental health issues due to the rigors and dangers of their job. The Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017 would direct the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Resources to provide support to State and local law enforcement to access mental healthcare services and make sure that hotlines are available for officers who are in need of help. I hope the House of Representatives takes up this bill soon and passes it.  I am proud to sponsor the Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act and cosponsor the Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act and Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness There is so much work for us to do to live up to our commitment to law enforcement across the country, and I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues on these critical issues.

11056,topic-id,1230,"Mr.President, April was Genocide Awareness and Prevention It commemorated some of the most horrific genocides and atrocities of the 20th century: the siege of Sarajevo in April 1992, the Rwandan genocide in April 1992; the Cambodian genocide in April 1975; and, the Armenian genocide in April 1915. Last, Yom Hashoah or Holocaust Remembrance Day fell during the month of April this year.  We must remember the past. And we must also be mindful of the present and the future. As we know all too well, criminal atrocities persist around the globe. In South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, a political and ethnic conflict is now in its fourth year. Tens of thousands of civilians were killed in mass atrocities and thousands more have fled the country fearing for their lives. In Iraq, ISIS has committed genocide against Yezidis, Christians, and Shiite Muslims, a determination made by former U.Secretary of State John Kerry last year. ISIS has killed, expelled, raped, and enslaved Yezidi men, women, and children in northern Iraq, and has committed similar atrocities against other groups living in areas under its control.  In Burma, the Rohingya Muslim community faces such severe violence and dehumanization, including slaughtering and sequestration, that many experts believe their suffering amounts to genocide. Moreover, in Syria, repeatedly, we see a government committing atrocities against its own people. Children are being gassed. Hospitals are being bombed. Innocent people are being tortured to death.  Too often, we have done too little, waited too long, or been caught unprepared by events that should not have surprised us. We continue to forget the lessons of the past and fail to live up to the post-Holocaust pledge of ``Never Again.'' Ignoring the genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity that continue to rage around the world sends a message to the global community that criminal atrocities are tolerable. We must do better to see that atrocities never again occur on our watch.  On April 7, I introduced the Syrian War Crimes Accountability Act, which expands the tools the U.government is using to document atrocities in Syria and hold President Bashar al-Assad and other perpetrators accountable. Today, under the heavy cloud of atrocities occurring in South Sudan, Iraq, Burma, Syria, and elsewhere, I am introducing another atrocity-related bill, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2017. This bill--named in honor of the courageous, inspiring Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel--strengthens the U.government's infrastructure to prevent and respond to mass atrocities, wherever they may occur.  I am here today to stress that our job, our responsibility, is to make sure the United States has the full arsenal of tools--diplomatic, economic, and legal--to take meaningful action before atrocities occur. The costs--both human and economic--of addressing these atrocities too late or after-the-fact are skyrocketing. The United States must do a better job of responding earlier and more effectively to these crimes--when warning signs begin to point towards possible atrocities occurring, and when strategic investments can have a greater impact in promoting stability and security. Essential to this effort is ensuring that the United States Government has structures in place and mechanisms at hand to better prevent and respond to potential atrocities.  Atrocity prevention has long been a bipartisan cause. In 1988, President Reagan signed implementing legislation allowing the United States to become a party to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of In the 2006 National Security Strategy, President George Bush highlighted the ``moral imperative that states take action to prevent and punish genocide.'' In 2008, the bipartisan Genocide Prevention Task Force, which was co-chaired by former Secretary of Defense William Cohen and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, stated: ``Genocide and mass atrocities . . . threaten core U.national interests.'' In 2010, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution recognizing ``the United States national interest in helping to prevent and mitigate acts of genocide and other mass atrocities against civilians, and supporting and encouraging efforts to develop a whole of government approach to prevent and mitigate such acts.'' In 2011, President Obama declared: ``Preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States of America.'' The same year, former U.Permanent Representative to the United Nations Samantha Power stated that preventing genocide ``required a degree of governmental organization that matches the kind of methodical organization that accompanies mass-killings.''  We need to continue taking proactive steps to enhance our Nation's capacity to quickly anticipate and address genocide and other atrocity crimes. I am introducing the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2017 to ensure that we do just that. I am joined in this effort by Senators Young, Tillis, Durbin, Rubio, Menendez, Murkowski, Blumenthal, Warren, Whitehouse, Gillibrand, Klobuchar, Shaheen, Franken, Peters, Coons, Stabenow, Booker, Markey, Brown, Baldwin, and This bill does a number of things. First, the bill authorizes the creation of a Mass Atrocities Task Force, which is a transparent, accountable, proactive, high-level, interagency body that includes representatives at the assistant secretary level or higher from departments and agencies across the U.The Task Force would work collaboratively with representatives of governmental as well as nongovernmental organizations to oversee the development and implementation of U.policy on atrocity prevention and response.  Second, this bill gives our Foreign Service Officers the training they need to recognize patterns of escalation and early warning signs of potential atrocities and conflict. With this training, we will, over time, build atrocity prevention into the core skillset of our people on the ground. They will be better equipped to see warning signs, analyze events, and engage early.  Third, this bill calls on the Director of National Intelligence to include in his or her annual testimony to Congress on threats to U.national security a review of countries and regions at risk of mass atrocities as well as, whenever possible, specific risk factors, potential groups of perpetrators, and at-risk target groups. With this information, Congress will be better informed and better able to respond to mass atrocities that are brewing.  Finally, this bill authorizes the Complex Crises Fund, which is a specifically dedicated portion of our foreign assistance budget for mitigating conflict. The Complex Crises Fund enables[[Page S3015]]us to rapidly respond to emerging crises overseas, including potential atrocities. We have already used the Complex Crises Fund to respond to crises in the Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Kenya, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere. Without this important tool, our ability to effectively prevent and mitigate crises is severely constrained.  Mr.President, this is a good bill. It does good things, and places the United States on solid moral ground. However, the moral argument is not the only reason to support this bill. We must also remember that America's security, and that of our allies, is impacted when civilians are slaughtered. Our security is impacted when desperate refugees stream across borders. Our security is affected when perpetrators of extraordinary violence wreak havoc on regional stability, destroying communities, families, and livelihoods. We have seen groups like ISIS systematically targeting communities because of their ethnicity or religious beliefs and practices, and yet, we still lack a comprehensive framework to prevent and respond to genocide and other atrocity crimes. So, let this bill act as our framework, and our call to action, so that when we use the phrase ``never again,'' we know that we are taking meaningful preventative action.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgS3011.txt,,FEDERAL AGENCY MAIL MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2017,2017.0,17.0,May

11243,topic-id,1421,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to speak about the rise of a failed state, Venezuela, and the manmade tragedy President Maduro has imposed on his citizens.  For 3 months, Venezuelans have taken to the streets in daily protests. They are speaking out against their country's economic collapse, against widespread food shortages, the disintegration of their medical system, against endemic corruption, and against a government that denies them their human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Appallingly, President Maduro has responded to the protests by unleashing his National As a recent Washington Post article stated, ``Mr.Maduro and the corrupt clique around him are hanging on by the brute force of tear gas, water cannons, mass arrests, and shootings by snipers.''  Since April, Venezuela's increasingly unstable crisis has left over 75 dead, thousands jailed, and thousands more injured. Yet, instead of listening to his people's legitimate demands and mitigating this tragedy, President Maduro is attempting to rewrite the Constitution, despite widespread opposition. Additionally, he declared this week that ``what couldn't be done with votes would be done with weapons.''  This is our hemisphere. This is a hemisphere that prides itself in democratic states, and here is the President of Venezuela saying he doesn't care what the voters say. With Maduro threatening to use arms against his people, one can only imagine the bloodshed and abuses will continue unabated.  Despite these threats, protests endure because Venezuelans see no alternatives. They have no other recourse against standing in lines for endless hours to scour the empty shelves at their markets. They have no other way to channel their sorrow over the spike in maternal and infant mortality rates in hospitals that lack supplies to treat the most basic diseases. They have no other way to express their outrage at the military profiting from corruption in food procurement contracts, even while children increasingly suffer the ravages of malnutrition.  Parallel to the protests, chaos is becoming commonplace. In the past 72 hours, the National Guard troops have stormed the National Assembly and assaulted opposition legislators. They came into the Parliament and assaulted the opposition. The supreme court has stripped the attorney general, Luisa Ortega, of her authorities for her criticism of President  We have seen lootings and the burning of government buildings. Alarmingly, a rogue police officer commandeered a helicopter and launched grenades and small arms fire while flying over the supreme court. These incidents from just the last 3 days should make it clear to all we are now dealing with a failed state in our own hemisphere.  As this crisis cripples Venezuela, I call on all sides to refrain from violence. I also want to recognize that the current situation is the product of 18 years of systematic efforts to dismantle Venezuela's democratic institutions.  Since coming to power, President Maduro--like Hugo Chavez before him--has filled the ranks of government with loyalists who have led the economy to hyperinflation and the brink of default. State oil companies like PDVSA, the country's only source of revenue, has been purged of its expertise. In a truly devastating blow to democracy and the rule of law, the judiciary has been entirely sapped of its independence so it now functions as a political appendage of the executive branch.  In the 18 months since the opposition coalition won control of the National Assembly--and I must tell you there was hope when we saw the voters in Venezuela enacted a new government in their Parliament--the supreme court has overturned every piece of legislation passed, gave itself authority to approve the national budget, and in April temporarily usurped the rest of the legislature's authorities, completely reversing the will of the people.  Additionally, as Venezuela's civilian and military justice systems have become accomplices to persecution and torture, the number of political prisoners has soared. Leopoldo Lopez, Judge Afiuni, Daniel Ceballos--these are just some of the more well-known names among the more than 350 political prisoners recognized by Venezuelan human rights NGO Foro These are people who are in prison as a result of their political beliefs.  It is no surprise the decay of judicial independence has led to an alarming rise in corruption and impunity. It is now a stated fact that senior officials have syphoned billions out of Venezuela and are engaged in the illegal drug trade.  In response, the United States has designated a dozen people under the Kingpin sanctions, including Vice President Tareck El Interior Minister Reverol was indicted in the United States last year for drug trafficking. Even Maduro's nephews were convicted in the United States on drug charges.  The sum of these trend lines is truly disturbing. Today, Venezuela is a failed state, where authoritarian leaders profit from links to corruption and drug trafficking, while the Venezuelan people are subject to precarious humanitarian conditions and human rights abuses. Against this backdrop, we require little explanation why more than 18,000 Venezuelans sought asylum in the United States last year.  We are all concerned about the flight of people at risk. What is happening in Venezuela directly impacts people trying to seek safety coming into the United If all this wasn't enough, in late 2016, Venezuelan State oil company PDVSA used its U.subsidiary Citgo as collateral to secure a loan from Rosneft, a company that is controlled by the Russian Government and is currently under U.sanctions. The result is, the Russian Government holds at least 49.9 percent of Citgo's mortgage and could come into control of critical U.energy infrastructure, including refineries, terminals, and a large network of pipelines. This should[[Page S3842]]concern every Member of the U. So the question for the United States and the international community is, How do we respond? What do we do? We cannot let this circumstance continue.  Thankfully, supported by a growing diplomatic coalition that includes Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru, Canada, and the United States, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, is marshalling international pressure. Mr.Almagro has called on President Maduro to heed the demands of his citizens, free political prisoners, permit the delivery of humanitarian assistance, commit to a timetable for overdue elections, and restore the authority of the National  However, despite Mr.Almagro's leadership, the results of last week's meeting of Foreign Ministers was a stunning failure to reach consensus on a hemisphere response. Appallingly, eight countries refused to vote their conscience, among them Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Trinidad, and They did not use the power under the OAS to recognize that Venezuela today is not living up to its charter commitment to be a democratic state. There is a process at the OAS to take action. They were unable to do that--a major setback.  As efforts at the OAS continue, all must remain clear that there are no alternative facts when it comes to Venezuela, there is just a manmade tragedy that demands collective action.  While providing full support for multilateral diplomacy, the United States must also lead. In May, I introduced bipartisan legislation to address the multifaceted crisis in My bill will authorize humanitarian assistance and require the State Department to coordinate an international approach to humanitarian challenges. The legislation will also provide strong congressional backing for OAS efforts, as well as funding for international election observers and civil society groups working to defend human rights and democratic values.  Given the rising instability in Venezuela, the bill would codify two lines of targeted sanctions against Venezuelan officials involved in corruption and undermining democratic governance--the very authorities the administration used to rightly sanction members of the Venezuelan supreme court last month.  Congress should act, as we have done in so many other places where we show congressional leadership to make it clear that this type of activity will not be allowed to continue and that Congress will take a strong position to give appropriate authority to sanction those individuals who are responsible.  Finally, the bill would require the State Department and U.intelligence community to prepare a report on the role of Venezuelan officials in corruption and drug trafficking.  As the instability in Venezuela grows, every day we decide not to act only makes the crisis worse. I urge my colleagues to work with legislation I have filed. Let's work with the Congress and the President to make it clear to the Venezuelan people they are not alone, and we will not tolerate a country in our hemisphere to become a failed state.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

11077,topic-id,803,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from New York for yielding, as well as for the tremendous work she and our staffs have done together on the Flood Insurance Affordability and Sustainability Act of 2017.  There is a capriciousness of flooding which makes the National Flood Insurance Program so important. You can have a mountaintop village next to a dry gulch. If there is a sudden flash flood, folks who have lived there 100 years suddenly find their 100-year-old homes destroyed. The NFIP helps rebuild the lives of those who are so affected.  The Flood Insurance Program is critical, not just to that mountaintop village but, by extension, our entire country. The economic impact of flooding extends far beyond real estate transactions to the fundamental vitality of communities and the workforce that operates our ports, develops and refines our domestic energy, and produces our seafood and agriculture for global consumption. It just makes sense.  Most towns started on the coast and on riverways because that is how goods were transported, and the history of these waterside communities is what makes them, one, economically vital, but, two, also makes them susceptible to flooding. I will note that the Presiding Officer's State of Pennsylvania, I believe, has among the most incidents of flooding in our country--principally because there are so many riverine systems. There is a valley with a river. If the water rises quickly, that riverside community is flooded. Look at my State of It relies on an accessible and affordable flood insurance program, but that benefits the country.  Louisiana is the 1 producer of offshore oil and gas, producing over 15 percent of our Nation's domestic energy supply. That is 15 percent of our Nation's domestic energy supply. It is home to the second largest refining capacity in petrochemical industry. The Gulf of Mexico is home to 11 of the top 20 U.ports by cargo volume, and we have one of the largest seafood industries in the world. After Hurricane Katrina, when our port facilities were affected and the farmers in the Upper Missouri suddenly could not get their crop to international markets, it shows the importance of our ports for our entire economy.  The National Flood Insurance Program allows folks in my State to participate in a working coast that gets that energy inland and gets those products in the international market, and this is what provides the value-added contribution to our domestic economy. Since the creation of the National Flood Insurance Program, people in Louisiana paid over $5 billion in flood insurance premiums, but, unfortunately, we have suffered some of the greatest losses after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustov, Isaac, and the flooding of the great Louisiana floods of last March and  While the NFIP has a deficit of $24 billion--according to FEMA's premium and payout data--the NFIP would have had a surplus if we remove the 2005 loss year, including the losses incurred after Superstorm I will also note that New Orleans flooded because federally built floodwalls designed to protect those businesses and families were constructed in a faulty way. This has been recognized, and their failure is what led to the expense. I am not here to say that NFIP doesn't need reforms--it needs reforms--but to underscore the fact that the program has worked for many years despite its failings. We need to reauthorize the NFIP and use the opportunity to improve the program, make it more affordable, transferring more risk to the private sector at a lower cost, increase investment mitigation, modernizing flood mapping to produce greater accuracy, and improve the transparency and accountability of all the participants that operate and administer the program.  There are a number of constituencies interested in long-term reauthorization of Senator Gillibrand and I know that the issue of flooding crosses party and geographical lines. We wanted to set the right bipartisan tone as Congress begins to debate the issue by introducing our bill, the Flood Insurance Affordability and Sustainability We hope the legislation will contribute to the ongoing discussion and work the committees of jurisdiction are conducting as we move toward reauthorization of the NFIP and with the needed reforms that enhance affordability and sustainability of the program.  Senator Gillibrand and her staff are passionate advocates for an affordable and sustainable flood insurance program. I am glad to work with her on this issue. We have listened to many stakeholders: bankers, realtors, homebuilders, flood plain managers, insurers, reinsurers, mapping experts, local government officials, financial experts and, most importantly, homeowners who work on our working coast and who have so much invested in making sure they can live and raise their families in a way which has protection from the capriciousness of flooding.

This legislation will ensure that Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and those who seek to help them, will suffer consequences for their bad behavior. Passage of this legislation is important to hold Iran accountable for its support for terrorism, human rights violations, and continued defiance of international treaties, including on ballistic missiles.  Today we are taking an important step toward holding the Iranian Government, including the IRGC, and anyone who seeks to support them, accountable for their bad actions. Anyone who contributes to Iran's ballistic missile program, supplies it with weapons, or assists the Iranian Government in their vast human rights abuses will be subject to sanction.  It is important to note that these sanctions do not violate the JCPOA and, in my view, strengthen the nuclear deal by showing our allies and Iran that the United States is serious about continuing to enforce violations of international law.  I am also pleased to see additional sanctions imposed upon Russia and North Korea in this legislation. The human suffering that North Korea has brought upon its own people is unimaginable. Such a depraved leader as Kim Jong-un getting his hands on nuclear weapons that can be used against American allies is an outcome that we simply cannot tolerate.  Finally, Russia engaged in an unprecedented attack against our democracy when it interfered in our 2016 election. This is the fundamental foundation of our democracy, our election, and we simply cannot allow any foreign power to interfere in our electoral process.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.111, which would repeal protections for our men and women in uniform and other everyday consumers against the use of forced arbitration by megabanks and other financial service providers.  Earlier this month, the CFPB finalized strong rules to protect the rights of hardworking Americans to band together in our justice system to hold corporate wrongdoers accountable. This protection is particularly critical for our Nation's men and women in uniform and their loved ones.  For over a decade, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, the Defense Department has warned Congress about the effects of forced arbitration in servicemembers' contracts. Often buried in the fine print of financial contracts, these clauses waive the rights of veterans and servicemembers to a day in court before a dispute even arises.  If these arbitration provisions were so beneficial to consumers and to servicemen and -women, why do you have to sneak these mandatory provisions into the contract?  There is overwhelming support for this rule among military service organizations who agree that forced arbitration clauses block access to the justice system and funnel the claims of servicemembers into private, costly arbitration systems.  Since the Second World War, Congress has continuously expanded and strengthened the rights and protections for servicemembers and veterans out of a sense of obligation that we must honor and protect our men and women in uniform.

Mr.Speaker, I commend the leadership for bringing this resolution to the floor, and I am proud today to be a Member of this body and speaking with one voice about Russian behavior and the need for sanctioning it.  Mr.Speaker, this Congress does not trust the President of the United States to manage U.S.-Russia relations.  Case in point--the first major legislative accomplishment of the Republican-led Congress in the Trump era will be a sanctions package[[Page H6266]]that limits, in every imaginable way, the president's ability to appease  President Trump and his administration have given the American public little reason to trust them on all things  The President obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey, the law enforcement officer tasked with investigating illegal collusion between the Trump campaign and  Attorney General Jeff Sessions potentially perjured himself by failing to disclose secret meetings with the Russian  Donald Trump, obscured a meeting he had with the Trump campaign's chairman, the president's son-in-law, and Russian operatives until the New York Times forced his hand and he had to publish emails that confirmed his collusion with individuals associated with Russian intelligence operations.  And now the president is attempting to intimidate his own Attorney General into prosecuting political opponents and upending the Russia investigation.  Today, we will pass this sanctions package, the strongest ever, and send a clear message to President Putin that there are consequences to invading peaceful neighbors and attacking American democratic institutions.  I reserve an important objection to the fact that this bill allows a waiver of Crimea-related sanctions on the condition that the Minsk agreement is being implemented.  Minsk does not mention Crimea, and therefore its implementation should have no bearing on the U.S.-led effort to combat the illegal and forcible annexation of Crimea sovereign Ukrainian territory.  However, I will vote for this bill because it sends a powerful and unified message to Russia, Iran, and North Korea at time when the foreign policy emanating from the White House is unsteady and confused.

11066,topic-id,752,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to our Nation's infrastructure. I am talking about our roads, our bridges, our rail corridors, our waterways and dams, the investments that over two centuries have made America great, the greatest economy in the world.  We have a long history of investing in the infrastructure in America, starting with the canal and rail systems in the 19th century, the highways and air transportation systems in the 20th century. However, over the last 25 years, we have lived off the infrastructure investments our parents and grandparents made in the previous generations.  Why? Because there has been a lack of political will here in Washington, D.C., to make new investments. But Congress, working with the President, must face this challenge head-on.  I believe there is bipartisan support for infrastructure investment, having been part of a bipartisan conversation this year with Members of Congress and with the administration. There is an attempt to offer a proposal to make major investments in our Nation's infrastructure.  We are talking about four different areas. First, there needs to be an incentive component. I strongly support incentivizing States and local governments to provide their own funding for these efforts. We know infrastructure projects move forward most effectively when local, State, and the Federal Government all do their part.  In the San Joaquin Valley in my district, Merced, Madera, and Fresno Counties have all increased their local sales tax to pay for critical transportation projects. Earlier this year, California enacted a bill to increase State gas tax and vehicle fees to provide over $52 billion over the next 10 years in California for much-needed transportation projects. And while more needs to be done in California, we know that, if we provide incentives across the country, States ought to come up and do their part as well.  The second focus of the administration's action is to support projects in rural areas. On Wednesday last week, the Agriculture Committee held a hearing in which we discussed strategic infrastructure investments in rural areas with a goal of increasing opportunities. The importance of investing in our rural areas cannot be overstated. Too often, rural America gets left behind in the infrastructure and development conversation. I know because I represent a large part of rural America in the San Joaquin Valley in  The third focus is transformative projects, projects that make creative and dramatic changes. I have always supported and will continue to support these projects, such as high-speed rail in California, California                              {time}  1030  Water is so critical to the West, especially in the San Joaquin Water provides the food that we have on America's dinner table every night. It is a national security issue.  These projects support deeper, systemic change, and they can have a large-scale and lasting impact on the future development of our They are investments in our future, like those our parents and grandparents made in the past.  Lastly, the administration talks about a loan program. These can be helpful.  Overall, I support these four components. But first we must not pick winners and losers when improving our Nation's infrastructure. This is, of course, very challenging. We need to have a policy that must rank priorities and decide how much we spend and where we spend.  We also must establish criteria to ensure infrastructure decisions promote fair distribution and cost effectiveness, doing the most good in critical areas.  Second, while I support public-private partnerships, they should not provide subsidies to projects that the private sector would already finance themselves.  Sound infrastructure is literally and figuratively the foundation of our Nation's economy. It is what has made America the greatest economy in the world. Countries around the world are making investments in their infrastructure while the United States sits on the sidelines engaging in a political debate that does not reflect the reality of the policy choice we have and the decisions we must make.  Mr.Speaker, we must come together as Democrats and Republicans to address these serious problems of our Nation's infrastructure, and as Americans in a bipartisan way because no transportation system, no water infrastructure system, no improvement in our energy grid, and all the other elements of our infrastructure are Democratic or They are the basis of an investment in America, and that is what we should be doing as Members of Congress with this administration.  So let's act as legislators. Let's act and show that we can work together in a bipartisan fashion. Let's show some profiles in courage.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgH6472.txt,1774,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY BUREAU,2017.0,27.0,July

10951,topic-id,917,"Mr.President, last year, a woman named Carol Denise Richardson was released from Federal prison after President Obama granted her clemency. She had been serving a life sentence for possessing and intending to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine, on top of having an already lengthy criminal record. She had not done anything specifically violent, so, theoretically, we should have been able to release her early and see good results, at least according to the advocates of criminal leniency.  Unfortunately, nothing good has come from this decision. Now, less than a year later, Carol Richardson is going back to prison. As part of her release, she was put on a 10-year probation, which meant she had to check in regularly with her probation officers, but she did not. She did not tell them she had left her job. She did not tell them she had moved. She did not even tell them she had been arrested.  Her latest offense, I should say, falls somewhere short of heinous. She was arrested in Pasadena, TX, for stealing $60 worth of laundry detergent so she could buy drugs.  From everything I have read in the news, it seems clear that Carol Richardson is not a serious, violent menace to society, but it is also clear she was not prepared to reenter society. She still had not kicked her drug habit. She still could not keep and hold a steady job. She still could not meet the most basic requirements of citizenship and basic adulthood.  But the real question is, Why would she be ready? Why would we expect that of her? She never went through the rehab that could have given her a second chance at life. Instead we just threw her in the deep end and watched her sink. That is why I think this story is worth mentioning, because I believe we should give pause to every advocate of criminal leniency.  They like to argue that taking people out of prison both heals communities and saves money. But who was better off once Carol Richardson was released? Not her community; she committed a crime within months. Not the taxpayers; they are still paying for prison costs. And here is the thing: Neither was she. She is back in prison yet again.  But, sometimes, the consequences are worse than this sad story. They are horrifying. Last year, a man named Wendell Callahan brutally killed his ex-girlfriend and her two young daughters. A frantic 911 call from the scene said that the two girls' throats had been slit.  These murders were an atrocity, and they were completely avoidable. Wendell Callahan walked out of Federal prison in August of 2014 after his sentence had been reduced in accordance with the provisions of sentencing guidelines made by the Sentencing Callahan's original sentence should have kept him in jail until 2018. If he had been in jail instead of on the streets, a young family would be alive today.  What the Richardson case, on one hand, and the Callahan case, on the other hand, show us are two things: First, if we are going to reform the criminal justice system, we shouldn't focus on merely reducing sentences. That doesn't do all that much to help our society. Instead, we should focus on rehabilitating people while they are in prison, whatever the length of their sentence. They need serious help if they can ever hope to redeem themselves and, once they are out of jail, stay out for good. And we should give them that help, not only because it is[[Page S3621]]good for them--though it is--but because it is good for us as a society. This is why I support real reform that will make our prisons safer for inmates and correction officers alike and take real steps to help inmates leave their lives of crime behind once and for all.  The second lesson is this: We need to know far more than we do now about how many people we release early from prison go back to a life of crime. What types of crimes do they commit? How many murders? How many robberies? How many drug arrests? Those numbers can be small or they can be large, but we need to know them to understand the full scope of our problem. And having that information will help the President decide each case as he considers when and how to use his pardon power.  But, today, the Federal Government doesn't even compile these data.  That is why I, along with Senators Hatch, Sessions, and Perdue, introduced a bill last year to require that the government collect and report on these numbers. Unfortunately, the bill did not pass into law. So I want to announce today that I intend to reintroduce the bill with a renewed sense of urgency. This is just one story, after all. We don't know how many people granted clemency are returning to crime. But that is all the more reason to start collecting more data. We need to thoroughly evaluate cold, hard evidence before we make any sweeping changes to our criminal laws.  Carol Richardson's story should warn us of the perils of letting ideology get the better of common sense. We owe it to our neighbors to keep their families safe, and we owe it to the Carol Richardsons of the world to give them a real and honest chance at life once they complete their sentence.

11020,topic-id,724,"Mr.President, September will mark the 60th anniversary of the Little Rock Nine, the nine African-American students who enrolled in the then-all-white Little Rock Central High School in 1957. Ask anyone who lived through the crisis, and they will tell you they remember it vividly. They may not have been there in person, but they remember the photos, those searing images of an angry mob, the stoic students, the bayoneted troops, all gathering in a high school, of all places.  Perhaps the most searing image is of Elizabeth Eckford, one of the nine who was then only 15 years old. She didn't get word that the other students were going as a group. She went alone in a simple black-and-white dress she had made just for the occasion. The mob baited her, menaced her, cursed her, some threatened to lynch her. She later said of her walk to the school's entrance: ``It was the longest block I've ever walked in my whole life.''  I think it is of the highest importance that we preserve their story and share it with our kids. It is a reminder of pretty sad times in our history and, more important, of the courage shown by nine young Arkansans, who helped our State and our Nation overcome deep-seated prejudices by appealing to the better angels of our nature.  We preserve historic battlefields like Yorktown and Gettysburg because we want our children to know what it took to gain and keep our freedom--the sacrifices made, the hardships endured. Equally important is preserving historic sites like Central High, where our citizens began the long road to freedom from oppression and intolerance.  That is why we made Central High School a historic site years ago, though with one oversight. There are seven homes across the street from the school. Their exteriors were in many of the pictures that are now so famous. There has long been a movement to preserve those exteriors so future generations will be able to see Central High exactly as it looked when the Little Rock Nine arrived to school.  I am proud to say that today I am introducing a bill with three of my colleagues--the senior Senator of Vermont Pat Leahy, Congressman French Hill of Little Rock, and civil rights legend Congressman John Lewis--that would do just that. It would extend the boundary of the Central High historical site to include these seven homes.  It would add about an acre and a half to the park, although I should say this bill would not authorize the Federal Government to take ownership of the homes and wouldn't allow the National Park Service to buy them in the future. Instead, it would simply encourage the homeowners and National Park Service to work together to preserve these homes so future generations could see them and learn from them. That is one reason our bill has the support of the homeowners, the Central High Neighborhood Association, and my State's historic preservation advocacy group, Preserve All three have written to me to express support for the bill.

11236,topic-id,1272,"Mr.President, we lost another great American this month with the passing of Arthur He received the Medal of Honor in 1945 for his service in the Pacific theater of World War His name may not be as familiar as it once was. In retirement, he lived a quiet life. I didn't want to let his death pass without paying tribute to him, his family, and the extraordinary acts of courage with which he defended our country. Although, to be sure, ``extraordinary'' doesn't really describe the half of it.  It was September 1944, and Private Jackson, a 19-year-old Ohio native, was serving with the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division on the island of Their mission sounded simple enough: Take the island as quickly as possible, inch ever closer to retaking the Philippines, and ultimately defeat  Simple it wasn't. His platoon was hailed by a steady stream of fire from a heavily fortified position. To charge forward would be to march toward certain death, and that is exactly what he did. He attacked a pillbox, holding about 35 enemy soldiers, and as his Medal of Honor citation reads, ``[P]ouring his automatic fire into the opening of the fixed installation to trap the occupying troops, he hurled white phosphorus grenades and explosive charges brought up by a fellow Marine, demolishing the pillbox and killing all of the enemy.''  The enemy fire continued unabated, his cover was light at best, and yet Private Jackson proceeded to storm one position after another--wiping out a total of 12 pillboxes and 50 enemy soldiers. It was a stunning act of bravery. I can only imagine the pride of President Truman when he pinned the Medal of Honor on Private Jackson's uniform. I can only imagine the awe of his fellow Americans as they showered him with ticker tape in a New York City parade to celebrate.  Yes, Arthur Jackson was one of the greats, and like with many great men, his career had a somewhat tragic ending. After a stint in the Army, he rejoined the Marines and was stationed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in September 1961. It was only months after the Bay of Pigs and just over a year from the Cuban Missile Tensions were high; suspicions were too.  On one night, then-Captain Jackson discovered a Cuban busdriver in a restricted part of the base. He wasn't supposed to be there, nor was he authorized to be there. The man had been identified as a spy for Fidel Castro's regime but was allowed to keep his job for the time being. Captain Jackson and a fellow officer escorted the man to a back gate to see him off the premises, only to discover the gate was locked. While the other officers went off to find tools, Captain Jackson pried the lock open, and, suddenly, the man lunged at him, aiming for a sidearm. Captain Jackson fired back in self-defense and killed the man on the spot.  Instead of reporting the man's death, however, he and some of his fellow Marines buried the body on the base. Many decades later, he told a newspaper columnist he feared, if he reported the death, he would be tried in a Cuban court and possibly tortured.  He had hoped no one would find out, but word got out, and he was forced to leave the Marine He ended life as a mail carrier in It was a disappointing end to an until-then brilliant career. This was a man who loved his country, who put everything on the line to defend it, and if one night that love blinded his judgment, it only shows the intensity of his commitment.  Arthur Jackson went on to work for the Veterans' Administration in San Francisco before moving to Boise, ID, in 1973. He lived out the remainder of his life there, where he was beloved by the community. As a neighbor of his put it, ``He flies the U.flag and the Marine Corps flag every day. It bothers him if someone flies a dirty or tattered flag. He tells them to take it down and replace it.''  A little thing with a big meaning: Arthur Jackson showed as much love for the flag as he did for our country, and now we lost him to the ages. We still have his memory, his example, his stories of derring-do, which will inspire future generations of Americans for decades to come.                      Remembering Joe Dale Burgess  Mr.President, I attended the signing ceremony at the White House last week for the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection It was a happy occasion, but I received some sad news.  A son of Arkansas who served in uniform passed away earlier this year at the far-too-young age of 31. His name was Joe Dale Though he was not widely known, he was especially well loved by all who did know him. Today I want to recognize him briefly for his service.  Joe Dale served in the U.Army--specifically, Delta Company, 2-506th Infantry Battalion, 101st Airborne Division; 2-506th, the same unit in which I served in  In March, 2008, he was deployed to Khost Province in Afghanistan, where he took the fight to the enemy for 12 straight months. He was a fearless soldier, but his platoon leader says what he will probably be best remembered for is being an awful comedian. He loved to crack jokes and play pranks, even though, as his best battle buddies attest, he didn't show a particular talent for either of them. He always got laughs, and he always lifted their spirits. When you are living in a war zone, I can tell you that counts for a lot.  But in his battle buddies' minds, Joe Dale means more than memories of sharing a few laughs. What stands out is his humility. His platoon leader says he was completely selfless. He did whatever was asked of him--no matter how unpleasant, no matter how tedious, how irritating, or how dangerous. He never lost sight of the mission. He never forgot why he was there, and it made an impression. Ask any one of his battle buddies what they think of Joe Dale, and you will not get a bad word out of them, not one in the whole bunch. His platoon leader says: ``We would all gladly serve with him again.'' That is a pretty good measure, the quality of a troop.  I am sorry to say Joe Dale, who endured a tour of duty that cost the lives of seven soldiers in his company, died in April of testicular cancer. It had spread to his spine, which after several surgeries left him paralyzed. He suffered several other afflictions: PTSD, pain in his joints, trouble sleeping. He didn't ask for care or a disability rating from the VA until it was too late.  It seems so unfair that this man--a man who braved the mountains of the Hindu Kush, a man who was awarded the Combat Infantryman's Badge and the Army Commendation Medal--ultimately succumbed to disease at home at such a young age. In fact, it seems almost cruel because he left behind a fiancee, Alice Hart, and a 2-year-old daughter, Zoe Hart-I suppose we must remember that the Lord God in Heaven has His own purposes, and He works in His own mysterious ways.  To see the outpouring of love for this man--a quiet man, a humble man, a man whose only ambition was to serve his country--it tells you, indeed, that Joe Dale Burgess was one impressive man.

(3) Consumers should be able to clearly identify the      company with which they are transacting business online.

11060,topic-id,385,"Mr.President, the travel and tourism industry is a pillar of Montana's economy. Our wealth of public lands, first-class fishing, hiking and skiing, and our breathtaking natural landscapes make Montana a special place for people to visit. Last year alone, visitors to Montana spent $3.46 billion in our state. And Montana is not alone. The travel and tourism industry plays a significant role in the United States economy as well, contributing over $503 billion to the U.GDP just last year.  With advancements in technology and the increased use of online marketplaces, travelers have the ability to do more research, plan trips, and book reservations online. Online platforms allow customers to compare thousands of brands in one place and as a result the number of hotel reservations made online has surged over the past several years, many of which are on legitimate third-party websites. However, as the ease and number of online bookings has increased, so has the number of online booking scams.  Illegitimate reservation sellers pose as hotel websites, leading consumers to believe they are booking directly with the hotel, when in fact they are booking with an unrelated third party. Transactions on these sites can result in additional hidden fees, loss of expected loyalty points, or even confirmation of reservations that were never made. One study found that as many as fifteen million bookings a year are affected by fraudulent websites. In Montana, you expect to get what you pay for. When you book a hotel online only to find out you are not on the list when you arrive, you not only lose your money, but you lose the positive experience tourism awards.  That is why I am proud to introduce the Stop Online Booking Scams Act of 2017 along with my colleagues Senators Nelson, Fischer, and This bill requires third-party sites to disclose that they are not affiliated with the hotel, providing clarity and transparency to consumers booking online. It also empowers State attorneys general to pursue cases on behalf of consumers who have been scammed. Providing clear disclosures that reveal the true identity of websites will give confidence to the millions of consumers who make reservations online every year. I ask my colleagues who have not yet done so to join me in cosponsoring this much-needed legislation. Thank you, Mr.                                ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgS3011.txt,2138,MODERNIZING GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,17.0,June

Last week at Ogden, UT, the Grizzlies won the Big Sky Conference softball championship for the first time in the school's history. This accomplishment is highlighted by the fact that the softball program is only in its third year on campus. Four years ago, there was no team or coach; today they are conference champions.

11197,topic-id,537,"Mr.President, student loan borrowers currently carry about $1.4 trillion in student loan debt. This breaks down to about 44 million borrowers holding student loan debt with an average balance of $30,000. This crushing debt has pushed many borrowers to delay important life decisions, including marriage, having children, or buying homes. Despite that, some still choose careers in public service to give back to their community and support our country.  However, the immense burden of student loan debt is not put on pause while individuals choose to forgo other work opportunities to serve our Nation in the military or public service. Recognizing this, the Federal Government established two ways to alleviate some of this burden for those who serve our country.  The Servicemember Civil Relief Act protects our servicemembers from interest rates above 6 percent on all loans while they are on Active This protection extends to both public and private student loans taken out preservice.  Public service loan forgiveness encourages people to become public servants by forgiving student loan debt after 10 years of public service, including military service. Under this program; borrowers must enroll in a qualifying repayment plan and make 10 years of payments while working in public service before the loan is forgiven. Additionally, borrowers with Perkins or Federal Family Education Loans must consolidate their loans into a Direct Consolidation  However, the act of consolidating these loans carries an unintended consequence for servicemembers. Currently, if a servicemember chooses to consolidate his or her preservice loans to qualify for public service loan forgiveness, those loans are no longer eligible for the 6 percent interest rate cap provided under the Servicemember Civil Relief The act of consolidating old debt for the purpose of enrolling public service loan forgiveness is treated as creating a new loan under current law, effectively forcing servicemembers to choose between the 6 percent interest rate cap while they are on Active Duty and enrolling in a program that will forgive their loans after 10 years of service and steady payments.  Requiring servicemembers to give up the interest rate cap while on Active Duty for a chance to earn loan forgiveness in the future was never the intention of Rather, in enacting the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and the Servicemember Civil[[Page S4417]]Relief Act, Congress intended to support servicemembers burdened with student loan debt. We owe it to our servicemen to fix this unintended consequence.  This week, Senator Duckworth and I reintroduced the Servicemember Student Loan Affordability This bill would allow preservice private or Federal student loan debt to be consolidated or refinanced while retaining the 6 percent interest rate cap. This minor change to the law will have a significant impact on servicemembers with student loan debt by allowing them to get the benefits Congress intended for them.  The bill is supported by the American Legion, the Association of United States Navy, the National Guard Association of the United States, the Retired Enlisted Association, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, Veteran Education Success, The Institute of College Access and Success, and the National Education  I urge my colleagues to consider this simple solution to help servicemembers. I hope they will join Senator Duckworth and myself and support the Servicemember Student Loan Affordability                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4416-5.txt,326,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY BUREAU,2017.0,27.0,July
11097,topic-id,337,"Mr.Speaker, if you listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle, they are going to tell you that having access to a lawyer in a court is a bad thing, but it is the foundation of American justice. The foundation of American justice is that, if somebody rips you off, you can sue them in court.  These arbitration clauses are the fine print, Mr.Speaker, that you find in these contracts that say, if you have a dispute with this particular company, you can only go to arbitration. And these arbitrators are almost always picked by the company themselves.  The fact is this is not justice. It is a railroad court. It is not a real court, and consumers are less well off. That is why over 100,000 individual consumers across the country wrote in to support the rule during the public comment period.  If my friends on the other side of the aisle are right, how come they don't have 100,000 people saying that their position is correct?  The people have spoken. They have engaged in the comment period and said: We want to be able to go to court to hold these people accountable.  Wells Fargo ripped off literally hundreds of thousands of In 2 million transactions, they opened up accounts people never asked for.  If you sue them, you might just be limited to an arbitration clause, which limits your award, and they pick the judge. Why not be able to join with other Americans and sue in court the good, old-fashioned way: get some discovery, get some money back, get some justice? This is what it is all about.  We believe that the American people deserve to take them to court if they take your money and rip you off. That is what we are standing up for today.  This is nothing but a U.Chamber, Big Business giveaway that they are talking about. We stand on the side of American consumers.

10971,topic-id,615,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I want to, first of all, thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for all the hard work that has gone into this legislation so far. I want to especially thank our chairman, Ed Royce, who has been my partner on this committee for nearly 5 years. We have passed excellent legislation. The legislation today just adds to it, and it shows what you can do when you work in a bipartisan way, so I want to thank the chairman for all his hard work and all his courtesies.  Mr.Speaker, I support this bill. I certainly plan to vote for it, but it seems we may be on the floor before we have ironed out all the differences with the other body. I hope that is not the case.  In particular, there have been issues with the North Korea sanctions. It was another Royce-Engel bill, which already passed in the House and, frankly, should have been taken up by the other body on a separate track; instead, it is now put into this bill. I hope we don't face further delays when this bill gets back to the other  Our job isn't done, obviously, until we get this thing across the finish line; and we need to do that because this bill is critical to our national security.  It does far more than just send a message to leaders in Russia, Iran, and North It exacts a heavy price for their aggressive and destabilizing behavior.  Just like the bill we already passed, this legislation would update and expand our sanctions on North Korea, closing loopholes that have allowed money to flow to the Kim regime, funding its illegal weapons program. It would crack down on the trading partners, banks, and shipping vessels that enable the regime, and go after the regime's most lucrative enterprises, whether exported goods or the pilfered wages of North Korean laborers sent abroad to work.  With respect to Iran, this bill would go after so many of the things Iran's leaders do to drive violence and instability, from Tehran's ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism to the regime's abhorrent human rights record and efforts to build up its military. I have said this again and again, that we need to hold the regime's feet to the fire on all these issues. This bill does exactly that.  Finally, on Russia, this bill is a strong, direct response to Vladimir Putin's efforts to undermine American democracy. It imposes new sanctions on those who want to do business with Putin's cronies or with Russia's military or intelligence. It strengthens existing sanctions for Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and armed intervention in eastern It pushes back against Russia's cybercrimes, including the hacking of our election to help Donald Trump--a story which Congress and the special counsel are still trying to get to the bottom of--as well as Putin's support for the murderous Assad regime in And it gives Congress a strong oversight role in making sure that these Russian sanctions are not lifted prematurely.  This administration has shown over and over that they are willing to cozy up to Putin, but here is the truth: Russia is not our ally. Putin wants to harm the United States, splinter our alliances, and undermine Western democracy. This Congress will not allow him to succeed, so I am glad to support this bipartisan bill.  I thank the chairman once again. We need to keep working to make sure this bill gets to the President's desk.

11071,topic-id,513,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce the Affordable Health Insurance for the Middle Class Act, a common sense fix to improve affordability of health insurance on the individual market. I am pleased that Senators Hassan, Warren, Harris, Baldwin, and Leahy have joined this bill as original cosponsors, and I appreciate their support.  Since its implementation, the Affordable Care Act has helped to expand health care and control out-of-pocket costs for millions of Over 20 million people who were previously uninsured now have coverage, there are no yearly or lifetime limits on coverage, and no one can be denied coverage or charged more based on their gender or because of a pre-existing health condition. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the individual marketplace, through which 18 million people currently get their coverage. Individuals who make between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, and who do not have affordable employer coverage available to them, can receive a tax credit subsidy to help pay for insurance on the individual market. This credit limits the cost of insurance at 9.69 percent of an individual's income.  However, someone who makes just one dollar above the income threshold immediately loses all federal assistance. This `cliff' unfairly impacts middle-income Americans who are by no means wealthy, but who make just barely too much to qualify for the tax credit. I am particularly concerned about my constituents between the ages of 50 to 64, who are facing higher premiums as they age and who need access to health services but are not yet eligible for  To address this issue, the Affordable Health Insurance for the Middle Class Act would eliminate the current cliff, and instead gradually phase out federal assistance based on income. Nobody would pay more than 9.69 percent of their income for insurance, and once someone's premium fell below this threshold, they would no longer receive federal assistance.  For example, in my hometown of San Francisco, a 60-year-old making $50,000 currently pays $946 per month for the second-lowest cost Silver plan and does not receive federal assistance. Under this bill, their premium would be capped at $404, or 9.69 percent of their income, and the tax credit subsidy would cover the rest. This bill would create a fairer and more predictable system, ensuring that consumers on the individual market know just how much their insurance will cost and will have affordable options available. The Affordable Care Act has reduced costs and expanded benefits for many Americans, and it is critical that we build on this progress to further improve the law--not destroy it.  The bill is supported by a number of organizations, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, AANS, Child Welfare League of America, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, CNS, Families USA, Lung Cancer Alliance, and National Farmers  This legislation is a simple fix that provides relief for middle-income[[Page S3331]]Americans and strengthens affordability protections for coverage through the individual market.

11075,topic-id,1460,"Mr.President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley in introducing the Trafficking Victims' Protection Act of 2017.  Last week, I met with a remarkable group of anti-trafficking stakeholders in Fresno, California, who reinforced what I have long held to be true: stamping out the horrific crime of human trafficking must be among our top priorities as lawmakers. At our meeting, Central Valley law enforcement, service providers and, most importantly, survivors of human trafficking educated me about the nature and prevalence of sex and labor trafficking in the Central I learned that counties like Fresno and Tulare serve as key stops along major California trafficking circuits, with victims as young as 10-years-old being shipped to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and beyond. I also learned that in 2016 alone, Fresno Police arrested more than 140 sex buyers and traffickers. This tells me that the demand for trafficking is far too high. Central Valley law enforcement and service providers are working together to reduce this demand, crack down on traffickers, and better serve victims, through a unique, highly-coordinated and victim-centered approach that I believe ought to be emulated nationwide.  Over the past seven years they have teamed up to identify and critically to provide comprehensive services to nearly 500 trafficking victims. When Central Valley law enforcement took down a trafficking ring last year, the ring leader and two of his associates were arrested and prosecuted, and approximately 50 victims were rescued, including 23 children. These victims were all provided with wraparound services, and the ring leader was sentenced to 40 years in prison. This is the kind of coordinated, victim centered work we need to support and replicate nationwide. The Trafficking Victims' Protection Act of 2017 aims to do that.  I have now met with law enforcement, service providers and survivors representing Southern, Central and Northern All have made one thing abundantly clear: lawmakers at all levels of government must commit whatever time and resources are needed to thwart this horrendous crime.  Over the past two decades, Congress has taken action to combat human trafficking. We passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and, 8 years later, passed the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization And two years ago, Congress passed the Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act--a landmark piece of legislation. The law focuses on reducing demand, rescuing victims, educating law enforcement and judges, and making sure that trafficking enterprises are put out of business. But it is clear that our work is far from done. The human trafficking industry continues to be one of the biggest criminal enterprises in the world and it is constantly evolving. The use of the internet to sell children for sex has escalated dramatically over the past several years.  In my home State, District Attorney Nancy O'Malley and her pioneering anti-trafficking team identified 47,719 internet users looking to purchase sex in Alameda County alone during a single month. Many of the victims posted on these sites are underage. In one survivor study, a staggering 75% of minor sex trafficking victims reported being bought or sold online. And last year, the Washington Post reported devastating accounts about human trafficking is also committed by Islamic State fighters, who sell young girls over platforms such as  The bill that Senator Grassley and I have introduced includes a provision that would give to law enforcement an additional tool to prevent human traffickers from accessing the internet and other tech platforms to sell minors for commercial sex. Under current current law, it is a criminal offense to advertise commercial sex acts with a minor. This legislation would add civil injunction authority to the criminal provision, providing the Department of Justice with a more readily accessible tool to deny human traffickers access to tech platforms to commit trafficking crimes. The bill also supports and strengthens efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to human trafficking crimes.  It allows school resource officers at schools to train school personnel to recognize and respond to signs of child sex trafficking. This is important because kids are often recruited at schools. In one heartbreaking case in Oakland, California, a 12-year-old student with top grades suddenly changed her normal behavior. She stopped completing her assignments, became withdrawn, and began wearing provocative clothing. Eventually, she stopped going to school altogether. Her parents contacted the school looking for her, but no one was able to locate her. She was discovered 24 hours later on an online sex advertisement based out of Los This 12-year-old girl had been groomed by a trafficker--but no one was able to recognize the signs of exploitation. Teachers and school personnel interact with these kids every day. They are critical in recognizing which kids are at risk or are about to become exploited. We need to be sure that they are familiar with the patterns and practices of human traffickers, and know how to identify and respond to suspected victims.  In addition to working with Chairman Grassley on the reauthorization[[Page S3337]]bill, I am also pleased to cosponsor Senator Cornyn and Senator Klobuchar's Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017. One of the most important provisions of this bill is the mandatory designation of at least one Human Trafficking Justice Coordinator in each United States Attorney's This is critical to ensure that our judicial system treats human trafficking offenses with the seriousness they deserve. Among other responsibilities, this Coordinator will be responsible for assisting in the prosecution of human trafficking cases. This includes the prosecution of those who solicit minors for commercial sex, a change in the law that was enacted in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking  In 2015, former United States Attorney Eileen Decker conducted one of the first federal prosecutions of a buyer under this new statute. The buyer, a 59-year-old man from Torrance, admitted to lying to federal prosecutors about his conduct with a 16-year-old girl he met online and hired for commercial sex acts. He was sentenced to 57 months in prison. Former United States Attorney Decker remarked that this case should serve as a warning to adults who engage in this type of criminal conduct.  It is critical that such prosecutions continue. Stemming the abuse and exploitation of trafficking requires confronting not only the predatory suppliers, but also those who solicit young girls for commercial sex. The designation of a Human Trafficking Justice Coordinator would ensure that those who violate human trafficking offenses, both buyers and sellers, are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The Human Justice Trafficking Coordinator would also be responsible for ensuring the collection of restitution for victims.  Restitution for trafficking victims is mandatory under federal law. Moreover, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act requires the Justice Department to train prosecutors to seek restitution for trafficking victims, regardless of whether the victim requests restitution. Yet, we continue to see our judicial system failing to do right by victims. In a 2015 law review article, the Human Trafficking Pro Bono Legal Center reported on the appallingly low rates of restitution orders in human trafficking prosecutions. In a study of federal human trafficking cases brought over a four period, federal courts failed to order restitution in nearly two-thirds of cases involving sex trafficking offenses. And shockingly, they found that the victims least likely to obtain restitution orders were children trafficked in the sex industry. Less than one in three defendants who commit sex trafficking offenses against children were ordered to pay restitution to their victims. This is unacceptable.  Furthermore, even if restitution is ordered against a trafficker, restitution itself is not being effectively collected. In response the requests from the Judiciary Committee, the Attorney General included restitution order and collection data in the Department of Justice's report on trafficking for fiscal year 2015. Of the $4,268,358 ordered in restitution in 2015, only $987 was collected.  While we may not expect to see full restitution collected in the year it is ordered, it is shocking that the total restitution collected is less than 1% of what was ordered.  That is why we have tried to include additional restitution provisions in the bill to better support victims. For example, there is an additional provision in the bill to update the Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2015, a bill that I authored with Senator That bill mandated extensive training on restitution for prosecutors and judges. It is our hope that with these updates--and with the recent enactment of the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 to make sure that prosecutors are held accountable in seeking restitution--victims will be better supported going forward. I am hopeful that we will be able to pass these bipartisan bills this I urge my colleagues in this body to support the passage of this important, comprehensive legislation to protect trafficking victims.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgS3329.txt,1332,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,7.0,July
11069,topic-id,793,"Mr.President, I rise to speak in support of the Customs and Border Protection Hiring and Retention Act, or CBP HiRe  In recent years, U.Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, has had a lot of trouble recruiting, hiring, and retaining personnel to adequately staff the border and our ports of entry. Today, CBP is nearly 1,000 officers below the mandated staffing levels. The Border Patrol, whose duty it is to secure 6,000 miles of borderlands, suffers from a shortage of more than 1,800 agents. These shortages persist, despite ample backing and funding from Congress and the threat they pose to both national security and trade-reliant communities and economies, particularly in my State of This has been frustrating for border communities across the country, but it is especially problematic for Arizona, a State that depends on both border security and a lot of cross-border trade.  For example, the Nogales port of entry in Southern Arizona is one of the busiest ports in the United It processes approximately $2.5 billion worth of produce each year. Arizona alone does about $15 billion in trade with Mexico alone, every year. Mexican shoppers spend about $8 million in stores in Arizona every day.  However, the port currently is suffering from a 23-percent shortage of CBP officers. Our ports cannot effectively and efficiently facilitate the flow of commerce across the border without adequate staffing.  One of the biggest challenges in both retaining and hiring new officers and agents for frontline positions has been the remoteness of CBP installations. CBP officers and border agents are often stationed in geographically remote and isolated locations. This likely contributes to the fact that, of those leaving the agency, nearly 30 percent of Border Patrol agents and over 10 percent of CBP officers are lost to other agencies.  Massive staffing shortages aside, CBP is barely able to hire fast enough to fill the jobs left by departing agents and officers. So we have great needs that are not being filled, but we also have attrition we simply can't replace. In fact, CBP hires only 1 out of every 64 applicants for officer positions, and 1 out of every 113 applicants for Border Patrol agent positions. This means that less than 2 percent of applicants manage to get through CBP's hiring process. The situation at CBP today is simply unsustainable.  Congress can't sit idly by as slow hiring rates and accelerating attrition threaten the security of our borders and the underpinnings of our economy. To that end, I am pleased to introduce my CBP HiRe Act with Senator[[Page S3330]]Heitkamp from North This legislation would streamline the hiring process and allow the CBP to finally bring more agents and officers into frontline positions.  Importantly, this bill gives CBP new tools to recruit and retain personnel in remote and hard-to-fill locations. This includes special salary rates and recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives.  In addition, the bill will eliminate bureaucratic redtape by giving CBP the authority to use direct-hire authority and to expedite the hiring of qualified applicants. Right now, the situation is that they have to deal with other Federal agencies and get virtually every incentive and program they want to approve and need to approve to hire more officers. They have to run it up the flagpole so many times with Federal agencies that it simply takes too long.  Lastly, the bill prevents CBP from disclosing an applicant's polygraph results with another Federal agency or non-Federal employer. Challenges relating to the administering of the polygraph have resulted in approximately 65 percent of the individuals failing the test.  Think about that. People who are in another law enforcement position, even those who have taken a polygraph before just a year or two prior--many of them fear that a false positive on a polygraph exam might impact their ability to move to another Federal agency if that is disclosed. If you have a polygraph, which can't be used in courts of law because it is not perfect or nowhere near perfect, then Federal agencies shouldn't be able to forward that to other Federal agencies. It acts as a big disincentive for people to apply for these positions because a false positive on a polygraph exam might imperil their chances to work for another Federal agency or to work in law enforcement later in their career. This also creates a disincentive, as I mentioned, for individuals to want to be hired by  In Arizona, safety and prosperity are inextricably linked to CBP's ability to secure the border and facilitate trade. The CBP HiRe Act will give CBP the tools and flexibility necessary to accomplish these missions.  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan solution, and I look forward to seeing it move through the Senate without delay.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgS3329.txt,1633,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,7.0,July

This practice undermines a consumer's right to be compensated for damages, particularly when they get nickeled and dimed by the fine print in financial contracts.  Class actions often represent the only realistic option for consumers who are ripped off to the tune of a few dozen or a few hundred dollars, and they reduce the burden on the courts by consolidating claims, thereby saving money for both plaintiffs and defendants.  Opponents of the CFPB's rule hope that, by prohibiting the consolidation of claims, they can make potential damages so small that the individual claims are not viable.

11076,topic-id,695,"Mr.President, I thank the senior Senator from Louisiana for working with me on the flood insurance bill that we are introducing today. This issue is so important to both of our States because both of our States have experienced enormous levels of flooding every year due to extreme weather.  In New York, after Superstorm Sandy hit our State, millions of homes and businesses were damaged by flooding that occurred. My colleague from Louisiana could go on and on and will tell you about flood damage his own constituents have had to endure, so it should be clear to everyone here that it is not a partisan issue.  Flooding can happen anywhere, in any State, from the Northeast to the gulf coast and everywhere else. Protecting our communities from the devastation that comes from flooding should be one of our highest priorities in this  Unfortunately, the National Flood Insurance Program has not been doing its job very well. Too many families who have had their properties damaged in a flood or even destroyed in a flood have paid their flood insurance premiums year after year only to find out there was some loophole that prevented them from getting the coverage they need. We cannot turn our backs and allow this to keep happening.  The bipartisan bill I have written with the Senator from Louisiana would ensure that flood insurance is more affordable for homeowners. It would make sure the Flood Insurance Program is no longer riddled with loopholes that leave our homeowners stranded and fighting with insurance companies on their own, all while trying to recover and rebuild from the flood damage. It would finally give homeowners the peace of mind that flood insurance rates will actually be affordable so that low- and moderate-income homeowners are not priced out of their homes because of extreme rate increases.  Our bill would also fund more projects to protect homes and communities from flood risk in the first place. Our bill would more than double the amount of funding a homeowner can receive for raising the elevation of their home, which is a proven way to protect against floods in certain areas, and it would provide more funding for FEMA's flood mitigation program. Those funds are used by States and local communities to plan and carry out projects that help manage flood risk to homes and other structures.  After Superstorm Sandy hit New York, too many families in my State experienced what amounted to a disaster after that disaster. They encountered engineering fraud. They had to deal with excessive delays and widespread underpayment of claims. This was shameful and totally unacceptable, especially for a program specifically designed to help people in their greatest time of need. So I am particularly pleased that this bill would fix some of the fundamental flaws in the National Flood Insurance Program's claims and appeals process that harmed so many of my constituents.

It would repeal the onerous earth movement exemption, which too often has been used to deny flood claims to families who desperately need the payments after a flood.

11144,topic-id,3124,"Mr.Speaker, I just want to thank my friend for pointing out the Consumer Financial Protection  One thing about that group, when I was a judge, or assistant DA, if you needed somebody's banking records, then you would have to get sworn evidence--normally in affidavit form--and take it to a judge, and there had to be sufficient detail in the affidavit to establish--again, under oath--that a crime had probably been committed and that the person whose banking records we were seeking had probably committed the crime.  If that could be done, then the judge would sign the warrant. Like my years as a judge handling felony cases, there were some warrants I turned down. There is just not enough particularity here. There is not probable cause that this person committed the crime, or I don't see probable cause that a crime was committed. But, normally, law enforcement was good about making sure that probable cause was there, and the DA office would help them.[[Page H4909]]  But the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has come in and it has basically begun to challenge the Internal Revenue Service for acting in the most unconstitutional ways. It may be a toss up now which one uses more unconstitutional authority than the other.  For the CFPB to gather people's financial records when there is no evidence that they committed a crime, no evidence that any crime had been committed--they just gather evidence, purportedly, to make sure nobody is taking advantage of people--well, that is not the way our Constitution works. It is supposed to be that if a bank or a lender takes advantage of an individual, then the individual can complain; then their banking records can be obtained.  But for a governmental entity to just gather people's financial records, it is not just Orwellian; it is outrageous, and it needs to stop. And as my colleague, Mr.Palmer, was pointing out, they have gotten--it was set up back when the Democrats had the majority, and they intentionally set up this governmental entity that would basically be beyond control by the They intentionally set up a group that could make a living hell for individuals or for banks, for others, because it is the government and it is gathering people's records.  And then along comes--you had ObamaCare get passed. Well, in order to help people, just like the CFPB--and for my liberal friends, that is sarcasm--well, you are going to get everybody's healthcare records, that way the government can help people better because they will have all of their records.  Well, some people, some liberal left-leaning folks would say: Well, we call that helping people. We gather all of their medical records and we gather all of their financial records so we can help them. But those who are Libertarian, Conservative, we don't consider that helping; we consider that abusive, and we don't need it.                              {time}  1800  One of the great honors and developments since I have been in Congress has been the development of a friendship with just an absolutely great patriotic He is a friend of mine, and he has come twice to sit in my seat in the gallery, most recently to hear President Trump deliver a State of the Union  Here is a story by Sean It is entitled, ``Pull the plug on the Mueller-Comey witch hunt.''  It says: ``Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is turning into a witch hunt and it needs to be shut down immediately.  ``Ex-FBI Director James Comey, who admitted sparking the probe by leaking information to The New York Times, is nothing more than a calculating, cunning partisan political hack at home in the D.swamp. During last week's hearing, Comey admitted that he intentionally gave a memo to his friend hoping it would lead to appointment of a special counsel.  ``'I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter,' Comey told lawmakers. `Didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. And so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.'  ``What Comey is admitting to under oath cannot be overlooked here or understated. His end goal was the appointment of the special counsel, which just so happens to turn out to be his longtime friend, Robert  ``By leaking information, Comey could be putting himself again in serious legal trouble. If those memos were classified--and several legal experts are arguing they are--Comey may have broken the law. Comey created those memos on government computers in a government truck, making it property of the U.Government, not James In addition to that, there are nondisclosure agreements that the FBI rules that exist that Comey also could have violated.  ``Leaks aside, Comey's relationship with Mueller is a massive conflict of interest. It is why it is time to now shut down this political witch hunt that is really aimed at stopping the President, delegitimizing him and hopefully, in the minds of some, making sure he gets thrown out of office. It is that serious.  ``We have a guy, Comey, who is beyond disgruntled and angry after being fired by the President and now one of Comey's closest friends is leading the investigation as the special counsel. I don't care if you are left, right, Republican, Democrat, does that sound fair, honest, objective to you? Of course not.  ``Conflict of interest rules disqualify Mueller from being special counsel in a case involving his pal. And if that is not bad enough, four members of Mueller's team have donated to  ``Not to mention, why did James Comey wait until his hearing last week to actually mention the fact that Loretta Lynch, the then-Attorney General, tried to interfere with an FBI investigation? He testified that she instructed him to soft-pedal his investigation by calling it a `matter.' This on top of her infamous meeting on the tarmac with Bill  ``The real collusion that Mueller is never going to probe is not with President Trump and the Russians, it appears to be between the Clinton campaign, the Obama administration, Loretta Lynch and James Comey.''  And I would add Mueller himself.  ``Let's pull the plug on this witch hunt and go after the real lawbreakers.''  So that is from FOX  Mr.Speaker, it is extraordinary what has come out. I already knew before all of this started that Robert Mueller--a great patriot who served this country in the Vietnam war, Bronze Star for courage and bravery--but he got into government, and he apparently wanted nothing but yes-men. He wanted yes-men and -women. He didn't want people who had been around for a while that could point out when he had a suggestion that was going to lead to trouble. He would rather have the trouble than have anybody point out such things. So he created a policy he called the 5-year, up-or-out program.  We have FBI offices all over the country and local law enforcement that I have worked with so many times through so many years. And, as people know, you will have bad apples in every crowd, but I would submit that when you are talking about law enforcement, the percentage of bad apples is dramatically lower than you find in the general population at large. We are greatly blessed in that respect. But with all of the massive number of employees with the Department of Justice, Mueller has this 5-year, up-or-out policy.  So if you were in a supervisory position of any kind for 5 years anywhere in the country, then at the end of the 5 years, you had to uproot your wife and your children--your family--and you had to move to Washington and be a minion among minions in the office here at the Department of Justice; or, if you weren't willing to uproot your family in the communities where they had gained so much credibility and were considered such an important part of law enforcement in the area, then you had to get out of the It is not that you weren't absolutely priceless and invaluable to law enforcement, it is that Bob Mueller did not want your experience where you might ever question him.  So as an article--I believe it was in The Wall Street Journal--years ago pointed out, under his leadership, the FBI lost thousands upon thousands of years of experience. So we keep having people get killed around the country, and people wonder: How did the FBI not pick this up? How did the FBI not recognize this?  Well, I recall when I got out of law school and I was an assistant DA, I would see criminal defense attorneys. I would think in my head--I would know in my head--I knew a whole lot more law than they did. Heck, I had won moot court; won a trip to London, England; at Baylor Law School, I won an award for best brief award--for that I had a partner. I won an award for a Law Review article on torts that I did. Gee, I was coming up against lawyers who hadn't won awards in law school like I had. So I am going: gee, this ought to be pretty easy. They are not near as smart as I am when it comes to the law.  What I learned rather quickly in courtroom work is that knowledge of the law is extremely helpful, but experience is even more helpful: getting a feel and an understanding of human nature, learning to pick up different signs[[Page H4910]]from people, what they think about different things, when they are holding something back; when you are cross-examining somebody, when to know to keep going or when to know to stop. There are a lot of things you pick up over questioning thousands of people.  Somebody right out of law school that knows every bit of the law is going to have a hard time competing with somebody that has a tremendous amount of experience in the courtroom with human nature.  That is true of law enforcement. I have known law enforcement that just had an incredible knack for just knowing when people were lying. It is amazing to see some of our great law enforcement at work, as I have through my career.  But FBI Director Robert Mueller didn't want them around. After you have been in a supervisory position for 5 years or more, you either come to Washington and take up your little cubicle or get out. Again, Robert Mueller did incalculable damage to the FBI, to its experience, to its ability to root out and find criminals. That experience that he ran off from the FBI was absolutely incalculable. It is just priceless.  He also spent millions on a software program. Many tried to tell him: Wait, you have got us inputting stuff in a system that is not going to work. It doesn't fit our needs.  I don't know if he had some relative there he got it from, why he was so sold on this terrible program. People tried to tell him, but those are the people he wanted out. He didn't want anybody questioning his brilliant intellect.  As a result, they wasted a massive number of hours by FBI employees and wasted the millions that were spent on the program trying to make the program work. Later they had to scrap it. Why? Because he was talked into a bad program, and he wouldn't listen to anybody that tried to tell him about the problems.  We also know that one of the reasons we continue to have people who were on the radar of the FBI--even questioned by the FBI--continue to get away with murder, literally, or be able to commit murder in America and commit terrorism involving murder, is because Robert Mueller tried to make radical Islamists who hate America and who want to overthrow our way of life feel better. So he brought in people to purge our training material in the FBI so that we wouldn't offend radical Islamists who want to kill us.  Michele Bachmann and I reviewed much of the material that was purged. Lynn Westmoreland viewed some of it and he had to go, but it involved hours going through.  Unfortunately--and obviously it was intentional--but the FBI, under Mueller, classified the purged materials so I couldn't have a blowup poster here to show something very important that FBI agents would need in order to understand radical So they classified that so I can't bring it down here and show people. Once again, the damage that FBI Director Robert Mueller did to the FBI was basically incalculable. I mentioned before, one of our intelligence guys said: We were blinded of our ability to see our enemy.  We have Robert Mueller to thank, or CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, that is always there to rush in and have a press conference after violence and say: We don't support this kind of violence.  Though, clearly, when the evidence is reviewed, the Council on American-Islamic Relations--individuals involved in CAIR--ultimately wants to see sharia law as the law of the land. There are principals that should have been prosecuted as supporting terrorism.                              {time}  1815  There were scores of people that were listed as co-conspirators in supporting terrorism. Instead of pursuing those after the Holy Land Foundation trial convicted the principals involved--I think it was over 100 counts of supporting terrorism--instead of being alerted and being more on his guard, FBI Director Mueller bent over backwards more and more to accommodate those who want to see Sharia law take over America and be the law of the land, scrapping our  At one time it was considered treason to want to scrap the Constitution and replace it with anything, but in Bob Mueller's America, people that wouldn't mind seeing the Constitution go away and be replaced by Sharia law, you want to develop an outreach program for those people.  So instead of going to the Boston mosque, where the Tsarnaevs surely had to have indicated and shown signs of being radicalized, Robert Mueller and his FBI went to the mosque as part of an outreach program to make merry and play patty cake with people who could have established, if they were honest, that the Tsarnaev brothers had indeed been radicalized, the information from Russia was correct.  Yet because, under Bob Mueller's leadership, the training materials were purged, FBI agents didn't know what they were looking for. They didn't know what scriptures in the Koran were referred to, were quoted by people who had been radicalized.  They had no idea what to look for in speaking to Kim Jensen, who prepared over 700 pages of training materials so people in the FBI could learn radical His training materials were banned. They were supposed to have been destroyed, but after it became clear that the FBI could not recognize radical Islamists, that Mueller had done so much damage in regard to training FBI agents, it was finally decided that we kind of need to get somebody back in here and get some materials back in here so maybe we don't keep getting people killed in the country after we are alerted to somebody who has been radicalized as an Islamic terrorist and we let them go because we don't know they are radicalized because FBI Director Robert Mueller prevented our FBI from being trained to recognize radical  I know there are some people who--not because they are aware of his virtues, but have heard other people say he is a great guy--just extoll his virtue, not realizing the kind of damage that has been done.  As I mentioned last night, Mr.Speaker, you look at the damage that James Comey and Robert Mueller--really tight friends--have done to the country to an extent I didn't even realize until we started looking at the article by Mollie Hemmingway in The Federalist, which is rather breathtaking, and I had no idea until I read that.  According to the article, Comey talked a very fine man, John Ashcroft, into recusing himself so he would not appoint a special prosecutor to find out who leaked the fact that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent. He commits to Ashcroft: Recuse yourself and I will find somebody good.  Mr.Comey likes to talk about conflicts of interest, unless they apply to himself.  So Ashcroft recuses himself, and Mr.Comey, who convinced him to do so, looks high and low: Who could we possibly find to investigate and prosecute whoever it was that leaked information about Valerie Plame? Oh, how about my very dear friend, Patrick Fitzgerald, who happens also to be the Godfather of my child?  So he likes to talk about conflict of interest and chummy relationships, unless they are his chummy relationships, in which case he just puts them in places which appear to be clear conflicts of interest. Which is no surprise that he was supportive and even manipulative in creating what appeared to be a need for a special prosecutor, which actually there was not a need for a special prosecutor at all. He just leaked information. There was a good chance he probably violated the law. He certainly should have violated his FBI employment agreement.  Memos that he prepares as part of his job regarding meetings he had as part of his job, those should belong to the FBI under an employment agreement. I am sure that he has seen Presidents for whom he has worked take their own memos and take them back and use them to write books. Perhaps that is what he is thinking: I will take my memos that I personally prepared and I will be like a President and I will save my memos and use them to write a book.  Of course, it turns out, with regard to this one memo that he wrote about his conversation with President Trump, he consulted with other members of the Justice Department, who all need to be fired, and colluded with them to figure out what should be done.  There is no question these people are smart, or they wouldn't be where they were. They knew that if there was an obstruction of justice in which Trump[[Page H4911]]had engaged, then they would have to report it. Failing to report it would be a crime. They didn't. So we know there was no crime. What we know is they were conspiring and colluding to hurt the President of the United  So we don't need a special prosecutor. We certainly don't need He has done enough damage. It is time to let the special prosecutor go that Comey needlessly created.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgH4908-2.txt,1801,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,13.0,July
11133,topic-id,218,"Mr.Speaker, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have worked long and hard to preserve the availability of fair, affordable arbitration to consumers. Hearings before the Judiciary Committee have demonstrated repeatedly that arbitration allows consumers to resolve disputes quickly, fairly and at lower costs than litigation. It also helps consumers to preserve relationships with companies with whom they contract, by avoiding the acrimony of litigation.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Arbitration Rule threatens to undo all of that, not to benefit consumers, but to benefit one special interest--the plaintiffs class-action trial bar.  By prohibiting consumers and companies from contracting to arbitrate individual matters, rather than litigate disputes through class actions, it ensures a steady stream of class-action litigation--and handsome class-action attorneys' fees--for the trial bar. But for consumers, it burdens their freedom of contract, subjects them to long, drawn-out class-action litigation, and sets up scenarios in which large portions of any recoveries they obtain will go, not to them, but to class-action lawyers with whom they are forced to deal.  For companies, meanwhile, the Rule threatens to force them into choosing whether to continue to fund their arbitration programs or, instead, to shutter those programs to preserve funds for high-dollar class-action defense.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution and against the CFPB's special-interest, anti-consumer rule.  ",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6268.txt,446,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,25.0,July
11074,topic-id,683,"Mr.President, this week, I am introducing a bill known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017. I want to thank Senators Feinstein, Cornyn, Klobuchar, Corker and Rubio for joining as original cosponsors. I also want to thank the many organizations that support this bill and worked so closely with us on its development; they include Rights4Girls, Polaris, the ATEST Coalition, Shared Hope International, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators, and the National District Attorneys  As its title implies, our legislation is aimed at combating the terrible scourge of human trafficking in the United To call trafficking victims' suffering a grave violation of our most basic human rights would be an understatement. Trafficking is a life-shattering crime that too-often goes unnoticed, despite the profound injury it inflicts on its victims and our society. Traffickers typically operate in the shadows, making it hard to identify them as well as their victims. That invisibility makes it harder still to rescue the victims and bring the perpetrators to justice.  But there are some things we do know about human trafficking, and we know them with some certainty. We know, for example, that trafficking is happening in rural areas, in cities, and in the suburbs. It is not confined to any[[Page S3336]]one area, because it has become so profitable. It has become a problem of national significance.  To be sure, we have made some strides in combating this terrible crime since the passage of the original Trafficking Victims Protection Act, or TVPA, over 15 years ago. The TVPA, last reauthorized in 2013, authorizes some very important programs to help victims. The bill I'm introducing this week updates and extends a number of these programs, which are under the jurisdiction of the Departments of Justice and Senator Cornyn this week is introducing a complementary bill that would reauthorize other TVPA programs, including those at the Departments of Health and Homeland  This is not the first time we have collaborated on this subject. Two years ago, Senator Cornyn sponsored, and I cosponsored, another important measure, known as the Justice for Victims of Trafficking As chair of the Judiciary Committee, I made that 2015 law's passage a top priority for our Committee and fought for its enactment. It established a new fund to help cover survivors' services and also equipped law enforcement with new tools to fight traffickers. The services authorized under this 2015 statute are crucial to helping survivors rebuild their lives with dignity.  The bill that I am introducing this week is a critical next step in ensuring that human trafficking is prevented, its perpetrators prosecuted, and its victims protected. This bill, drafted with bipartisan support, would require more training for investigative personnel at the Departments of Justice and Homeland It also extends a grant program by which school personnel can receive training to recognize and respond to signs of trafficking in our educational system.  This bill also offers increased assistance to prosecutors and law enforcement agencies in their fight against human trafficking. For instance, it authorizes the Secret Service to offer investigative and forensic assistance to other crime fighting agencies. And it updates key provisions of the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which authorizes the important work of the National Center for Missing and Exploited The Center operates a cyber tipline by which internet service providers can report child sexual abuse.  Additionally, the bill I am introducing signals Congress' continued support for services available to trafficking victims who cooperate with federal law enforcement in trafficking investigations. Specifically, the bill authorizes an Office of Victim Assistance within the Department of Homeland This office, which is staffed with specially trained victim assistance personnel, plays a crucial role in securing victims' cooperation with trafficking investigations.  Finally, this bill would promote the collection of more data on trafficking, and it would promote increased coordination among the federal agencies engaged in combating this crime. Meaningful partnerships at the federal level can help expand awareness, leverage expertise, and facilitate creative solutions.  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

We have made good progress, and we will keep working. As we do, our focus will remain on the major ObamaCare problems that continue to hurt Americans all across our country.  Under ObamaCare, premiums have skyrocketed. Over the past several years, ObamaCare has caused premiums to climb by an average of 105 percent in the vast majority of States on the Federal exchange, and it has caused them to triple in some  Next year, ObamaCare is expected to raise premiums again, as high as 30 percent or greater in States like Connecticut and Virginia, by as much as 40 percent or greater in Maine and Iowa, and by as much as an astonishing 80 percent in New Obviously, Americans deserve a lot better than that.  Under ObamaCare, choices have diminished, even disappeared, in States all across our country. ObamaCare has left 70 percent of counties with little or no insurance options on the exchanges this year. Even worse, next year, dozens more counties could have zero choice at all--potentially leaving thousands trapped, forced by law to purchase ObamaCare insurance but left without the means to do so. For instance, as we learned just yesterday, as many as 14 of Nevada's 17 counties could now be left without any insurance options under ObamaCare at all in 2018. Americans deserve a lot better than that.  Under ObamaCare, mandates have forced families into plans they don't want or can't afford, preferred doctors have become less accessible to many[[Page S3838]]patients, and plans have grown less desirable but more extensive. Americans deserve better than that. That is why we are continuing to work hard. Fixing ObamaCare's failures and protecting families from its consequences is not an easy task.  It is disappointing that our Democratic colleagues made clear early on that they were not interested in joining our efforts in a serious, comprehensive manner, especially given how many of their constituents have been hurt by the law they themselves voted for and continue--continue--to defend. The Republican conference continues to work through solutions to help those who have been hurt by this failing system because, as we can all agree, ObamaCare's status quo is simply unsustainable and unacceptable.

I rise in support of the Russia, Iran, and North Korean Sanctions  Mr.Speaker, I particularly want to highlight the provisions that are the product of the hard work of the Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit The inclusion of these provisions will undoubtedly assist our government's anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing efforts.  For instance, this bill includes language directing the President, acting through the Secretary of the Treasury, to develop and maintain a national strategy for combating the financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit financing.  The opportunistic nature of terrorist groups, combined with the emergence of financial technology, creates new challenges for our law enforcement community and their efforts to disrupt terror finance.  The national strategy should also seek to enhance partnerships with the private sector that prevent and detect illicit financing, and increase efforts to facilitate compliance with our anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing laws.  I would like to commend Congressman Ted Budd for introducing the National Strategy for Combating Terrorists, Underground, and Other Illicit Financing Act, which is almost entirely incorporated in section 2 of the underlying legislation.  I would also like to recognize Congressman Pearce and Congressman Pittenger, the chairman and vice chairman of the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee of our committee, whose leadership on these issues has been instrumental to achieve the legislation that is before us today.

Mr.Speaker, hardworking Americans want something different in their Nation's They want to change the toxic culture in Washington, D.C., that for far too long has allowed unaccountable bureaucrats to overreach and overregulate.  The best way we can change Washington is to begin to drain the bureaucratic swamp, but it is not easy because we have seen in the last 6 months the swamp fights back. The most recent example of this is a rule issued by one of the swampiest of Washington bureaucracies, the Orwellian-named Consumer Financial Protection  We all know that this is a rogue agency with a checkered past, chock-full of rampant allegations of abuse, racial and gender discrimination, and Big Government nannyism, which constantly makes credit more expensive and less available to hardworking  Mr.Speaker, so radical is this agency and so extreme in lacking accountability that a three-judge panel of the D.Circuit Court of Appeals declared the Bureau's governing structure unconstitutional.  Now, this unaccountable bureaucracy has joined forces in an unholy alliance with one of the Democratic Party's favorite special interest groups; namely, the trial lawyers lobby. And this unholy alliance will specifically deprive consumers of a low-cost, easy way to resolve legal disputes that can be accomplished without hiring trial attorneys.  What the Bureau and the wealthy trial lawyers want is to take away arbitration for consumers and, instead, force them into class action lawsuits, which just so happens to require consumers to hire the very trial lawyers who will benefit most from this rule.  Americans were promised a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but, instead, they obviously got a trial lawyer enrichment bureau.

Mr.Speaker, making consumers pay more for less is the exact opposite of consumer protection, but it is exactly what this regulation means for every  This regulation will perpetuate a justice gap that takes away a quicker, less expensive legal option for low-income and middle-income  Even the CFPB's own study says this: the Bureau's own study found that 87 percent of the class actions it examined resulted in no consumer benefit whatsoever. In the mere 13 percent that actually provided some benefit, Mr.Speaker, the average payout per consumer was $32.  How much did the trial attorneys make?  31,000 times that amount.  So, again, Mr.Speaker, we have an average payout of $32 for the consumers and millions for the trial attorneys. So no wonder the powerful trial attorneys lobby is so eager to see this rule go into effect.  The Bureau's own study also concludes that arbitration is less expensive for consumers and up to 12 times faster than litigation.                              {time}  1530  Consumers who obtain relief in arbitration recovered in a CFPB study an average of $5,389. Again, Mr.Speaker, compare that to $32 the average consumer received under the CFPB study.  Now, we are about to hear from some Members on the other side of the aisle that somehow consumers will lose their day in court and that somehow big banks will be helped. The CFPB's own study shows that not a single class action it examined, not a single one, resulted in trial by a judge or a jury. So no consumer got his or her day in court under the Bureau's preferred class actions. Instead, we know consumers are far more likely to obtain decisions on the merits in arbitration.  With this rule, we once again see our colleagues in the other party hurting small community banks and credit unions. I have a statement that has been published already from the Independent Community Bankers of They are not Wall This is small town community banks, and their statement says they strongly oppose the CFPB rule.  Also, I have a statement from the Credit Union National Association--again, Mr.Speaker, not Wall Street, but credit unions, our neighborhood credit unions. They say that the CFPB's rule will limit options for resolving disputes and could increase the number of frivolous lawsuits and that credit union members ``could suffer when costs rise and resources are depleted as a result of this rule.''  Indeed, the CFPB, itself, estimates its final rule will increase costs for American businesses over $1 billion per year. That is money that our community banks and credit unions won't be able to lend to our small businesses, to our families, and to American workers.  The CFPB's rule is bad for consumers, it is bad for community banks, it is bad for credit unions, and it is bad for our economy. Washington should be focused on creating more jobs, not more class action lawsuits.  So, Mr.Speaker, it is time to fight the bureaucratic swamp. It is time to pass the resolution offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.Rothfus). I appreciate his leadership in helping protect consumers instead of enriching trial lawyers.

Mr.Speaker, since 1925, this institution, the United States Congress, has recognized the right of consumers to engage in arbitration, which we know for so many consumers is their avenue for redress of grievance. We know that this has been upheld on multiple occasions by the Supreme We have almost 100 years of precedence. And now this rogue agency, the Orwellian-named CFPB, decides to promulgate a rule, and it is not even an agency. Mr.Speaker, it is one unelected, unaccountable individual who has decided that Americans no longer have the right to contract, they no longer have the right to decide that they would prefer to arbitrate instead of go through a class action lawsuit.  Mr.Speaker, let's let people know what this is truly about. What this is about is the trial attorneys relief act. Theirs are the voices that we are hearing on the other side of the aisle, and we are hearing them loud and clear, because what we know is that, in class action lawsuits, consumers end up with almost nothing and the trial lawyers make out like bandits.  Even in the CFPB's own study, they figured out that those who go through class action are doing well to get $32.35, yet the trial lawyers make out with millions. We also know in the CFPB's own study that those who went through arbitration ended up with settlements of $5,389.  Mr.Speaker, here are just a couple of different class action lawsuits that have happened recently. A Dell Computers class action lawsuit: $500,000 for class members, $7 million for the lawyers; Subway sandwiches: $50,000 for the class members, $500,000 for the trial attorneys.  Oh, here is a good one, Mr.Speaker, Coca-Cola class action: $0 for class members, $1.2 million for the lawyers; L.Fitness International: $7,000 for class members, $200,000 for lawyers.  Mr.Speaker, the American people are not foolish. It is time to drain the swamp and to start off with the bureaucracy that is taking away their rights to have dispute resolution through arbitration. They are tired of seeing others go and kowtow to the trial lawyers lobby in this town to give them what they want. It is time to make sure that Americans' consumer rights can be protected, and so it is time that we pass this Congressional Review Act for all  ",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6268.txt,1749,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,25.0,June

I have said this before and I will say it again: Mr.Royce, as chairman, and Mr.Engel, as ranking member, are an example for, frankly, all of us on how to work together productively in a bipartisan fashion to reach a result that is good for our country, for our people, and indeed for international security.  I also want to thank Senators Cardin and Corker for their leadership and their involvement.  This legislation is the product of very careful and sometimes difficult negotiations on a bipartisan basis. It is a strong, tough, and appropriate response to Russia's attempts to meddle in our election process, its support for violent separatists in Ukraine, its illegal occupation of Crimea, and, yes, its unhelpful activity in  It also imposes new sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program, which threatens the United States, our Gulf allies, and  Russia's power comes from its ability to coerce other nations by its energy distribution, in many instances. This bill seeks to make it harder for Russia to use that type of coercion, and empower other nations to join us in standing up against Russian aggression. These sanctions will only be successful, however, if they are truly bipartisan and if Congress continues to play its important and necessary oversight role.  Democrats and Republicans are coming together on this bill, Mr.Speaker, to ensure that the President cannot alter sanctions toward Russia without congressional review. This is critical at a moment when our allies are uncertain about where this administration stands with respect to Russian aggression.  I remain open to additional sanctions on Russia's energy sector at a later date if the Russian leader and his associates fail to heed the message of this bill that their business as usual cannot and must not continue.  Once this bill passes the Senate, as I believe it will, Russia will know that sanctions levied because of its malevolent acts will be lifted only with the concurrence, either tacitly or expressly, of the Congress of the United There will be no side deals or turning a blind eye to its actions.  This legislation, Mr.Speaker, will also make it clear that Russia's interference in Ukraine comes with consequences, and it puts pressure on Iran to end its ballistic missile program.

11051,topic-id,679,"Mr.Speaker, at the end of the week, President Trump will reach his 100th day in office. These first 100 days, unfortunately, have been defined by chaos, contradiction, and conflicts of interest, and he has broken campaign promise after campaign promise.  He claimed he would be the greatest jobs President God ever created, yet he has failed to put forward a single jobs bill and is taking credit for jobs that were created or announced long before he took office.  He said he would fight for working families, yet his budget would slash investments that create jobs and opportunities. He said he would drain the swamp, yet he refuses to release his taxes, which would shed light on his own conflict of interest.  Washington is now practically drowning in the swamp President Trump has rained down on our He promised to balance the budget in 9 years. It took him, unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, less than 30 days to abandon that pledge, and his most recent proposals--tax cuts--would plunge our Nation even more deeply into debt.  But perhaps most emblematic of the failure of this Presidency's first 100 days was his attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and purportedly to replace it.  The President has promised insurance for everybody--not access, insurance for everybody. He said that over and over again. But TrumpCare would do exactly the opposite, kicking 24 million people off their coverage and precluding millions more from being able to get health insurance.  The President promised coverage that is much less expensive and much better, but TrumpCare would force Americans to pay more for less. Not my observation--the Congressional Budget Office's.  The President promised he wouldn't cut Medicaid, but like so many other broken promises, TrumpCare cuts Medicaid deeply. As was true of the President's campaign, he brought no unity to his attack on America's health, and his plan was not even voted on. Indeed, that has been followed by Republican efforts to make their proposal even more draconian.  The second 100 days looms even worse as the Trump White House continues to be focused on kicking Americans off their coverage and making the rest pay more and getting less, saying it intends to bring an even more draconian version of its TrumpCare bill back.  Mr.Speaker, Republicans control both the House, the Senate, and the administration. They are now, theoretically, the governing party, and whatever happens to our healthcare system on their watch will be their responsibility.  So as this administration reaches its 100th day in office, it has a choice. It can continue to rack up the failures that it has amassed or it can turn the page to constructive cooperation.  The President can, contrary to his promises, keep trying to take health coverage away from the American people and make it more expensive, or he can set partisanship aside and work across the aisle to make sure the Affordable Care Act works for everyone.  We ought to be working together to accomplish that objective. He must start by ensuring that the promised cost-sharing reduction payments under the Affordable Care Act are made. If he does not, millions of people will be deeply hurt, the insurance system will be destabilized, and Americans across this country will find their policies more expensive.  On jobs, he can continue doing nothing or he can finally show the American people a plan to invest in jobs and infrastructure. Send us the legislation you promised, Mr.And he can keep hiding his tax returns from the American people and ducking and weaving when it comes to his ties to Russia, or finally draw the curtain back and show what he has been hiding and support a bipartisan, independent commission to seek the answers Americans deserve and America must have.

11093,topic-id,341,"Mr.Speaker, let's talk about a stacked deck: trial attorneys putting cash over conscience. That is not the answer that we are in search of, but it is the answer that others who are opposed to this certainly are.  The CFPB, the so-called Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has a study itself that shows that consumers who actually use arbitration reach more favorable outcomes than those who are roped into lawsuits with cash-starved trial lawyers.  It is astounding that only 13 percent of these lawsuits provide any benefit to actual consumers, but the Bureau is still pushing this ill-advised rule. Arbitration decisions also come much more quickly for consumers. Again, the Bureau's own study concludes that arbitration decisions come 12 times faster than lawsuits.  So let's review quickly: a faster, more favorable outcome for consumers versus helping trial lawyers line their pockets. This should not be hard.  In fact, Mr.Speaker, according to the D.Circuit Court, unelected Bureau Director Cordray has more unilateral authority than any other single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the entire U. Congress must begin to use its authority to hold this agency accountable for its anticonsumer policies and actually provide the checks and balances that our Founders would have intended. That is the stacked deck that we have right now, folks.  The Bureau's flawed arbitration rule does absolutely nothing to protect the consumers it is charged with protecting. Instead, it is nothing more than a windfall for trial lawyers and well-connected Washington elites. The[[Page H6272]]rule's only accomplishment will be to create more class action lawsuits, lining trial lawyers' pockets with more cash while providing no real protection to consumers.  This anticonsumer rule will have the effect of making consumers wait longer for worse decisions as they seek resolutions for their disputes. In no way, shape, or form does this rule actually do what the Bureau was created to do: protect consumers.  This CRA is an important step in allowing Congress to rein in this rogue agency.

11029,topic-id,2721,"Mr.Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.2227) to modernize Government information technology, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.2227       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Modernizing Government      Technology Act of 2017'' or the ``MGT Act''.     2. FINDINGS;       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:       (1) The Federal Government spends nearly 75 percent of its      annual information technology funding on operating and      maintaining existing legacy information technology systems.      These systems can pose operational risks, including rising      costs and inability to meet mission requirements. These      systems also pose security risks, including the inability to      use current security best practices, such as data encryption      and multi-factor authentication, making these systems      particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber activity.       (2) In 2015, the Government Accountability Office (GAO)      designated Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and      Operations to its biannual High Risk List and identified as a      particular concern the increasing level of information      technology spending on operations and maintenance, making      less funding available for development or modernization. The      GAO also found the Government has spent billions on failed      and poorly performing information technology investments due      to a lack of effective oversight.       (3) The Federal Government must modernize Federal IT      systems to mitigate existing operational and security risks.       (4) The efficiencies, cost savings, and greater computing      power offered by modernized solutions, such as cloud      computing, have the potential to--       (A) eliminate inappropriate duplication and reduce costs;       (B) address the critical need for cybersecurity by design;      and       (C) move the Federal Government into a broad, digital-     services delivery model that will transform the ability of      the Federal Government to meet mission requirements and      deliver services to the American people.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:       (1) Assist the Federal Government in modernizing Federal      information technology to mitigate current operational and      security risks.       (2) Incentivize cost savings in Federal information      technology through modernization.       (3) Accelerate the acquisition and deployment of modernized      information technology solutions, such as cloud computing, by      addressing impediments in the areas of funding, development,      and acquisition practices.     3.

11031,topic-id,433,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of my bill, H.2227, the Modernizing Government Technology Act, or the MGT  Each year, the Federal Government spends over $80 billion a year on information technology, with nearly 75 percent of that directed just towards operating and maintaining existing IT systems. Couple this with innovation and management strategies that are decades behind the private sector when it comes to IT, and the increasing cost of maintaining these aging and insecure systems, this is unsustainable.  These systems pose increasing operational and security risks for the Federal Government, as we saw with the devastating OPM data breach, which impacted over 20 million people.  As we see cybersecurity attacks on the rise across the globe, it is imperative that we modernize and protect our information technology systems. The American people deserve better from their government, especially on an issue that is completely solvable. Our government needs to be able to introduce cutting-edge technology into their networks to improve operational efficiency and decrease operational cost.  This bipartisan IT reform package is designed to reduce wasteful IT spending and strengthen information security by accelerating the Federal Government's transition to modern technology, like cloud computing. This legislation is an innovative solution and a tremendous step forward in strengthening our digital infrastructure.  This bill passed the House on voice vote last year and passed out of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by voice this year. Unfortunately, we ran out of time on this bill last Congress with the Senate, but we have an opportunity to act this year with an improved bill.  H.2227 authorizes two types of funds to modernize legacy IT and incentivize IT savings in Federal agencies. The bill authorizes funds within individual CFO Act agencies, and it authorizes a centralized fund located within Treasury and overseen by The two funds will incentivize IT savings and reward cost-sensitive and responsible chief information officers.  Under MGT, savings obtained by Federal agencies, by doing things like streamlining IT systems, replacing legacy products, and transitioning to cloud computing, can be placed in a working capital fund that can be accessed for up to 3 years for further modernization efforts.  This approach eliminates the traditional use-it-or-lose-it approach that has plagued government technology for decades. This approach to technology investments will transform government technology by keeping our information and digital infrastructure secure from cyber attacks while saving billions of taxpayer dollars.

11037,topic-id,802,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy), the distinguished majority leader.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, before the minority whip departs, I want to thank him for his work on this. This has really been a bipartisan effort, and it is really putting the country first. The gentleman is correct: This might not make headlines, but this will have a greater effect on our government being more efficient, effective, and accountable. We thank him for his work on it.  Mr.Speaker, there are some things we get used to hearing, but when you think about it, it is amazing just how much things have changed.  I hear a friend say that all of the photos he took on his phone automatically updated to his cloud--not surprising there. But how long ago was it that we couldn't even take pictures on our phone, much less have them saved automatically on a cloud?  Nowadays, it is not uncommon to cash your checks online, manage your accounts on Mint, pay individuals back online. Many millennials don't even carry cash anymore. That is a revolution in money management that just happened in a matter of years.  So, Mr.Speaker, why in the world would the Department of Defense use a 54-year-old system as a backup to send and receive emergency messages for our nuclear forces, a 54-year-old system that relies on floppy disks? Why would the master file of the public's taxes at the IRS run on a 1950s code?  Eighty percent of the $80 billion we spend each year on IT is used to maintain legacy systems, to buy expensive parts that nobody uses anymore for a 54-year-old system we shouldn't even have.  We would expect more from the private sector. We would expect mobile cameras, cloud computing, online banking. Heck, we would even expect to upgrade our phones and apps and[[Page H4265]]technology on a rolling basis every single week. Well, why should we expect less from the Federal Government?  I would say this is about more than expectations. We all saw what happened over the weekend with the massive global cyber attack: hospitals shut down, transportation systems. This is a government service issue. It is a government waste issue. It is a national security issue.  Now, government may never be like Silicon Valley, but it should not be stuck in the age of ``Mad Men.'' That is not only costly, it is dangerous.  Will Hurd, an individual that has served his Nation in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, an individual who worked in the private sector when it came to technology, an individual who serves in this body and, I will say this based upon everybody else I have served, probably has the most bipartisan approach of anyone I have ever seen serve in that position--he doesn't care about party. It is just as the time when he worked in the He cares about his country. He has seen the most deadly things happen, and, through his technology company, he has seen that people fight wars new ways.  So he took it upon himself--it is not the issue that people would campaign upon, but it is an issue that he saw needed a solution. He worked with both sides of the aisle, and he said: Why can't we modernize our own technology?  The Veterans Administration was created in 1921, and if somebody that was a veteran had a problem and a claim, they would write it on a piece of paper. In 1921, on a warm day like today, we would have fans going to try to cool ourselves down. We would rush, after we got done voting, to turn on our radios to see what the news was saying.  Well, the world all changed. We can look at our phones and get the news instantaneously. We got central air to cool ourselves down. And if you have a claim with the VA, lots of times they write it on a piece of paper.  Well, do you know what? That is all going to stop today. That is going to stop because we are going to make a smart investment. We are going to make the Federal Government have the same accountability that we expect in business or anywhere else.  And do you know what will happen? Government will become more effective, more efficient, more accountable, and more transparent.  So I want to tip my hat to both sides of the aisle, and especially to Congressman Will He took the leadership, had the tenacity to stay with it and the ability to work with all on, really, the issue that people wouldn't talk about but expect to happen, and he was the right person at the right time to make the push.

11055,topic-id,334,"Mr.President, today I want to discuss legislation I am introducing, the School Infrastructure Modernization  To claim the federal tax credit for historic preservation, a building renovation must be for a different purpose than that for which the building was previously used, a requirement known as the ``prior use'' rule. This bill waives that requirement for renovations of K-12 public school buildings. This will make it easier to restore historic-but-dilapidated school buildings across the country so our children have safe, modern spaces in which to learn.  As a Richmond City Council member and later Mayor, I faced challenges familiar to many municipalities--overcrowded schools, aging buildings, and limited dollars in the budget. But in one particular case, I and a group of local stakeholders identified a creative solution. On one hand we had an overcrowded Thomas Jefferson High School with in-zone and magnet students. On the other hand, we had a closed Maggie Walker High School that needed renovations. We put together a financing package that made use of federal and state historic tax credits to renovate Maggie Walker High School and satisfied the prior use rule by consolidating the magnet program from Thomas Jefferson into a new Maggie Walker Governor's School for Government and[[Page S3014]]International Today, some 20 years later, this is one of America's highest performing public high schools. Without the federal historic tax credit, this would have been too expensive to make happen.  This bill will make it easier to do similar projects around the country. More modern school buildings will bolster the quality of public education, and carrying out these projects will generate private sector infrastructure investment and jobs.

11078,topic-id,344,"Mr.Today I am introducing a bipartisan bill to make the process of siting natural gas pipelines fairer and more transparent.  For some time now, I have been listening to Virginians with passionate views on the proposed Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley For various reasons, many oppose one or both of these projects, while others support these projects. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, is tasked with analyzing all the issues--purpose and need for a project, impacts on 2 'people living on the route, potential risks to the environment or property--and deciding what course best serves the public interest.  From listening to all sides, I have concluded that while reasonable people may reach different conclusions, FERC's public input process is flawed and could be better. Accordingly, this legislation proposes several steps to address several shortcomings, all of which were originally brought to my attention by Virginia constituents. For instance, this bill requires programmatic analysis of pipelines proposed around the same time and in the same geographic vicinity so that the full impacts of multiple projects can be analyzed. It requires a greater number of public comment meetings so that citizens are not required to commute long distances to meetings at which they must speed through just a few minutes of remarks on these complex topics.

11174,topic-id,1022,"Mr.President, on behalf of myself and the senior Senator from Virginia, Mark Warner, we want to commemorate an important, early step in our Nation's emergence as a world leader in flight, space exploration, and atmospheric science.  One hundred years ago today on July 17, 1917, NASA's Langley Research Center was founded in Hampton, What was once a quiet expanse of farmland and marsh on a riverbank near the Chesapeake Bay has helped transform our Nation's transportation system and the world's understanding of our universe.  That date in 1917 represents the beginning of a journey that would eventually take Americans to the moon and American technology to Mars and beyond.  Born in the days of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the precursor to NASA, Langley was the agency's first field center and our Nation's first civilian aeronautics laboratory.  The groundbreaking and sky conquering research conducted during Langley's early days led to major advances in aeronautics and, in the years after World War I, helped our Nation cement its status as a pacesetter in flight research. Langley's important work also served as a foundation for America's burgeoning aviation industry.  Langley won the first of its seven Collier trophies, awarded for the highest achievements in aeronautics or astronautics in our Nation, in 1929. That trophy, won for development of cowling for radial air-cooled engines, honored a high level of technical excellence that Langley has maintained ever since.  Over the decades, Langley has evolved into a research center supporting all of NASA's areas of emphasis, from human space exploration to Earth science and from aeronautics to technology development.  NASA Langley's legacy of discovery and innovation is truly remarkable. Researchers at the center helped refine technologies and designs across all flight regimes--subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic--revolutionizing the shape and performance of today's aircraft and spacecraft.  This year, we all witnessed some of NASA Langley's contributions to the space race through the lens of the Oscar-nominated film, ``Hidden Figures.'' The film told the story of the many contributions of NASA Langley employees, especially African-American women, to the Mercury 7 mission involving America's first astronauts.  Beyond that, Neil Armstrong and other Apollo astronauts learned how to land on the moon by training at[[Page S4022]]Langley's Lunar Landing Research Facility, now known as the Landing and Impact Research  Langley led the first successful robotic landing on Mars with the Viking 1 mission, which gave humanity its first glimpse of the landscape of another world. The center's technical expertise in a field called Entry, Descent and Landing--the study of how a spacecraft can safely move through a planet's atmosphere and reach the surface--has been a key to every fully successful robotic landing on the surface of  Those are just a few highlights among many, many accomplishments.  Over the decades, NASA Langley has contributed technologies that have improved people's lives around the globe.  For example, the grooved pavement that makes our highways safer evolved from research into runway surfaces at The winglets--the upturned tips of wings seen on commercial aircraft--have saved fuel and reduced pollution for years. Their use is a result of research done by Richard Whitcomb, one of Langley's legendary aerodynamics experts.  Based on what we have seen when visiting the center, we predict this legacy of excellence and innovation will continue--even accelerate--over the next 100 years.  We have been proud to work closely with the center on improving the safe use of unmanned aerial vehicles, better known as drones.  We have also proudly partnered with the center's efforts on groundbreaking materials research, including the Advanced Composites Initiative, to work toward developing lighter, safer, and more fuel-efficient vehicles for air and space.  We have seen Langley's critical involvement in development of the Orion crew module, which was tested at Langley's Landing and Impact Research Facility to ensure that astronauts can safely splashdown in the ocean after future missions.  Langley's test facilities are being used by companies who have partnered with NASA through its Commercial Crew By working with Boeing and Space X, Langley is helping to boost our Nation's growing space industry.  Other current projects include new aircraft designs intended to change the sonic boom to a sonic thud, opening the way for a revolutionary new generation of faster aircraft that will bring vast improvements for the traveling public.  When it comes to serving the public's interest, Langley's work studying the Earth's atmosphere and how it absorbs and radiates heat tops the list. It is critical that NASA's work in earth science research continues. Wise policy decisions rely on high-quality data. Without solid data, we are essentially flying blind in the area of environmental policy.  Coincidentally, the Hampton Roads area of Virginia--where Langley is located--is second only to New Orleans in susceptibility to sea-level rise. NASA Langley is one of many national assets--including military, industrial, and academic institutions--located there. It is an important region of our Nation and Langley's work to study earth's atmosphere will safeguard Hampton Roads, as well as our planet as a whole.  When you consider exciting new capabilities offered by the center's Measurement Systems Laboratory, now under construction, and its Katherine Johnson Computational Research Facility, which is set to open later this year, it is clear that we can expect to see more improvements and discoveries from NASA  As Virginia's Senators, we take great pride in the fact that NASA's original field lab--sometimes called the agency ``Mother Center''--resides in the great Commonwealth of We firmly believe that the boundary-pushing spirit displayed over the last 100 years represents some of the best traits of our national character: innovation, exploration, hard work, and the quest to make life better for us all.  We look forward to seeing more amazing innovations from Langley and NASA as our Nation continues its push to solve the great problems of our age and as we extend humanity's reach ever deeper into the universe.  NASA Langley is a remarkable place--and has been for 100 years. As a center for aerospace innovation, technological discovery, and scientific inquiry, Langley continues to lead the way.  We should all cheer them on as they pass this big milestone and rocket ahead into a bold, new century.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-17-pt1-PgS4021-2.txt,2176,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY BUREAU,2017.0,17.0,July

11047,topic-id,1164,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in support of H.2281, the Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, we are living in unprecedented times. A quick glance of recent headlines shows that our Nation is suffering from the largest heroin epidemic in the history of the United In fact, just last week, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that heroin has become so pervasive in our cities and so profitable for the cartels that supply it that even our local law enforcement officers are disheartened and admit that sporadic street-level arrests seem to have little to no effect.  Recently, in my district and because of the hard work of our men and women in law enforcement, we witnessed the dismantling of a large-scale organization. News reports indicate 52 individuals are facing charges for about 370 crimes, including operating as drug dealers and traffickers.  Mr.Speaker, if these individuals had not been stopped, their nefarious activities would have broken the dreams of children across America, and their criminal enterprise would have caused millions in economic loss through increased incarceration, rehab, and medical expenses. If they had not been stopped, their actions would have continued to introduce poison into our communities and shattered lives.  Even worse, a recent trend shows that the heroin hitting our streets is becoming more lethal as drug cartels have now begun lacing heroin with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid making doses more addictive and cheaper to produce.  I might add parenthetically that, for 20 years as a Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted every possible drug organization known to man. I have never seen anything with the lethality that is heroin.  This epidemic is, in large part, due to the stream of illegal narcotics that is flowing across our Nation's borders. However, there are steps that can be taken to shut down these illicit pathways. Thankfully, there is a Federal task force dedicated to this singular purpose.  In 2005, in response to the increase in violence along the southwest border of Mexico, the U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, in partnership with U.Customs and Border Protection, as well as other Federal, State, local, and international law enforcement officials, created what is known as BEST, the Border Enforcement Security Task  To date, a total of 44 BEST units have been deployed across 16 States and in the Commonwealth of Puerto My home State of New York is well served by three BEST teams, two of which are situated on the northern border and one of which I helped stand up in Massena, New  Nationwide, BEST teams comprise over 1,000 members who represent over 100 law enforcement agencies that have committed to jointly investigate transnational criminal activity along the southwest and northern borders and at our Nation's major seaports.  Since inception, their collective efforts have initiated more than 10,654 investigations which have resulted in almost 13,000 criminal arrests, the seizure of 1.2 million pounds of narcotics, and more than $130 million. The street value of 1.2 million pounds of narcotics is astronomical.  This is an impressive feat by any measure; however, as we are considering reauthorizing this important task force, it is important to highlight where there is some room for improvement. Every Congress looks at existing programs and makes adjustments when needed. That is exactly what we are proposing to do here today.[[Page H4272]]  Of the 44, total, BEST units, 20 of them are designated by Homeland Security Investigations as having a maritime security focus. While the Coast Guard provides critical support to Federal, State, and local partners through a majority of the maritime BESTs, not every maritime BEST is currently benefiting from Coast Guard participation.  This bill mandates the participation of both a Coast Guard Investigative Service special agent and a uniformed Coast Guard intelligence officer on every maritime By utilizing both plainclothes investigators and uniformed intelligence officers, BEST will be able to partner with the Coast Guard in ongoing criminal investigations and the generation of actionable maritime intelligence.  The Coast Guard is the only agency within DHS that is also an independent member of the intelligence community. This unique position, coupled with the fact that the Coast Guard has unparalleled maritime domain awareness through daily interaction with mariners and facility operators, makes it imperative that they are included in all maritime BESTS in a mandatory fashion.  As we find ourselves halfway through Police Week this week, I want to take a second to pause and thank the men and women of law enforcement throughout this great Nation--many of whom I have stood side by side with for over 20 years--for all they do in keeping our country safe.  I would also like to thank the ranking member, Mr.Vela, for introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the law enforcement community and vote in favor of reauthorizing this important task force.

I want to note that, back in the mid-nineties when I was starting out my career as a Federal organized crime prosecutor, I was set on the border in El Paso, Texas, and I had a frontline view, as I was going after cartel-level drug traffickers back then, of just what a problem the border is.  Many people think of the border's primary problem being illegal aliens, but I can tell you firsthand--and I think my colleague from Texas will agree with me--that drug trafficking remains a gigantic issue, and the poison that is killing our kids is streaming across the southwest border in particular.[[Page H4273]]  It is imperative that bills like this continue. It is imperative that Congressman Vela, Congresswoman McSally, and the others on their subcommittee continue their great work identifying issues along the border, both north and south, and that the BEST concept continues and, indeed, hopefully, expands in the future. Targeted law enforcement that involves people on both sides of the border and law enforcement is the only way we are ever going to solve this problem. I commend them for their work on this.

11054,topic-id,1573,"Mr.President, I would like to talk today about the need for a work requirement in our Medicaid In 1969, President Lyndon Johnson addressed the American people, and he talked about breaking the cycle of poverty. This is what President Johnson said:       I believe . . . that the key to success in this effort is      jobs. It is work for people who want to work.  President Johnson, as we know, was a He fervently believed that the people of Louisiana didn't want handouts. Most people want a chance to support themselves. President Johnson also believed that Medicaid, as originally envisioned, would be a safety net for the disabled, the elderly, and people with small children. Medicaid is not exactly that; it is dramatically different.  Whether you agree or disagree with what has happened to Medicaid, the fact is that it has turned into a health insurance program for about 20 percent of all Think about that. We have roughly 320 million people in our country, and fully 25 percent are on It gets bigger and bigger every year, and it gets more expensive every year. You can see that the numbers speak for themselves. You can see the trend. You can certainly see that we started in 1966, and you can particularly see the trend beginning in 1996 and its trajectory.  It also became more expensive. The cost of our Medicaid Program in 1966 was $1 billion. That is a lot of money. This is the cost of last year: $576 billion and climbing.  Let me talk about our State alone. In Louisiana, the cost of Medicaid has increased from $5.9 billion in 2008 to $10.7 billion today, and 65 percent of all of the babies born in Louisiana every year now are born on Think about that.[[Page S3013]]  We know that Medicaid is a Federal-State program. The Federal Government puts up some of the money; the State puts up some of the money, as well. In Louisiana, we put up about one-third of the money. In Louisiana dollars, in 2008, we were putting up $1.7 billion in State money. It is called the match for the Medicaid Today, the State of Louisiana is paying $3.3 billion. You can do the math. That is about a 10 percent increase every year.  If we are spending $3.3 billion of State money, that means every year, just like clockwork, we have to come up with an extra $330 million. I can tell you where that money comes from. It comes out of public schools, it comes out of universities, it comes out of our budget for roads, and it comes out of our budget for public safety.  We have a choice in Either Medicaid is going to be, as we originally envisioned it, a safety net for the old, the disabled, and mothers with babies or it is going to be a health insurance program for the masses.  If the American people and Congress decide that Medicaid is going to be a health insurance program for the general population, then it needs to operate as health insurance does in the private sector. In other words, able-bodied adult enrollees in Medicaid should be required to work in order to receive their benefits, if they are able.  I am filing a bill that is going to be entitled the ``Medicaid Reform and Personal Responsibility Act of 2017.'' It is going to create a work requirement for My reason is simple. I want Americans to prosper. I don't want our people to remain mired in poverty. I want to break poverty's back by creating a system that doesn't force the American people to subsist on handouts from government, and the best way to do that is to provide an incentive for able-bodied Americans to know the dignity of work because a person without a job is neither happy, nor is he free.  I think my bill is a commonsense approach to reducing America's reliance on entitlement programs. The work requirement will be very simple. It will be similar to the program that we have in place--the work requirement we have in place right now for food stamps.  This is what my bill would require: If you are on Medicaid or want to receive Medicaid, and you are an adult between the ages of 18 and 55, and you are able-bodied, you are not disabled, and you don't have any dependents, you don't have any children--so if you are 18 to 55, you are not disabled, and you don't have any children, then in order to receive Medicaid or to continue to receive Medicaid, you have to either work 20 hours a week--not 40 hours a week but 20 hours a week--you have to look for a job or you have to go back to school if you don't want to work. Or if you don't want to go back to school or you don't want to look for a job or you don't want to get a job, you have to perform community service for 20 hours a week. My goal is to get people off Medicaid and into the workforce, so they can support themselves and not need  I don't want to take Medicaid away from people in need. I do want fewer people to need So if you are disabled, if you are pregnant, if you are elderly, if you are caring for a child, my bill doesn't apply to you. I am not talking about telling a mother with a baby in her arms that she has to go find a job, and I am not going to ask an elderly person in a nursing home to leave the nursing home and go get a job in order to receive All my bill says is that if you are young by today's standards, between 18 and 55, you are able-bodied and you have no children or dependents, then you have to go get a job or you have to go to school or you have to perform community service.  I want to be very clear about something else. In my State, we have a lot of flood victims. We had terrible flooding last year. In my State, Louisiana, we have a depression in the oil and gas industry; indeed, we do throughout America, and I know we do in the great State of Alaska as well. I am not looking to add to their hurt. I am working very hard, as are you, Mr.President, to put our oilfield workers back to work and to get our flood victims the assistance they need to recover from the tragedy that has befallen them. This bill is not about them. This bill is about able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 55 who have no dependents and who have been unemployed for years, in many cases, by their own choosing.  Our country has grown a lot and evolved a lot since Medicaid was introduced in 1965. We now face new challenges, both at home and abroad. We know that. Medicaid has grown, as well, but it hasn't evolved in a positive way, in my opinion. Just 3 years after Medicaid was founded, we knew we were going to have a problem finding the money, given the exponential growth in the program, and more than 50 years later, it is way past time to do something about it.  We have to break the back of poverty. This is not about throwing people out into the cold. This is about helping them to know that they can get work because the best program--the best social program in the entire world is a job. By implementing a work requirement for able-bodied adults, Medicaid will evolve to the next logical step. Our goal ought to be to ensure, of course, that people are healthy. That is what Medicaid exists for, but if you are healthy, then the next step is to help you join the workforce.  The simple fact is, this is nothing new or extraordinary. We already have work requirements--required by acts of this Congress--for unemployment assistance, for welfare benefits, for subsidized housing, and for food stamps. Now, these requirements have been a success. We all know that, not just for stemming the costs of those programs but also for helping people--helping Americans build careers.  Yet we do not have a requirement--a work requirement--for If my bill passes, we will. Work requirements exist because these programs are supposed to be safety nets. That is what a social program is, a safety net. They are not supposed to exist to permanently support you if you can support yourself.  Our social programs in America are meant to be bridges. In way too many respects, they have become parking lots. Medicaid costs are not just a national problem. The program's expansion is clipping the wings of States like Louisiana and like Alaska because, as I pointed out, the States have to put up a substantial amount of the money.  We are becoming a country in which people subsist instead of thrive because they don't know the rewards of work. We have become a country in which poverty is a way of life for way too many people. That is just sad. More than 50 years after Medicaid began, it is time to break the back of poverty once and for all. We can start with a work requirement for  Thank you.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgS3011.txt,2172,MODERNIZING GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,17.0,July

11070,topic-id,390,"Mr.President, founded more than two centuries ago, Vermont boasts a trove of historically preserved buildings, structures, and towns. These are part of our heritage, and our State's character. Making a priority of managing and preserving our cultural heritage makes Vermont a National leader in this field.  Of course, many of these historic structures do not meet modern fire prevention codes and lack basic features such as sprinklers, which can drastically reduce the potential for irreparable damage from a fire. Today I am reintroducing the Historic Downtown Preservation and Access Act, a bill that would create a refundable tax credit for the installation of fire suppression systems and elevators in older, multi-use buildings in historic downtowns. Every year, fires destroy numerous historic buildings that often serve as the center of towns and villages across the nation. In 2011, the Brooks House in Brattleboro, Vermont, burned down after almost 150 years in use as a hotel and later, as a multi-use building for residential housing and commercial space. After six years of rebuilding and restoring, those who were displaced by this fire are finally getting back on their feet.  The Historic Downtown Preservation and Access Act will establish a 50 percent refundable tax credit of up to $50,000 that incentivizes the installation of sprinkler systems in order to help prevent and minimize damage caused by fire, including potential loss of life, extensive property damage, and, in some instances, federal funding that is reinvested during the restoration process. This bill also includes a provision to encourage the installation of elevators in our historic buildings, making them accessible to all. This would ensure that upper floors for commercial or residential use are accessible to everyone, including tenants and their guests. Finally, this bill is updated to establish a tax credit for the costs incurred when removing hazardous substances from historic buildings, like lead paint, asbestos, and radon.  We should encourage the maintenance of the history and character of historic buildings and downtowns, while also ensuring that they remain safe and accessible to all. This bill is a responsible step forward in those efforts. As we look ahead to comprehensive tax reform, I hope that Congress will consider commonsense legislation like this that will help preserve our towns' unique histories and legacy features for decades to come, while promoting the safety of all                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgS3329.txt,1383,INVEST IN THE NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE,2017.0,7.0,June
11113,topic-id,364,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Mr.Speaker, Ronald Reagan had a unique gift of communicating in a way that reflected the ideas and the thoughts of the American people. He also understood that out-of-control government bureaucracy had a well-deserved reputation of working in its own best interest, not in the best interest of the American people.  President Reagan best defined this mistrust of government when he stated: ``The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help.''  The skepticism Americans have of their too-big-to-be-useful government has only increased since Reagan spoke those words. And it is rules and regulations, such as the one we are discussing here today, that fosters the distrust Americans have of their government. The CFPB's decision to ban arbitration with preference to class action lawsuits will cause harm to both consumers and businesses.  Arbitration has proven to be an effective tool that benefits both parties in a dispute, and has shown to be more favorable to consumers than traditional litigation in the courts. The average compensation, as you have heard, to consumers when using arbitration is $5,400. In contrast, the average settlement for consumers in a class action lawsuit is $32.  Not only is arbitration more financially beneficial to consumers, it is less costly and less time-consuming than fighting through the courts. Disputes which use arbitration are usually settled in 2 to 7 months; however, lawsuits can take an average of 2 years to settle.  Even the CFPB has recognized that arbitration is more efficient, less costly, and more beneficial to consumers; so it boggles the mind trying to figure out why they are pursuing a course that would harm  It is the responsibility of Congress to rein in government when it is outside the constitutional boundaries of its office or pursues a course of action that is harmful to the citizens.

If we handed out grades to government agencies based on their ability to meet a mission statement, the CFPB would most decidedly receive an That is because the Bureau's arbitration rule does absolutely nothing to ensure that consumers are treated fairly. In fact, this rule is proof of what House Republicans have said for years: the CFPB does not operate in the best interests of the American consumers.

11199,topic-id,1914,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the concerns of the good people of my great State of West Virginia, about their healthcare and the needs they have. If the American Health Care Act is passed, which is the Republican plan that was passed over in the House, many West Virginians are going to lose their current insurance coverage.  Individuals on Medicaid expansion would not be guaranteed coverage after 2020. That means that for anybody that has gotten insurance for the first time, there is no guarantee they can keep it at all past 2020. The American Hospital Association estimates that 68,200 West Virginians would lose their Medicaid coverage in 2018, and another 126,000 people who currently have it would be without Medicaid coverage by 2026.  The American Health Care Act, which is being sent by our friends in the House--our Republican friends in the House--increases the cost to our The bill cuts $834 billion from Medicaid, meaning that the State would receive less Federal Medicaid funding, and it would not increase if costs rise in the case of health crises.  In fact, the American Hospital Association estimates that my State of West Virginia would lose a total of $9.8 billion over the next 10 years--$9.8 billion over the next 10 years alone in my great With all of the hard work they have done, to go without healthcare is unbelievable.  This bill would also increase costs for older, sicker, poorer, rural West We have this type of a population in all of our Older Americans would face higher costs because insurance companies could charge them five times more than younger beneficiaries--five times more. So if a young beneficiary is paying $2,500 a year, they can end up paying $10,000, $12,000 a year. That would increase the costs to older Americans nationally by anywhere from $2,000 to $8,400.  We did this little comparison here of what that would actually look like. Let's say there is a low-income senior, somebody who hasn't gotten to Medicare eligibility yet because of their age, and they are over the 138th percentile of the poverty guidelines, and they are paying about $1,700 now for their insurance under the Affordable Care  With this piece of legislation, they are going to pay upwards of $13,000--$13,000, which they don't have. The cost to purchase insurance for low-income seniors in West Virginia who buy insurance on the exchanges, as I just showed you, could go up to almost 800 percent--800 percent of the costs they are paying.  So today I am going to share the story of a West Virginian who is concerned about losing her healthcare. This West Virginia native is Stephanie She told me her story at a townhall that we had in the Eastern Panhandle in She asked me to make sure I shared this story with all of you. This will be printed in the So this is going to be Stephanie's story. This is one of many stories throughout my State of West Virginia:       My name is Stephanie Fredricksen and back in April 2016, I      woke up one day unable to turn my head due to stiffness in my      neck and terrible pain. At first I thought I had just slept      on it wrong and it would go away. By early May, the pain had      spread to every joint in my body.       Then, I began to experience painful spasms in my back, my      shoulders, my neck, and even my jaw. I started having blurred      vision and shooting pain in my eyes. I also began suffering      from extreme exhaustion, on really bad days activities as      simple as getting out[[Page S3151]]     of bed, getting dressed, and brushing my hair can tire me out      for hours. I could go on and on with a long list of other      horrible symptoms.       My illness began to affect my job as a Property & Casualty      Insurance I started missing more and more time from      work, first due to doctor appointments and then due to the      worsening of my symptoms. Eventually, I was forced to file a      claim for long-term disability insurance. I had been      undergoing multiple tests and examinations and I thought the      physicians would soon determine what was wrong and prescribe      the appropriate treatment so I could get back my life and get      back to work.       That never happened. During this time I had physical      therapy and after a couple of weeks of treatment I was able      to move my neck again. But by August, I was diagnosed with      Systemic Lupus, Systemic Sclerosis, Osteoarthritis and Severe      Spinal Stenosis among other related conditions. Although my      employer assured me they had my back, in October, I received      a certified letter from an attorney advising me that my      employment had been terminated.       As a result, I lost my healthcare coverage and was offered      COBRA coverage for a period of only three months.       On February 1, 2017, I became one of millions who rely on      the Affordable Care Act (ACA). I was already familiar with      the ACA because my husband had been covered by it since 2012.       My husband works for a small business that doesn't offer      health insurance. The ACA was about $350 less than for him to      be added to my former employers's plan. Some of you may be      thinking after hearing about some of my conditions that they      aren't life ending but you would be wrong.       I suffer from autoimmune diseases. My immune system attacks      my own body instead of resisting hostile foreign invaders. So      my immune system will not fight off but will actually help      the bad things to spread and become even stronger.       In approximately 50 percent of people with Systemic Lupus a      major organ or tissue in the body such as the heart, lungs,      kidneys or brain will become affected.       Between 10 and 15 percent of Lupus patients will die      prematurely. However, it is widely believed that number is      substantially underreported. Many deaths are reported as a      result of the complications such as kidney failure and not      the Lupus itself.       1 in 3 patients with Lupus also have another autoimmune      disease. I fall into that category having been diagnosed with      Systemic Sclerosis as well. Systemic Sclerosis can also      involve the heart, kidneys, lungs, liver and brain. Internal      organ complications are common and are often not symptomatic      until the late stages of disease, thus routine screening is      essential. Lung involvement is the leading cause of death.  She shared her story and much more with me at a townhall in She asked me to read this on the Senate floor. She asked me to share her story because she has tried to share it with all of the elected officials herself, not just for herself but also for the protected 24 million Americans who are at risk of losing their insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed and replaced with the American Health Care Act, the act that was just passed in the House which is being sent to the  So she is asking us: Please, do not pass this. Do not repeal the ACA but fix it. We all know it needs to be repaired. The private market needs to be fixed, not to mention those who will no longer be able to afford it with the premiums going up, especially for the older, poorer senior citizens.       I obviously have pre-existing conditions, no job, and my      husband's job does not offer health insurance. In other      words, without the ACA, I would not be able to get the      insurance I need so badly. I also fear that based on numbers      provided by the CBO, if insurance is still available to me, I      won't be able to afford it and of course there is also my      husband's insurance to worry about.       At the same time many young and healthy people chose to      take a gamble believing like we all do when we're young that      nothing bad is ever going to happen to us.       As a result, the ACA risk pool was not as diverse as it      should have been. Robust participation is so critical to      ensuring citizens have access to and a real choice in      affordable coverage. Imagine if those that oppose the ACA      actually got behind it for the good of the country.       The ACA even with all of its opposition helped millions and      it appears that the American people realize this, even many      that were originally fooled by the negative rhetoric have      decided they want to keep it. Please do what is right for us      the citizens that have chosen each of you to represent us.       As I pointed out earlier, many of those people have come      around to a different way of thinking as of late and I      wouldn't be so sure that they will be there for you the next      time when they vote if you have taken away their health care      or their parents, siblings, children, grandparents, aunts,      uncles, nieces, nephews, neighbors, friends, church members,      coworkers, classmates, and so on. Of course we can't forget      that a lot of those people will die as a result of not being      able to keep their health care as well.       Putting your politics, egos, agendas, and parties aside in      this case will actually save human lives. I ask you all not      to repeal and replace the ACA and instead to work together to      fix it and make improvements.       Please don't allow the CEOs of insurance companies and the      wealthiest Americans to make even more money at the expense      of those Americans who are the most vulnerable, like the      disabled, the sick, the elderly and those with lower incomes.       I beg of you, PLEASE oppose the repeal of the ACA and      please oppose any plan that could leave me and millions like      me without health insurance or that will increase our      premiums or deductibles or reduce or eliminate any current      coverage. Our lives are depending on it and we are depending      on you.  So, as I have promised, I have read this letter, Stephanie's story. I am hoping that Stephanie is listening and watching, but also for all the people that she represents--people who have serious illnesses, who are going to be left out or who are afraid they are going to be left out, elderly people who are going to not be able to afford insurance.  There are a lot of things that we can do, but one thing that we can all be doing is working together as Republicans and Democrats and putting our country first and people in our States and fixing this. We know it needs to be fixed. Get off the political rhetoric and quit blaming each other and sit down and say: OK, this needs to be repaired. This private market doesn't work the way it was intended to.  We need to get more young people involved. We need the market forces to work. We need for everyone who has insurance for the first time to use it in the most efficient, effective, and appropriate way. There is a lot that can be done, but not just by taking political votes and holding each other in harm's way.  I thank you for allowing me to tell Stephanie's story. I hope it helps. I can't wait to sit down and start working with all of our colleagues in this body.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3150-7.txt,1983,COUNTERING AMERICA'S ADVERSARIES THROUGH SANCTIONS ACT,2017.0,24.0,May

10952,topic-id,3026,"Mr.President, on May 4 of this year, there was a party at the White House, a celebration--a celebration that the House had passed Indeed, the President wanted to invite people over and say what a great job they had done and what a great bill they had passed. He called it a ``great plan.'' He said the House plan was ``very, very incredibly well-crafted.''  That was on May 4--a party at the White House, a celebration--but what a difference a month can make. A week ago, on Tuesday, June 13, the President had another gathering, and at this gathering he said that the bill from the House was ``mean,'' and he went on to use a very derogatory phrase to describe it.  So what happened between May 4 and June 13? Did the bill change in some way? Absolutely not. It had already been passed out of the Apparently what happened is that someone explained to the President what was in it, and he said: That is terrible. We can't do that. It is a mean bill. And he used other vivid language to say just how bad it was.  What feature of the TrumpCare bill did the President get briefed on that made him say that it was mean? It certainly is a mean-spirited bill. It certainly is a hard-hearted bill. It certainly is destructive to the quality of life of millions and millions of So which aspect of the bill was he referring to?  I asked that question of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, when he came to the Senate for a hearing last week. I asked the Secretary if he shared the President's opinion that the TrumpCare bill was a mean bill. He didn't have an answer for that. He wouldn't say whether, as a leader in the administration on healthcare, he shared the President's opinion.  I asked whether he thought the President thought it was a mean-spirited bill because it ripped healthcare from 23 million The Secretary of healthcare didn't answer.  I asked whether it was mean because it eliminated essential health benefits like emergency care and rehabilitation services and mental health and addiction treatment and maternity coverage for women having a child. The Secretary again refused to answer.  And he proceeded to say things like ``Well, I wasn't in the meeting,'' and that he hadn't talked to the President about why the President didn't like the bill. One would think that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon hearing that the President thought that the bill he had advocated for was terrible, would actually go to him and say: What is it you thought was so terrible? That might inform the conversations here in the But he said that he hadn't talked to the President about it. The Secretary of Health and Human Services didn't want to know why the President disliked this bill.  I asked if the President thought that this was a mean bill because it has vast premium increases for older An individual in their mid-sixties, prior to the age for Medicare, a 64-year-old earning $26,500--how much would they pay under current law and how much would they pay under TrumpCare? Under current law, the answer is about $140 a month. And under TrumpCare from the House, the answer is $1,200 per month--an eightfold increase. How can anyone earning a little over $2,000 a month spend $1,200 on health insurance? It is an impossible situation.  So, of course, those Americans in that situation would not be able to buy health insurance, would not be able to access healthcare. Is that why the President thought it was mean? Did the President get briefed on the damage it would do to our older Americans? Or was the President concerned about the impact on our older Americans who need to have care in a nursing home? Is the President finally aware that Medicaid pays for more than 6 out of 10 individuals who are in a nursing home because they need a level of care that can't be provided in the home?  I went and visited a nursing home over the weekend in urban Oregon and then visited one in rural Oregon, in Klamath In Klamath County they told me that almost 100 percent of their citizens in long-term care are paid for by Nationally, it is a little more than 6 out of 10, but in this rural community, almost 100 percent. I thought about the residents there and what happens to them. Under this bill, when Medicaid is slashed massively and 23 million folks lose access to it, what happens to them? One woman, Deborah, said: Senator, Medicaid pays for my bill and if it doesn't exist for me--if it is taken away--I am on the street, and that is a problem because I can't walk.  So picture an older American, a senior American who needs an intensive level of care that can't be provided in the home being thrown into the street in a wheelchair, unable to walk, and, by the way, no support structure because in order to qualify for Medicaid to pay your bill, you have to have spent down all your own resources, so it isn't like somebody has a backup plan. Maybe there are family members who will take them in and provide an intensive level of care. Maybe a few will have friends who will take them in and provide an intensive level of care. But for the vast majority, that support structure isn't there, and that means they are going to be on the street. Is that why the President said it was mean?  Was it because the bill said States can charge more, allow insurance companies to charge more for individuals with preexisting conditions? That is certainly a huge problem. Community pricing has given access to insurance at the same price to everyone in America, regardless of preexisting conditions, but, unfortunately, TrumpCare changes that.  I think we need to recognize that now, here in the Senate, 13 Senators are working to craft a Senate version of TrumpCare, and they are terrified--terrified of the public seeing their bill. It is a vampire bill. It is afraid of the sunlight--the sunlight of public commentary, input, even a public discussion from experts. They are afraid of their citizens. They are afraid of the expert commentary. And they want to hide it until the last second so they can bring it to the floor--next Thursday, a week from this Thursday--and try to pass it in a moment's time, less than a day.  I was fascinated that our Secretary of Health and Human Services--after there were more than 100 hearings and roundtables and walk-throughs of the healthcare bill in 2009, after consideration of more than 300 amendments in the Senate, after more than 100 Republican amendments that were adopted,[[Page S3622]]minority amendments adopted, after more than 25 days of debate on the Senate floor--complained that the bill and the process were not transparent. If that wasn't transparent, how do you score the transparency of a bill where there have been zero committee meetings, zero chance for legislators to weigh in, zero chance for public input by experts, zero chance for the citizens of the United States to see this bill and share their feelings, zero chance for us to go back to our own States and have townhalls and ask for input? Well, you give it an It is a process completely out of sync with the responsibilities that every Senator took when they took the oath of office to be a Member of a legislative body--not a secret body, a legislative body, which implies deliberation in committee and deliberation on the floor and deliberation with constituents back home.  There is a phrase for the Senate--probably not merited; in fact, I am sure it is no longer merited--that the Senate was the world's greatest deliberative body. But crafting legislation in secret that affects the quality of life of millions and millions of Americans, with no deliberation, that is not a legislative process. That is not what was envisioned under our Constitution, our ``we the people'' It wasn't a ``we the secret group of powerful folks accommodating powerful special interests, government by and for the powerful.'' That wasn't the introduction to our Perhaps Members might read the first three words of the Perhaps folks might go back and look at our history of why we have this floor to debate the issues, because that is what a system of government of, by, and for the people is all about.  In my home State, the elimination of Medicaid expansion--that is, the Oregon Health Plan expansion--would throw 400,000 people off of healthcare. Stretching that timeline from a couple years to 7 years doesn't change the fact that 400,000 people lose healthcare. That is mean-spirited. That is hard-hearted. That is terrible healthcare policy.  It is not just those individuals who are affected. The uncompensated care rate has dropped enormously in Oregon, from 15 percent to 5 percent. The result is that there is much more income to our clinics and to our hospitals, and the result is better healthcare for everyone--everyone in our rural communities, everyone in our urban communities. Nonetheless, the majority persists in wanting to destroy this improvement.  I am hearing from people like Elizabeth from Portland, who wrote to say that the Oregon Health Plan saved her life. The Oregon Health Plan, or Medicaid, saved her life. She was in school, and she had some health problems that were getting worse because of stress. But she didn't have a job and didn't have insurance, and things were getting bad. Then the Affordable Care Act came around, and it extended coverage. Since then, she has gotten her health problems under control, finished school, and was able to get a job. In Elizabeth's own words:       I am once again contributing to society. I just need a      little bit of time and help and I'm back on my feet.  Isn't it the right thing to provide a foundation for every single American to have access to quality healthcare, so that when they get sick, it helps them get back on their feet?  Ask yourself: What is your value? Is it your value that every American should have access to affordable healthcare? That is my value. That is what I am fighting for. What are you fighting for? Are you fighting to destroy healthcare for millions of Americans? Is that your value--to make life difficult and hard and mean-spirited and hard-hearted and terrible and painful for millions of Americans? Is that your value? If so, then keep up with this secret plan to destroy healthcare for millions of But if you value your constituents' quality of life, if you value their peace of mind, then put a stop to this abomination, this anti-democratic process. Insist that there is at least a month of consideration of the bill so that citizens can weigh in, so experts can weigh in, so committees can deliberate, so committees can propose amendments and improvements. Insist on that.  We just need three Members of the majority party to believe in the responsibility of this Chamber to hold a public debate and insist that they will not vote to proceed to the bill unless we have at least a month of opportunity. That is only one-ninth of what we had in 2009. It is only a fraction of the committee meetings, roundtables, and walk-throughs we had in 2009. It would be only a fraction of the amendments offered in 2009. It would only be a fraction of the time here on the Senate floor we had in 2009. Don't you believe we should have at least a fraction of the public deliberation we had just 8 years ago before jamming this through and destroying healthcare for millions of Americans? What does peace of mind mean to you?  I will tell you what it means to my constituents. It means that when their loved one gets sick, their loved one will get the care they need. It means that when their loved one gets sick, they won't go bankrupt. That is the peace of mind we are talking about, and that is the peace of mind that is so profoundly disturbed when you have a secret group meeting with powerful special interests, devising a bill they are afraid to show to the public of the United States of I would never want to have to vote on such a major bill without being able to hear what my citizens in Oregon think. I don't think any Member of this Senate should agree to vote on a bill with no deliberation and no public hearing.  So we need three champions. Just three out of 52. It should be 52 out of 52 who insist on a quality public process. We have heard the comments in the hallways, many Members of the majority dislike the fact that there is a secret process that their majority leader is insisting on. We have heard that they don't like it. It is not right. But do you know what? Every Member here has a chance to say no to the secret operation, the secret committee of 13, and the last-second presentation of such a bill on the floor.  The issue of the changes in healthcare without public deliberation terrifies folks like Deborah from Hillsboro, She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease 8 years ago and has to take regular injections and medications to keep it under control. She does a lot of things right. She doesn't smoke, she exercises, and she follows her doctor's recommended diet. Other than her regular medications, she lives a normal, healthy life, and she is looking forward to retiring in the near future with her husband. They have been working hard their whole lives. They have been saving up for it. It is so close that they can almost taste it. But it is a dream that could be shattered by the Republican healthcare plan--the TrumpCare plan--being concocted secretly by 13 Members of this body. As she says:       Without affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions I      cannot even switch jobs easily. If Medicare is reduced or      eliminated, as the GOP is trying to do, I may never be able      to retire . . . we should not now, or ever, eliminate      coverage for pre-existing conditions (or price that coverage      such that most of us will never be able to afford it).  She is worried that changes that refer to Medicaid and the Oregon Health Plan will ruin her ability to retire and her ability to access healthcare.  I don't know exactly what the President was briefed on that made him call TrumpCare ``mean'' and then speak in a very derogatory fashion about the bill from the I don't know exactly what he learned. I don't know if it was because he learned that folks on long-term care could lose that long-term care and Medicaid pays for more than 6 out of 10 Americans who are in long-term care. I don't know if it was because he learned about preexisting conditions. I don't know if it was because he learned it would throw 23 million people out of the healthcare system. I don't know if it was because he learned this would have devastating consequences to rural healthcare because of the impact on the finances of clinics and hospitals.  Whatever he meant, he was right. He was right to make that transition from a month earlier when he held a celebration at the White House because this terrific, wonderful bill had been passed by the House, and when he sobered up and discovered that it was a mean-spirited, hard-hearted bill. But for all these reasons, no healthcare should be crafted and jammed through without deliberation. No significant bill affecting[[Page S3623]]the lives of Americans should be pushed through in this manner. Americans deserve better. They expect more from this Chamber than such a secret, callous, poorly informed process. They don't like that powerful special interests are meeting with the Senators in private--those private 13--to develop a plan, because here is what they have heard:  They know this bill gives huge tax breaks to powerful parts of the healthcare industry, that it gives huge amounts of money away to those who make medical equipment and huge amounts of money away to health insurance companies, meanwhile stripping healthcare from millions of They know it also gives a massive tax break to the richest  So here we are with a bill that Trump has called ``mean,'' giving away the Treasury to powerful special interests, meeting in private with my colleagues, giving away the Treasury to the richest Americans, while on the other hand lowering the boom on our seniors in long-term care, lowering the boom on struggling and working families, lowering the boom on 20 million or so Americans who would lose healthcare, and lowering the boom on the clinics and hospitals that provide care for everyone.  That is what they see: special favors for the powerful and thrown into the street the working and struggling families. That is morally wrong. That is wrong from a policy point of trying to improve the quality of life of Americans, and it is why every Senator here should absolutely say no to moving to this bill on the floor without a full month, at least, for committee deliberations and for the citizens of the United States to weigh in.  That is the difference between what happens in a dictatorship with no deliberation and a democratic republic with a legislative process that values deliberation and openness. That is the difference. Which model do my colleagues support?  Let's fight for the ``we the people'' vision of our Constitution, and let's fight for quality healthcare for every American, and let's say no to moving to any bill that hasn't had public deliberation and at least a full month of deliberation in this  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

10955,topic-id,912,"Mr.President, I want to thank all of my colleagues for their comments today on the damage TrumpCare would do. Democrats, patients, and families have been fighting back against TrumpCare and Republican efforts to jam it through Congress for months.  I want to take a moment and recall some of the promises President Trump and Republicans made at the very beginning of this process because there truly is a Grand Canyon between President Trump's promises and the TrumpCare bill he has now admitted himself is ``mean.''  At the start, President Trump promised to provide insurance for everybody that was both cheaper and higher quality. When TrumpCare was introduced in the House, Secretary Price said that ``no one would be worse off financially'' under the law. And when Speaker Ryan was asked whether millions of people would lose their insurance coverage under TrumpCare, he said ``no.''  Families were told again and again that TrumpCare would lower costs and keep people covered. As we know, TrumpCare would do the exact opposite. It will raise healthcare costs for people across the country, astronomically for those with preexisting conditions and for seniors, who could pay as much as 850 percent more in premiums. Medicaid would be gutted. Women and men would be unable to get care from the providers they trust and choose at Planned New mothers would pay as much as $1,000 more a month just to get maternity care. Tens of millions of people would see their healthcare coverage taken away.  I could continue. And I want to be clear that those facts came from the nonpartisan, independent Congressional Budget  Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, when TrumpCare passed the House, President Trump ignored those facts and doubled down on his broken promises. He championed TrumpCare, calling it ``very, very well-crafted.'' He promised to get TrumpCare through the Senate, predicting that it would be an unbelievable victory. His Secretary of Health and Human Services called this bill--which would take healthcare coverage away from 23 million people--a victory for the American people. Which people? Maybe President Maybe special interests who are going to get these massive tax breaks. But not the hundreds of thousands of people in Washington State who are rightly scared of TrumpCare or millions more across the country.  Democrats have come to the Senate floor with story after story about how our constituents would suffer under this legislation, workers who would not be able to make ends meet between jobs without losing health insurance, seniors who know they will go bankrupt if TrumpCare becomes law, moms who stay up at night worrying about whether their child who has a preexisting condition will be priced out of coverage, patients fighting for their lives who are afraid that TrumpCare will kill them and who are literally begging Congress not to do this.  To these patients and families, President Trump's decision to finally admit the incredibly obvious--that TrumpCare is ``mean''--doesn't begin to cover it. To them, that bill is a gut punch. It is the bottom dropping out. It could be a death sentence. And this is especially true because, as hard as Senate Republicans have tried to keep their version of TrumpCare secret, behind closed doors, and in back rooms, as often as some have made promises just like those President Trump and House Republicans were making to try to reassure their constituents somehow that the Senate version of TrumpCare would be somehow less mean, the truth is, we know the Senate version of TrumpCare will be just as damaging.  Senate Republican leaders have already admitted that they expect their TrumpCare bill to mirror 80 percent of the House's. We have House conservatives writing letters to Senate Republicans making demands even meaner than many Senate Republicans want. And we all have a good idea how this is going to end up. ``Mean'' doesn't even begin to cover what TrumpCare would do to my constituents in Washington and to people across the country, but it is a start.  I haven't said this often, but I hope Senate Republicans listen to President This is a man who knows about mean--from making fun of a reporter with disabilities, to belittling our friend the junior Senator from Florida, to even impugning the senior Senator from Arizona, a war hero. When President Trump says something is mean, that certainly means something.  Mr.President, I hope they think about why he had to make that comment. They realize just how hard it will be to defend this truly appalling legislation, especially after it has been jammed through Congress, hidden from patients, and hidden from families without seeing the light of day. I hope they do what we tell preschoolers to do when they do something mean--apologize and make sure to do better next time. In Senate Republicans' case, that means dropping this effort to undermine families' healthcare once and for all and then joining with us to continue fixing healthcare for the people we serve by making healthcare more affordable, getting more families covered, and maintaining quality of care.  Democrats have ideas. We are at the table. We are ready to get to work as soon as Republicans are. It is not too late to make the right choice. The wrong choice is far more than mean. If my Republican colleagues do continue down this deeply harmful path, they should know they will own every bit of the hurt they cause, and they will be held fully accountable.

Mr.Speaker, I am very sad today because of what is happening on both sides of the The cruelty, carelessness, and contempt Republicans are showing for working families boggles the mind. Now, Senate Republicans are careening toward shattering the healthcare of millions of Americans, with no regard or appreciation for the consequence.  Every chance they get, they stack the deck against America's working families. Here, on this side of the Capitol, Republicans are stacking the deck even further against America's working families by seeking to deny those families their fundamental right to obtain justice in court.  Eight years ago, unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited a financial meltdown that devastated families across the country. Democrats proudly took bold action and passed Dodd-Frank, the strongest set of consumer financial protections in history. But today, House Republicans are once again trying to destroy those protections for America's consumers.  Last month, Republicans passed what we called the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act, the Dodd-Frank repeal, which was a giveaway to the financial industry at the expense of hardworking families.  Republicans are waging a war on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a bureau that has returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million wronged Americans, many of them seniors, veterans, and members of the Armed  Forcing consumers into arbitration--indeed, forced arbitration--gives financial services providers a free pass to get away with abuse. It denies, again, veterans, servicemembers, and seniors justice against the predatory financial marketplace practices. Sadly, it reflects a Republican Party that works relentlessly to empower Wall Street and to rig the system against consumers. It denies them consumer class action.  More than 800 years ago, the Magna Carta first laid out a basic right to justice as the foundation of a fair society. Even under a king, the Magna Carta declared, this much was owed the people: ``. . . to no one will we deny or delay right or justice.''  Every day, Americans take a similar solemn pledge: ``liberty and justice for all.'' Republicans' attack on consumers insult those pledges and deny Americans their justice.  All the American people deserve a better deal than what they are getting from the Republicans in Democrats are going to fight back. We will fight to protect hardworking American consumers. We will fight to put leverage back into the hands of the American people.  Who has the leverage? If I am a financial institution and I know that you have no leverage, that you cannot act in a class action way, you can just imagine what I have in store for you. But if I think you have leverage and you can act in a different way and not be forced into arbitration, I might have more respect for our financial relationship with each other.  We will put the leverage back in the hands of the American people. We will fight this resolution. I call upon my Republican colleagues to join Democrats in voting ``no'' because this bill is an unfair and unjust bill.  Who is it unfair to?

During World War II, Congress authorized funding for a new lock because it was clear the country's ability to move iron ore to steel plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania was absolutely critical for the war effort. It took less than 2 years to complete that project after Congress authorized the funding in 1942.  President Roosevelt signed an Executive order establishing the military district of Sault Saint Marie, and the Army stationed 10,000 troops there to defend the Soo Locks by land, air, and sea--so great was the fear that a German attack would instantly cripple Allied efforts to produce steel and weapons.  Today, there is only one Soo Lock--the Poe Lock--that is large enough to accommodate modern freighters, especially the 1,000-foot-long vessels that move millions of tons of iron ore each and every year. Over 80 percent of the commodities that flow through the Soo Locks must pass through the Poe Lock, and each one of those 1,000-foot freighters carries the equivalent of 3,000 truckloads of commodities. It is not possible to move that amount of iron ore in these 1,000-foot freighters by rail or by road, and on top of that, the steel mills are only equipped to handle the iron ore supply by water.  A study conducted by the Department of Homeland Security in 2015 confirmed that it is the Achilles' heel of our economy. Key findings from the Department say: ``A disruption of the Poe Lock likely will cause an almost complete shutdown of Great Lake steel production.''  The report goes on to say: ``A shutdown of Great Lakes steel production likely will cause almost all North American appliances, automobiles, construction equipment, farm equipment, mining equipment, and railcar production to cease within weeks.''  Within weeks. The Homeland Security report estimates that 11 million Americans would lose their jobs if this were to happen.  Consider the fact that the jobs of millions of American workers depend on the ability of large ships to pass, as depicted, from here to here on the Mary's Falls Currently, there is only one lock that can accommodate this task. If this lock shuts down, steel plants in Ohio and Indiana and Kentucky shut down. Auto plants in Texas, Tennessee, California, and Michigan shut down. The American economy shuts down. The losses would be felt throughout the United States, wherever steel is used in the manufacturing process.  We are taking an unacceptable risk if we do not act swiftly to ensure that there is a backup in the case of a lock failure. That is why I am joining Senator Stabenow and members of the Michigan congressional delegation from both parties to introduce a bill that would authorize the funding for constructing another larger Poe-sized lock. The current authorization for the project is far below projected cost estimates. Our bill, which was introduced today, if enacted, will allow the Army Corps to move directly into the design and construction phase. We do not have a moment to lose.  Just last week, I traveled to the Soo Locks for a tour with members of the Michigan congressional delegation, and we saw firsthand how the dedicated men and women of the Army Corps are working to keep the locks functioning. They go to work each and every day with a full understanding of how the safety and security of the Nation rests with their ability to maintain this critical infrastructure. It is a credit to the skill of the Army Corps of Engineers that freighters have been able to pass through the Mary's on their journeys around the Great Lakes almost without interruption. But they are working with equipment that has been maintained well beyond its life cycle and in some cases beyond two life cycles. When I was there last week, I saw 100-year-old water pumps still in use.  We cannot continue to rely on the infrastructure investments made by our grandparents and great-grandparents.

From repealing the Affordable Care Act to tax reform, to an infrastructure package, not one of his major initiatives has yet made it through Congress in over 6 months. Now, that may be good news for the working men and women of this country, but, still, as a grade, that gets him an  Now, we have seen a lot of action on Twitter from this President, from insulting women and threatening journalists to relitigating the election against Secretary Clinton and shouting ``fake news.'' In fact, President Trump tweeted 991 times in his first 6 months in office with ``fake news'' being mentioned almost twice as much as the word ``jobs.''  While he scores high on the volume of tweets, he is low on the content of tweets, so we are going to give him an incomplete in this area.  President Trump's second favorite activity after tweeting is golfing.

American taxpayers have been footing the bill for pricey trips to Trump branded properties and trips benefiting the Trump family business in Canada, Uruguay, Mar-a-Lago in Florida, New York, and many others places.

They play a central role in our Democracy--educating the next generation, serving as polling places for our elections, hosting community meetings and events, and so much more. As we consider the components of a new major Federal investment in infrastructure, we cannot afford to leave our public schools behind. That is why I am proud to be introducing the School Building Improvement Act with my colleagues Senators Brown, Cortez Masto, Hassan, Warren, Whitehouse, Hirono, and  Safe, healthy, modern, well-equipped schools are essential for advancing student achievement and ensuring that the next generation is prepared to meet the economic, social, environmental, and global challenges our Nation faces. Yet, too many of the over 50 million students and six million staff who learn and work in our public schools, spend their days in facilities that fail to make the grade. A 2014 Department of Education study estimated that it would cost $197 billion to bring all public schools into ``good'' condition. Nationally, there is also a $38 billion funding gap in annual capital construction and new facility funding, as reported in the 2016 State of Our Schools report. Despite the benefits and need, however, Federal funding accounts for 0.2% of the total current capital investment in our schools.  Addressing this need is the right thing to do for our students and our communities. Moreover, it will give a needed boost to our economy, putting people to work in family sustaining jobs. According to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, every $1 billion spent on construction generates 17,785 jobs.  There are plenty of examples in Rhode Island of the urgent need for additional investment in school facilities. My hometown of Cranston recently reported $190 million in school facility deficiencies--a startling figure. In the weeks ahead, the Rhode Island Department of Education will publish a report detailing the infrastructure shortfalls in school districts across the state. Our students and community members do not have to be convinced about the need for investing in school facilities. This spring, students, educators, and community leaders gathered in Providence to talk about our schools. One participant said, ``The condition of the buildings is a value statement about how we feel about our students. We must have buildings that are warm, safe, and dry.'' The Federal government needs to be a partner in helping Rhode Island and other States in closing school infrastructure funding gaps.  The School Building Improvement Act of 2017 will create a Federal-State partnership for school infrastructure. It will provide, over ten years, a total of $100 billion in direct grants and school construction bonds to help fill the annual gap in school facility capital needs, while creating nearly two million jobs.  Specifically, the School Building Improvement Act will provide $7 billion per year in formula funds to States for local competitive grants for school repair, renovation, and construction. States will focus assistance on communities with the greatest financial need,[[Page S4622]]encourage green construction practices, and ensure equitable access for public charter schools. Our legislation would also provide $30 billion for qualified school infrastructure bonds (QSIBs), $10 billion each year from FY 2018 through FY 2020 and expand the bond authority of and eligible purposes for Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZABS) to allow local education agencies to construct, rehabilitate, retrofit, or repair school facilities. The School Building Improvement Act also supports American workers by ensuring that projects use American-made iron, steel, and manufactured products.  I would like to thank the broad coalition of educators, community organizations, and unions that have provided feedback and support for this legislation, including Rebuild America's Schools, American Federation of Teachers, Californians for School Facilities, Council of the Great City Schools, International Union of Operating Engineers, National Association of Elementary School Principals., National Association of Federally Impacted Schools, National Association of Secondary School Principals, National Education Association, National Parent Teacher Association, and North America's Building Trades We look forward to expanding this coalition in the weeks and months ahead.

I don't want anybody to think when they look at me giving this speech on the floor of the House that this is evidence that there is arm-twisting going on here in the Capitol about trying to get people's vote on the healthcare issue. No, it is just humorous.  This is a shoulder replacement. I had this one replaced, actually, 4 or 5 months ago, and it is doing fine now. This one was a week ago. The cause of this, of course, has been excessive surfing. When I was older, I should have understood that you cannot surf as much as you can when you are younger without eliminating the cartilage that is there, then the cartilage is gone, and the bones grind on each other.  Well, that is just one example, however, of a healthcare issue that is going to be with us much more frequently now as the population of this country is growing older. The older people get, there will be other infirmities that really were not suffered on such a scale when we died off at a younger age.

Tax reform, of course, is something that is being focused on today as well--tax reform for fiscal year `17. And, of course, fiscal year `18, the appropriations bill. Border security, of course, has to be on this list.  These are issues that we are every day talking about here on Capitol The work is intense, people are serious, and there is a job for us to do. President Trump is in the White House, and he is working hard as well.  This is not the time for the other side to be politicizing every issue that comes up, but, instead, to admit that Republicans now have legitimately won the election for President and legitimately won a majority in both Houses of  Thus, we should put in place policies that are, yes, fair, honest, and effective. But, also, we have to realize that it is fair, honest, and effective based on what those people who are elected by the people to make the decision believe is fair and effective.  Unfortunately, what we have now, and we see this across the country, are people who--and I don't even know if they understand the system at all, but they are arrogantly trying to be engaged with disrupting the system because they did not win. That cannot be tolerated for long. I would hope that people have a change of heart and work with us. We are willing to work with Members of the other party, the Democratic Party, to make sure we come up with both health care and tax reform that the American people will accept and applaud.  First, let's take a look at health care. Tonight I would like to discuss with whoever is listening and whoever is reading the Congressional Record an idea that I am proposing for the healthcare industry. And for the bill that is being put together, as we speak, where people are negotiating and compromising out, I have thrown this idea into the mix. And that is that we are--and we have to recognize--making progress toward replacement of  I am asking my colleagues to give serious consideration to this simple amendment that I believe will revolutionize health care in America by protecting the formation and operation of healthcare cooperatives.  Now, let's get back to that. I am trying to suggest that a small change could actually bring about a revolution in the way health care is delivered to the American people today.  Let's first admit that our healthcare system today seems to be run by the insurance companies. Yes, insurance companies have almost more influence than doctors do on the policies that we have on health insurance. That is not something that we need to put up with much longer if there is an alternative.  What that should mean to Americans is that we need to open up the system of health care. We need to make sure that health care is being looked at as a target for a multiapproach that will come to grips with those challenges, both financial and technical, et cetera, and that we need to open it up, rather than just having such a major influence by those people who are the money changers--the insurance companies.                              {time}  1800  My amendment which I am proposing would go a long way towards opening up a whole new avenue. Now, when I say free enterprise--and I believe in free enterprise. When I say free enterprise, I don't just mean--and this is where, unfortunately, a lot of people have made a mistake in thinking that free enterprise approaches are simply the approaches that are based on greed and are based on profit motive. And instead of other things and motivations that are available, they believe that that is what free enterprise means, whether it is health care or whatever.  Well, I would submit that free enterprise means a lot more than just depending on the profit motive and competition and greed but instead, also, includes, and should include--but we have excluded this avenue--cooperation; cooperation among free people for their own benefit and the benefit of their families. We need it not only just in health care, but that is what we are discussing today, to make sure that Americans can cooperate together for their own benefits and the benefits of their family.  Now, how do I get this? How do I get this consciousness? My mom and dad were both born on very small farms in North In North Dakota where we have homesteaders and others who are relatively poor, in North Dakota, the farmers may have been given the land--by a Republican President, I might add. Abraham Lincoln is the one who initiated the Homestead  But they didn't have the money for the equipment, maybe even the money to buy seed. And what they did is, they formed farmers' collectives. What they called them, farmers' cooperatives. In Russia, they might have called them collectives, but they had the iron hand of evil in Russia, the iron hand of despotism, and a political control. But the cooperation in the United States was based on people gathering together, voluntarily working together to create a better situation. And you had cooperatives that would buy--farm cooperatives that would buy the machinery that was necessary for a small farm to succeed.  Well, that worked. I noticed that when I would go up to work on the farm when I was younger, and I noticed these farm cooperatives around. And that is totally consistent with free enterprise, the cooperation among people to share with each other the burden of buying that type of equipment.  Well, the amendment that I am proposing, in terms of our health care, falls right into that category. The amendment I am proposing stipulates that no provision in current law, or the underlying act, which we are amending, may restrict cooperative arrangements between individuals or organizations to jointly cover healthcare related expenses. The provision would further stipulate that such cooperative arrangements shall not be subject to any of the requirements, bureaucratic[[Page H2892]]rules and regulations, that currently apply to healthcare industry companies.  In addition, my amendment would stipulate that participation in such a cooperative arrangement shall be deemed as the equivalent of being covered by health insurance. If I might describe what I am talking about so people will understand. We are talking about now, the reason why a lot of people won't buy health insurance is that if they put it in, and they are healthy, that insurance money then goes to the insurance company, even though they have not used it at all.  And so you are going to be hesitant to give that money and to buy that insurance, and the insurance companies, of course, are very happy to have that money available to speculate on the stock market, et cetera, in order to make a profit. I am not against profit, but I want to make sure that profit and greed are not the driving forces for what most people would hope for is they can cooperate together and not be subject to someone else's greed and profit motive.  So what I am talking about, if this would be put into the healthcare bill, this small provision that I just read to you, making sure that cooperative efforts are covered and are not going to be controlled by the Federal Government, that they are free to do so without the many restrictions that would be on another company providing health insurance, that these cooperative efforts could--for example, you could have a co-op among people who worked at a certain school, or an industry, or you could have the same as we have now.  I think that the pathway has been certainly explored when it comes to credit unions where, again, people in a nonprofit situation are working together in order to establish something that benefits all of those people.  We could have a cooperative effort for health care, even run by some of the credit unions if they wanted to do so. They could have an app on their telephone or something where people would then put their money forward. If they didn't get sick, that money would still be part of what they have as their pot of money, their account with whoever it is. It is either an account or whatever, but the account will be returned. Thus, people will then take money out of the account to handle their own small medical needs, but they will also know that if they have a catastrophic condition--that is why everybody is banding together in this cooperative program--that they will be taken care of in terms of some catastrophic illness that might become them.  So what we have in this proposal is an alternative, a very simple change in our healthcare law, which will permit people to work together and make it profitable for them to do so and take them away from the control of other corporations in the health insurance industry that may be thinking more profit than of what their interests are.  So with that said, I have asked my colleagues to consider that proposal, and those who are reading this tonight or tomorrow in the Congressional Record, I hope they would call their Congressman to say that they are really interested in seeing that the cooperative alternative to health care is permitted in the bill.  Now, the second piece of legislation that I would like to talk about tonight also deals with a vitally important issue, vitally important to the well-being of the American people, and that is border security. Let me just say, I have been aware that a massive influx of illegals into our country was a threat to the well-being of the American people, and I have known that in the almost 28 years that I have been a Member of  But it has been discouraging to me that we have, over and over again, made attempts to try to do something that would draw the line and say we are not going to have any more illegals coming into our country. Now, by the way, that is illegals. I didn't say immigration, immigrants. I am talking about people coming here illegally, a massive flow of illegal immigration.  In fact, the United States permits 1 million legal immigrants to come into our country every year. How big is that? That happens to be more than all of the other countries of the world combined. And we are supposed to apologize about having that kind of an open system? But no, we have been attacked, over and over again, for trying to get control of this. And what happens when you get out-of-control illegal immigration? You get jobs for ordinary Americans; the value of their work is bid down. And if you want to know why some people can't get good jobs today, and those jobs actually paid a lot more in the past, is because we have flooded the market.  Basically, the Democratic Party has been deeply involved with opposing any of the efforts, and many Republicans have opposed the effort to get control of this flow of illegals. Why? Well, I guess we might be able to take a look at some motives and say: there are a lot of Republicans who could have done something on this, but they didn't want to stem the flow of illegal immigrants because Big Business wants--what do they want? Cheap labor.  That is a betrayal of the American people, just as much as it is a betrayal of the American people for the other party to try to keep the flow of illegal immigrants into our country, hoping they will give them a victory at the ballot box and, thus, give them political power that they wouldn't otherwise have.  Well, it is time to draw the line, and the American people did that in the last Presidential election. And I am very proud that the American people stood up to the most massive propaganda campaign against any Presidential candidate that I have seen in my lifetime, and that was against President Donald  I just heard the other night, even the bankers up in Massachusetts and New York overwhelmingly were giving money to Hillary's campaign. But Donald Trump got a pittance. The establishment was out to destroy Donald Trump, because Donald Trump said that he was going to stop the flow of illegals, he was going to be watching out for the benefit of America's working people, and that would be the top priority.  Well, one of the things we remember, he wanted to make it real. It wasn't just a bunch of rhetoric. He kept talking about how he would build a huge wall. Now, we all know that ``a huge'' wasn't around before Donald I don't remember people using that phraseology. And what we have got now is Donald Trump is moving forward. The President of the United States is moving forward to fulfill his promise.  We should not have a situation where politics get in the way by people who lost the election and are now trying to stop and interfere with those people who won the election. That is what the democratic process is all about. And the proposal that I am making when it comes to border security is that--and I was very honored to be asked into the Oval Office by President Trump and to give him some ideas that might be good ideas on how to handle some of these problems.  What I suggested to him is, any wall that he has suggested will be built along our southern border will cost tens of billions of dollars. Well, I had a proposal that I made to him, and I have made to the leadership here in the House, and I hope that they do not ignore this because it is vitally important if we are serious about stopping this massive flow of illegal immigrants into our country. We have to be building that wall, if nothing else, as symbolism that this is a sovereign country, and we demand that our border laws be respected.  Well, what I am proposing is a change from a currently existing immigration law. And that is, we bring in 1 million legal immigrants every year. But guess what? Of that 1 million legal immigrants that we permit in--which I applaud--but among that 1 million legal immigrants, there are 50,000 of them coming in who are selected. What?  They are not selected by a process where you study who is what, who we need here, what kind of skills we need. They are selected by a lottery. They are selected by a lottery, just pulling them out of nowhere. Yes, they are vetted all right, but they are not in any way rationally designed, them coming here, in a way that would help the American people.  Well, what I am suggesting is that 50,000 people--we do not want to decrease the number of legal immigration. We don't want to decrease legal[[Page H2893]]immigration. So we have a 50,000 slot. If we eliminated that stupid lottery that we don't even decide who is coming in, that it is left up to chance, well, we eliminate that, and then we set up a special fund. And the fund is a dedicated fund that whoever puts in $1 million into that dedicated fund will do so in exchange for immediate residency and U.citizenship within 2 years.                              {time}  1815  In other words, foreign people who are successful in whatever they have done in order to accumulate wealth, and we are not going to bring in criminals, it is going to be vetted just like every other legal immigrant will be vetted to make sure they are not criminals or terrorists or anything, but people who are overseas who would love to become U.citizens, that they will be given guaranteed U.citizenship within 2 years.  Now, that would mean $1 million per person, and perhaps we might want to say that individuals could bring in their immediate family, minors, for $500,000. But whatever that is, the revenue raised from this program could be put into that special account managed by the Secretary of Homeland Security for the purpose of carrying out border security and immigration enforcement activities.  In other words, the President of the United States does not have to have the burden of raising taxes in order to pay for that Southern border wall. He does not have to pass it off on further generations by increasing the debt by that level.  We have a method in this to bring in a better quality of people who we need coming into our country rather than selecting at random and paying for a wall that will reestablish the security of the people of this country and will go a long way to establish a mindset around the world that no longer are our borders open. No longer, whoever can get over here, are we going to take in and then give them free education and free health care and let them commit crimes and not even be kicked out of the country for it. Those days are over, and this wall will symbolize that.  What I have suggested, having these foreign wealthy people pay for that wall, makes it a real possibility. If people would be interested in talking to their Member of Congress, they can call or write, but they should call and say the idea of letting rich foreigners build that wall is the answer. Let's get going on it. Let's not wait for 5 years. Build the wall and let the others pay for it. That is a plan that will work.  I would like to also discuss another issue that I have been involved in. But let me just note that, on the tax bill, I have also asked for an amendment that would increase the well-being. And, how do you say, right now our wealth is becoming so centralized in just a few hands.  What we have now in the United States is a vision that the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer. There is a problem with this concentration of wealth.  Now, the reason we have that concentration of wealth is because there are a few people in our country that own capital, own the companies that produce the wealth. And over the years, that has been focused on fewer and fewer hands, and the working people are being shut out of a system that is something that they are essential players in.  So with that said, I am certainly not against profit motive and I am certainly not against competition. I am certainly for the private sector and not for big bureaucracy. But if we just passed an incentive into our system, that incentive would be this: I am proposing that when an employer provides stock for his employees, it has to be an equal distribution to all the employees. Those employees don't have to pay income tax on it. And if those employees keep that stock for over 10 years, the employees don't have to pay capital gains tax on it.  So what we have got--if a company is successful and we have got a large increase in the value of that company, it is being shared with the workers in the company. It is not being held up in the one percent of the elite management. What we need to do is to make sure that we deal with this concentration of wealth because the American people, that is what it was all about. It wasn't about having some elite. That was what the Homestead Act was all about that helped my grandparents. We need a Homestead Act for people who are working in the various industries in our country. And tweaking the system with a little tax incentive like I am talking about, this would be an ESOP, which are already in existence but have very complicated structure associated with them, an expensive structure associated with them, that this would be like ESOPs on steroids. We will have working people thinking in terms of partnership with their employer instead of being on an adversarial relationship. People with startup companies will be able to get the top-quality people knowing if their company is successful, the capital gains tax will be zero for them who came onboard early on.  This is another proposal that I am making, and I would hope that people will look at that again and ask their Congressman to consider Congressman Rohrabacher's Employee Ownership Bill, Expanding Employee  Finally, I would like to talk about one last issue that is something that is very controversial, I know, and I have never stepped away from being controversial. But what we have got here today is a major change in public attitude towards something that has been wrong for a long time but the public was not aware of it.  I would hope that we do not pass up the chance again of legalizing the medical use of marijuana. And the fact is, 44 States have taken many restrictions off the use of medical marijuana.  I have legislation that says respect State marijuana laws. This should be left up to the This should be left up to the people who decide for themselves whether or not they believe medical marijuana should be available to seniors, to veterans, and to other people. And we should stop paying money to the drug cartels by making sure that this medicine that we now know is possible with marijuana that we don't want to have the source being the drug cartels around the world.  So I would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the medical marijuana initiative, what I have, which says we will respect medical marijuana laws and the United  I would hope that my colleagues get the message. These are four very important issues. These are issues I spent a lot of time on, but I am doing that because I understand these are fundamental. We have to start doing more. If we are going to drain the swamp, as the President says, we have got to be working on the fundamentals that are wrong with the system rather than just trying to create some image of progress and image of activity here.  We can do it. We have got good leadership here in the We have got a willingness to cooperate with the other side of the aisle. We have got a President who wants to work with us. Congress is here. We are in action, and we have got some great new creative ideas. Now the American people are welcome to participate.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgH2891.txt,979,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY BUREAU,2017.0,26.0,June
11086,topic-id,546,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership on getting this legislation to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, the CFPB's anticonsumer, anti-arbitration, pro-trial lawyer rule is just the latest example of the harm that can be done by an out-of-control, Washington-knows-best bureaucracy. This is a teaching moment for the country about how, when elites in Washington pander to special interests, they end up hurting the very people they claim to be protecting.  We all want fairer outcomes for consumers, but the CFPB's unfair, deceptive, and abusive rule will deprive millions of Americans of a convenient, fast, and effective way to resolve their disputes.  According to the CFPB's own study, only 13 percent of class actions provided a benefit to consumers, and the average payout was--get this--$32. How is that pro-consumer? The same study, on the other hand, showed that consumers who obtain relief through arbitration recover over $5,300, on average. Again, that is $5,300 in arbitration against $32 through a class action.  Meanwhile, trial lawyers in class actions earn about $1 million, on average. Consider that--$1 million for the plaintiffs' lawyers, a $32 coupon, $32 cash, for a consumer. In other words, trial lawyers stand to earn 31,000 times more than a consumer in a class action.  In arbitration, however, consumers get meaningful relief. Yet the CFPB has finalized a rule that would effectively get rid of arbitration and promote class actions as the preferred dispute resolution process. This hardly seems fair.  The CFPB's anti-arbitration rule is an invitation to trial lawyers to take all they can get. Banks, credit unions, and other businesses that American consumers interact with on a daily basis will be forced to hold greater reserves because of the risk of future costly litigation. This will increase costs for consumers, and it will lead to less access or more expensive financial services for millions of It could also harm the safety and soundness of the financial system, according to the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the main Federal banking regulators.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires that any move by the CFPB to regulate arbitration agreements needs to be in the public interest and for the protection of consumers. I fail to see how forcing consumers to accept a coupon for their troubles and handing millions of dollars in payouts to trial lawyers meets either of those goals.  Only at the CFPB could endangering local banks and credit unions and restricting consumer access to financial services be cast as a win for the American people. But, again, this is what you get from the least accountable agency in history, an agency with, according to the D.Circuit Court of Appeals, massive and unchecked power that is headed by a Director who possesses more unilateral authority than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the U. It has long been understood that expeditious, fair resolution of disputes is in the public interest and part of the public policy of this country. The CFPB rule we are reviewing today challenges that premise, as did the Dodd-Frank section that spawned this rule. But it is the people, acting through their elected Representatives, who have the final say in this matter.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

Approximately 2 years ago, President Obama signed into law the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014.  The law modernized and improved Federal recordkeeping statutes by codifying agency responsibilities that have been in practice for decades. Once the law was enacted, the General Services Administration, or GSA, identified technical provisions in the law that the agency interpreted as limiting its ability to regulate Federal agency mailroom operations.[[Page H4267]]  The GSA has been responsible for the regulation and oversight of Federal agency mail management for many years. Congress did not intend for the 2014 law to change the mail management structure.

Mr.Speaker, here we are again: the special interests are running the show in Pointblank, this resolution will make it harder for Americans to get justice. Specifically, this will unwind critical new rules that allow financial consumers to take collective action. You heard that right. This is an effort to take away your ability to sue big banks when they run you over.

In June, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran is within the limits set by this historic deal. There are serious issues left to be addressed with Iran, especially in regards to human rights violations and ballistic missiles, which this bill covers.  The Iran deal took Iran's nuclear weapons off the table and allowed us to deal with these remaining challenges. Withdrawing or violating the agreement would be an enormous mistake.

11241,topic-id,1478,"Mr.President, from all indications, our Republican friends continue to negotiate amongst themselves, behind closed doors, to revive the healthcare bill they had to pull from the floor on  I would suggest to my friends on the other side that there is no tweak or change or modification that will fix what is wrong with this Republican healthcare bill. The core of the bill is the problem. The American people are opposed to tax cuts for the wealthy and the reduction of the social safety net of Social Security, Medicare, and  The Republican TrumpCare bill is built on a crumbling, decrepit foundation, and that is because it is based on the premise that special interests and a very small number of wealthy Americans deserve a tax break while millions of Americans--middle class families, older Americans in nursing homes, folks with a preexisting condition--ought to receive less healthcare at a higher cost.  That idea is so backward, so out of step with what America wants and what actually works, it can never succeed, no matter how it is tweaked.  The one thing my Republican friends are latching on to--that their bill will bring down average premiums several years down the line--is really a bait and switch. The bait is lower premiums, but the switch is higher deductibles and copays so that, in the end, the average American pays more than they would have otherwise. They are luring people in with a lower premium, but then they have to pay such a high percentage of their medical costs, the insurance policy is virtually worthless.  The Republican TrumpCare bill tells insurers they can offer much less generous healthcare plans than under the current system, even allowing States to opt out of covering essential benefits like treatment for opioids, mental health coverage, prescription drug coverage, and maternity care.  The result of these changes is that insurers may charge smaller premiums on some plans, but they will cover way less and, in fact, the deductibles and copays will go up--way up--in order to make the difference. So this isn't: Oh, you are not paying for some esoteric item; your insurance policy will pay for virtually nothing at the beginning if you have a high deductible.  The CBO report estimates that for an average 40-year-old with an income of $26,500 a year, looking at insurance on the marketplace, deductibles would increase by thousands. If that 40-year-old decided on a ``bronze'' plan, for instance, their deductible would be $6,000 a year, the CBO estimates. That is $5,200 more than under current law. So we know what that means: They have to pay the first $6,000 of healthcare, no matter what your insurance policy is. What good is that? Not much. Good for the insurance industry, maybe; not good for the average citizen. Some of my colleagues on the other side are claiming they want lower premiums, but if those lower premiums come with higher deductibles and higher copays, nobody benefits. It is a bait and switch.  What the Republican bill gives with one hand in this area, it more than takes away with the other because the lower premiums are made up for by higher deductibles and copays, so the average person pays more, not less, even when their premium goes down.  Who in America believes that folks should have higher out-of-pocket costs than before? Who in America believes that folks making over $1 million a year--God bless them; they are doing well--deserve another $57,000 tax break? Who in America believes that we should be making it harder to afford nursing home care or maternity care or opioid abuse treatment? Who in America believes a child born with a preexisting condition should hit their lifetime insurance limit before they even leave the hospital for the first time? Who believes in that in this America?  It turns out, almost no one. A poll yesterday showed that only 12 percent of Americans support the Republican bill. No amendment or compromise or tweak or adjustment in formula can solve that.  So I repeat the offer I made to President Trump and my Republican friends yesterday: Let's start over. Drop this fundamentally flawed approach--abandon cuts to Medicaid, abandon tax breaks for the wealthy--and we can discuss the problems that Americans are actually concerned about: the cost, quality, and availability of healthcare.  I suggested that President Trump invite all Senators to Blair House to begin anew on a bipartisan approach to healthcare. Unfortunately, the President said I wasn't serious. Mr.President: Try me. The minute you make the invitation, we will take it in a very serious way. It is not that audacious of an idea. President Obama did the same thing early in his Presidency to discuss healthcare with Members of both parties in front of the American people. Our only condition: Drop the wrong-headed idea of slashing Medicaid to give tax breaks to the wealthy. It is perfectly reasonable, and a vast majority of Americans agree with us.  Nonpartisan institutions like the American Medical Association, the National Association of Medicaid Directors, AARP, and America's largest nursing home groups are all against the Republican approach. The Congressional Budget Office and other expert analyses say that it will not actually fix the problems in our healthcare system--high deductibles, high premiums, counties with too few insurance options--and the American people are as roundly against it as any piece of major legislation I have ever seen.  So I don't believe it is unserious to ask my Republican friends to drop this particular bill and talk to us about actually fixing the problems in our healthcare system.  I don't believe it is unserious to say to President Trump: You campaigned on bringing costs down and providing care for everyone. You campaigned on not cutting Medicaid and controlling the outrageous costs of prescription drugs. These are all your words in the campaign. Well, we Democrats agree with all of that. So let's talk about it.  Fundamentally, I don't believe that seeking a bipartisan solution on the great issues of our time should ever be considered unserious.  President Trump, you have complained about a lack of bipartisanship--unfairly, in our opinion. We are offering a way to implement bipartisanship, and right now it is you, not we, who are stopping it.  I hope my Republican friends, President Trump, and the majority leader think long and hard before dismissing our offer out of hand. I challenge them again: Invite all of us to Blair House the first day we get back from recess. If you think we are not serious, try us. Democrats are ready to turn the page on healthcare. When will my Republican friends realize it is time for them to do the same?                            Russia Sanctions  Finally, Mr.President, as to Russia sanctions, on June 15, nearly 2 weeks[[Page S3841]]ago, the Senate, in an act of bipartisanship, passed a tough Russia sanctions bill on a 98-to-2 vote. There are very few things of such significance that this body does with such a large bipartisan vote--Democrats and Republicans, all but two coming together.  The majority leader, Senator McConnell, and I worked hard to pass it before a possible meeting between President Trump and President Putin at the G20 summit. We wanted to send a message to Mr.Putin: If you interfere with our democratic institutions, you will be punished. These new sanctions should also help to deter future Russian interference.  At the Speaker's request, I hope this morning the Senate will pass a technical correction to address the blue-slip issue. It is important for Speaker Ryan to get the House to act on this legislation before the July 4th recess. It is critical that Congress speak in a loud, clear, and unified voice to President Putin: Interfering with our elections--the wellspring and pride of our democracy for over two centuries--will not be tolerated, and the United States will always respond forcefully, including with the power of economic sanctions.  I want to put the House on notice. If they water down the bill, weaken the sanctions, add loopholes to the legislation, they will find stiff resistance here in the  Later today, we will break for the July 4th recess. The Fourth of July is a day to remember the audacity of a ragtag group of colonies who declared themselves free and independent from the tyranny of one of the great, mighty foreign powers. What better way to mark the occasion than for the Congress of that once fledgling Nation--now the mightiest Nation in the world, ourselves--to pass a bill that says, 241 years since that fateful day, that we intend to defend our democracy as fiercely as the patriots who put down their plows and took up muskets on Bunker Hill did?

But keep in mind, ultimately, we have got to force China to decide whether they are going to support North Korea or whether they are going to have access to American markets. We can't let them have both.  As to Iran, this bill designates the entire Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps, as the Quds Force has already been designated, as subject to terrorism sanctions, and provides an arms embargo. Let us remember that the real face of this regime in Tehran is not their dapper foreign minister, but rather it is the hundreds of thousands who have died in Syria as a result of Iranian action.  Speaking of countries that have supported Assad, finally and perhaps most importantly, this bill provides sanctions against Russia necessary because of its action in the Ukraine and its interference in our elections.  We hit Russia in a very important way by dealing with the technology they would need to explore oil.

We call these people the Alaskans of the Learning about these individuals and sharing their stories with my Senate colleagues, Alaskans, and Americans who watch what we do here or who are in the gallery, is probably one of the best parts of my week every week.

We will remember the hard-fought battles that brought us independence, and we will remember those who have served and sacrificed to keep our country the land of the free and the home of the brave. They are the heroes among us, and Alaska is chock-full of these heroes.  Today I want to recognize one of them, a very special hero who is our Alaskan of the Week--Solomon Atkinson, who spent nearly his entire adult life serving our country with honor and dignity and now serves his community in Alaska tirelessly.  Let me tell you a little bit about Sol and his illustrious career in the military. Sol was born in 1930 to Harris and Elizabeth Atkinson in Metlakatla,  Metlakatla is on Annette Island on the Inside Passage, where so many Americans take cruises to see the glaciers and the whales. It is home to the only federally recognized Indian reservation in our  Sol could have continued to live in Metlakatla, where he was a commercial fisherman as a young man, but, like so many patriotic Alaskans, he chose to leave his home and join the military. Sol joined the U.Navy, and for 22 years--from 1951 to 1973--he had by anybody's standards a remarkable patriotic military career.  In 1953, Sol volunteered for the Navy's legendary Underwater Demolition Team and was deployed to the Pacific, including Some history buffs will know and recall that the Underwater Demolition Team, the UDT, was the precursor to the present-day Navy SEALS--frogmen, as they liked to call themselves. In fact, Sol was on the very first Navy SEAL team created by President Kennedy in 1962, and I have a copy of the SEAL Team One plank owners certificate, commissioned on January 1, 1962, with Sol's name proudly displayed.  So Sol became a Navy SEAL--the first Navy SEAL, literally. He became a SEAL team training instructor, training new Navy SEAL recruits. He was affectionately referred to as ``the Mean Machine'' by the Navy He also had the honor of training 48 astronauts, including Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Jim Lovell, just to name a few, in underwater weightlessness simulations. His prized possession is a framed plaque bearing the signature of all those astronauts, all those American heroes whom he trained.  Sol completed three combat tours in By the time he retired from the military, he had earned numerous awards and medals for personal valor, including the Bronze Star and the Purple But what is truly remarkable about Sol is that after he retired from the Navy, he moved back home to Metlakatla and continued to serve his country and serve his community. He served on the Indian Community Council, on the school board, and as mayor of He has also been very involved in veterans affairs and was the president of the first veterans organization on the island and was instrumental in starting that organization. He has spent years reaching out to his fellow veterans to make sure they receive the benefits, honor, and dignity they earned.  Jeff Moran, the superintendent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Metlakatla, said this about Sol:       I could go on and on regarding the wonderful things that      Sol has done for his community. We would not be here today      without his leadership and knowledge [and commitment].  I, too, can go on about Many Alaskans can go on about Sol and all the things he has done. But I also want to mention, particularly on the eve of the Fourth of July, that he is part of a long tradition in my State of Alaskan Natives who have served in the military, who have served our country even during darker times in our history when many Alaskan Natives were discriminated against and denied basic rights.  On the eve of the Fourth of July, we celebrate America's independence but also in particular those who have fought for that independence over the last 200 years. As I mentioned, one proud element of my great State is that we have more veterans per capita than any State in the country, and Alaska Native veterans serve at higher rates in the U.military than any[[Page S3840]]other ethnic group in the country--something I like to refer to as a special kind of patriotism because they have been doing this for decades, like Sol--even at times, as I mentioned, when the country hasn't always treated that group of patriotic Americans with the respect and dignity they deserve. Sol personifies this special patriotism.  The SEALs who served with him wrote this about him in a tribute:       Sol's story will continue to be told by the men he trained,      by the officers who relied on him, by the Frogmen who all      respect him. An officer, a gentleman, an athlete, a friend,      Sol Atkinson is all of these, but of all of these traits, he      is first a  We can see the pride the Navy SEALs have for Sol, a plank owner for the entire organization.

In fact, the CFPB's own study even admitted that arbitration is faster, less expensive, and pays out consumers much higher compared to the class action lawsuit.  Of course, many trial lawyers oppose arbitration because it denies them of exorbitant class action lawsuit fees. It is an inexpensive alternative to courtroom litigation.  If consumers are lucky enough to be part of the successful class action, the average individual payment is, as my colleague just pointed out, only about $32. Remarkably, the trial lawyers raked in $425 million in class action fees between 2010 and 2013, according to a study by  Of the arbitrations reviewed by the CFPB in which consumers were victorious, the average individual payout was $5,389.

11053,topic-id,1672,"Mr.President, there is no doubt that the last 8 years were not good ones for the American economy. Yearly economic growth under the Obama administration averaged just under 1.5 percent. That is less than half the growth needed for a healthy economy. That kind of weak growth has consequences: fewer jobs, fewer opportunities, and lower wages.  Wage growth was almost nonexistent during the Obama administration, and new jobs and opportunities were few and far between. There have been a few encouraging signs since the election. Both wage and job growth have shown some improvement, but we are still a long way from getting our economy back to full health. The GDP report for the first quarter of this year underscored the need to implement the kind of progrowth policies that were lacking during the Obama years.  One major way to spur economic growth and improve the health of our economy is to reform our Nation's Tax Our current Tax Code is strangling businesses, both large and small. Our Nation has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, putting American businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy.  Small businesses and family farms face high tax rates, at times exceeding those paid by large corporations. These tax policies have consequences. A small company that owes a large tax bill to the Federal Government is unlikely to be able to come up with the capital necessary to expand the business or hire new workers.  When American businesses are taxed at a far higher rate than their foreign counterparts, it is likely to be the foreign rather than the American company that expands and thrives. Tax reform needs to address these obstacles to growth. Later this year, the Senate plans to consider a major tax reform package. Two of the most powerful tax-related things we can do to increase economic growth are lowering business tax rates and allowing business to recover their investments in inventory, machinery, and the like faster.  The Senate tax bill will do both. Today, I am introducing legislation that I hope will be a part of the final tax reform package in the My bill--I am calling it the Investment in New Ventures and Economic Success Today Act, or the INVEST Act for short--focuses on helping small- and medium-sized businesses by allowing them to recover their costs faster.  Earlier this year, the Economic Innovation Group released a report on economic dynamism. Economic dynamism, as the Economic Innovation Group defines it, refers to the rate at which new businesses are born and die. In a dynamic economy, the rate of new business creation is high and significantly outstrips the rate of business deaths, but that hasn't been the case in the United States lately.  New business creation has significantly dropped over the past several years. Between 2009 and 2011, business deaths outstripped business births. While the numbers have since improved slightly, the recovery has been poor and far from historical norms.  The Economic Innovation Group notes that 2012, the economy's best year for business creation since the recession, ``fell far short of its worst year prior to 2008.'' Well, this is deeply concerning because new businesses have historically been responsible for a substantial part of the job creation in this country, not to mention a key source of innovation.  When new businesses are not being created at a strong rate, workers face a whole host of problems. A less dynamic economy--the Economic Innovation Group notes--``is one likely to feature fewer jobs, lower labor force participation, slack wage growth, and rising inequality, exactly what we see today.''[[Page S3012]]Again, that is from the Economic Innovation  Well, starting a new business always has a substantial element of risk. We don't need to make it harder by throwing up tax and regulatory obstacles. If we want to see our economy thriving again, we need to be encouraging the creation of new businesses, but our Tax Code, too often, does the opposite.  My bill, the INVEST Act, would encourage new business creation by allowing new enterprises to deduct a substantial part of their startup costs within the first year. Under current law, new businesses are only able to deduct $5,000 of their startup costs within their first year. Any startup expenses above that amount can be deducted, but that deduction is stretched out over a 15-year period. That is a long time.  The faster a new business can recover its startup costs, the faster it can establish itself on a secure footing. Entrepreneurs are far more likely to take the risk of starting a new venture if they know they will be able to recover their startup costs quickly. My bill would substantially increase the amount of a business's startup costs that can be deducted in the first year from $5,000 to $50,000.  Plus, any additional startup costs can be deducted over a 10-year period instead of the current 15. This will go a long way toward encouraging new business creation and the economic dynamism that comes along with it.  The second part of my bill focuses on increasing cashflow for businesses, farms and ranches, and particularly those that operate as corporations and partnerships, by allowing them to use the so-called cash method of accounting. Under current law, these businesses, farms, and ranches are generally forced to use what is called accrual accounting. Basically, what that means is, a business has to pay tax on income before it receives the cash, and it cannot deduct all of its expenses when it pays the invoice.  For a company with inventory, this means it has to deduct the investments it makes over an extended period of time. A small business might have to spend the majority of its available cash on inventory but be unable to fully deduct that expense until all of that inventory is sold.  In the case of some businesses, it might be well beyond the current tax year before that substantial investment can be fully deducted. That can leave a business increasingly cash poor. Cash poor businesses don't expand. They don't hire new workers. They don't increase wages.  Well, the INVEST Act would allow businesses to deduct investments and inventory up front, leaving them with more cash on hand to put back into their operations. It would also reduce the need for businesses to hire armies of lawyers and accountants to ensure that they have properly adhered to complex accounting rules.  Finally, the INVEST Act would substantially reform the depreciation and expensing rules. Traditionally, farms and businesses have been forced to deduct expenses like machinery, property, or agricultural equipment over an extended period--anywhere from 5 to 10 years or as many as 39 years for commercial buildings. That could leave a farm or a business with its cash tied up for years in all the property it takes to run the enterprise. Of course, that means a farm, LLC, or S corporation can spend years without being able to increase its investment in a business or to hire new workers.  My bill would permanently allow all businesses to deduct 50 percent of their investment in equipment, vehicles, machinery, and certain other kinds of property during the year in which they are purchased. It would also help small and medium-sized farms and businesses to recover an even greater portion of their capital investments by allowing them to deduct at least $2 million of new investments in business property.  My bill expands current law so additional building improvements--things like roofs, heating, and air conditioning units would qualify for immediate expensing. Farmers and ranchers who may reach the limit on full expensing are not forgotten either. The bill substantially increases the rate at which they can deduct the costs of tractors, combines, and other machinery.  Finally, for those farms and businesses that rely on cars, light trucks, and vans, this bill would substantially increase the amount of their vehicle investment that can be deducted when the business determines its taxable income each year. Currently, a light truck used on a farm or ranch could cost upwards of $30,000. Yet a farmer is only allowed to deduct $19,000 of that cost over the required recovery period for a business vehicle. My bill would substantially increase that limit to bring it more in line with the real-world costs of business vehicles.  These changes to expensing rules all have one goal: putting more money back in the hands of business owners--particularly, small business owners, farmers, and ranchers. Forcing business owners, farmers, and ranchers to lock up their capital for 5, 10, or nearly 40 years discourages growth and job creation. Under my bill, businesses, farms, and ranches would be able to redeploy that hard-to-raise capital back into business expansion, increase in wages, new jobs, and even new ventures.  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the economy will grow at a rate of just 1.9 percent over the next 30 years. That is a full percentage point lower than the average growth rate over the past 50 years, which was over 3 percent, or between 3.2 and 3.5. That will mean decades of fewer jobs and opportunities, low wage growth, and a reduced standard of living. We don't want to resign ourselves to that, and we don't have to. If we eliminate the antigrowth features of our Tax Code, if we lift the regulatory burdens facing American businesses and free up businesses to grow and create jobs, we can achieve a future of strong economic growth--the kind of strong growth that will fuel employment and wage growth, along with greater opportunities for American workers.  I hope the INVEST Act will help us develop the kind of tax reform legislation that will help us restore strong, sustainable economic growth, and I am looking forward to working with Chairman Hatch and all of my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to put together the final bill and to get it to the  It is time that we give the American people a tax code that actually works for them.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgS3011.txt,1534,COUNTERING AMERICA'S ADVERSARIES THROUGH SANCTIONS ACT,2017.0,17.0,May

Thirty-two dollars that they are willing to celebrate over as compensation for people who have been harmed.  Let us look at the other side of the ledger. What are trial lawyers receiving? On average, $1 million. So while our friends may want to stand up for the trial lawyers, for their million-dollar paychecks, we are going to choose to stand with the American consumer to make sure that they are going to be able to receive the justice that they deserve, and one way to be able to do that is going to be through arbitration.  When we look at the CFPB's own statistics, the average arbitration payout is not your $32. It is almost $5,400, which has been received in terms of compensation that is going to be paid.  This latest rule, Mr.Speaker, joins a growing list of CFPB actions that have hurt consumers. Since the Bureau's inception, they have rolled out rules and regulations 3\1/2\ times faster than other Federal agencies, and according to the research from the American Action Forum, just 26 of these regulations have added an additional $2.8 billion in regulatory costs.  The practical effect of the Bureau's actions are measurable, especially in rural districts like mine: no mortgage credit for young families trying to purchase their first home, community banks that spend more time on compliance than serving their community, and small businesses that cannot get the capital that they need to grow.  The Arbitration Agreements rule is nothing more than the latest sleight-[[Page H6273]]of-hand by the Bureau taking money out of pockets of consumers and gifting it to trial lawyers.

11110,topic-id,328,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.111, which will block the CFPB's harmful arbitration rule.  I want to start with a little story. Last year, I opened up the mail, and I got a wonderful surprise. I got a check for $3.92. Apparently, I was part of some class action lawsuit, didn't know it, dug into the facts, didn't feel I had been harmed, didn't know who the attorneys were, but I got $3.92, almost enough to buy a latte. I did a little digging around and turns out the lawyers representing the plaintiff class made millions of dollars.  Now, we have heard a lot of conflicting stories here today about this bill being harmful to consumers. Here are the facts.  In a class action lawsuit, a typical consumer gets $32; in arbitration, a typical consumer gets $5,400; in a class action lawsuit, it takes 12 times longer for the consumer to get the money.  But how can this be? Well, in my prior life, I represented a lot of clients who were involved in class action lawsuits. Here is your typical class action lawsuit.  It involves a highly technical violation, not the Wells Fargo example, where there is little or no harm to the consumer, goes on for years, costs millions of dollars in legal fees, and at the end of the day, there is a settlement for $3.92.  I will make a deal with my friends on the other side of the aisle. I will buy anyone a latte who comes clean with the American people and tells them why they are opposing this bill.  The reason why they are opposing this bill is the Trial Lawyers Association makes millions of dollars, and that money lines the pockets of their campaign coffers. It is not about consumers. It is about lawyers protecting lawyers, and it is about protecting the bureaucrats in the swamp.  I ask all my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution.

11048,topic-id,531,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.2281, the Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, this bill, H.2281, seeks to reauthorize the Border Enforcement Security Task Force, or BEST, program within the Department of Homeland  U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement leads 42 BEST units across 16 States within the United States and Puerto Each unit is comprised of members from ICE's Homeland Security Investigations, U.Customs and Border Protection, as well as other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies who investigate criminal activity along the southwest and northern borders and at the Nation's major seaports.  These units play a critical role in advancing DHS' border security efforts by ensuring all levels of domestic law enforcement are sharing information and leveraging resources. BEST units have been instrumental in coordinating joint operations with our law enforcement partners in Mexico to thwart threats posed by transnational criminal organizations.  This legislation is in furtherance of my efforts as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Boder and Maritime Security to bolster law enforcement collaboration on cross-border threats and to ensure that resources are used in a strategic manner to effectively mitigate such threats, particularly in response to the drug cartels.  Those of us representing border districts are well aware that cartels adapt quickly to exploit real or perceived weaknesses in our security. As they shift their criminal operations to new locations along our land borders, smuggle their contraband into the United States through our ports of entry, or utilize maritime routes into this country, DHS must be at the ready to quickly intercept and disrupt their operations.  This legislation seeks to ensure that DHS continues to use BEST units to maximum effect. This bill instructs DHS, before standing up a BEST unit, to consider the cross-border threats posed by transnational criminal organizations, the Department's homeland and border security strategic priorities, as well as the operations of DHS' joint task forces and other multiagency efforts.  H.2281 also updates existing reporting requirements so that Congress has better information on how effectively BEST units are reducing criminal activity, such as the traffic of drugs, weapons, and people along our borders; enhancing information sharing among law enforcement partners; coordinating with the Department's joint task forces; and generally advancing the DHS homeland security and border security strategic priorities.

H.2281 was approved by voice vote by the full committee on May 3 and enjoys broad, bipartisan support.

11057,topic-id,964,"Mr.President, I rise today to announce the reintroduction of the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act of 2017. This legislation would allow student loan borrowers to take advantage of lower interest rates, and I urge both my Senate colleagues and the Trump administration to support it. In a few short months, millions more college graduates will be hit with their first student loan bills.  Already, more than 44 million Americans have student loans, and many are struggling to pay loans that are running at interest rates of 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent and even more. It is time for real action to help struggling borrowers. That is why, today, I join 36 of my Democratic colleagues in the Senate and 98 of my Democratic colleagues in the House of Representatives to reintroduce our plan to allow borrowers to lower their monthly payment by refinancing their existing loans to today's lower interest rates, 3.76 percent for undergrads, a little higher for graduate students.  Supporting America's students should not be a political food fight. In fact, President Trump talked about student loans when he was on the campaign trial, including a plan to reduce the maximum number of years for repayment for most students.  As a candidate, Donald Trump said that ``students should not be asked to pay more on the debt than they can afford.'' I agree with that, which is why Congress should allow students to lower their monthly payments by refinancing to today's lower interest rates. Donald Trump also said that ``student loan debt should not be an albatross around student's necks for the rest of their lives.''  I agree with that too. The legislation I am introducing today would lower the outstanding balance for millions of Americans, allowing them to get out from under their student loans faster. Here is one more. Donald Trump said that it is ``terrible that one of the only profit centers we have is student loans.'' He also said that ``it is not fair and that should not take place.''  Unfortunately, right now, that is exactly what is happening. According to a recent analysis of Congressional Budget Office data by the Institute for College Access and Success, after all the costs are accounted for, the Federal Government is now on track to make $81 billion off student loans over the next 10 years.  That is obscene. The Federal Government should not be making a profit off the backs of our students, period. Yes, Candidate Trump talked a lot about this problem, but talk is cheap, and President Trump has not done a thing to fix the problem. In fact, he seems to have lost all interest in students and their student loans. Since his election in November, he has not even mentioned his campaign promises about student loans.  Instead, he and Education Secretary DeVos have gone in the opposite direction, using their short time in office to deliver one blow after another to hard-working Americans who are struggling with student debt. Back when he was running for President, Donald Trump made a lot of promises, but empty promises don't help the students who have been punched in the gut by Secretary DeVos's decision to roll back critical consumer protections for borrowers.  Hollow campaign pledges do not help the students, the veterans, the members of our Armed Forces when they are hurt by student loan companies, like Navient, that break the law and brazenly announce to the world that they don't think they have a responsibility to act in the best interests of students.  Rally speeches don't mean much when this administration is ripping up policies that would have made it harder for greedy student loan companies to rake in lucrative government contracts while cheating students. Last year's rhetoric means nothing to the struggling borrowers who can now be charged sky-high fees--as high as 16 percent--by student loan collection companies thanks to yet another policy Betsy DeVos ripped up.  Students know what is going on. The loan companies know too. Industry stocks have skyrocketed since Mr.President, keep your promise and start by supporting this refinancing bill.  For nearly 4 years, Republicans have filibustered this bill and refused to even debate it, despite its overwhelming public support. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans have offered nothing--nothing--to seriously address the problems of student loan borrowers. Those problems keep getting worse. Today's students are wrestling with $1.4 trillion in student loan debt, and every year the student loan debt increases by nearly $100 billion.  Interest rates are scheduled to jump up again later this summer, meaning the urgency for Congress to act and allow borrowers to access today's rates is stronger than ever. The Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act would give millions of borrowers across this country a chance to save hundreds and in some cases thousands of dollars a year. That is real money, money they can put toward paying down the balance on their debt, money they can use to save for a home, money they can spend on buying a car, money they can put toward building a solid future.  By refusing to act and ignoring this debt crisis, Republicans threaten to bury the hopes of an entire generation. It is time for Congress to step up and fix this problem. It is also time for the President to step up as well.  President Trump, you campaigned on the idea that the Federal Government should not be making a profit off the backs of hard-working students. So support this legislation. Put it in your annual budget, this proposal. Call on Members of your own party who have held up this bill to get on board.

While this rule claims consumer protection, it does the very opposite. It will cost Americans more of their hard-earned money and time.  The CFPB is arguably the most powerful and yet unaccountable government agency in the history of this country. By intentional design, the CFPB is not accountable to Congress or the taxpayer.  According to the D.Circuit, the unelected CFPB Director, Richard Cordray, ``possesses more unilateral authority than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the U.Government.''  What does this mean exactly? Well, it means that no one is checking the Director's actions. The CFPB is able to evade all limits and restraints proposed by the government. Because of this, Director Cordray is only looking out for one person--that is himself.  The CFPB chose to ignore their own study because the results did not fit the narrative they were trying to impose on This study showed that the average consumer receives $5,400--we have heard this already--in cash relief when using arbitration, as opposed to an inadequate $32 through class action suits.  In addition, the study concluded that the use of arbitration produced a higher recovery rate and shorter timeline for the consumer, and that is good. Regardless of this study, Director Cordray has refused to acknowledge that taxpayers will feel the immediate damage that comes from limiting their options by being forced to pay more for less.
