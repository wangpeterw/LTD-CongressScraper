               OFFICER DOWN: MIGUEL MORENO--TEXAS LAWMAN

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Peace Officers Miguel Moreno and Julio 
Cavazos of the San Antonio Police Department were responding to a 
routine call when they were approached by two individuals. Suddenly, 
one dastardly criminal pulled out a firearm and began shooting at both 
officers.
  As the shots rang out, both officers were hit. 32-year-old Officer 
Moreno took a bullet to the chest, collapsing to the ground. Officer 
Cavazos ran to his fellow officer, Moreno, pulling him out of the line 
of fire despite being shot himself. He fired back at the outlaw, 
hitting the mark; and, in my opinion, justice was then served.
  Despite Cavazos' quick actions, 32-year-old Officer Moreno succumbed 
to his injuries. Another life needlessly stolen from the thin blue 
line.
  Miguel Moreno was a 9-year veteran of the force. He woke up each 
morning ready to serve and protect his community. His life was stolen 
by an evil villain with no socially redeeming value.
  Moreno stood for everything that is good in America. As we mourn his 
loss, we should thank the good Lord that such people as he ever lived. 
He was part of the rare breed, the American breed. Our peace officers 
are the best we have. America needs to stand with peace officers. We 
should stand with the thin blue line--the line that separates the 
lawful from the lawless.
  God bless Officer Moreno and his family.
  And that is just the way it is.
