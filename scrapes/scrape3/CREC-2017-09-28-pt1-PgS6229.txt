                                 ______
                                 

SENATE RESOLUTION 270--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2017 AS ``NATIONAL OVARIAN 
                        CANCER AWARENESS MONTH''

  Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Brown, Mr. King, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. 
Blumenthal, Mr. Menendez, and Ms. Hirono) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 270

       Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic 
     cancers;
       Whereas ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer 
     deaths among women in the United States;
       Whereas, in 2017 in the United States, approximately 22,440 
     new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed and 14,080 
     women will die of ovarian cancer;
       Whereas the mortality rate for ovarian cancer has not 
     significantly decreased since the ``War on Cancer'' was 
     declared more than 40 years ago;
       Whereas \1/4\ of women will die within 1 year of being 
     diagnosed with ovarian cancer and more than \1/2\ will die 
     within 5 years of that diagnosis;
       Whereas, while the mammogram can detect breast cancer and 
     the Pap smear can detect cervical cancer, there is no 
     reliable early detection test for ovarian cancer;
       Whereas the lack of an early detection test means that 
     approximately 80 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are 
     detected at an advanced stage;
       Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, but 
     approximately 20 percent of women who are diagnosed with 
     ovarian cancer have a hereditary predisposition to ovarian 
     cancer, which places them at even higher risk;
       Whereas scientists and physicians have uncovered changes in 
     the BRCA genes that some women inherit from their parents, 
     which may make those women 30 times more likely to develop 
     ovarian cancer;
       Whereas the family history of a woman has been found to 
     play an important role in accurately assessing the risk of 
     that woman of developing ovarian cancer and medical experts 
     believe that family history should be taken into 
     consideration during the annual well-woman visit of any 
     woman;
       Whereas many experts in health prevention now recommend 
     genetic testing for young women with a family history of 
     breast and ovarian cancer;
       Whereas women who know that they are at high risk of breast 
     and ovarian cancer may undertake prophylactic measures to 
     help reduce the risk of developing those diseases;
       Whereas, as of 2017, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 
     recommends that all women who are diagnosed with ovarian 
     cancer receive counseling and genetic testing;
       Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of 
     ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal 
     pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary 
     symptoms, and several other symptoms that are easily confused 
     with other diseases;
       Whereas awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer by 
     women and health care providers can lead to a quicker 
     diagnosis;
       Whereas, in June 2007, the first national consensus 
     statement on ovarian cancer symptoms was developed to provide 
     consistency in describing symptoms to make it easier for 
     women to learn and remember those symptoms; and
       Whereas, each year during the month of September, the 
     Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance and community partners 
     hold a number of events to increase public awareness of 
     ovarian cancer: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates September 2017 as ``National Ovarian Cancer 
     Awareness Month''; and
       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Ovarian 
     Cancer Awareness Month.
