             REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS OF WOMEN ARE UNDER ATTACK

  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition 
to the absurdly titled Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.
  This bill is yet another attempt by the majority to intimidate women 
and providers of abortion care by imposing restrictions that are 
redundant, at best, and life-threatening, at worse. Time and again, 
Republicans have charged that politicians, not women and their doctors, 
know what is best for women's bodies. Enough is enough.
  Today is a reminder that women's reproductive rights are constantly 
under attack, and I will never waver in fighting back. This bill is 
completely unnecessary. It has always been illegal to kill newborn 
infants, and to suggest this legislation is anything more than 
redundant obstruction for women accessing healthcare is outrageous.
  Instead of spending time on unnecessary legislation, my Republican 
colleagues should work with Democrats to fund the government and 
protect 800,000 young people, our DREAMers, from deportation to 
countries they have never known.
  Mr. Speaker, Americans face actual real problems every single day. So 
let's get back to work.
