     Syria (ISIS)has claimed responsibility for multiple terrorist 
     attacks against civilians that have left more than 180 dead 
     and many more wounded.
       Whereas ISIS frequently claims attacks perpetrated by 
     individual actors or other groups for propaganda purposes.

     following two terrorist attacks claimed by ISIS in London on 
     June 4 and Manchester on May 22 that targeted and killed 
     innocent men, women, and children.
       Whereas government forces in the Philippines are currently 
     fighting ISIS militants in Mindanao, including ISIS-
     affiliated fighters from the Philippines, Indonesia, 
     Malaysia, Chechnya, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, who launched an 
     assault in Marawi City on May 23 in an apparent effort to 
     establish a caliphate in Southeast Asia.

     in Jakarta, Indonesia, killing three policemen.

     then detonated a second bomb killing elderly Iraqis 
     collecting their pensions.

     person in Melbourne, Australia and wounded three police 
     officers.

     12 people were killed when gunmen and suicide bombers 
     targeted Iran's parliament and a shrine in two coordinated 
     attacks across Tehran.
       Whereas these reprehensible attacks have no place in a 
     peaceful world: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
