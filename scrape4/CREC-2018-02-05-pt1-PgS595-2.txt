                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God our rock, we look to You for safety in a chaotic world. We are 
grateful that You hear our prayers, responding to our requests for 
help.
  Be a shield for our Senators, protecting them from dangers seen and 
unseen. As they put their trust in You, fill them with Your Spirit, 
giving them confidence in the unfolding of Your powerful providence. 
Lord, remind them that no weapon formed against them will ultimately 
prosper. Lead them like a shepherd beside still waters, as You fill 
their hearts with Your peace.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
