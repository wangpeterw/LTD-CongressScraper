             HONORING THE LIFE OF STAFF SERGEANT CARL ENIS

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a life that was lost too 
soon. Staff Sergeant Carl Enis from Tallahassee was tragically killed 
in the Black Hawk helicopter crash that claimed the lives of seven 
members of the United States Air Force in western Iraq last week.
  Sergeant Enis graduated from Florida State University, and went on to 
get his MBA in 2017. He chose to selflessly serve our country and he 
joined the Air Force after college, serving as a pararescueman, where 
he performed combat rescue missions as a member of the elite 308th 
Rescue Squadron.
  Sergeant Enis loved the outdoors, and he even had a blog about 
hunting, fishing, and hiking. He was loved and respected by all who met 
him.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Staff Sergeant Carl Enis and 
all of our fallen heroes who gave their last full measure of devotion 
to this country to make Americans safe at home and abroad.
