                     WE MUST REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we must reopen the 
government.
  I find it troubling that a majority of the Senate Democrats have 
chosen to severely jeopardize our military readiness, shut down central 
government operations, and eliminate healthcare coverage for low-income 
children, all while setting an arbitrary deadline to address the DACA 
issue.
  Mr. Speaker, I know that we must achieve comprehensive immigration 
reform, which includes providing certainty on the status of those 
brought here as children, but a government shutdown is not the way to 
achieve that public policy.
  We must continue to work towards a bipartisan agreement to protect 
the fate of the DREAMers and to ensure our borders are secure for the 
safety of all Americans.
  In accordance with the law, my Bellefonte and Titusville district 
offices will be closed, and many of my staff members are furloughed for 
the duration of any budget impasse. I will remain here in Washington 
working to get this impasse resolved.
  It is my hope that cooler heads will prevail and we can quickly find 
a resolution to reopen the Federal Government.
  All Americans deserve better.
