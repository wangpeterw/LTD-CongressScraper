                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving and gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  Help us this day to draw closer to You, so that with Your Spirit, and 
aware of Your presence among us, we may all face the tasks of this day.
  Bless the Members of the people's House. Help them to think clearly, 
speak confidently, and act courageously in the belief that all noble 
service is based upon patience, truth, and love.
  May they be great enough to be humble, and good enough to keep their 
faith, always regarding public office as a sacred trust. Give them the 
wisdom and the courage to fail not their fellow citizens, nor You.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
