9352,topic-id,1718,"Mr.Speaker, I want to, first of all, thank my colleague from Missouri, Representative Clay, for his concern, for his courage, for standing up and speaking up to ensure that his constituents' and others' First Amendment rights are protected by this Congress, and for organizing this Special Order hour this evening.  I appreciate very much the opportunity to join Representative Clay, and I proudly stand with him and my other colleagues to speak in defense of the First Amendment rights afforded to citizens of the Constitution of the United  As the 12th District Representative from North Carolina, as a practicing professional artist and art educator, as a curator, as a retired 40-year college arts professor, I am pleased to join with Representative Clay in expressing my support for freedom of visual expression and creativity, especially when it comes to supporting talented young students.  I have learned through my professional arts education and management careers that, yes, the arts are nice, but, beyond being nice, they are absolutely necessary and essential in helping enrich our lives. The arts are unique to our being, and they are what make us human.  Artists connect the past to the present, they convey our unique experiences, and they are presented in many forms--sometimes familiar, other times unfamiliar. The arts are a universal language that speak to people everywhere to help them to understand diversity, cultures, and some of the most complicated of issues. Therefore, having the freedom to make art is essential to creative expression.  Freedom of expression is everyone's freedom. And our Founding Fathers enshrined the expressions of freedom of speech in all forms--in music, in written and spoken word, in theater, and through visual imagery and composition--in the Bill of  Under the First Amendment, all art forms and all artistic expressions are constitutionally protected. Our Founding Fathers who created our country and launched our Nation as the world's role model in democracy believed that freedom of speech and freedom of the press were important enough to guarantee protection in our country's[[Page H2882]]founding documents. If our Founding Fathers, the brightest minds of that generation, thought that artistic expression was important enough to protect in our Bill of Rights, then what right do we have to take this away and censor the artistic community?  The ACLU said: ``. . . a free society is based on the principle that each and every individual has the right to decide what art or entertainment he or she wants--or does not want--to receive or create. Once you allow the government to censor someone else, you cede to it the power to censor you, or something you like. Censorship is like poison gas: A powerful weapon that can harm you when the wind shifts.''  As a nation, we face many threats, both internally and externally. We are a Nation of diverse thought, diverse people, and strong diverse principles. However, when we stand by and allow our artistic community to be censored or allow threats to silence our press, we become our own greatest threat. And when we reject facts and censor artistic expression just because it makes us uncomfortable or because we don't like it, we are becoming the tyrants that our Founding Fathers risked their lives to protect and escape from.  So the question of what is appropriate art is not a new question. Since the beginning of our country, our citizens have wrestled with what to do when they are offended by a work or art in any form. Court case after court case has tested governmental censorship of artistic expression, and the Supreme Court has continued to uphold our founding principles of freedom of expression and speech.  In the 1931 case, Stromberg v. California, the Supreme Court ruled that symbolic speech is protected by the First The ruling ensured that all art forms, music, paintings, plays, and other artistic expressions are protected by the First  In the 1982 decision, the Board of Education v. Pico, the Supreme Court ruled that local school boards may not remove books from school library shelves simply because they disliked the ideas contained in those books. Like the removal of the books from libraries, the removal of Mr.Pulphus' painting was a blatant violation of his First Amendment rights.  The First Amendment guarantees that our government cannot make substantive decisions about the content of a work of art. Expression can only be limited if, and only if, that expression will cause direct and imminent harm such as yelling ``fire'' in a crowded theater.                              {time}  1615  Our government's role is not to censor but to ensure that artists are able to freely express themselves without fear of censorship. Our government did not protect this young man's First Amendment rights. Instead, it acted as a retroactive censor on his work.  Here is an example of our government making a decision based on content they disapproved of and preventing this work because of its subject and because some legislators weren't knowledgeable enough about it to understand it from being displayed in a public place.  Justice Louis Brandeis, in his defense of free speech, wrote:       It is hazardous to discourage thought and hope and      imagination; that fear breeds repression, and that repression      breeds hate, and that hate menaces stable government. The      path to safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely      supposed grievances and proposed remedies.  Justice Brandeis' words were written in 1927, 90 years ago, almost a century, but they still echo true today. Censorship out of fear, out of misunderstanding or pain or dislike of a work is fundamentally anti-American and unconstitutional.  For more than 4 decades as a visual arts professor, I taught my students that you are going to see a lot of art throughout your lifetime. Some images you will like and some you won't especially like. And some will be disturbing and some confusing. But I reminded my students that their responsibility as viewers was to make every attempt to be able to say that you don't like it because you at least understand it.  Mr.Speaker, knowledge is power. Mr.Pulphus' work did not create direct or imminent harm, but his work did depict an uncomfortable reality that is pervasive across our country.  Unfortunately, violence is a way of life in many communities throughout As a matter of fact, it is too prevalent. But for this young man, violence in his community was a life that he knew most of his life. It was a life he was intrinsically as an artist compelled to visually talk about on his canvas.  As a matter of fact, he had a right to talk about it, and, in reality, he needed to talk about it. I admire him for his courage. As a teacher, I can tell you that, visually, his utilization of compositional elements and principles and forms showed an extraordinary talent.  In my estimation, we failed as viewers to do our part, and we didn't make an effort to really see, but we just merely looked at the work. But most especially, we didn't seize the opportunity to learn so that we could enhance our capacity to build and reinforce positive relationships in our community.  This painting offered us a chance to have a real conversation about race and police and community violence and institutional racism. But instead of seizing this opportunity, we have to continue to fight to protect this young artist's First Amendment rights.  Heated debate and discussion is the hallmark of our democracy. However, when arguments are censored, when the artists are told what they are able to produce, when expression is silenced, our democracy is then threatened.  And since this incident, as you have heard, the Congressional Institute has changed the rules for the Congressional Art Work submitted to the competition depicting contemporary political controversy or sensationalist or gruesome nature are not allowed.  But I am not here to criticize the work of the Congressional Institute, but as a professional artist myself, only to ask this question: What benefit can come from limiting our young artists from creating?  A democracy works when people stay engaged, when people participate. But by censoring what is in our public spaces, we are creating barriers for political discourse and we are creating fear of retaliation.  Artists are visual storytellers and we are entrusted with a unique responsibility to use the power of the arts to inform, to educate, and to empower our communities.  Noted African-American artist and scholar Samella Lewis of California said that ``African-American artists have a primary obligation to community, to understand, and to use the elements of their cultural heritage to produce an art that is diverse, reflecting our diverse interests, materials techniques, and to communicate those messages to the audiences we want to reach.''  Removing this young man's work was a degrading and insensitive action, which signaled to this young, aspiring, gifted student that his work is valueless, that his story is not worthy to be told. But most especially, it put into question the right and the responsibility that he has as an artist to express himself in visual imagery and symbolic competition.  It is not up to the government to decide what work has value or whose story should be told. The removal of Mr.Pulphus' work sets a dangerous precedent. Congress is now making content decisions on works displayed in the U.Capitol and is limiting what types of art will be exhibited. To some, this issue may not seem important, but the scope of the actions that have taken place in the U.Capitol is tremendous.  Just because somebody's sensibility is offended doesn't give that person the right to ban or censor a work. In fact, the First Amendment prevents that.  However, as this gross overreach of power in removing his work proves, just because the Constitution prevents something doesn't always mean that it won't happen. But it is our duty to hold our government responsible for protecting the sanctity of the Constitution and the Bill of  That is why I am honored, as a 40-year arts educator, as a member of the Congressional Art Caucus, and as a professional artist to join Representative Clay and all of my colleagues in speaking today about the importance of the First Amendment as it relates to the creative and the professional obligations and rights of the visual artist.

9434,topic-id,359,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the Reporting Efficiently to Proper Officials in Response to Terrorism Act, or the REPORT  I introduced the REPORT Act a year after the San Bernardino terrorist attack. Our community has seen more than its fair share of gun violence, but this terrorist mass shooting claimed 14 lives, injured another 22 people, and shook my community. In the days and weeks after, we pledged to do all we could to prevent another attack like this from happening ever again. This is what this bill seeks to do.  The REPORT Act requires the Department of Homeland Security to submit a report to Congress when a terror attack occurs in the United Under the bill, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the United States Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the head of the National Counterterrorism Center will produce a report detailing the attack and how to prevent future attacks.  The idea is to have a uniform after-action report following a terrorist attack here in the United There is currently no legal requirement to create such a report. Specifically, this report will include policy recommendations for lawmakers to make our communities safer and to prevent the next San Bernardino, Boston, New York, or  Mr.Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill. It also has the support of regional leaders in communities impacted by acts of terror. It has been endorsed by my region's law enforcement community: San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan and Sheriff John Chief Burguan and Sheriff McMahon are my community's law enforcement leaders who led the heroic response on December 2, 2015, and stopped the violent rampage, preventing further loss of life.  The REPORT Act is a commonsense bill that will empower lawmakers with the facts they need to create meaningful laws to thwart future attacks of terror.  This bill is for the 14 killed and 22 injured in San It is for my community. It is also for every American city touched by these heinous acts of terrorism.  We can and must work together to protect our homeland, and I believe this is a smart, bipartisan step to achieve that.  ",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgH4976.txt,2229,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,20.0,May
9446,topic-id,3086,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the commitment letters from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives regarding reauthorization of the Biosimilar User Fee Act, Generic Drug User Fee Act, Prescription Drug User Fee Act, and Medical Device User Fee  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Department of Health &                                               Human Services,                                  Washington, DC, January 4, 2017.     Lamar Alexander,     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions,          U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Mr.Chairman: The Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of      2012 (GDUFA) enacted as title III of the Food and Drug      Administration Safety and Innovation Act [112-144],      expires at the end of Fiscal Year 2017. With this letter the      Administration is providing our recommendations for the      reauthorization of GDUFA for the Fiscal Years 2018-2022      (GDUFA II).       Under GDUFA, the revenues generated from fees paid by the      generic pharmaceutical industry have been used to expedite      the process for the review of generic drugs and to support      and augment regulatory science and drug development. The      expenditure of these funds is in accordance with the statute      and provides resources to meet the performance goals and      procedures that were developed by the Food and Drug      Administration [FDA] in consultation with representatives of      regulated industry. FDA estimates that the fees negotiated in      GDUFA II will average approximately $493.6 million per year,      adjusted annually for inflation.       Throughout this process, the FDA has solicited input and      worked with various stakeholders, including representatives      from consumer, patient, academic research, and health      provider groups, and negotiated with the regulated industry,      to develop reauthorization recommendations for GDUFA that      would build upon and enhance the success of the program. In      addition, we have complied with the statutory requirements to      solicit public comments on our recommendations, and the      summary of public comments is posted on the agency web site.       Our recommendations build upon the successes of existing      programs and performance goals with step-wise improvements      allowing FDA the resources to establish a generic drug review      program that can keep up with the ever-expanding generic drug      industry. The recommendations will bring all Abbreviated New      Drug Applications (ANDAs) under a common review goals scheme      which calls for faster review cycles of 10 months for      standard ANDAs and eight months for priority Priority      status will be reserved for drug shortages, first generics,      sole source generics and other public health priorities. The      negotiated recommendations provide that FDA will communicate      deficiencies to industry throughout rather than at the end of      a review cycle, increasing the chances for applicants to      remedy deficiencies and obtain approval in fewer cycles. This      will allow for improved predictability and transparency and      enable industry advanced business planning.[[Page S4722]]       The agreement also establishes a robust Pre-ANDA program      for complex products. The program will include meetings with      applicants, guidance development and regulatory science      enhancements aimed at allowing applicants with complex      products to submit more complete applications and FDA to be      more prepared for such submissions.       FDA will also make improvements to the facility assessment      program in order to increase predictability, transparency and      safety. In addition, FDA has committed to accountability and      reporting enhancements. FDA will conduct activities to      evaluate the financial administration and resource      allocations of the GDUFA II program to help identify areas to      enhance operational and fiscal efficiency and transparency.      FDA will also expand GDUFA program performance reporting to      enable the regulated industry, patients and consumer groups,      and other stakeholders to better gauge the generic drug      program's performance.       Lastly, the agreement would revamp the user fee structure.      GDUFA II will be funded at a level commensurate with the      volume of ANDA submissions--the primary workload driver of      the program. This will allow FDA the resources necessary to      meet all of its commitments. In order to maintain a      predictable fee base and to more closely align fee      responsibility with program costs and fee-paying ability, FDA      and industry have agreed to shift the burden more toward      annual program fees. To address specific small business      concerns, FDA and industry have proposed three distinct small      business considerations. We anticipate that the proposed      GDUFA II will increase public access to affordable, generic      drug products.       The following five enclosures are provided for your      consideration: The proposed GDUFA II statutory language; a      redline of current law; the GDUFA Reauthorization Performance      Goals and Procedures--Fiscal Years 2018 through 2022; the      Background for the Proposed Changes for Reauthorization of      GDUFA in Fiscal Years 2018 through 2022; and the summary of      public comments.       Thank you for the opportunity to present our      recommendations to reauthorize this vital program. We would      be pleased to brief your staff on the details and want to      work closely with Congress in order to reauthorize the      program in a timely manner.

Frank Pallone,     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Representative Pallone: The Generic Drug User Fee      Amendments of 2012 (GDUFA) enacted as title III of the Food      and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act [     112-144], expires at the end of Fiscal Year 2017. With this      letter the Administration is providing our recommendations      for the reauthorization of GDUFA for the Fiscal Years 2018-     2022 (GDUFA II).       Under GDUFA, the revenues generated from fees paid by the      generic pharmaceutical industry have been used to expedite      the process for the review of generic drugs and to support      and augment regulatory science and drug development. The      expenditure of these funds is in accordance with the statute      and provides resources to meet the performance goals and      procedures that were developed by the Food and Drug      Administration [FDA] in consultation with representatives of      regulated industry. FDA estimates that the fees negotiated in      GDUFA II will average approximately $493.6 million per year,      adjusted annually for inflation.       Throughout this process, the FDA has solicited input and      worked with various stakeholders, including representatives      from consumer, patient, academic research, and health      provider groups, and negotiated with the regulated industry,      to develop reauthorization recommendations for GDUFA that      would build upon and enhance the success of the program. In      addition, we have complied with the statutory requirements to      solicit public comments on our recommendations, and the      summary of public comments is posted on the agency web site.       Our recommendations build upon the successes of existing      programs and performance goals with step-wise improvements      allowing FDA the resources to establish a generic drug review      program that can keep up with the ever-expanding generic drug      industry. The recommendations will bring all Abbreviated New      Drug Applications (ANDAs) under a common review goals scheme      which calls for faster review cycles of 10 months for      standard ANDAs and eight months for priority Priority      status will be reserved for drug shortages, first generics,      sole source generics and other public health priorities. The      negotiated recommendations provide that FDA will communicate      deficiencies to industry throughout rather than at the end of      a review cycle, increasing the chances for applicants to      remedy deficiencies and obtain approval in fewer cycles. This      will allow for improved predictability and transparency and      enable industry advanced business planning.       The agreement also establishes a robust Pre-ANDA program      for complex products. The program will include meetings with      applicants, guidance development and regulatory science      enhancements aimed at allowing applicants with complex      products to submit more complete applications and FDA to be      more prepared for such submissions.       FDA will also make improvements to the facility assessment      program in order to increase predictability, transparency and      safety. In addition, FDA has committed to accountability and      reporting enhancements. FDA will conduct activities to      evaluate the financial administration and resource      allocations of the GDUFA II program to help identify areas to      enhance operational and fiscal efficiency and transparency.      FDA will also expand GDUFA program performance reporting to      enable the regulated industry, patients and consumer groups,      and other stakeholders to better gauge the generic drug      program's performance.       Lastly, the agreement would revamp the user fee structure.      GDUFA II will be funded at a level commensurate with the      volume of ANDA submissions--the primary workload driver of      the program. This will allow FDA the resources necessary to      meet all of its commitments. In order to maintain a      predictable fee base and to more closely align fee      responsibility with program costs and fee-paying ability, FDA      and industry have agreed to shift the burden more toward      annual program fees. To address specific small business      concerns, FDA and industry have proposed three distinct small      business considerations. We anticipate that the proposed      GDUFA II will increase public access to affordable, generic      drug products.       The following five enclosures are provided for your      consideration: The proposed GDUFA II statutory language; a      redline of current law; the GDUFA Reauthorization Performance      Goals and Procedures--Fiscal Years 2018 through 2022; the      Background for the Proposed Changes for Reauthorization of      GDUFA in Fiscal Years 2018 through 2022; and the summary of      public comments.       Thank you for the opportunity to present our      recommendations to reauthorize this vital program. We would      be pleased to brief your staff on the details and want to      work closely with Congress in order to reauthorize the      program in a timely manner. The Office of Management and      Budget has advised that the bill and the enclosed performance      goals are in accord with the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                                   Sylvia Burwell,                                                         ",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4721-3.txt,1695,REINSTATING AND EXTENDING DEADLINE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF HYDROELECTRIC,2017.0,2.0,April

Continue to review and act on ANDAs and ANDA amendments,      PASs and PAS amendments and controlled correspondence      submitted prior to October 1, 2017 that have been assigned      GDUFA I goal dates pursuant to the GDUFA I review metrics      applicable to those submissions.       2. Review and act on 90% of ANDAs and ANDA amendments with      Target Action Dates (TADs) by the goal date. The TAD for an      ANDA or ANDA amendment becomes its GDUFA II goal date.      (Attachment A shows how FDA, until September 30, 2017,      assigned TADs to ANDA amendments not subject to GDUFA I      review goals.)       3. Review and act on 90% of ANDAs and ANDA amendments      pending FDA as of October 1, 2017 that were not subject to      GDUFA I goal dates and either (a) were not previously      assigned TADs or (b) were previously assigned TADs that came      due prior to October 1, 2017 but remain pending in the same      review cycle as of October 1, 2017, by GDUFA II ANDA and ANDA      amendment goal dates that FDA will assign on October 1, 2017.      No such goal date shall be later than July 31, 2018.       4. Review and act on amendments received on or after      October 1, 2017, to any ANDAs submitted prior to October 1,      2017, pursuant to the amendment review goals set forth in      (A)(3)-(5) of this section.             ORIGINAL ANDA REVIEW PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS     ANDA Receipt       1. FDA will strive to determine whether to receive ANDAs      within 60 days of the date of ANDA submission.       2. To enable FDA to rapidly determine whether to receive an      ANDA pursuant to 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)      314.101, and with consideration of final agency guidances      that address ANDA receipt determinations, FDA will issue a      Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPP) by October 1, 2017      setting forth procedures for filing reviewers on      communication of minor technical deficiencies (e.g., document      legibility); and on deficiencies potentially resolved with      information in the ANDA at original submission, in order to      provide applicants with an opportunity for resolution within      7 calendar days. If such a deficiency is resolved within 7      calendar days, that deficiency will not be a basis for a      refuse-to-receive decision.       3. At the time of receipt, FDA will notify the applicant in      the acceptance letter whether the ANDA or PAS is subject to      priority or standard review     ANDA Review Transparency and Communications Enhancements       To promote transparency and communication between FDA and      ANDA applicants, FDA will apply the review program      enhancements below to the review of all The goal of      these program enhancements is to improve predictability and      transparency, promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the      review process, minimize the number of review cycles      necessary for approval, increase the overall rate of      approval, and facilitate greater access to generic drug      products.       1. FDA will issue the appropriate Information Request(s)      (IR(s)) and/or Discipline Review Letter(s) (DRL(s)) from each      review discipline as soon as the discipline has completed its      review, with the first IR(s) and/or DRL(s) at about the mid-     point of the review.       2. Following the IR and/or DRL at about the mid-point of      the review, IRs and/or DRLs will, as appropriate, continue      from each review discipline on a rolling basis.       3. Neither IRs nor DRLs stop the review clock or add to a      GDUFA goal.       4. If an applicant is unable to completely respond within      the time frame requested by FDA, including any extensions      that may be granted by FDA, then FDA will generally issue a      Complete Response Letter (CRL).       5. FDA will continue to issue IRs and/or DRLs late in the      review cycle, until it is no longer feasible, within the      current review cycle, for applicant to develop and FDA to      review a complete response to the IR and/or       6. FDA should continue to work through the goal date if in      FDA's judgment continued work would likely result in an      imminent tentative approval that could prevent forfeiture of      180-day exclusivity or in an imminent approval.       7. FDA will strive to act prior to a goal date when the      review is done and there are no outstanding issues.       8. If in the ordinary course a Regulatory Project Manager      (RPM) learns that a major deficiency is likely forthcoming,      the RPM will notify the Authorized Representative that a      major deficiency is likely forthcoming. If the Authorized      Representative raises concerns or seeks additional      information regarding the forthcoming major deficiency, the      RPM will encourage the Authorized Representative to review      the forthcoming deficiency upon receiving it.       9. If in the ordinary course an RPM learns that FDA is      likely to miss the goal date for the submission, the RPM will      notify the Authorized Representative of the outstanding      discipline(s), the general nature of the delay (when      possible), and the estimated timeframe for receiving the      response.       10. The Authorized Representative may periodically request      a Review Status In response to the Authorized      Representative's request, the RPM will timely provide a      Review Status       11. FDA will include in the CRL its basis for classifying a      responding amendment       12. Applicants may opt for a post-CRL teleconference to      seek clarification concerning deficiencies identified in a      FDA will grant appropriate requests for teleconferences      requested by applicants upon receiving first cycle major      complete response letters. FDA will also grant appropriate      requests for teleconferences requested by applicants upon      receiving subsequent major complete response letters or minor      complete response letters. FDA will provide a scheduled date      for 90 percent of post-CRL teleconferences within 10 days of      the request for a teleconference, and conduct 90 percent of      such post-CRL teleconferences held on the FDA-proposed date,      within 30 days of receipt of the written request.     Review Classification Changes During the Review Cycle       1. If during a review cycle of an ANDA or PAS, the review      classification of the ANDA or PAS changes from Standard to      Priority, FDA will notify the applicant within 14 days of the      date of the change.       2. If a previous ANDA or ANDA amendment was subject to      priority review, but a subsequent ANDA amendment is subject      to standard review, FDA will notify applicant within 14 days      of the date of receipt of the solicited amendment.       3. A request for a change may occur at any time during the      review.       4. Once an ANDA or PAS submission is classified as being      subject to priority review, the application will retain such      priority review classification status until FDA takes an      action on the submission.       5. FDA will include an explanation of the reasons for any      denial of a review status reclassification request.       6. If an applicant requests a teleconference as part of its      request to reclassify a major amendment or standard review      status, FDA will schedule and conduct the teleconference and      decide 90% of such reclassification requests within 30 days      of the date of FDA's receipt of the request for a      teleconference. This goal only applies when applicant accepts      the first scheduled teleconference date offered by     ANDA Approval and Tentative Approval       If applicants submit and maintain ANDAs consistent with the      statutory requirements for approval under 505(j); respond to      IRs and DRLs completely and within the time frames requested      by FDA and timely submit all required information under 21      CFR parts 314 and 210, including information concerning      notice (21 CFR 314.95), litigation status (21 CFR 314.107),      and commercial marketing (21 CFR 314.107); then FDA will      strive to approve approvable ANDAs in the first review cycle;      to approve potential first generics on the earliest lawful      ANDA approval date, if known to FDA; and to tentatively      approve first to file Paragraph IV ANDAs so as to avoid      forfeiture of 180-day exclusivity.     Dispute Resolution       1. An applicant may pursue a request for reconsideration      within the review discipline at the Division level or      original signatory authority, as needed.       2. The Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) Office of Regulatory      Operations Associate Director will track each request for      Division level reconsideration through resolution.       3. Following resolution of a request for reconsideration,      an applicant may pursue formal dispute resolution above the      Division level, pursuant to procedures set forth in the      September 2015 Guidance, Formal Dispute Resolution: Appeals      Above the Division       4. FDA will respond to appeals above the Division level      within 30 calendar days of the Center for Drug Evaluation and      Research's (CDER's) receipt of the written appeal pursuant to      the applicable goal.       a. In FY 2018, the goal is 70 percent.       b. In FY 2019, the goal is 80 percent.       c. In FY 2020, 2021, and 2022 the goal is 90 percent.[[Page S4726]]         5. CDER's Formal Dispute Resolution Project Manager (or      designee) will track each formal appeal above the Division      level through resolution     Other ANDA Review Program Aspirations       1. FDA aspires to continually improve the efficiency of the      ANDA review program.       2. The absence of a GDUFA II commitment for a specific      program function does not imply that the program function is      not important. For example, other program functions include      determinations whether listed drugs were voluntarily      withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness      and ANDA proprietary name reviews.  PRE-ANDA PROGRAM AND SUBSEQUENT MID-REVIEW-CYCLE MEETINGS FOR                             COMPLEX PRODUCTS     Rationale for Pre-ANDA Program, Guidance on Enhanced          Pathway for Complex Products       The goal of the pre-ANDA program is to clarify regulatory      expectations for prospective applicants early in product      development, assist applicants to develop more complete      submissions, promote a more efficient and effective ANDA      review process, and reduce the number of review cycles      required to obtain ANDA approval, particularly for Complex            1. FDA will issue guidance describing an enhanced pathway      for Complex Products, including policies and procedures for      Product Development Meetings, pre-submission meetings, and      mid-review cycle meetings. An ANDA applicant who was granted      a Product Development Meeting has the option of a pre-     submission meeting with FDA and also the option of a mid-     review-cycle meeting with FDA, subject to policies and      procedures to be set forth in the guidance.     Controlled Correspondence       1. FDA will review and respond to standard controlled      correspondence and to complex controlled correspondence with      meaningful responses that can more consistently inform drug      development and/or regulatory decision making pursuant to the      applicable metric goals.     Product-Specific Guidance       1. FDA will issue product-specific guidance identifying the      methodology for developing drugs and generating evidence      needed to support ANDA approval, for 90 percent of new      chemical entity New Drug Applications that are approved on or      after October 1, 2017, at least 2 years prior to the earliest      lawful ANDA filing date.       2. This goal shall not apply to Complex FDA will      strive to issue guidance for a Complex Product as soon as      scientific recommendations are available.       3. FDA will continue to develop and issue product-specific      guidance based on requests from industry and public health      priorities as set forth in the CDER Prioritization       4. Industry may request that FDA develop product-specific      guidance via email to [email protected].     Product Development Meetings       1. FDA will grant a prospective applicant a Product      Development Meeting if, in FDA's judgment:       a. The requested Product Development Meeting concerns:       i. Development of a Complex Product for which FDA has not      issued product-specific guidance or       ii. An alternative equivalence evaluation (i.e., change in      study type, such as in vitro to clinical) for a Complex      Product for which FDA has issued product-specific guidance,       b. The prospective applicant submits a complete meeting      package, including a data package and specific proposals,       c. A controlled correspondence response would not      adequately address the prospective applicant's questions, and       d. A Product Development Meeting would significantly      improve ANDA review efficiency.       2. Dependent on available resources, FDA may grant a      prospective applicant a Product Development Meeting      concerning Complex Product development issues other than      those described in Section III(D)(1)(a) above if, in FDA's      judgment:       a. The prospective applicant submits a complete meeting      package, including a data package and specific proposals,       b. A controlled correspondence response would not      adequately address the prospective applicant's questions, and       c. A Product Development Meeting would significantly      improve ANDA review efficiency.       3. FDA will grant or deny 90% of Product Development      Meeting requests within the applicable goal.       a. In FYs 2018 and 2019, the goal is 30 days from receipt      of the request.       b. In FYs 2020, 2021 and 2022, the goal is 14 days from      receipt of the request.       4. FDA will conduct Product Development Meetings granted      pursuant to the applicable goal.       a. In FY 2018, FDA will conduct 60 percent of such meetings      within 120 days of granting them.       b. In FY2019, FDA will conduct 70 percent of such meetings      within 120 days of granting them.       c. In FY2020, FDA will conduct 80 percent of such meetings      within 120 days of granting them.       d. In FYs 2021 and 2022, FDA will conduct 90 percent of      such meetings within 120 days of granting them.       5. FDA can meet the Product Development Meeting Goal by      either conducting a meeting or providing a meaningful written      response that will inform drug development and/or regulatory      decision making to the prospective applicant, within the      applicable goal date.       6. Unless FDA is providing a written response to satisfy      the Product Development Meeting goal, FDA will provide      preliminary written comments before each Product Development      Meeting (and aspire to provide the written comments 5      calendar days before the meeting), and will provide meeting      minutes within 30 calendar days following the meeting.     Pre-Submission Meetings       1. Prospective applicants may request and FDA will conduct      pre-submission meetings, subject to Section III(A)(1). An      applicant's decision not to request a pre-submission meeting      will not prejudice the receipt or review of an       2. FDA will grant or deny 90% of pre-submission meeting      requests within the applicable goal.       a. In FYs 2018 and 2019, the goal is 30 days.       b. In FYs 2020, 2021, and 2022, the goal is 14 days.       3. If an applicant did not have a Product Development      Meeting, FDA may grant a pre-submission meeting if in FDA's      judgment the pre-submission meeting would improve review      efficiency.       4. FDA will conduct pre-submission meetings granted      pursuant to the applicable goal.       a. In FY 2018, FDA will conduct 60 percent of such meetings      within 120 days of granting them.       b.

In FY 2020, FDA will conduct 80 percent of such meetings      within 120 days of granting them.       d. In FYs 2021 and 2022, FDA will conduct 90 percent of      such meetings within 120 days of granting them.       5. If appropriate to the purpose of the meeting, FDA will      provide preliminary written comments 5 calendar days before      each meeting, and meeting minutes within 30 calendar days of      the meeting.     Mid-Review-Cycle Meetings for Complex Products       As set forth in guidance issued pursuant to Section      III(A)(1), the Project Manager and other appropriate members      of the FDA review team will call the applicant to provide the      applicant with an update on the status of the review of their      application. An agenda will be sent to the applicant prior to      the mid-review-cycle meeting. The Project Manager will      coordinate the specific date and time of the telephone call      with the applicant.     Inactive Ingredient Database Enhancements       1. By October 1, 2020, FDA will complete enhancements to      the Inactive Ingredient Database so users can perform      electronic queries to obtain accurate Maximum Daily Intake      and Maximum Daily Exposure information for each route of      administration for which data is available.       2. FDA will update the Inactive Ingredient Database on an      ongoing basis, and post quarterly notice of updates made.      Such notices will include each change made and, for each      change, the information replaced.     Regulatory Science Enhancements       FDA will conduct internal and external research to support      fulfilment of submission review and pre-ANDA commitments set      forth in Sections I and III, respectively.       1. Annually, FDA will conduct a public workshop to solicit      input from industry and stakeholders for inclusion in an      annual list of GDUFA II Regulatory Science initiatives.      Interested parties may propose regulatory science initiatives      via email to [email protected]. After considering      Industry and stakeholder input, FDA will post the list on      FDA's website.       2. If Industry forms a GDUFA II regulatory science working      group, then upon request of the working group to the Director      of the Office of Research and Standards in the Office of      Generic Drugs, FDA will meet with the working group twice      yearly to discuss current and emerging challenges and      concerns. FDA will post minutes of these meetings on its      website.       3. Annually, FDA will report on its website the extent to      which GDUFA regulatory science-funded projects support the      development of generic drug products, the generation of      evidence needed to support efficient review and timely      approval of ANDAs, and the evaluation of generic drug      equivalence.     Safety Determination Letters       1. FDA will issue 90% of safety determination letters      within 60 days of the date of submission of disclosure      authorization.     Other Pre-ANDA Program Aspirations       1. FDA aspires to continually improve the effectiveness of      its pre-ANDA activity.       2. The absence of a GDUFA II commitment for a specific      program function does not imply that the program function is      not important. For example, notwithstanding the absence of a      GDUFA II commitment, FDA aspires to respond to Suitability      Petitions in a more timely and predictable manner.                  DMF REVIEW PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS     Communication of DMF Review Comments       1. FDA will ensure that DMF review comments submitted to      the DMF holder are issued at least in parallel with the      issuance of review comments relating to the DMF for[[Page S4727]]     the This commitment applies to comments to the      applicant issued in any ANDA CRL and comments issued in the      first IR letter by the drug product review discipline.     Teleconferences to Clarify DMF First Cycle Review          Deficiencies       1. FDA will grant and conduct teleconferences when      requested to clarify deficiencies in first cycle DMF      deficiency letters.       2. DMF holders must request such teleconferences in writing      within 20 business days of issuance of the first cycle DMF      deficiency letter, identifying specific issues to be      addressed. FDA may initially provide a written response to      the request for clarification, but if the DMF holder      indicates that a teleconference is still desired, FDA will      schedule the teleconference.       3. FDA will strive to grant such teleconferences within 30      days, giving priority to DMFs based on the priority of the      referencing       4. In lieu of a teleconference, the DMF holder may submit a      request for an email exchange between FDA and the DMF holder.      The request must identify specific issues to be addressed.      After FDA responds to the request, the DMF holder may submit,      and FDA will respond to, one follow up email to obtain      additional clarification.     DMF First Adequate Letters       1. Once a DMF has undergone a full scientific review and      has no open issues related to the review of the referencing      ANDA, FDA will issue a First Adequate     DMF No Further Comment Letters       1.

9448,topic-id,11160,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the commitment letter for the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: MDUFA Performance Goals and Procedures, Fiscal Years 2018 Through 2022                                General       The performance goals and procedures agreed to by the      Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and the      Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) of the      United States Food and Drug Administration (``FDA'' or ``the      Agency'') for the medical device user fee program in the      Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017, are summarized      below.       FDA and the industry are committed to protecting and      promoting public health by providing timely access to safe      and effective medical devices. Nothing in this letter      precludes the Agency from protecting the public health by      exercising its authority to provide a reasonable assurance of      the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. Both FDA and      the industry are committed to the spirit and intent of the      goals described in this letter.                        SHARED OUTCOME GOALS       The program and initiatives outlined in this document are      predicated on significant interaction between the Agency and      applicants. FDA and representatives of the industry agree      that the process improvements outlined in this letter, when      implemented by all parties as intended, should reduce the      average Total Time to Decision for PMA applications and      510(k) submissions, provided that the total funding of the      device review program adheres to the assumptions underlying      this agreement. FDA and applicants share the responsibility      for achieving this objective of reducing the average Total      Time to Decision, while maintaining standards for safety and      effectiveness. Success of this program will require the      cooperation and dedicated efforts of FDA and applicants to      reduce their respective portions of the total time to      decision.       FDA will be reporting total time performance quarterly as      described in Section FDA and industry will participate in      the independent assessment of progress toward this outcome,      as described in Section V below. As appropriate, key findings      and recommendations from this assessment will be implemented      by     PMA       FDA will report on an annual basis the average Total Time      to Decision as defined in Section VII.H for the three most      recent closed receipt cohorts.       For Original PMA and Panel Track Supplement submissions      received in Fiscal Years 2016 through 2018, the average Total      Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 320 calendar      days.       For Original PMA and Panel Track Supplement submissions      received in Fiscal Years 2017 through 2019, the average Total      Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 315 calendar      days.       For Original PMA and Panel Track Supplement submissions      received in Fiscal Years 2018 through 2020, the average Total      Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 310 calendar      days.       For Original PMA and Panel Track Supplement submissions      received in Fiscal Years 2019 through 2021, the average Total      Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 300 calendar      days.       For Original PMA and Panel Track Supplement submissions      received in Fiscal Years 2020 through 2022, the average Total      Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 290 calendar      days.     510(k)       FDA will report on an annual basis the average Total Time      to Decision as defined in Section VII.H for the most recent      closed receipt cohort.       For 510(k) submissions received beginning in Fiscal Year      2018, the average Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and      industry is 124 calendar days.       For 510(k) submissions received beginning in Fiscal Year      2019, the average Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and      industry is 120 calendar days.       For 510(k) submissions received beginning in Fiscal Year      2020, the average Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and      industry is 116 calendar days.       For 510(k) submissions received beginning in Fiscal Year      2021, the average Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and      industry is 112 calendar days.-       For 510(k) submissions received beginning in Fiscal Year      2022, the average Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and      industry is 108 calendar days.REVIEW PERFORMANCE GOALS--FISCAL YEARS 2018 THROUGH 2022 AS APPLIED                            TO RECEIPT COHORTS       The overall objective of the review performance goals      stated herein is to assure more timely access to safe and      effective medical devices.     Pre-Submissions       FDA will continue the Pre-Submission program as described      in the Guidance on ``Requests for Feedback on Medical Device      Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with FDA      Staff'' with process improvements and performance goals as      noted in this section.       For all Pre-Submissions in which the applicant requests a      meeting or teleconference, the applicant will provide a      minimum of three proposed meeting dates in the initial      submission.       Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a Pre-Submission, FDA      will communicate with the applicant regarding whether the      application has been accepted and, if applicable, regarding      scheduling of the meeting or teleconference. Acceptance will      be determined based on the definition of pre-submission in      Section VII.F below and an acceptance checklist in published      guidance. This communication consists of a fax, email, or      other written communication that a) identifies the reviewer      assigned to the submission, b) acknowledges acceptance/     rejection of the submission, and c) if the submission      included a request for a meeting or teleconference and is      accepted, either confirms one of the applicant's requested      meeting dates or provides two alternative dates prior to day      75 from receipt of accepted submission. A determination that      the request does not qualify as a Pre-Submission will require      the concurrence of the branch chief and the reason for this      determination will be provided to the applicant in the above      written communication. FDA intends to reach agreement with      the applicant regarding a meeting date within 30 days from      receipt of accepted submission. For all requests for meetings      or teleconferences that do not have such a meeting or      teleconference scheduled by 30 days from receipt of an      accepted submission, an FDA manager will contact the      applicant to resolve scheduling issues by the 40th day.       FDA will provide written feedback that addresses the issues      raised in the pre-submission request within 70 calendar days      of receipt date or five calendar days prior to a scheduled      meeting, whichever comes sooner, for at least 1,530 Pre-     Submissions received in FY 2018, at least 1,645 Pre-     Submissions received in FY 2019, at least 1,765 Pre-     Submissions received in FY 2020, at least 1,880 Pre-     Submissions received in FY 2021, and at least 1,950 Pre-     Submissions received in FY 2022. FDA will provide such timely      written feedback for additional Pre-Submissions as resources      permit, but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative      review timelines and statutory obligations. Written feedback      will be provided to the applicant by email or fax and will      include: written responses to the applicant's questions;      FDA's suggestions for additional topics for the meeting or      teleconference, if applicable; or, a combination of both. If      all of the applicant's questions are addressed through      written responses to the applicant's satisfaction, FDA and      the applicant can agree that a meeting or teleconference is      no longer necessary, and the written responses provided by      email or fax will be considered the final written feedback to      the Pre-      Meetings and teleconferences related to Pre-Submission will      normally be limited to 1 hour unless the applicant justifies      in writing the need for additional time. FDA may extend the      time for such meetings and/or teleconferences.       Applicants will be responsible for developing draft minutes      for a Pre-Submission meeting or teleconference, and provide      the draft minutes to FDA within 15 calendar days of the      meeting. At the beginning and end of each meeting, the      applicant will affirmatively state that they will draft      minutes and provide them to FDA within 15 calendar days. The      minutes will summarize the meeting discussions and include      agreements and any action items. FDA will provide any edits      to the draft minutes to the applicant via email within a      timely manner. These minutes will become final 15 calendar      days after the applicant receives FDA's edits, unless the      applicant indicates that there is a[[Page S4730]]     disagreement with how a significant issue or action item has      been documented. In this case, within a timely manner, the      applicant and FDA will conduct a teleconference to discuss      that issue with At the conclusion of that      teleconference, within 15 days FDA will finalize the minutes      either to reflect the resolution of the issue or note that      this issue remains a point of disagreement.       FDA intends that feedback the Agency provides in a Pre-     Submission will not change, provided the information      submitted in a future IDE or marketing application is      consistent with that provided in the Pre-Submission and      documented in the Pre-Submission, and that the data and other      information in the future submission do not raise any      important new issues materially affecting safety or      effectiveness. The minutes described above will serve as the      record of the Agency's Pre-Submission feedback. Modifications      to FDA's feedback will be limited to situations in which FDA      concludes that the feedback does not adequately address      important new issues materially relevant to a determination      of safety and/or effectiveness or substantial equivalence.      Such a determination will be supported by the appropriate      management concurrence consistent with applicable guidance      and       By October 1, 2018, the Agency will update the Guidance on      ``Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The      Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with FDA Staff'' to      include: additional information to assist applicants in      determining the need for a Pre-Submission, an enhanced Pre-     Submission acceptance checklist, examples of frequently asked      Pre-Submission questions that lend themselves to productive      Pre-Submission interactions, and edits to reflect the revised      process outlined above. FDA will provide an opportunity for      the public to comment on the updated guidance. No later than      12 months after the close of the public comment period, the      Agency will issue a final guidance. FDA will implement this      guidance once final.     Original Premarket Approval (PMA), Panel-Track          Supplements, and Premarket Report Applications       The performance goals in this section apply to all Original      Premarket Approval, Panel-Track Supplements, and Premarket      Report Applications, including those that are accepted for      priority review (previously referred to as expedited).       FDA will communicate with the applicant regarding whether      the application has been accepted for filing review within 15      calendar days of receipt of the application. This      communication consists of a fax, email, or other written      communication that a) identifies the reviewer assigned to the      submission, and b) acknowledges acceptance/rejection of the      submission based upon the review of the submission against      objective acceptance criteria outlined in a published      guidance document and consistent with the statute and its      implementing regulations.       If the application is not accepted for filing review, FDA      will notify the applicant of those items necessary for the      application to be considered accepted for filing review.       For those applications that are accepted for filing review,      FDA will communicate the filing status within 45 calendar      days of receipt of the application.       For those applications that are not filed, FDA will      communicate to the applicant the specific reasons for      rejection and the information necessary for filing.       If the application is filed, FDA will communicate with the      applicant through a Substantive Interaction within 90      calendar days of the filing date of the application for 95%      of submissions.       When FDA issues a major deficiency letter, that letter will      be based upon a complete review of the application and will      include all deficiencies. All deficiency letters will include      a statement of the basis for the deficiencies (e.g., a      specific reference to applicable section of a rule, final      guidance, recognized standard unless the entire or most of      document is applicable). In the instance when the deficiency      cannot be traced in the manner above and relates to a      scientific or regulatory issue pertinent to the      determination, FDA will cite the specific scientific issue      and the information to support its position. All deficiency      letters will undergo supervisory review prior to issuance to      ensure the deficiencies cited are relevant to a determination      of safety and effectiveness. Any subsequent deficiencies will      be limited to issues raised by the information provided by      the applicant in its response, unless FDA concludes that the      initial deficiencies identified do not adequately address      important new issues materially relevant to a determination      of safety or effectiveness. Such a determination will be      supported by the appropriate management concurrence      consistent with applicable guidance and Issues related      to post-approval studies, if applicable, and revisions to      draft labeling will typically be addressed through      interactive review once major deficiencies have been      adequately addressed.       For submissions that do not require Advisory Committee      input, FDA will issue a MDUFA decision within 180 FDA Days      for 90% of submissions.       For submissions that require Advisory Committee input, FDA      will issue a MDUFA decision within 320 FDA Days from receipt      of the accepted submission for 90% of submissions. FDA will      issue a MDUFA decision within 60 days of the Advisory      Committee recommendation, as resources permit, but not to the      detriment of meeting the quantitative review timelines and      statutory obligations. The Office Director shall review each      request for Advisory Committee input for appropriateness and      need for this input.       If in any one fiscal year, the number of submissions that      require Advisory Committee input is less than 10, then it is      acceptable to combine such submissions with the submissions      for the following year(s) in order to form a cohort of 10 or      more submissions, upon which the combined years' submissions      will be subject to the performance goal. If the number of      submissions that require Advisory Committee input is less      than 10 for FY 2022, it is acceptable to combine such      submissions in the prior year to form a cohort of 10 or more      submissions: in such cases, FDA will be held to the FY2022      performance goal for the combined years' submissions.       To facilitate an efficient review prior to the Substantive      Interaction, and to incentivize submission of a complete      application, submission of an unsolicited major amendment      prior to the Substantive Interaction extends the FDA Day      review clock by the number of FDA Days that have elapsed.      Submission of an unsolicited major amendment after the      Substantive Interaction extends the FDA Day goal by the      number of FDA Days equal to 75% of the difference between the      filing date and the date of receipt of the amendment.      Requests from FDA that a submission be made will not be      considered unsolicited.       For all PMA submissions that do not reach a MDUFA decision      by 20 days after the applicable FDA Day goal, FDA will      provide written feedback to the applicant to be discussed in      a meeting or teleconference, including all outstanding issues      with the application preventing FDA from reaching a decision.      The information provided will reflect appropriate management      input and approval, and will include action items for FDA      and/or the applicant, as appropriate, with an estimated date      of completion for each party to complete their respective      tasks. Issues should be resolved through interactive review.      If all of the outstanding issues are adequately presented      through written correspondence, FDA and the applicant can      agree that a meeting or teleconference is not necessary.       For PMA submissions that receive a MDUFA decision of      Approvable, FDA will issue a decision within 60 days of the      sponsor's response to the Approvable letter, as resources      permit, but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative      review timelines and statutory obligations.       In addition, information about submissions that miss the      FDA Day goal will be provided as part of FDA's Performance      Reports, as described in Section     180-Day PMA Supplements       FDA will communicate with the applicant through a      Substantive Interaction within 90 calendar days of receipt of      95% of submissions.       FDA will issue a MDUFA decision within 180 FDA Days for 95%      of submissions.     Real-Time PMA Supplements       FDA will issue a MDUFA decision within 90 FDA Days for 95%      of submissions.     De Novo Submissions       FDA will issue draft and final guidance that includes a      submission checklist to facilitate a more efficient and      timely review process.       Deficiencies identified will be based upon a complete      review of the submission and will include all deficiencies.      All deficiency letters will include a statement of the basis      for the deficiencies (e.g., a specific reference to      applicable section of a rule, final guidance, recognized      standard unless the entire or most of document is      applicable). In the instance when the deficiency cannot be      traced in the manner above and relates to a scientific or      regulatory issue pertinent to the determination, FDA will      cite the specific scientific issue and the information to      support its position. All deficiency letters will undergo      supervisory review prior to issuance to ensure the      deficiencies cited are relevant to a classification      determination. Any subsequent deficiencies will be limited to      issues raised by the information provided by the applicant in      its response, unless FDA concludes that the initial      deficiencies identified do not adequately address important      new issues materially relevant to a classification      determination. Such a determination will be supported by the      appropriate management concurrence consistent with applicable      guidance and Issues related to revisions to draft      labeling will typically be addressed through interactive      review once major deficiencies have been adequately      addressed.       FDA will issue a MDUFA decision within 150 FDA days of      receipt of the submission for: 50% of de novo requests      received in FY 2018; 55% of de novo requests received in FY      2019; 60% of de novo requests received in FY 2020; 65% of de      novo requests received in FY 2021 and 70% of de novo requests      received in FY 2022. At Industry's request and as resources      permit, but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative      review timelines, if a final decision has not been rendered      within 180 FDA days, FDA will discuss with the applicant all      outstanding issues with the submission preventing FDA from      reaching a decision. This discussion will reflect appropriate      management input and approval, and will include action items      for FDA and/or the applicant, as appropriate, with an      estimated date of completion for each party to complete their      respective tasks.     510(k) Submissions       FDA will communicate with the applicant regarding whether      the submission has been[[Page S4731]]     accepted for review within 15 calendar days of receipt of the      submission. For those submissions that are not accepted for      review, FDA will notify the applicant of those items      necessary for the submission to be considered accepted.       This communication includes a fax, email, or other written      communication that a) identifies the reviewer assigned to the      submission, and b) acknowledges acceptance/rejection of the      submission based upon the review of the submission against      objective acceptance criteria outlined in a published      guidance document. This communication represents a      preliminary review of the submission and is not indicative of      deficiencies that may be identified later in the review      cycle.       FDA will communicate with the applicant through a      Substantive Interaction within 60 calendar days of receipt of      the submission for 95% of submissions.       Deficiencies identified in a Substantive Interaction, such      as a telephone/email hold or Additional Information Letter,      will be based upon a complete review of the submission and      will include all deficiencies. All deficiency letters will      include a statement of the basis for the deficiencies (e.g.,      a specific reference to applicable section of a rule, final      guidance, recognized standard unless the entire or most of      document is applicable). In the instance when the deficiency      cannot be traced in the manner above and relates to a      scientific or regulatory issue pertinent to the      determination, FDA will cite the specific scientific issue      and the information to support its position. All deficiency      letters will undergo supervisory review prior to issuance to      ensure the deficiencies cited are relevant to a determination      of substantial equivalence. Any subsequent deficiencies will      be limited to issues raised by the information provided by      the applicant in its response, unless FDA concludes that the      initial deficiencies identified do not adequately address      important new issues materially relevant to a determination      of substantial equivalence. Such a determination will be      supported by the appropriate management concurrence      consistent with applicable guidance and       FDA will issue a MDUFA decision for 95% of 510(k)      submissions within 90 FDA For all 510(k) submissions      that do not reach a MDUFA decision within 100 FDA Days, FDA      will provide written feedback to the applicant to be      discussed in a meeting or teleconference, including all      outstanding issues with the application preventing FDA from      reaching a decision. The information provided will reflect      appropriate management input and approval, and will include      action items for FDA and/or the applicant, as appropriate,      with an estimated date of completion for each party to      complete their respective tasks. Issues should be resolved      through interactive review. If all of the outstanding issues      are adequately presented through written correspondence, FDA      and the applicant can agree that a meeting or teleconference      is not necessary.       In addition, information about submissions that miss the      FDA Day goal will be provided as part of FDA's Performance      Reports, as described in Section     CLIA Waiver by Application       FDA will engage in a Substantive Interaction with the      applicant within 90 days for 90% of the applications.       Industry will inform FDA that it plans to submit a dual      submission (510(k) and CLIA Waiver application) during the      Pre-Submission process. FDA will issue a decision for 90% of      dual submission applications within 180 FDA days.       For ``CLIA Waiver by application'' submissions FDA will      issue a MDUFA decision for 90% of the applications that do      not require Advisory Committee input within 150 FDA days.       For ``CLIA Waiver by application'' submissions FDA will      issue a MDUFA decision for 90% of the applications that      require Advisory Committee input within 320 FDA days.       If in any one fiscal year, the number of submissions in any      CLIA Waiver by Application category is less than 10, then it      is acceptable to combine such submissions with the      submissions for the following year(s) in order to form a      cohort of 10 or more submissions, upon which the combined      years' submissions will be subject to the performance goal.       For all CLIA waiver by application submissions and dual      submissions that do not reach a decision by 20 days after the      applicable FDA Day goal, FDA will provide written feedback to      the applicant to be discussed in a meeting or teleconference,      including all outstanding issues with the application      preventing FDA from reaching a decision. The information      provided will reflect appropriate management input and      approval, and will include action items for FDA and/or the      applicant, as appropriate, with an estimated date of      completion for each party to complete their respective tasks.      Issues should be resolved through interactive review. If all      of the outstanding issues are adequately presented through      written correspondence, FDA and the applicant can agree that      a meeting or teleconference is not necessary.       In addition, information about submissions that miss the      FDA Day goal will be provided as part of FDA's Performance      Reports, as described in Section       In addition, FDA will:       1. Hold CLIA Waiver Vendor Days, with the first to occur      before the end of       2. Permit discussion of both 510(k) and CLIA waiver process      in Pre-      3. Specifically permit discussion of appropriate reference/     comparator for both 510(k) and CLIA waiver submissions in      Pre-      4. Provide a status report on completion and issuance of      revisions to Section V of the Guidance on ``Recommendations      for CLIA Waiver Applications'' to include appropriate use of      comparable performance between a waived user and moderately      complex laboratory user to demonstrate accuracy.     Original Biologics Licensing Applications (BLAs)       FDA will review and act on standard original BLA      submissions within 10 months of receipt for 90% of      submissions.       FDA will review and act on priority original BLA      submissions within 6 months of receipt for 90% of      submissions.     BLA Efficacy Supplements       FDA will review and act on standard BLA efficacy supplement      submissions within 10 months of receipt for 90% of      submissions.       FDA will review and act on priority BLA efficacy supplement      submissions within 6 months of receipt for 90% of      submissions.     Original BLA and BLA Efficacy Supplement Resubmissions       FDA will review and act on Class 1 original BLA and BLA      efficacy supplement resubmissions within 2 months of receipt      for 90% of submissions.       FDA will review and act on Class 2 original BLA and BLA      efficacy supplement resubmissions within 6 months of receipt      for 90% of submissions.     BLA Manufacturing Supplements Requiring Prior Approval       FDA will review and act on BLA manufacturing supplements      requiring prior approval within 4 months of receipt for 90%      of submissions.                          Infrastructure     Quality Management       The Agency will establish a dedicated Quality Management      (QM) Unit that reports directly to the CDRH Director or      Deputy Director and establish a quality management framework      for the premarket submission process in The Framework      will include infrastructure, senior management      responsibility, resource management, lifecycle management,      and quality management system evaluation.       At least once per year, the Agency will discuss with      industry the specific areas it intends to incorporate in its      ongoing audit plan. FDA will identify, with industry input,      areas to audit, which will include the effectiveness of      CDRH's Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) process. FDA      will expand the scope of its annual audits as it implements      and builds up its auditing capability. As part of these      ongoing audits, high-performing premarket review processes      utilized in one division will be identified and shared      accordingly with other divisions to improve efficiencies and      effectiveness. At a minimum, FDA audits in the following      areas will be completed by the end of FY 2020: Deficiency      Letters and Pre-Additional audits in the      following areas will be completed by the end of FY 2022:      Submission Issue Meetings, Interactive Review, Withdrawals      and Special 510(k) conversions.       The effectiveness of the QM framework will be evaluated in      Phase 2 of the Independent Assessment (see Section V).     Scientific and Regulatory Review Capacity       The Agency will apply user fee revenues to reduce the ratio      of review staff to front line supervisors in the premarket      review program to improve consistency. The Agency will also      apply user fee revenues to enhance and supplement scientific      review capacity by hiring device application reviewers as      well as leveraging external experts needed to assist with the      review of device applications.       To ensure such additional positions are filled by qualified      experts, the Agency will apply user fee revenues to      recruitment and hiring. The Agency will apply user fee      revenues to retain high-performing supervisors in the      premarket review program.       CDRH intends to enter into an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA)      with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide      supplemental recruitment and staffing support throughout      MDUFA IV to augment existing FDA Human Resources services.     IT Infrastructure for Submission Management       FDA will enhance IT infrastructure that will allow FDA to      perform quality management audits and review consistency.       FDA will implement a new information management system that      provides an industry dashboard that displays near real-time      submission status.       FDA will develop electronic submission templates that will      serve as guided submission preparation tools for industry to      improve submission consistency and enhance efficiency in the      review process. By FY 2020, the Agency will issue a draft      guidance document on the use of the electronic submission      templates. FDA will provide an opportunity for public comment      on the guidance. No later than 12 months after the close of      the public comment period, the Agency will issue a final      guidance. FDA will implement the guidance once final. In      addition, the Agency will update the Guidance ``eCopy Program      for Medical Device Submissions'' to reflect the respective      changes to the technical standards and specifications.       FDA will link pre-submissions with subsequent premarket      submissions when identified by the applicant.[[Page S4732]]       Training       FDA will continue to improve training for new and existing      reviewers under this agreement. FDA will achieve Kirkpatrick      Level 3 for curriculum-based premarket training through      assessment of work performance behavior change and evaluate      the effectiveness of the impact of curriculum-based premarket      training activities on relevant premarket program metrics and      goals (Kirkpatrick Level 4) by the end of FY 2020. FDA      training efforts will also be closely coordinated with the      Quality Management Unit described in item III.A above to      provide more targeted and personalized training to staff.     Time Reporting       FDA will implement complete time reporting by the end of      MDUFA IV such that data from time reporting can be used to      conduct workload analysis and capacity planning.     Fee Setting, Fee Collections, and Workload       FDA will seek authority to eliminate the fifth-year offset      provision and to maintain and use any and all fee      collections, including collections over the statutory total      revenue targets.       If the collections are in excess of the resources needed to      meet performance goals given the workload, or in excess of      inflation-adjusted statutory revenue targets, FDA and      industry will work together to assess how best to utilize      those resources to improve performance on submission types      with performance goals and/or quality management programs,      using, as input for the discussion: workload information,      performance objectives and ongoing reported performance.                        Process Improvements     Interactive Review       The Agency will continue to incorporate an interactive      review process to provide for, and encourage, informal      communication between FDA and applicants to facilitate timely      completion of the review process based on accurate and      complete information. Interactive review entails      responsibilities for both FDA and applicants. As described in      the guidance document, ``Interactive Review for Medical      Device Submissions: 510(k)s, Original PMAs, PMA Supplements,      Original BLAs, and BLA Supplements,'' both FDA and industry      believe that an interactive review process for these types of      premarket medical device submissions should help facilitate      timely completion of the review based on accurate and      complete information. Interactive review is intended to      facilitate the efficient and timely review and evaluation by      FDA of premarket submissions and is expected to support      reductions in total time to decision. The interactive review      process contemplates increased informal interaction between      FDA and applicants, including the exchange of scientific and      regulatory information.     Deficiency Letters       By October 1, 2017, the Agency will publish a level 2      update to the final guidance ``Suggested Format for      Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with      the Least Burdensome Provisions of FDAMA; Final Guidance for      Industry and FDA Staff'' to reflect the following:       All deficiency letters will include a statement of the      basis for the deficiencies (e.g., a specific reference to      applicable section of a rule, final guidance, recognized      standard unless the entire or most of document is      applicable). In the instance when the deficiency cannot be      traced in the manner above and relates to a scientific or      regulatory issue pertinent to the determination, FDA will      cite the specific scientific issue and the information to      support its position. All deficiency letters will undergo      supervisory review prior to issuance to ensure the      deficiencies cited are relevant to a marketing authorization      decision (e.g., 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, and de novo      classification). Any additional best practices identified by      quality audits and/or the Independent Assessment will be      incorporated in updates to the guidance, as appropriate.       FDA will train staff and managers on this process      improvement and the updated guidance.     Device Accessories       FDA and Industry will explore additional mechanisms for a      streamlined, resource minimal pathway to reclassify      accessories previously classified as class III devices as a      part of a PMA review if they meet the requirements of a low      or moderate risk device.     Enhanced Use of Consensus Standards       FDA will establish an Accreditation Scheme for Conformity      Assessment (ASCA) Program using FDA-recognized consensus      standards. FDA will define the `scheme' and oversee the      Conformity Assessment (CA) model and ensure that there is      appropriate interaction with parties that serve as      Accrediting Bodies (ABs) to accredit test laboratories (TLs).      When a device type using the `scheme' is evaluated according      to a specific recognized standard by an accredited TL, FDA      intends to rely on the results from the accredited TL for the      purpose of premarket review (i.e., generally accept a      determination that a device conforms with the standard)      without the need to address further questions related to      standards conformance. Assuming that it meets established      criteria as outlined in the ASCA program, a device company's      internal TL will be eligible to participate in the ASCA      program. FDA will not review reports from accredited TLs      except as part of a periodic quality audit or if FDA becomes      aware of new information materially relevant to safety and/or      effectiveness.       Specific actions that FDA will undertake include the      following:       1. Conduct a Public Workshop by the end of FY 2018 to      discuss objectives for the establishment of ABs and      Discussion would include areas (specific FDA-recognized      consensus standards) where the ASCA Program can be piloted to      maximize initial impact of existing CA activities and      potential new areas.       2. Hold educational sessions with stakeholders by the end      of FY 2018 about the purpose of the ASCA Program       3. Develop and initiate the pilot of the ASCA program with      stakeholder input by the end of FY 2020.       a. FDA intends to pilot inclusion of recognized standards      of public health significance where specific pass/fail      criteria are part of the standard       4. Develop an internal IT system to track CA activities of      the ASCA Program       5. Establish a process for accreditation of ABs and      FDA will issue draft guidance by the end of FY 2019 and issue      final guidance within 12 months post initiation of the pilot.       a. In limited circumstances, the FDA may directly accredit      third-party For example, FDA could directly accredit      third party TLs, if FDA has not identified and recognized an      AB within 2 years after establishing the tenets of the ASCA      program.       6. Establish a process for reaccreditation and the      suspension or withdrawal of accreditation of poor performing      ABs and FDA will issue draft guidance by the end of FY      2019 and final guidance within 12 months post initiation of      the pilot.       7. Establish a publicly-accessible website listing TLs      accredited by ASCA and the FDA-recognized consensus      standard(s) for which they are accredited       8. FDA, in consultation with stakeholders, will identify      appropriate recognized consensus standards for consideration      as part of the pilot as the specific focus for       a. By the end of FY 2022: FDA will have piloted, and      provided a report on the viability of, an ASCA program which      utilizes the schema identified in guidance to include      utilization of 5 appropriate cross-cutting/horizontal and/or      device-specific areas, at least one of which will be device-     specific.       b. Standards included as part of the ASCA Program will need      to have well established endpoints/acceptance criteria built      into the standard to allow effective tracking of TL      competence.       FDA will provide an annual report on the progress of the      ASCA program.       FDA will work with stakeholders for further input on      programmatic improvements and/or consideration for expansion.     Third Party Review       The Agency will take the following actions to improve the      Third Party Review program with a goal of eliminating routine      re-review by FDA of Third Party reviews:       1. Strengthen the process for accreditation of Third            a. Provide training for Third Parties seeking accreditation      by This training shall include the opportunity for Third      Parties to have access to redacted review memos and other      information as appropriate.       b. When FDA's expectations for a particular device type      change, FDA will have in place a process to convey this      information to the Third Parties and to industry.       2. By the end of FY 2018, establish a plan for eliminating      routine re-review by FDA of Third Party reviews and implement      plan within 12 months.       3. Implement a program to audit reviews conducted by      accredited Third       a. Provide tailored re-training to accredited Third Parties      based on the results of audits.       4. By the end of FY 2018, issue draft guidance outlining      criteria for reaccreditation of 3rd Parties and the      suspension or withdrawal of accreditation of a Third      FDA will issue final guidance within 12 months of the      conclusion of the public comment period.       5. Publish performance of individual accredited Third      Parties with at least five completed submissions on the web      (e.g., rate of NSE, average number of holds, average time to      SE).       6. Require the independent assessment of the Third Party      Review Program to evaluate efficiency including the      circumstances when FDA re-reviews were conducted; and to      suggest process improvements.       The Agency will seek greater authority to tailor the      program. Specifically, FDA intends to expand the scope of the      program to some product codes that require clinical data and      to remove product codes from eligibility when appropriate,      such as if/when safety signals arise.       As resources permit, FDA will identify pilot device areas      to be the specific focus of an effort where FDA would work      with willing industry partners to ensure that information      allowing for high quality Third Party reviews could be made      available to provide a proof of concept in certain device      areas and enable the development of a broader successful      program.     Patient Engagement & the Science of Patient Input       The Agency will take the following actions to advance      patient input and involvement in the regulatory process.      Where appropriate, the Agency will leverage public private      partnerships (PPPs) to advance these actions.       1. Develop clinical, statistical, and other scientific      expertise and staff capacity to respond to submissions      containing applicant-[[Page S4733]]     proposed use of publicly available and validated, voluntary      patient preference information (PPI) or voluntary patient      reported outcomes (PROs). These staff will provide submission      review and early consultation/advice to industry during study      planning.       2. By the end of FY 2020, hold one or more public meetings      to discuss the topics below and publish the findings and next      steps.       a. Discuss approaches for incorporating PPI and PRO as      evidence in device submissions, as well as other ways of      advancing patient engagement;       b. Discuss ways to use patient input to inform clinical      study design and conduct, with a goal of reducing barriers to      patient participation and facilitating recruitment and      retention;       c. Public meetings should include specific examples and      case histories for PPIs and PROs to ensure clarity and      understanding by workshop attendees; and       d. Identify priority areas where decisions are preference-     sensitive and PPI data can inform regulatory decision-making,      in order to advance design and conduct of patient preference      studies in high impact areas. Publish the priority areas in      the Federal Register for public comment following the public      meeting.       3. FDA will undertake several activities to improve the      regulatory predictability and impact of PROs, including:       a. Clarify to device review divisions that use of PROs is      voluntary and may be one potential way of demonstrating      safety or effectiveness (or elements of either or both, such      as in a composite endpoint). Consistent with least burdensome      principles, applicants may use alternative approaches.       b. Modify the guidance to outline a flexible framework for      PRO validation evidentiary thresholds. These thresholds may      vary depending on the particular regulatory use of the       c. Work on developing a model for ``bridging studies'' to      make efficient use of existing validated PROs which may be      improved, or adapted to other subpopulations or other      regulatory uses in a more streamlined and expeditious manner      than creating novel       4. The existing dispute resolution process should be used      in the event of disagreement between the applicant and the      Agency on the need for PPI or     Emerging Diagnostics       FDA will work with industry to continue the pilot for      emerging diagnostics started under MDUFA     Real World Evidence (RWE)       1. The Agency will use user fee revenue to support the      National Evaluation System for health Technology (NEST) by      providing funding for the NEST Coordinating Center and hiring      FDA staff with expertise in the use of The NEST      governing board will include no fewer than 4 representatives      of the trade associations that participated in the MDUFA IV      negotiations (AdvaMed, MDMA, MITA, and ACLA), with each      association appointing an individual to serve. Industry      representation on the NEST governing board will make up at      least 25% of the governing board membership. The      representative from each trade association may be part of the      staff of the association or appointed from a member company.      If any of the trade associations elects not to participate on      the NEST governing board or for any additional seats      allocated to Industry, the participating trade associations      will determine how to fill any vacant Industry positions. The      governing board also will include, but not be limited to,      representation from patient organizations. By the end of      FY2019, NEST will implement pilots for at least two product      codes (and related product codes), one of which will cover      devices approved through the PMA process and the other of      which will cover devices cleared through the 510(k) process.      The NEST Coordinating Center will seek ways in which to make      NEST financially self-sustaining so as not to rely on MDUFA      user fees in the long term unless FDA and Industry determine      continued user fee support is warranted and provides a      sufficient return on investment.       2. FDA will contract with an organization to serve as the      NEST Coordinating Center to facilitate use of real world      evidence to support premarket activities. The contract will      specify actions the Coordinating Center will take to advance      the use of RWE, including:       a. Establish a framework to fund pilot projects to      determine the usability of RWE for:       i. Expanded indications for use       ii. New clearances/approvals       iii. Improved malfunction reporting       b. No later than October 1, 2020, the Coordinating Center      will hold a public meeting to review and evaluate the      progress and outcomes (as of the date of the public meeting)      of the pilots described in (H)(1) above.       c. The pilots will take place over a period of three years,      including data analysis and the Coordinating Center will      issue a publicly available report of the results.       d. The pilots will include devices not currently subject to      a registry.       e. At the conclusion of the pilots, an independent third-     party will conduct an assessment to evaluate the strengths,      limitations, and appropriate use of RWE for informing      premarket decision-making for multiple device types.       f. If warranted based on the results of the pilot(s)      described in (H)(1) above, FDA will revise its guidance on      the use of RWE to reflect what has been learned from the      pilots as to how RWE can be used to support:       i. Expanded indications for use; and       ii. New clearances/approvals.       If supported by the pilot(s) described in (H)(1) above, the      guidance will include discussion of how devices not currently      subject to a registry can benefit from       3. The Agency will establish criteria for streamlining MDR      requirements.       a. For most, if not all, device procodes, FDA will permit      manufacturers of such devices in those procodes to report      malfunctions on a quarterly basis and in a summary MDR      format. FDA will publish the list of eligible device procodes      within 12 months of receiving a proposed list from      The list will include, among other device procodes, Class II      implantable and Class III devices, as appropriate, and will      reflect FDA's consideration of Industry's proposed list.       b. FDA may determine that devices under a new procode in      existence for less than 2 years are not eligible for      reporting of malfunctions on a quarterly basis and in a      summary format.       c. If a new type of malfunction occurs that the      manufacturer has not previously reported to FDA, the      manufacturer must submit an individual report. The      manufacturer will notify FDA when the issue has been      resolved, using current requirements per 21 C.F.803, 806.       d. FDA will maintain on its website the list of eligible      device procodes for which manufacturers are permitted to      report malfunctions on a quarterly basis and in a summary MDR      format.       e. FDA will establish a mechanism at the time it publishes      the list of eligible devices under 3(a) that permits      stakeholders to request device procodes be added to the list.       f. Nothing in this section precludes the Agency from      requiring individual malfunction reports from a specific      manufacturer and/or for a specific device if necessary to      protect public health. In these situations, FDA will notify      the manufacturer they are not eligible for quarterly summary      MDR reporting and provide an explanation for that decision      and the steps necessary to return to eligibility for      quarterly summary MDR reporting.       4. FDA will not require postmarket surveillance studies      (i.e., 522 Studies) for devices for which registries and/or      other real world data (RWD) sources exist if FDA has access      to the information/data in the RWD source and has determined      that the information/data in the RWD source is sufficient to      take the place of a postmarket surveillance study.     Digital Health       The Agency will build expertise and streamline and align      FDA review processes with software lifecycles for Software as      a Medical Device (SaMD) and software inside of medical      devices (SiMD). Specifically, the Agency will:       1. Establish a central digital health unit within CDRH's      Office of the Center Director to ensure proper coordination      and consistency across the The Agency will not      reorganize staff such that existing review staff would be      reassigned to the central digital health unit, while      retaining and not disrupting the existing digital health      talent within the reviewing divisions who have established,      long-term therapeutic and device expertise. The digital      health unit will perform, at a minimum, the following tasks:       a. Develop software and digital health technical expertise      (``Technical Experts'') to provide assistance for premarket      submissions that include SaMD, SiMD, interoperable devices,      or otherwise incorporate novel digital health technologies.       b. Utilize Technical Experts as appropriate or when      requested by the manufacturer for submissions that include      SaMD, SiMD, interoperable devices, or otherwise incorporate      novel digital health technologies; and       c. Incorporate appropriate metrics for digital health      improvements to monitor, track, analyze and report the      results of digital health premarket review timelines.       2. Publish final guidance addressing when to submit a      510(k) for a software modification to an existing device      within 18 months of the close of the comment period.       3. Explore opportunities to establish premarket approval/     clearance pathways tailored to SaMD, SiMD, and novel digital      health technologies that take into account real world      evidence while incorporating principles established through      international harmonization. To accomplish this task, the      Agency will:       a. Engage with stakeholders, including industry, through      roundtables, informal meetings, and teleconferences;       b. Hold a public workshop; and       c. Revise existing and/or publish new relevant guidance      documents, including publishing a draft revised version of      the ``Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for      Software Contained in Medical Devices'' (issued in 2005) by      the end of FY2019, and within 12 months of the close of the      comment period, publish the final revised version. The Agency      will incorporate applicable concepts from its Guidance for      ``Off-The-Shelf Software Used in Medical Devices.''       4. Participate in international harmonization efforts      related to digital health, including work on developing SaMD      and other digital health convergence efforts through the      International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF).[[Page S4734]]       Guidance Document Development       FDA will apply user fee revenues to ensure timely      completion of Draft Guidance documents. The Agency will      strive to finalize, withdraw, reopen the comment period, or      issue a new draft guidance for 80% of draft guidance      documents within 3 years of the close of the comment periods      as resources permit. The Agency will strive to finalize,      withdraw, reopen the comment period, or issue a new draft      guidance for 100% of draft guidance documents within 5 years      of the close of the comment periods as resources permit. The      Agency will continue to develop guidance documents and      improve the development process as resources permit, but not      to the detriment of meeting quantitative review timelines and      statutory obligations.     Total Product Life Cycle (TPLC)       The establishment of CDRH's Office of In Vitro Diagnostic      Device Evaluation and Safety (now the Office of In Vitro      Diagnostics and Radiological Health (OIR)) has led to      improved consistency and predictability due to the enhanced      integration of premarket, postmarket, and compliance-related      activities and staff and improved information sharing among      staff. In addition, the successful development and evaluation      of medical devices depends on the integration of clinical      with scientific and engineering disciplines. CDRH will      explore transitioning to a similar TPLC model building in the      other device areas based on the lessons learned from its      experience with OIR and taking into account the Center's      mission, vision, strategic priorities, and development of a      patient-centric benefit-risk framework for regulatory and      non-regulatory decision making across the Because an      essential element for the success of the Center's benefit-     risk decision making framework and approach to device      regulation (particularly emerging and innovative      technologies) is the incorporation of the clinical context      and the impact of a decision on patient health and quality of      life, CDRH will take steps to increase and enhance the      integration of its clinicians into its TPLC activities,      amongst themselves, and with the Center's scientists and      engineers. Building on the success of considering and      incorporating additional expertise and viewpoints into our      decision-making, such as through the use of the Network of      Experts and the leveraging of patient perspectives, CDRH will      also explore ways in which to better learn from and leverage      the expertise of clinicians in other parts of the agency and      outside of the agency to inform its decision making, enhance      consistency, and assure a more holistic clinical perspective.      Clinicians involved in device-related activities will have      appropriate training on and make recommendations consistent      with applicable device statutory provisions, regulations,      guidances, and this Commitment In addition, CDRH will      provide managerial oversight of clinician recommendations and      device submission decisions, except for those devices subject      to CBER oversight.         Independent Assessment of Review Process Management       FDA and the industry will participate in a comprehensive      assessment of the process for the review of device      applications. The assessment will include consultation with      both FDA and industry. The assessment shall be conducted in      two phases under contract to FDA by a private, independent      consulting firm capable of performing the technical analysis,      management assessment, and program evaluation tasks required      to address the assessment scope described below within the      budget provided under this user fee agreement.                                Phase 1       During the first phase, the contractor will complete an      evaluation of FDA's implementation of the corrective action      plan developed in response to recommendations from the MDUFA      III independent assessment.       For Phase 1, FDA will award the contract by the end of      The contractor will evaluate the implementation of      MDUFA III recommendations and publish a written assessment      within 1 year of contract award.                                Phase 2       During the second phase, the contractor will:       1. Evaluate FDA's premarket review program to identify      efficiencies that should be realized as a result of the      process improvements and investments under MDUFA III and IV;       2. Evaluate premarket review program infrastructure and      allocation of FTEs;       3. Assess the alignment of resource needs with the training      and expertise of hires;       4. Identify and share best practices across branches in ODE      and OIR;       5. Assess the effectiveness of programs targeted for      improvement under this agreement, including the:       a. Quality Management program,       b. Proportion of deficiencies in which FDA references the      basis for the deficiency determination,       c. Pre-Submission program (assess whether (a) CDRH is      providing guidance specific to the questions being asked; (b)      CDRH is using Pre-Submissions appropriately; and (c) CDRH and      Industry are adhering to the procedural aspects as set forth      in this agreement),       d. Third Party Review program (assess efficiency of program      and suggest process improvements),       e. Digital Health program,       f. Patient Engagement program, and       g. Real World Evidence program;       6. Analyze conversions of Special 510(k)s to Traditional      510(k)s; and       7. Assess other key areas identified by FDA and industry as      resources permit.       For Phase 2 of the independent assessment, FDA will award      the contract no later than 3/31/2020. However, the contractor      would not begin the audit of deficiency letters and Pre-     Submissions before 10/1/2020. The contractor will publish      comprehensive findings and recommendations within 1 year. For      all recommendations the contractor will provide an estimate      of additional resources needed or efficiencies gained, as      applicable.       FDA will incorporate findings and recommendations, as      appropriate, into its management of the premarket review      program. FDA will analyze the recommendations for improvement      opportunities identified in the assessment and, as      appropriate, develop and implement a corrective action plan,      and assure its effectiveness.                        Performance Reports       The Agency will report its progress toward meeting the      goals described in this letter, as follows. If, throughout      the course of MDUFA IV, the Agency and Industry agree that a      different format or different metrics would be more useful,      the reporting will be modified accordingly as per the      agreement of both FDA and       1.

On an annual basis, FDA and Industry will discuss the      return on investment, which may include process improvements,      improved performance, and other enhancements, under MDUFA               Definitions and Explanations of Terms     Applicant       Applicant means a person who makes any of the following      submissions to FDA:       an application for premarket approval under section 515 of      the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA);       a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FDCA;       an application for investigational device exemption under      section 520(g) of the FDCA;       a Pre-Submission;       a de novo request (evaluation of automatic class III      designation) under section 513(f)(2) of the FDCA;       a CLIA Waiver by application.     Electronic Copy (e-Copy)       An electronic copy is an exact duplicate of a submission,      created and submitted on a CD, DVD, or in another electronic      media format that FDA has agreed to accept, accompanied by a      copy of the signed cover letter and the complete original      paper submission. An electronic copy is not considered to be      an electronic submission.     Electronic submission template       An electronic submission template, or eSubmission template,      is a guided submission preparation tool for industry. Similar      to an online form, the eSubmission template walks industry      through the relevant contents and components for the      respective premarket submission type and device in order to      facilitate submission preparation and enhance consistency,      quality, and efficiency in the premarket review process.     FDA Days       FDA Days are those calendar days when a submission is      considered to be under review at the Agency for submissions      that have been accepted (510(k) or de novo classification      request), filed (PMA) or submitted (CLIA Waiver by      application). FDA Days begin on the date of receipt of the      submission or of the amendment to the submission that enables      the submission to be accepted (510(k)) or filed (PMA).     MDUFA Decisions       Original PMAs: Decisions for Original PMAs are Approval,      Approvable, Approvable Pending GMP Inspection, Not      Approvable, withdrawal, and       180-Day PMA Supplements: Decisions for 180-Day PMA      Supplements include Approval, Approvable, and Not       Real-Time PMA Supplements: Decisions for Real-Time PMA      supplements include Approval, Approvable, and not       510(k)s: Decisions for 510(k)s are substantially equivalent      (SE) or not substantially equivalent (NSE).       De Novo Requests: Decisions for De Novo requests are grant,      withdrawal, and decline.       CLIA Waiver by Application Submissions: Decisions for CLIA      Waiver by Application Submissions are Approval, Withdrawal,      and       Submissions placed on Application Integrity Program Hold      will be removed from the MDUFA cohort.     Pre-Submission       A Pre-Submission includes a formal written request from an      applicant for feedback from FDA which is provided in the form      of a formal written response or, if the manufacturer chooses,      a meeting or teleconference in which the feedback is      documented in meeting minutes. A Pre-Submission meeting is a      meeting or teleconference in which FDA provides its      substantive feedback on the Pre-      A Pre-Submission provides the opportunity for an applicant      to obtain FDA feedback prior to intended submission of an      investigational device exemption or marketing application.      The request must include specific questions regarding review      issues relevant to a planned IDE or marketing application      (e.g., questions regarding pre-clinical testing protocols or      data requirements; design and performance of clinical studies      and acceptance criteria). A Pre-Submission is appropriate      when FDA's feedback on specific questions is necessary to      guide product development and/or application preparation.       The following forms of FDA feedback to applicants are not      considered Pre-      Interactions requested by either the applicant or FDA      during the review of a marketing application (i.e., following      submission of a marketing application, but prior to reaching      an FDA Decision).       General information requests initiated through the Division      of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE).       General questions regarding FDA policy or procedures.       Meetings or teleconferences that are intended to be      informational only, including, but not limited to, those      intended to educate the review team on new device(s) with      significant differences in technology from currently      available devices, or to update FDA about ongoing or future      product development, without a request for FDA feedback on      specific questions related to a planned submission.       Requests for clarification on technical guidance documents,      especially where contact is recommended by FDA in the      guidance document. However, the following requests will      generally need to be submitted as a Pre-Submission in order      to ensure appropriate input from multiple reviewers and      management: recommendations for device types not specifically      addressed in the guidance document; recommendations for      nonclinical or clinical studies not addressed in the guidance      document; requests to use an alternative means to address      recommendations specified in a guidance document.       Phone calls or email messages to reviewers that can be      readily answered based on a reviewer's experience and      knowledge and do not require the involvement of a broader      number of FDA staff beyond the routine involvement of the      reviewer's supervisor and more experienced mentors.     Substantive Interaction       Substantive Interaction is an email, letter,      teleconference, video conference, fax, or other form of      communication such as a request for Additional Information or      Major Deficiency letters by FDA notifying the applicant of      substantive deficiencies identified in initial submission      review, or a communication stating that FDA has not      identified any deficiencies in the initial submission review      and any further minor deficiencies will be communicated      through interactive review. An approval or clearance letter      issued prior to the Substantive Interaction goal date will      qualify as a Substantive       If substantive issues warranting issuance of an Additional      Information or Major Deficiency letter are not identified,      interactive review should be used to resolve any minor issues      and facilitate an FDA decision. In addition, interactive      review will be used, where, in FDA's estimation, it leads to      a more efficient review process during the initial review      cycle (i.e., prior to a Substantive Interaction) to resolve      minor issues such as revisions to administrative items (e.g.,      510(k) Summary/Statement, Indications for Use statement,      environmental impact assessment, financial disclosure      statements); a more detailed device description; omitted      engineering drawings; revisions to labeling; or clarification      regarding nonclinical or clinical study methods or data.       Minor issues may still be included in an Additional      Information or Major Deficiency letter where related to the      resolution of the[[Page S4736]]     substantive issues (e.g., modification of the proposed      Indications for Use may lead to revisions in labeling and      administrative items), or if they were still unresolved      following interactive review attempts. Both interactive      review and Substantive Interactions will occur on the review      clock except upon the issuance of an Additional Information      or Major Deficiency Letter which stops the review clock.     Total Time to Decision       Total Time to Decision is the number of calendar days from      the date of receipt of an accepted or filed submission to a      MDUFA decision.       The average Total Time to Decision for 510(k) submissions      is calculated as the average of Total Times to Decision for      510(k) submissions within a closed cohort, excluding the      highest 2% and the lowest 2% of values. A cohort is closed      when 99% of the accepted submissions have reached a decision.       The average Total Time to Decision for PMA applications is      calculated as the three-year rolling average of the annual      Total Times to Decision for applications (for example, for      FY2018, the average Total Time to Decision for PMA      applications would be the average of FY2016 through FY2018)      within a closed cohort, excluding the highest 5% and the      lowest 5% of values. A cohort is closed when 95% of the      applications have reached a decision.     Accreditation Scheme for Conformity Assessment       Conformity Assessment is the demonstration that specified      requirements relating to a product, process, system, person      or body are fulfilled.       Accreditation is the formal recognition by an independent      body, generally known as an accreditation body, that an      organization is competent to carry out specific conformity      assessment activities. Accreditation is not obligatory but it      adds another level of confidence, as `accredited' means the      organization has been independently checked to make sure it      operates according to international standards.       A conformity assessment scheme is a system for assessing      the conformity of specified objects (e.g., medical devices or      management processes) to one or more consensus standards. The      system specifies the applicable standards as well as the      rules, procedures, and management requirements for carrying      out the conformity assessment to meet a regulatory need.      Informally, such a scheme may be referred to as an      accreditation scheme.       Testing laboratory is an organization that possesses the      necessary technical competence and capabilities to conduct      testing to making a determination that one or more      characteristics of an object are in conformance with a set of      predefined requirements.     BLA-related Definitions       Review and act on--the issuance of a complete action letter      after the complete review of a filed complete application.      The action letter, if it is not an approval, will set forth      in detail the specific deficiencies and, where appropriate,      the actions necessary to place the application in condition      for approval.       Class 1 resubmitted applications--applications resubmitted      after a complete response letter that includes the following      items only (or combinations of these items):       (a) Final printed labeling       (b) Draft labeling       (c) Safety updates submitted in the same format, including      tabulations, as the original safety submission with new data      and changes highlighted (except when large amounts of new      information including important new adverse experiences not      previously reported with the product are presented in the      resubmission)       (d) Stability updates to support provisional or final      dating periods       (e) Commitments to perform Phase 4 studies, including      proposals for such studies       (f) Assay validation data       (g) Final release testing on the last 1-2 lots used to      support approval       (h) A minor reanalysis of data previously submitted to the      application (determined by the Agency as fitting the Class 1      category)       (i) Other minor clarifying information (determined by the      Agency as fitting the Class 1 category)       (j) Other specific items may be added later as the Agency      gains experience with the scheme and will be communicated via      guidance documents to industry       Class 2 resubmitted applications--resubmissions that      include any other items, including any item that would      require presentation to an advisory committee.

The goals letter represents the      product of FDA's discussions with the regulated industry and      public stakeholders, as mandated by The performance      and procedural goals and other commitments specified in this      letter apply to aspects of the human drug review program that      are important for facilitating timely access to safe,      effective, and innovative new medicines for patients. While      much of FDA's work is associated with formal tracked      performance goals, the Agency and industry mutually agree      that it is appropriate to manage some areas of the human drug      review program with internally tracked timeframes. This      provides FDA the flexibility needed to respond to a highly      diverse workload, including unanticipated public health      needs. FDA is committed to meeting the performance goals      specified in this letter and to continuous improvement of its      performance regarding other important areas specified in      relevant published documents that relate to preapproval drug      development and post-approval activities for marketed      products. FDA and the regulated industry will periodically      and regularly assess the progress of the human drug review      program throughout PDUFA This will allow FDA and the      regulated industry to identify emerging challenges and      develop strategies to address these challenges to ensure the      efficiency and effectiveness of the human drug review      program.       Unless otherwise stated, goals apply to cohorts of each      fiscal year (FY).     ENSURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HUMAN DRUG REVIEW PROGRAM     Review Performance Goals       1. NDA/BLA Submissions and Resubmissions       a. Review and act on 90 percent of standard NME NDA and      original BLA submissions within 10 months of the 60 day      filing date.       b. Review and act on 90 percent of priority NME NDA and      original BLA submissions within 6 months of the 60 day filing      date.       c. Review and act on 90 percent of standard non-NME      original NDA submissions within 10 months of receipt.       d. Review and act on 90 percent of priority non-NME      original NDA submissions within 6 months of receipt.       e. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 1 resubmitted      original applications within 2 months of receipt.       f. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 2 resubmitted      original applications within 6 months of receipt.       2. Original Efficacy Supplements       a. Review and act on 90 percent of standard efficacy      supplements within 10 months of receipt.       b. Review and act on 90 percent of priority efficacy      supplement within 6 months of receipt.       3. Resubmitted Efficacy Supplements       a. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 1 resubmitted      efficacy supplements within 2 months of receipt.       b. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 2 resubmitted      efficacy supplements within 6 months of receipt.       4. Original Manufacturing Supplements       a. Review and act on 90 percent of manufacturing      supplements requiring prior approval within 4 months of      receipt[[Page S4737]]       b. Review and act on 90 percent of all other manufacturing      supplements within 6 months of receipt.       5. Review Performance Goal Extensions       a. Major Amendments       i. A major amendment to an original application, efficacy      supplement, or resubmission of any of these applications,      submitted at any time during the review cycle, may extend the      goal date by three months.       ii. A major amendment may include, for example, a major new      clinical safety/efficacy study report; major re-analysis of      previously submitted study(ies); submission of a Risk      Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) with Element to      Assure Safe Use (ETASU) not included in the original      application; or significant amendment to a previously      submitted REMS with Generally, changes to REMS that do      not include ETASU and minor changes to REMS with ETASU will      not be considered major amendments.       iii. A major amendment to a manufacturing supplement      submitted at any time during the review cycle may extend the      goal date by two months.       iv. Only one extension can be given per review cycle.       v. Consistent with the underlying principles articulated in      the GRMP guidance, FDA's decision to extend the review clock      should, except in rare circumstances, be limited to occasions      where review of the new information could address outstanding      deficiencies in the application and lead to approval in the      current review cycle.       b. Inspection of Facilities Not Adequately Identified in an      Original Application or Supplement       i. All original applications, including those in the      ``Program,'' (see Section I.B.2) and supplements are expected      to include a comprehensive and readily located list of all      manufacturing facilities included or referenced in the      application or supplement. This list provides FDA with      information needed to schedule inspections of manufacturing      facilities that may be necessary before approval of the      original application or supplement.       ii. If, during FDA's review of an original application or      supplement, the Agency identifies a manufacturing facility      that was not included in the comprehensive and readily      located list, the goal date may be extended.       1) If FDA identifies the need to inspect a manufacturing      facility that is not included as part of the comprehensive      and readily located list in an original application or      efficacy supplement, the goal date may be extended by three      months.       2) If FDA identifies the need to inspect a manufacturing      facility that is not included as part of the comprehensive      and readily located list in a manufacturing supplement, the      goal date may be extended by two months.       6. These review goals are summarized in the following      tables:     TABLE 1.--ORIGINAL AND RESUBMITTED APPLICATIONS AND SUPPLEMENTS------------------------------------------------------------------------        Submission Cohort              Standard            Priority------------------------------------------------------------------------NME NDAs and original BLAs......  90% in 10 months    90% in 6 months of                                   of the 60 day       the 60 day filing                                   filing date.        dateNon NME NDAs....................  90% in 10 months    90% in 6 months of                                   of the receipt      the receipt date                                   date.Class 1 Resubmissions...........  90% in 2 months of  90% in 2 months of                                   the receipt date.   the receipt dateClass 2 Resubmissions...........  90% in 6 months of  90% in 6 months of                                   the receipt date.   the receipt dateOriginal Efficacy Supplements...  90% in 10 months    90% in 6 months of                                   of the receipt      the receipt date                                   date.Class 1 Resubmitted Efficacy      90% in 2 months of  90% in 2 months of                      the receipt date.   the receipt dateClass 2 Resubmitted Efficacy      90% in 6 months of  90% in 6 months of                      the receipt date.   the receipt date------------------------------------------------------------------------                                 TABLE 2------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Prior Approval         All Other------------------------------------------------------------------------Manufacturing Supplements.......  90% in 4 months of  90% in 6 months of                                   the receipt date.   the receipt date------------------------------------------------------------------------     Program for Enhanced Review Transparency and Communication          for NME NDAs and Original BLAs       To promote transparency and communication between the FDA      review team and the applicant, FDA will apply the following      model (``the Program'') to the review of all New Molecular      Entity New Drug Applications (NME NDAs) and original      Biologics License Applications (BLAs), including applications      that are resubmitted following a Refuse-to-File decision,      received from October 1, 2017, through September 30, 2022.      The goal of the Program is to promote the efficiency and      effectiveness of the first cycle review process and minimize      the number of review cycles necessary for approval, ensuring      that patients have timely access to safe, effective, and high      quality new drugs and biologics.       Approach to Application The standard approach for      the review of NME NDAs and original BLAs is described in this      section. However, the FDA review team and the applicant may      discuss and reach mutual agreement on an alternative approach      to the timing and nature of interactions and information      exchange between the applicant and FDA, i.e., a Formal      Communication Plan for the review of the NME NDA or original      The Formal Communication Plan may include elements of      the standard approach (e.g., a mid-cycle communication or a      late-cycle meeting) as well as other interactions that      sometimes occur during the review process (e.g., a meeting      during the filing period to discuss the application, i.e., an      ``application orientation meeting''). If appropriate, the      Formal Communication Plan should specify those elements of      the Program that FDA and the sponsor agree are unnecessary      for the application under review. If the review team and the      applicant anticipate developing a Formal Communication Plan,      the elements of the plan should be discussed and agreed to at      the pre-submission meeting (see Section I.B.1) and reflected      in the meeting minutes. The Formal Communication Plan may be      reviewed and amended at any time based on the progress of the      review and the mutual agreement of the review team and the      applicant. For example, the review team and the applicant may      mutually agree at any time to cancel future specified      interactions in the Program (e.g., the late-cycle meeting)      that become unnecessary (e.g. because previous communications      between the review team and the applicant are sufficient).      Any amendments made to the Formal Communication Plan should      be consistent with the goal of an efficient and timely first      cycle review process and not impede the review team's ability      to conduct its review.       Expedited In certain cases, an application      reviewed in the Program will be for a product that the FDA      review team identifies as meeting an important public health      need. If the FDA review team determines that a first-cycle      approval is likely for such an application, the team intends      to make every effort to conduct an expedited review and act      early on the application. FDA conducts expedited reviews to      promote timely access to critically needed therapies for      patients without compromising FDA's high standards for      demonstrating the safety, efficacy, and quality of new      medicines. Expedited reviews are typically characterized by      frequent contact between the applicant and the FDA review      team throughout the review process. Any parameters of the      Program that are intended to facilitate expedited reviews are      noted throughout Section I.      If significant application deficiencies are identified by      the review team at any time during an expedited review, FDA      intends to revert, for the remainder of the review, to the      standard approach to the review of priority NME NDAs and      original BLAs (as described in this section), and will inform      the applicant accordingly.       The remainder of Section I.B describes the parameters that      will apply to FDA's review of applications in the       1. Pre-submission meeting: The applicant is strongly      encouraged to discuss the planned content of the application      with the appropriate FDA review division at a pre-NDA/BLA      meeting. This meeting will be attended by the FDA review      team, including appropriate senior FDA staff.       a. The pre-NDA/BLA meeting should be held sufficiently in      advance of the planned submission of the application to allow      for meaningful response to FDA feedback and should generally      occur not less than 2 months prior to the planned submission      of the application.       b. In addition to FDA's preliminary responses to the      applicant's questions, other potential discussion topics      include preliminary discussions on the need for REMS or other      risk management actions, and, where applicable, the      development of a Formal Communication Plan and a timeline for      review activities associated with a scheduling recommendation      under the Controlled Substances Act for drugs with abuse      potential. These discussions will be summarized at the      conclusion of the meeting and reflected in the FDA meeting      minutes.       c. The FDA and the applicant will agree on the content of a      complete application for the proposed indication(s) at the      pre-submission meeting. The FDA and the applicant may also      reach agreement on submission of a limited number of      application components not later than 30 calendar days after      the submission of the original application. These submissions      must be of a type that would not be expected to materially      impact the ability of the review team to begin its review.      These agreements will be summarized at the conclusion of the      meeting and reflected in the FDA meeting minutes.       i. Examples of application components that may be      appropriate for delayed submission include updated stability      data (e.g., 15-month data to update 12-month data submitted      with the original submission) or the final audited report of      a preclinical study[[Page S4738]]     (e.g., carcinogenicity) where the final draft report is      submitted with the original application.       ii. Major components of the application (e.g., the complete      study report of a Phase 3 clinical trial or the full study      report of required long-term safety data) are expected to be      submitted with the original application and are not subject      to agreement for late submission.       2. Original application submission: Applications are      expected to be complete, as agreed between the FDA review      team and the applicant at the pre-NDA/BLA meeting, at the      time of original submission of the application. If the      applicant does not have a pre-NDA/BLA meeting with FDA, and      no agreement exists between FDA and the applicant on the      contents of a complete application or delayed submission of      certain components of the application, the applicant's      submission is expected to be complete at the time of original      submission.       a. All applications are expected to include a comprehensive      and readily located list of all clinical sites and      manufacturing facilities included or referenced in the      application.       b. Any components of the application that FDA agreed at the      pre-submission meeting could be submitted after the original      application are expected to be received not later than 30      calendar days after receipt of the original application.       c. Incomplete applications, including applications with      components that are not received within 30 calendar days      after receipt of the original submission, will be subject to      a Refuse-to-File decision.       d. The following parameters will apply to applications that      are subject to a Refuse-to-File decision and are subsequently      filed over protest:       i. The original submission of the application will be      subject to the review performance goal as described in      Section I.B.4.       ii. The application will not be eligible for the other      parameters of the Program (e.g., mid-cycle communication,      late-cycle meeting).       iii. FDA generally will not review amendments to the      application during any review cycle. FDA also generally will      not issue information requests to the applicant during the      agency's review.       iv. The resubmission goals described in Section I.A.1.e and      I.A.1.f will not apply to any resubmission of the application      following an FDA complete response action. Any such      resubmission will be reviewed as available resources permit.       e. Since applications are expected to be complete at the      time of submission, unsolicited amendments are expected to be      rare and not to contain major new information or analyses.      Review of unsolicited amendments, including those submitted      in response to an FDA communication of deficiencies, will be      handled in accordance with the GRMP guidance. This guidance      includes the underlying principle that FDA will consider the      most efficient path toward completion of a comprehensive      review that addresses application deficiencies and leads      toward a first cycle approval when possible.       3. Day 74 Letter: FDA will follow existing procedures      regarding identification and communication of filing review      issues in the ``Day 74 letter.'' For applications subject to      the Program, the timeline for this communication will be      within 74 calendar days from the date of FDA receipt of the      original submission. The planned review timeline included in      the Day 74 letter for applications in the Program will      include the planned date for the internal mid-cycle review      meeting. The letter will also include preliminary plans on      whether to hold an Advisory Committee (AC) meeting to discuss      the application. If applicable, the Day 74 letter will serve      as notification to the applicant that the review division      intends to conduct an expedited review.       4. Review performance goals: For NME NDA and original BLA      submissions that are filed by FDA under the Program, the      PDUFA review clock will begin at the conclusion of the 60      calendar day filing review period that begins on the date of      FDA receipt of the original submission. The review      performance goals for these applications are as follows:       a. Review and act on 90 percent of standard NME NDA and      original BLA submissions within 10 months of the 60 day      filing date.       b. Review and act on 90 percent of priority NME NDA and      original BLA submissions within 6 months of the 60 day filing      date.       5. Mid-Cycle Communication: The FDA Regulatory Project      Manager (RPM), and other appropriate members of the FDA      review team (e.g., Cross Discipline Team Leader (CDTL)), will      call the applicant, generally within 2 weeks following the      Agency's internal mid-cycle review meeting, to provide the      applicant with an update on the status of the review of their      application. An agenda will be sent to the applicant prior to      the mid-cycle communication. Scheduling of the internal mid-     cycle review meeting will be handled in accordance with the      GRMP guidance. The RPM will coordinate the specific date and      time of the telephone call with the applicant.       a. The update should include any significant issues      identified by the review team to date, any information      requests, information regarding major safety concerns and      preliminary review team thinking regarding risk management,      proposed date(s) for the late-cycle meeting, updates      regarding plans for the AC meeting (if an AC meeting is      anticipated), an update regarding FDA's review activities      associated with a scheduling recommendation under the      Controlled Substances Act (if applicable), and other      projected milestone dates for the remainder of the review      cycle.       b. In the case of an expedited review, FDA will communicate      the timelines for the Late-Cycle Meeting and the Late-Cycle      Meeting background package (see Section I.B.6) which may      occur earlier with more condensed timeframes compared to a      review that is not expedited.       6. Late-Cycle and Advisory Committee Meetings: A meeting      will be held between the FDA review team and the applicant to      discuss the status of the review of the application late in      the review cycle. Late-cycle meetings will generally be face-     to-face meetings; however, the meeting may be held by      teleconference if FDA and the applicant agree. Since the      application is expected to be complete at the time of      submission, FDA intends to complete primary and secondary      reviews of the application in advance of the planned late-     cycle meeting.       a. FDA representatives at the late-cycle meeting are      expected to include the signatory authority for the      application, review team members from appropriate      disciplines, and appropriate team leaders and/or supervisors      from disciplines for which substantive issues have been      identified in the review to date.       b. For applications that will be discussed at an AC      meeting, the following parameters apply:       i. FDA intends to convene AC meetings no later than 2      months (standard review) or no later than 6 weeks (priority      review) prior to the PDUFA goal date. The late-cycle meeting      will occur not less than 12 calendar days before the date of      the AC meeting.       ii. FDA intends to provide final questions for the AC to      the sponsor and the AC not less than 2 calendar days before      the AC meeting.       iii. Following an AC Meeting, FDA and the applicant may      agree on the need to discuss feedback from the AC for the      purpose of facilitating the remainder of the review. Such a      meeting will generally be held by teleconference without a      commitment for formal meeting minutes issued by the agency.       c. For applications that will not be discussed at an AC      meeting, the late-cycle meeting will generally occur not      later than 3 months (standard review) or two months (priority      review) prior to the PDUFA goal date.       d. Late-Cycle Meeting Background Packages: The Agency      background package for the late-cycle meeting will be sent to      the applicant not less than 10 calendar days (or 2 calendar      days for an expedited review) before the late-cycle meeting.      The package will consist of a brief memorandum from the      review team outlining substantive application issues (e.g.,      deficiencies identified by primary and secondary reviews),      the Agency's background package for the AC meeting      (incorporated by reference if previously sent to the      applicant), potential questions and/or points for discussion      for the AC meeting (if planned) and the current assessment of      the need for REMS or other risk management actions. If the      application is subject to an expedited review, the background      package may be streamlined and brief using a bulleted list to      identify issues to be discussed.       e. Late-Cycle Meeting Discussion Topics: Potential topics      for discussion at the late-cycle meeting include major      deficiencies identified to date; issues to be discussed at      the AC meeting (if planned); current assessment of the need      for REMS or other risk management actions; status update of      FDA's review activities associated with a scheduling      recommendation under the Controlled Substances Act, if      applicable; information requests from the review team to the      applicant; and additional data or analyses the applicant may      wish to submit.       i. With regard to submission of additional data or      analyses, the FDA review team and the applicant will discuss      whether such data will be reviewed by the Agency in the      current review cycle and, if so, whether the submission will      be considered a major amendment and trigger an extension of      the PDUFA goal date.       7. Inspections: FDA's goal is to complete all GCP, GLP, and      GMP inspections for applications in the Program within 6      months of the date of original receipt for priority      applications and within 10 months of the date of original      receipt for standard applications. This will allow 2 months      at the end of the review cycle to attempt to address any      deficiencies identified by the inspections.     First Cycle Review Management       FDA and industry share a commitment to ensuring an      efficient and effective first cycle review process for all      applications subject to the PDUFA program. This commitment      was first articulated in the GRMP guidance finalized in 2005.      FDA will update this guidance in PDUFA VI to include review      activities (e.g., the NME Program, REMS) that have been added      to the human drug review program since the guidance was      finalized, principles regarding notification to applicants      regarding issues identified during FDA's initial review of      the application, principles regarding FDA's notification to      applicants regarding planned review timelines, and the      importance of internal review timelines that govern aspects      of the human drug review program that are not part of PDUFA      performance goals. FDA will publish a revised draft guidance      for public comment no later than the end of FY 2018.[[Page S4739]]       Review of Proprietary Names to Reduce Medication Errors       To enhance patient safety, FDA is committed to various      measures to reduce medication errors related to look-alike      and sound-alike proprietary names and such factors as unclear      label abbreviations, acronyms, dose designations, and error      prone label and packaging design. The following performance      goals apply to FDA's review of drug and biological product      proprietary names during development (as early as end-of-     phase 2) and during FDA's review of a marketing application:       1. Proprietary Name Review Performance Goals During Drug      Development       a. Review 90% of proprietary name submissions filed within      180 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of tentative acceptance      or non-acceptance.       b. If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the      sponsor can request reconsideration by submitting a written      rebuttal with supporting data or request a meeting within 60      days to discuss the initial decision (meeting package      required).       c. If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the      above review performance goals also would apply to the      written request for reconsideration with supporting data or      the submission of a new proprietary name.       d. A complete submission is required to begin the review      clock.       2. Proprietary Name Review Performance Goals During      Application Review       a. Review 90% of NDA/BLA proprietary name submissions filed      within 90 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of tentative      acceptance/non-acceptance.       b. A supplemental review will be done meeting the above      review performance goals if the proprietary name has been      submitted previously (IND phase after end-of-phase 2) and has      received tentative acceptance.       c. If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the      sponsor can request reconsideration by submitting a written      rebuttal with supporting data or request a meeting within 60      days to discuss the initial decision (meeting package      required).       d. If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the      above review performance goals apply to the written request      for reconsideration with supporting data or the submission of      a new proprietary name.       e. A complete submission is required to begin the review      clock.     Major Dispute Resolution       1. Procedure:       For procedural or scientific matters involving the review      of human drug applications and supplements (as defined in      PDUFA) that cannot be resolved at the signatory authority      level (including a request for reconsideration by the      signatory authority after reviewing any materials that are      planned to be forwarded with an appeal to the next level),      the response to appeals of decisions will occur within 30      calendar days of the Center's receipt of the written appeal.       2. Performance goal: 90% of such answers are provided      within 30 calendar days of the Center's receipt of the      written appeal.       3. Conditions:       a. Sponsors should first try to resolve the procedural or      scientific issue at the signatory authority level. If it      cannot be resolved at that level, it should be appealed to      the next higher organizational level (with a copy to the      signatory authority) and then, if necessary, to the next      higher organizational level.       b. Responses should be either verbal (followed by a written      confirmation within 14 calendar days of the verbal      notification) or written and should ordinarily be to either      grant or deny the appeal.       c. If the decision is to deny the appeal, the response      should include reasons for the denial and any actions the      sponsor might take to persuade the Agency to reverse its      decision.       d. In some cases, further data or further input from others      might be needed to reach a decision on the appeal. In these      cases, the ``response'' should be the plan for obtaining that      information (e.g., requesting further information from the      sponsor, scheduling a meeting with the sponsor, scheduling      the issue for discussion at the next scheduled available      advisory committee (AC).       e. In these cases, once the required information is      received by the Agency (including any advice from an AC), the      person to whom the appeal was made, again has 30 calendar      days from the receipt of the required information in which to      either grant or deny the appeal.       f. Again, if the decision is to deny the appeal, the      response should include the reasons for the denial and any      actions the sponsor might take to persuade the Agency to      reverse its decision.       g. N.If the Agency decides to present the issue to an AC      and there are not 30 days before the next scheduled AC, the      issue will be presented at the following scheduled committee      meeting to allow conformance with AC administrative      procedures.     Clinical Holds       1. Procedure:       The Center should respond to a sponsor's complete response      to a clinical hold within 30 days of the Agency's receipt of      the submission of such sponsor response.       2. Performance goal:       90% of such responses are provided within 30 calendar days      of the Agency's receipt of the sponsor's response.     Special Protocol Question Assessment and Agreement       1. Procedure:       Upon specific request by a sponsor (including specific      questions that the sponsor desires to be answered), the      Agency will evaluate certain protocols and issues to assess      whether the design is adequate to meet scientific and      regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor.       a. The sponsor should submit a limited number of specific      questions about the protocol design and scientific and      regulatory requirements for which the sponsor seeks agreement      (e.g., is the dose range in the carcinogenicity study      adequate, considering the intended clinical dosage; are the      clinical endpoints adequate to support a specific efficacy      claim).       b. Within 45 days of Agency receipt of the protocol and      specific questions, the Agency will provide a written      response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment      of the protocol and answers to the questions posed by the      sponsor. If the Agency does not agree that the protocol      design, execution plans, and data analyses are adequate to      achieve the goals of the sponsor, the reasons for the      disagreement will be explained in the response.       c. Protocols that qualify for this program include:      carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols, and Phase 3      protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary      basis of an efficacy claim. For such Phase 3 protocols to      qualify for this comprehensive protocol assessment, the      sponsor must have had an end-of-Phase 2/pre-Phase 3 meeting      with the review division so that the division is aware of the      developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed      and the questions being answered.       d. N.For products that will be using Subpart E or      Subpart H development schemes, the Phase 3 protocols      mentioned in this paragraph should be construed to mean those      protocols for trials that will form the primary basis of an      efficacy claim no matter what phase of drug development in      which they happen to be conducted.       e. If a protocol is reviewed under the process outlined      above and agreement with the Agency is reached on design,      execution, and analyses and if the results of the trial      conducted under the protocol substantiate the hypothesis of      the protocol, the Agency agrees that the data from the      protocol can be used as part of the primary basis for      approval of the product. The fundamental agreement here is      that having agreed to the design, execution, and analyses      proposed in protocols reviewed under this process, the Agency      will not later alter its perspective on the issues of design,      execution, or analyses unless public health concerns      unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this      process are evident.       2. Performance goal:       90% of special protocol assessments and agreement requests      completed and returned to sponsor within the timeframe.       3. Reporting:       The Agency will track and report the number of original      special protocol assessments and resubmissions per original      special protocol assessment.     Meeting Management Goals       Formal PDUFA meetings between sponsors and FDA consist of      Type A, B, B(EOP), and C meetings. These meetings are further      described below.       Type A meetings are those meetings that are necessary for      an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed      (i.e., a ``critical path'' meeting) or to address an      important safety issue. Post-action meetings requested within      three months after an FDA regulatory action other than      approval (i.e., issuance of a complete response letter) will      also generally be considered Type A meetings.       Type B meetings include pre-IND meetings and pre-NDA/BLA      meetings, while Type B (EOP) meetings are reserved for      certain End-of-Phase 1 meetings (i.e. for 21 CFR Part 312      Subpart E or 21 CFR Part 314 Subpart H or similar products)      and End-of-Phase 2/pre-Phase 3 meetings. Meetings regarding      REMS or postmarketing requirements that occur outside the      context of the review of a marketing application will also      generally be considered Type B meetings.       A Type C meeting is any other type of meeting.       1. Responses to Meeting Requests       a. Procedure: FDA will notify the requester in writing of      the date, time, and place for the meeting, as well as      expected Center participants following receipt of a formal      meeting request. Table 3 below indicates the timeframes for      FDA's response to a meeting request.                                 TABLE 3------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                         Response Time                     Meeting Type                       (calendar days)------------------------------------------------------------------------A....................................................                 14B....................................................                 21B(EOP)...............................................                 14C....................................................                 21------------------------------------------------------------------------       i. For any type of meeting, the sponsor may request a      written response to its questions rather than a face-to-face      meeting, videoconference or teleconference. FDA will review      the request and make a determination on whether a written      response is appropriate or whether a face-to-face meeting,      videoconference, or teleconference is necessary. If a written      response is deemed appropriate, FDA will notify the requester      of the date it intends to send the written response in the[[Page S4740]]     Agency's response to the meeting request. This date will be      consistent with the timeframes specified in Table 4 below for      the specific meeting type.       ii. For pre-IND and Type C meetings, while the sponsor may      request a face-to-face meeting, the Agency may determine that      a written response to the sponsor's questions would be the      most appropriate means for providing feedback and advice to      the sponsor. When it is determined that the meeting request      can be appropriately addressed through a written response,      FDA will notify the requester of the date it intends to send      the written response in the Agency's response to the meeting      request. This date will be consistent with the timeframes      specified in Table 4 below for the specific meeting type.       b. Performance Goal: FDA will respond to meeting requests      and provide notification within the response times noted in      Table 3 for 90% of each meeting type.       2. Scheduling Meetings       a. Procedure: FDA will schedule the meeting on the next      available date at which all applicable Center personnel are      available to attend, consistent with the component's other      business; however, the meeting should be scheduled consistent      with the type of meeting requested. Table 4 below indicates      the timeframes for the scheduled meeting date following      receipt of a formal meeting request, or in the case of a      written response, the timeframes for the Agency to send the      written response. If the requested date for any meeting type      is greater than the specified timeframe, the meeting date      should be within 14 calendar days of the requested date.                                 TABLE 4------------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Meeting Scheduling or Written              Meeting Type                        Response Time------------------------------------------------------------------------A......................................  30 calendar days from receipt                                          of meeting requestB......................................  60 calendar days from receipt                                          of meeting requestB(EOP).................................  70 calendar days from receipt                                          of meeting requestC......................................  75 calendar days from receipt                                          of meeting request------------------------------------------------------------------------       b. Performance goal: 90% of meetings are held within the      timeframe for each meeting type, and 90% of written responses      are sent within the timeframe for each meeting type.       3. Meeting Background Packages       The timing of the Agency's receipt of the sponsor      background package for each meeting type (including those      meetings for which a written response will be provided) is      specified in Table 5 below.                                 TABLE 5------------------------------------------------------------------------              Meeting Type                Receipt of Background Package------------------------------------------------------------------------A......................................  At the time of the meeting                                          requestB......................................  30 calendar days before the                                          date of the meeting or                                          expected written responseB(EOP).................................  50 calendar days before the                                          date of the meeting or                                          expected written response*C6.....................................  47 calendar days before the                                          date of the meeting or                                          expected written response*------------------------------------------------------------------------* If the scheduled date of a Type B(EOP) or C meeting is earlier than  the timeframes specified in Table 4, the meeting background package  will be due no sooner than 6 calendar days and 7 calendar days  following the response time for Type B(EOP) and C meetings specified  in Table 3, respectively.       4. Preliminary Responses to Sponsor Questions       a. Procedure: The Agency will send preliminary responses to      the sponsor's questions contained in the background package      no later than five calendar days before the meeting date for      Type B(EOP) and C meetings.       b. Performance goal: 90% of preliminary responses to      questions for Type B(EOP) meetings are issued by FDA no later      than five calendar days before the meeting date.       5. Sponsor Notification to FDA       Not later than three calendar days following the sponsor's      receipt of FDA's preliminary responses for a Type B(EOP) or C      meeting, the sponsor will notify FDA of whether the meeting      is still needed, and if it is, the anticipated agenda of the      meeting given the sponsor's review of the preliminary      responses.       6. Meeting Minutes       a. Procedure: The Agency will prepare minutes that will be      available to the sponsor 30 calendar days after the meeting.      The minutes will clearly outline the important agreements,      disagreements, issues for further discussion, and action      items from the meeting in bulleted form and need not be in      great detail. Meeting minutes are not required if the Agency      transmits a written response for any meeting type.       b. Performance goal: 90% of minutes are issued within 30      calendar days of the date of the meeting.       7. Conditions       For a meeting to qualify for these performance goals:       a. A written request must be submitted to the review      division.       b. The written request must provide:       i. A brief statement of the purpose of the meeting and the      sponsor's proposal for either a face-to-face meeting or a      written response from the Agency;       ii. A listing of the specific objectives/outcomes the      requester expects from the meeting;       iii. A proposed agenda, including estimated times needed      for each agenda item;       iv. A listing of planned external attendees;       v. A listing of requested participants/disciplines      representative(s) from the Center with an explanation for the      request as appropriate; and       vi. The date that the meeting background package will be      sent to the Refer to Table 5 for timeframes for the      Agency's receipt of background packages.       c. The Agency concurs that the meeting will serve a useful      purpose (i.e., it is not premature or clearly unnecessary).      However, requests for a Type B or B(EOP) meeting will be      honored except in the most unusual circumstances.       8. Guidance       FDA will publish revised draft guidance on formal meetings      between FDA and sponsors no later than September 30, 2018.     Enhancing Regulatory Science and Expediting Drug          Development       To ensure that new and innovative products are developed      and available to patients in a timely manner, FDA will build      on the success of the FDA's regulatory science program that      included advancing the science of meta-analysis      methodologies, advancing the use of biomarkers and      pharmacogenomics, enhancing communications between FDA and      sponsors during drug development, and advancing the      development of drugs for rare diseases. The extension and      continuation of this work will encompass further evaluation      and enhancement of FDA-sponsor communications, ensuring the      sustained success of the breakthrough therapy program,      establishing early consultations between FDA and sponsors on      the use of new surrogate endpoints as the primary basis for      product approval, advancing rare disease drug development,      advancing the development of combination products, and      exploring the use of real world evidence for use in      regulatory decision-making.       1. Promoting Innovation Through Enhanced Communication      Between FDA and Sponsors During Drug Development       FDA's philosophy is that timely interactive communication      with sponsors during drug development is a core Agency      activity to help achieve the Agency's mission to facilitate      the conduct of efficient and effective drug development      programs, which can enhance public health by making new safe      and effective drugs available to the American public in a      timely manner. Accordingly, FDA will maintain dedicated drug      development communication and training staffs in CDER and      CBER, focused on enhancing communication between FDA and      sponsors during drug development.       One function of the staff is to serve as a liaison that      will facilitate general and, in some cases, specific      interactions between sponsors and each The liaison      will serve as a point of contact for sponsors who have      general questions about drug development or who need      clarification on which review division to contact with their      questions. The liaison will also serve as a secondary point      of contact in each Center for sponsors who are encountering      challenges in communication with the review team for their      IND (e.g., in instances when they have not received a      response from the review team to a simple or clarifying      question or referral to the formal meeting process within 30      days of the sponsor's initial request). In such cases, the      liaison will work with the review team and the sponsor to      facilitate resolution of the issue.       The second function of the staff is to provide ongoing      training to the review organizations on best practices in      communication with sponsors. The content of training      includes, but is not limited to, FDA's philosophy regarding      timely interactive communication with sponsors during drug      development as a core Agency activity, best practices for      addressing sponsor requests for advice and timely      communication of responses through appropriate mechanisms      (e.g., teleconferences, secure email, or when questions are      best addressed through the formal meetings process), and the      role of the liaison staff in each Center in facilitating      communication between the review staff and sponsor community,      including the staff's role in facilitating resolution of      individual communication requests. The staff will also      collaborate with sponsor stakeholders (e.g., through      participation in workshops, webinars, and other meetings) to      communicate FDA's philosophy and best practices regarding      communication with sponsors during drug development.       To continue to enhance timely interactive communication      with sponsors during drug development in PDUFA VI, FDA will      do the following:       a. Independent FDA will contract with an      independent third party to assess current practices of FDA      and sponsors in communicating during drug development. The      statement of work for this effort will be published for      public comment prior to beginning the assessment. The third      party will be expected to separately engage both FDA staff      and individual sponsors through contractor-led interviews as      part of the assessment. Due to the significant volume of FDA-     sponsor interactions in a given year, the assessment will be      based on a random subset of drug development programs      identified by IND number. The third party will identify best      practices and areas for improvement in communication by FDA      review staff and sponsors. FDA will publish the final report      of the assessment on FDA's website no later than the end of      FY 2020.       b. Public FDA will convene a public workshop by      the end of March 2021 to discuss the findings of the      independent assessment, including anonymized, aggregated      feedback from sponsors and FDA review teams resulting from      the contractor interviews.[[Page S4741]]       c. FDA will consider the third party's      recommendations for best practices in communication and      update the current draft or final guidance on ``Best      Practices for Communication Between IND Sponsors and FDA      During Drug Development'' if appropriate. If FDA determines      that the guidance should be updated, based on the      recommendations of the third party and the feedback received      from the public workshop, FDA will update the guidance no      later than one year following the public workshop.       2. Ensuring Sustained Success of Breakthrough Therapy      Program       Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite      the development and review of drug and biological products,      alone or in combination, for serious or life-threatening      diseases or conditions when preliminary clinical evidence      indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial      improvement over existing therapies. A breakthrough therapy      designation includes the features of the fast track program,      intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development      program, and an organizational commitment by FDA involving      senior managers. Additional resources will enable the Agency      to continue to work closely with sponsors throughout the      breakthrough therapy designation, development, and review      processes. Both FDA and the regulated industry are committed      to ensuring the expedited development and review of      innovative therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases      or conditions by investing additional resources into the      breakthrough therapy program.       3. Early Consultation on the Use of New Surrogate Endpoints       FDA and industry believe that early consultation between      review teams and sponsors is important for development      programs where the sponsor intends to use a biomarker as a      new surrogate endpoint that has never been previously used as      the primary basis for product approval in the proposed      context of use. Early consultation in the drug development      program allows the review team to consult with FDA senior      management to evaluate the sponsor's proposal before      providing advice regarding the proposed biomarker as a new      surrogate endpoint to support accelerated or traditional      approval. Requests to engage with FDA on this topic will be      considered a Type C meeting request. The purpose of this      meeting is to discuss the feasibility of the surrogate as a      primary endpoint, and identify any gaps in knowledge and how      they might be addressed. The outcome of this meeting may      require further investigation by the sponsor and discussion      and agreement with the agency before the surrogate endpoint      could be used as the primary basis for product approval. To      qualify for this consultation, these Type C meeting requests      must be accompanied by the complete meeting background      package at the time the request is made that includes      preliminary human data indicating impact of the drug on the      biomarker at a dose that appears to be generally tolerable.      The remaining meeting procedures as described in Section I.H      of this document will apply.       4. Advancing Development of Drugs for Rare Diseases       FDA will build on the success of the Rare Disease Program      (RDP) in CDER and CBER by continuing to advance and      facilitate the development and timely approval of drugs and      biologics for rare diseases, including rare diseases in      children. The Rare Disease Program staff in CDER will be      integrated into review teams for rare disease development      programs and application review to provide their unique      expertise on flexible and feasible approaches to studying and      reviewing such drugs to include, for example, innovative use      of biomarkers, consideration of non-traditional clinical      development programs, use of adaptive study designs,      evaluation of novel endpoints, application of new approaches      to statistical analysis, and appropriate use of FDA's      expedited development and review programs (i.e., Fast Track,      Breakthrough, Priority Review, and Accelerated Approval).      CBER, through its Rare Disease Program Staff, will also      ensure that its review offices consider such flexible and      feasible approaches in review.       The RDP staff will also continue to provide training to all      CDER and CBER review staff related to development, review,      and approval of drugs for rare diseases as part of the      reviewer training core curriculum. The objective of      the training will be to familiarize review staff with the      challenges associated with rare disease applications and      strategies to address these challenges; to promote best      practices for review and regulation of rare disease      applications; and to encourage flexibility and scientific      judgment among reviewers in the review and regulation of rare      disease drug development and application review. The training      will also emphasize the important role of the RDP staff as      members of the core review team to help ensure consistency of      scientific and regulatory approaches across applications and      review teams.       RDP staff will continue to engage in outreach to industry,      patient groups, and other stakeholders to provide training on      FDA's The staff will continue to foster collaborations      in the development of tools (e.g., patient reported outcome      measures) and data (e.g., natural history studies) to support      development of drugs for rare diseases. In addition, the      staff will also facilitate interactions between stakeholders      and FDA review divisions to increase awareness of FDA      regulatory programs and engagement of patients in FDA's      regulatory decision-making.       FDA will include updates on the activities and success of      the RDP in the PDUFA annual performance report to include,      for example, the number of training courses offered and staff      trained, the number of review programs where RDP staff      participated as core team members, and metrics related to      engagement with external stakeholders. FDA will also continue      to include information on rare disease approvals in its      annual reports on innovative drug approvals, including      utilization of expedited programs and regulatory flexibility      and appropriate comparative metrics to non-rare disease      innovative approvals.       5. Advancing Development of Drug-Device and Biologic-Device      Combination Products Regulated by CBER and CDER       a. FDA will develop staff capacity and capability across      the medical product centers and the Office of Combination      Products (OCP) to more efficiently, effectively, and      consistently review and respond to submissions that include      combination products. These staff will advance the      development of combination products by providing combination      product expertise as part of the core review team as      applicable, and through promoting best practices for review      of combination products. The additional capacity will include      staff who will focus on review of cGMP, engineering aspects,      human factors and bridging study protocols and study reports,      and labeling, to include instructions-for-use materials.       b. FDA will streamline the process for combination product      review and improve the Agency's ability to assess workload      and allocate resources to the review of combination products.       i. By no later than December 31, 2017, FDA will complete a      lean process mapping for combination product review in order      to inform changes to review work flow to improve the inter-     center consultation process.       ii. By no later than December 31, 2017, FDA will begin      tracking workload and timelines for cross-center      consultations to enable appropriate allocation of resources      and regularly assess the progress of combination product      review throughout PDUFA       iii. By no later than September 30, 2018, for each      component within FDA that is consulted to participate in      review of combination products, FDA will outline in      appropriate internal documents the Agency's process for      resolving internally any scientific or regulatory issues that      arise, as well as a commitment for the medical product      centers and OCP to coordinate and complete reviews and      related activities when consulted in timelines set forth by      PDUFA and other published documents (e.g., the GRMP guidance      and GRMP MAPP).       c. FDA will establish Manuals of Policies and Procedures      (MAPPs) and Standard Operating Policy and Procedures (SOPPs)      to promote efficient, effective, and consistent combination      product development and review. The documents will describe      processes and procedures for conducting review of combination      products, including the expectations for consultation of      internal experts outside the reviewing FDA will      describe the responsibilities of staff in each Center and      Office, expectations for core review team members and for      other consultant staff in activities and meetings related to      the combination product development program and application      review. FDA will define the key terms to be used by staff in      review of combination products to foster clear communication      within FDA and to regulated industry. The topic areas and      expected completion dates of these documents are specified      below:       i. Human Factors Assessments (March 31, 2019)       ii. Quality assessment of combination products, including      coordination of facility inspections (September 30, 2019)       iii. Patient-oriented labeling, including instructions-for-     use materials for those drug-device and biologic-device      combination products regulated by CBER and CDER (September      30, 2019)       d. By no later than December 31, 2018, FDA will make      available on FDA's website key points of contact in OCP and      the medical product centers for combination product review.      FDA agrees to maintain and update this information      periodically.       e. FDA will establish submission procedures for Human      Factors protocols no later than September 30, 2018. Beginning      in FY 2019, FDA will establish timelines to review and      provide comment on the protocols for Human Factors studies of      combination drug-device and biologic-device products within      60 days.       i. Procedure for review of human factors protocols for      combination products: Upon specific request by a sponsor      (including specific questions that the sponsor desires to be      answered) consistent with the steps below, the Agency will      evaluate human factors protocols and issues to assess whether      the design is adequate to meet scientific and regulatory      requirements identified by the sponsor.       (1) The sponsor should submit a limited number of specific      questions about the human factors protocol design and      scientific and regulatory requirements for which the sponsor      seeks agreement (e.g., are the study participant groups      appropriate to represent intended users, is the study      endpoint adequate, are the critical tasks that should be      evaluated appropriately identified).       (2) Within 60 days of Agency receipt of the protocol and      specific questions, the Agency will provide a written      response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment      of[[Page S4742]]     the protocol and answers to the questions posed by the      sponsor. If the Agency does not agree that the protocol      design, execution plans, and data analyses are adequate to      achieve the goals of the sponsor, the reasons for the      disagreement will be explained in the response.       (3) Performance goals for FDA will be phased in, starting      in FY 2019 as follows:       a. By FY 2019, review 50% of human factors protocol      submissions within 60 days and provide sponsor with written      comments.       b. By FY 2020, review 70% of human factors protocol      submissions within 60 days and provide sponsor with written      comments.       c. By FY 2021, review 90% of human factors protocol      submissions within 60 days and provide sponsor with written      comments.       f. By no later than December 31, 2018, FDA will begin staff      training related to development, review, and approval of      drug-device and biologic-device combination products reviewed      in CDER and The training will be provided to all CDER,      CBER, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and      Office of Combination Products (OCP) staff, and will be part      of the reviewer training core curriculum. The key purposes of      this training include familiarizing review staff with the      regulatory requirements and challenges associated with      combination product applications and strategies to address      these challenges; promoting best practices for review and      regulation of combination products regulated by CDER and      CBER, and helping ensure coordination and consistent      approaches within the Centers in the review and regulation of      combination product applications. The training will also      emphasize the role of various experts in the Centers as      members of the review team and OCP's roles and      responsibilities in order to help ensure consistency of      scientific and regulatory approaches across applications and      review teams.       g. FDA will contract with an independent third party to      assess current practices for combination drug product review.      This study will focus on areas where the needs for inter-     center coordination and consistent approaches are greatest,      including such areas as the Request-for-Designation, cGMPs/     facilities topics, human factors and bridging studies, and      labeling. The contractor will be expected to engage both FDA      staff and individual sponsors as part of the assessment. The      assessment will be based on a randomly selected subset of      combination products in various phases of development. The      assessment will identify best practices and areas for      improvement by FDA review staff and sponsors in the      submission and review of combination products for      consideration by both FDA and sponsors. FDA will publish the      final report of the assessment on FDA's website no later than      the end of FY 2020. FDA will consider the assessment findings      regarding best practices on the part of FDA review staff and      sponsors in any updates to relevant documents such as MAPPs,      SOPPs, and submission procedures for human factors protocols,      and in the review and submission of Combination Product      applications.       h. By the end of FY 2019, FDA will publish draft guidance      or update previously published guidance issued by the medical      product centers and OCP for review staff and industry      describing considerations related to drug-device and      biologic-device combination product on the topics noted      below. The draft guidance(s) will be finalized by the end of      FY 2022.       i. Bridging studies, including the bridging of data from      combination products that employ different device components      for the same drug or biologic and the same device component      across different drugs and biologics.       ii. Patient-oriented labeling (e.g., instructions-for-use).       6. Enhancing Use of Real World Evidence for Use in      Regulatory Decision-Making       As we participate in the current data revolution, it is      important that FDA consider the possibilities of using so-     called ``real world'' data as an important tool in evaluating      not only the safety of medications but also their      effectiveness. To accomplish this will require an      understanding of what questions to ask, including how such      data can be generated and used appropriately in product      evaluation, what the challenges are to appropriate generation      and use of these data, and how to address such challenges.      Towards this end, FDA will do the following:       a. By no later than the end of FY 2018, FDA will complete      one or more public workshop(s) with key stakeholders,      including patients, biopharmaceutical companies, and      academia, to gather input into issues related to Real World      Evidence (RWE) use in regulatory decision-making. The      workshop(s) should address, among other things, the following      topics:       Benefits to patients, regulators, and biopharmaceutical      companies of RWE in regulatory decision making;       RWE availability, quality, and access challenges, and      approaches to mitigate these;       Methodological approaches for the collection, analysis, and      communication of RWE; and       Appropriate contexts of use of RWE in regulatory decision-     making regarding effectiveness.       b. By no later than the end of FY 2019, FDA will initiate      (or fund by contract), appropriate activities (e.g., pilot      studies or methodology development projects) aimed at      addressing key outstanding concerns and considerations in the      use of RWE for regulatory decision making.       c. By no later than the end of FY 2021, considering      available input, such as from activities noted above, FDA      will publish draft guidance on how RWE can contribute to the      assessment of safety and effectiveness in regulatory      submissions, for example in the approval of new supplemental      indications and for the fulfillment of postmarketing      commitments and requirements. FDA will work toward the goal      of publishing a revised draft or final guidance within 18      months after the close of the public comment period.     Enhancing Regulatory Decision Tools to Support Drug          Development and Review       1. Enhancing the Incorporation of the Patient's Voice in      Drug Development and Decision-Making       To facilitate the advancement and use of systematic      approaches to collect and utilize robust and meaningful      patient and caregiver input that can more consistently inform      drug development and, as appropriate, regulatory decision      making, FDA will conduct the following activities during      PDUFA VI:       a. FDA will strengthen the staff capacity to facilitate      development and use of patient-focused methods to inform drug      development and regulatory decisions. This staff, composed      primarily of clinical, statistical, psychometric, and health      outcomes research expertise, will be integrated into review      teams as core members of the team during drug development and      application review where the sponsor intends to use patient      input or clinical outcome assessment (COAs) such as patient-     reported outcomes (PROs) as part of the development program.      A core responsibility of the staff will be to engage patient      stakeholders and provide timely development-phase      consultations to sponsors developing new tools to collect      patient and caregiver input. This additional capacity is      expected to advance the science of COA development and      analysis, and the staff will also support the public      qualification activities for       b. FDA will develop a series of guidance documents to focus      on approaches and methods to bridge from initial patient-     focused drug development meetings, like those piloted under      PDUFA V, to fit-for-purpose tools to collect meaningful      patient and caregiver input for ultimate use in regulatory      decision making. Prior to the issuance of each guidance, as      part of the development, FDA will conduct a public workshop      to gather input from the wider community of patients, patient      advocates, academic researchers, expert practitioners,      industry, and other stakeholders.       i. By the end of FY 2018, FDA will publish a draft guidance      describing approaches to collecting comprehensive and      representative patient and caregiver input on burden of      disease and current therapy. The guidance will address topics      including: standardized nomenclature and terminologies,      methods to collect meaningful patient input throughout the      drug development process, and methodological considerations      for data collection, reporting, management, and analysis.       ii. By the end of FY 2019, FDA will publish a draft      guidance describing processes and methodological approaches      to development of holistic sets of impacts that are most      important to patients. The guidance will address topics      including: methods for sponsors, patient organizations,      academic researchers, and expert practitioners to develop and      identify what are most important to patients in terms of      burden of disease, burden of treatment, and other critical      aspects. The guidance will address how patient input can      inform drug development and review processes, and, as      appropriate, regulatory decision making.       iii. By the end of FY 2020, FDA will publish a draft      guidance describing approaches to identifying and developing      measures for an identified set of impacts (e.g., burden of      disease and treatment), which may facilitate collection of      meaningful patient input in clinical trials. The guidance      will address methods to measure impacts in a meaningful way,      and identify an appropriate set of measure(s) that matter      most to patients.       iv. By the end of FY 2021, FDA will publish a draft      guidance on clinical outcome assessments, which, when final,      will, as appropriate, revise or supplement the 2009 Guidance      to Industry on Patient-Reported Outcome The draft      guidance will also address technologies that may be used for      the collection, capture, storage, and analysis of patient      perspective information. The guidance will also address      methods to better incorporate clinical outcome assessments      into endpoints that are considered significantly robust for      regulatory decision-making.       v. For each of the above, FDA will work toward the goal of      publishing a revised draft or final guidance within 18 months      after the close of the public comment period on the draft      guidance.       c. FDA will create and maintain a repository of publicly      available tools on FDA's website as a resource for      stakeholders. The repository will also include FDA's clinical      outcome assessment compendium, patient-focused drug      development meeting resources, and ongoing efforts on      patient-focused drug development.       d. As appropriate, FDA will revise existing MAPPs and SOPPs      to include suggested approaches for incorporating an      increased patient focus in other on-going or planned FDA      public meetings (e.g., FDA scientific workshops). In      addition, as appropriate, FDA will develop and implement      staff training related to processes, tools, and methodologies      described in this section.[[Page S4743]]       e. By the end of FY 2019, FDA will conduct a public      workshop, through a qualified third party, with the primary      purpose of gathering ideas and experiences of the patient and      caregiver community and their recommendations on approaches      and best practices that would enhance patient engagement in      clinical trials. The meeting may also gather input from      sponsors, academic researchers, and expert practitioners. The      meeting will result in a published report on proceedings and      recommendations from discussions at the meeting.       2. Enhancing Benefit-Risk Assessment in Regulatory      Decision-Making       FDA will further the agency's implementation of structured      benefit-risk assessment, including the incorporation of the      patient's voice in drug development and decision-making, in      the human drug review program through the following      commitments to be accomplished during PDUFA VI:       a. By March 31, 2018, FDA will publish an update to the      implementation plan titled ``Structured Approach to Benefit-     Risk Assessment in Drug Regulatory Decision-Making.'' The      update will include a report on the progress made during      PDUFA V and a plan for continued implementation during FYs      2018-2022.       b. By the end of FY 2019, FDA will convene and/or      participate in, at least one meeting, conducted through a      qualified third party, to gather industry, patient,      researcher, and other stakeholder input on key topics. This      would include applying the benefit-risk framework throughout      the human drug lifecycle, including best approaches to      communicating FDA's benefit-risk assessment.       c. By the end of FY 2020, FDA will publish a draft guidance      on benefit-risk assessments for new drugs and biologics. This      guidance will:       i. Articulate FDA's decision-making context and framework      for benefit-risk assessment, illustrating the application of      the benefit-risk framework throughout the human drug      lifecycle, using a case study approach, if appropriate.       ii. Discuss appropriate interactions between a sponsor and      FDA during drug development to understand the therapeutic      context (i.e., the severity of disease that represents the      targeted indication and the extent of unmet medical need in      the target population) regarding regulatory decisions for the      product at the various stages of drug development and      evaluation.       iii. Discuss appropriate approaches to communicate to the      public FDA's thinking on a product's benefit-risk assessment,      such as through product-specific discussions using the      benefit-risk framework at AC meetings.       d. Beginning in FY 2021, FDA will conduct an evaluation of      the implementation of the benefit-risk framework in the human      drug review program. This evaluation will assess how      reviewers across the organization apply the benefit-risk      framework and identify best practices in use of the benefit-     risk framework. The evaluation of the benefit-risk framework      implementation conducted in PDUFA V will serve as a baseline      for this PDUFA VI assessment.       e. As appropriate, FDA will revise relevant MAPPs and SOPPs      to include new approaches that incorporate FDA's benefit-risk      framework into the human drug review program.       3. Advancing Model-Informed Drug Development       To facilitate the development and application of exposure-     based, biological, and statistical models derived from      preclinical and clinical data sources, herein referred to as      ``model-informed drug development'' (MIDD) approaches, FDA      will conduct the following activities during PDUFA VI:       a. FDA will develop its regulatory science and review      expertise and capacity in MIDD approaches. This staff will      support the highly-specialized evaluation of model-based      strategies and development efforts.       b. FDA will convene a series of workshops to identify best      practices for Topics will include: (1) physiologically-     based pharmacokinetic modeling; (2) design analysis and      inferences from dose-exposure-response studies; (3) disease      progression model development, including natural history and      trial simulation; and (4) immunogenicity and correlates of      protection for evaluating biological products, including      vaccines and blood products. Each workshop will focus on      current and emerging scientific approaches, including      methodological limitations. FDA will produce a written      summary of the topics discussed in each workshop.       c. Starting in FY 2018, FDA will conduct a pilot program      for MIDD approaches. For sponsors participating in the pilot      program, FDA will grant a pair of meetings specifically      designed for this pilot program, consisting of an initial and      a follow-up meeting on the same drug development issues, to      occur within a span of approximately 120 days. These meetings      will be led by the clinical pharmacology or biostatistical      review components within CDER or       i. FDA will publish a Federal Register Notice announcing      the pilot program and outlining the eligibility criteria and      process for submitting to FDA requests to participate in the      pilot program.       ii. FDA will select 2-4 proposals (e.g., 1-2 per Center)      quarterly each year. FDA will convene an internal review      group to review proposals on a quarterly basis and provide      recommendations on prioritization and selection of proposals      and share knowledge and experience. Program selection will      take into account development programs where clinical data      are limited such that integration across non-traditional      sources may be needed, and for which MIDD can assess      uncertainties about issues such as dosing, duration, and      patient selection in a way that can inform regulatory      decision-making.       iii. Sponsors who do not participate in the pilot will have      an opportunity to interact with the Agency through      traditional channels.       d. By end of FY 2019, FDA will publish draft guidance, or      revise relevant existing guidance, on model-informed drug      development.       e. By end of FY 2021, FDA will develop or revise, as      appropriate, relevant MAPPs or SOPPs, and/or review templates      and training, to incorporate guidelines for the evaluation of      MIDD approaches.       4. Enhancing Capacity to Review Complex Innovative Designs       To facilitate the advancement and use of complex adaptive,      Bayesian, and other novel clinical trial designs, FDA will      conduct the following activities during PDUFA VI:       a. FDA will develop the staff capacity to enable processes      to facilitate appropriate use of these types of methods. This      staff will support the computationally intensive review work      necessary to evaluate complex adaptive, Bayesian, and other      novel clinical trial designs, with a particular focus on      clinical trial designs for which simulations are necessary to      evaluate the operating characteristics.       b. Starting in FY 2018, FDA will conduct a pilot program      for highly innovative trial designs for which analytically      derived properties (e.g., Type I error) may not be feasible,      and simulations are necessary to determine trial operating      characteristics. For INDs in the pilot program, FDA will      grant a pair of meetings specifically designed for this pilot      program, consisting of an initial and follow-up meeting on      the same design, to occur within a span of approximately 120      days. These meetings will be led by the biostatistical review      components within CDER or The opportunity for increased      interaction with the agency will provide better understanding      of the agency's requirements for trial simulations involved      in the use of the pilot study design and allow for iteration      of design modifications, if needed. In return, FDA's ability      to publicly discuss example designs will provide better      clarity on the acceptance of different types of trial designs      that should facilitate their use in future development      programs.       i. FDA will publish a Federal Register Notice announcing      the pilot program, clarifying pilot program eligibility, and      describing the proposal submission and selection process.       ii. FDA will select up to 2 proposals (e.g., 1 per Center)      quarterly each year. FDA will convene an internal review      group to review proposals on a quarterly basis and provide      recommendations on prioritization and selection of proposals      and share knowledge and experience. Program selection will be      prioritized based on trial design features and therapeutic      areas of high unmet need.       iii. To promote innovation in this area, trial designs      developed through the pilot program may be presented by FDA      (e.g., in a guidance or public workshop) as case studies,      including while the drug studied in the trial has not yet      been approved by Before FDA grants the initial meeting,      FDA and the sponsor will agree on the information that FDA      may share publicly in these case studies. Participation in      the pilot program, including such agreement on information      disclosure, will be voluntary and at the discretion of the      sponsor.       iv. FDA may periodically review the progress of the pilot      program and determine whether it is appropriate to adjust any      aspects of the program.       v. Sponsors who do not participate in the pilot will have      an opportunity to interact with the Agency through      traditional channels. The pilot program will not affect FDA's      existing procedures for providing advice on trial designs.       c. By end of 2nd Quarter FY 2018, FDA will convene a public      workshop to discuss various complex adaptive, Bayesian, and      other novel clinical trial designs, with a particular focus      on clinical trial designs for which simulations are necessary      to evaluate the operating characteristics, and the      acceptability of those designs in regulatory decision-making.       d. By end of FY 2018, FDA will publish draft guidance on      complex adaptive (including Bayesian adaptive) trial designs.       e. By end of FY 2020, FDA will develop or revise, as      appropriate, relevant MAPPs, SOPPs and/or review templates      and training to incorporate guidelines on evaluating complex      clinical trial designs that rely on computer simulations to      determine operating characteristics.       5. Enhancing Capacity to Support Analysis Data Standards      for Product Development and Review       To support the enhancement of analysis data standards for      product development and review in the human drug review      program, FDA will conduct the following activities during      PDUFA VI:       a. FDA will develop the staff capacity to efficiently      review and provide feedback to sponsors on the readiness of      submitted analysis data sets and programs for statistical      review. This staff will support pre- and post-submission      discussion of standardized datasets and programs, and      maintain the knowledge of and engage in collaborations about      standards models used in the design, analysis and review of      clinical and non-clinical studies. Examples of these      standards[[Page S4744]]     models could include the Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical      Data (SEND), Clinical Data Acquisition Standards      Harmonization (CDASH), Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM),      and Analysis Data Model (ADaM).       b. In parallel, FDA will improve staff capacity to assist      with FDA development and updating of therapeutic area user      guides (TAUGs) to include the appropriate content for the      analysis data standards used in submission and review.       c. By end of FY 2019, FDA will convene a public workshop to      advance the development and application of analysis data      standards.       d. FDA will collaborate with external stakeholders and      participate in public workshops held by third parties such as      standards development organizations, on development of data      standards, processes, documentation and continuous      improvement of clinical trials and regulatory science.       e. By end of FY 2020, FDA will develop or revise, as      appropriate, relevant guidance, MAPPs, SOPPs and training      associated with submission and utilization of standardized      analysis datasets and programs used in review, and on the      processes, procedures, and responsibilities related to the      receipt, handling, and documentation of submitted analysis      data and programs.       6. Enhancing Drug Development Tools Qualification Pathway      for Biomarkers       To facilitate the enhancement of the drug development tools      qualification pathway for biomarkers, FDA will conduct the      following activities during PDUFA VI:       a. FDA will develop the staff capacity to enhance biomarker      qualification review by increasing base capacity. FDA will      also pilot processes to engage external experts to support      review of biomarker qualification submissions.       b. By the end of FY 2018, FDA will convene a public meeting      to discuss 1) taxonomy for biomarkers used in drug      development, and 2) a framework with appropriate standards      and scientific approaches to support biomarkers under the      taxonomy, including scientific criteria to determine      acceptance of a biomarker qualification submission and      essential elements of a formal biomarker qualification plan.       c. By the end of FY 2018, FDA will publish draft guidance      on proposed taxonomy of biomarker usage and related contexts      of use.       d. By the end of FY 2020, FDA will publish draft guidance      on general evidentiary standards for biomarker qualification      to be supplemented with focused guidance on specific      biomarker uses and contexts.       e. FDA will develop or revise, as appropriate and      necessary, relevant MAPPs and SOPPs on the biomarker      qualification process.       f.

FDA will include in the annual PDUFA Financial Report      information on the Agency's progress in the hiring of new      staff used to support the new initiatives as identified in      Section               DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF TERMS       1. ``Human drug applications'' refers to new drug      applications submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal      Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and biologics license      applications submitted under section 351(a) of the Public      Health Service Act, as defined in the Prescription Drug User      Fee       2. ``Human drug review program'' refers to the activities      to conduct ``the process for the review of human drug      applications,'' as defined in the Prescription Drug User Fee            3. The term ``review and act on'' means the issuance of a      complete action letter after the complete review of a filed      complete application. The action letter, if it is not an      approval, will set forth in detail the specific deficiencies      and, where appropriate, the actions necessary to place the      application in condition for approval.       4. A resubmitted original application is a complete      response to an action letter addressing all identified      deficiencies.       5. Class 1 resubmitted applications are applications      resubmitted after a complete response letter (or a not      approvable or approvable letter) that include the following      items only (or combinations of these items):       a. Final printed labeling       b. Draft labeling       c. Safety updates submitted in the same format, including      tabulations, as the original safety submission with new data      and[[Page S4747]]     changes highlighted (except when large amounts of new      information including important new adverse experiences not      previously reported with the product are presented in the      resubmission)       d. Stability updates to support provisional or final dating      periods       e. Commitments to perform Phase 4 studies, including      proposals for such studies       f. Assay validation data       g. Final release testing on the last 1-2 lots used to      support approval       h. A minor reanalysis of data previously submitted to the      application       i. Other minor clarifying information (determined by the      Agency as fitting the Class 1 category)       j. Other specific items may be added later as the Agency      gains experience with the scheme and will be communicated via      guidance documents to industry       6. Class 2 resubmissions are resubmissions that include any      other items, including any items that would require      presentation to an advisory committee.       7. The performance goals and procedures also apply to      original applications and supplements for human drugs      initially marketed on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis through      an NDA or switched from prescription to OTC status through an      NDA or supplement.       8. As used in this commitment letter, ``regulatory decision      making'' may include, for example, FDA's process for making a      regulatory decision regarding a drug or biological product      throughout the product lifecycle, such as during drug      development, following FDA's review of a marketing      application, including review of proposed labeling for the      product, or in the post-approval period (e.g., FDA's decision      regarding a supplement to an approved application).

The goals letter represents the product of FDA's      discussions with the regulated industry and public      stakeholders, as mandated by The performance and      procedural goals and other commitments specified in this      letter apply to aspects of the biosimilar biological product      review program that are important for facilitating timely      access to safe and effective biosimilar medicines for      patients. FDA is committed to meeting the performance goals      specified in this letter, enhancing management of BsUFA      resources, and ensuring BsUFA user fee resources are      administered, allocated, and reported in an efficient and      transparent manner.       Under BsUFA II, FDA is committed to ensuring effective      scientific coordination and review consistency, as well as      efficient governance and operations across the biosimilar      biological product review program. In addition, FDA is      committed to the principles articulated in the Good Review      Management Principles and Practices (GRMP) guidance,\1\ which      FDA intends to update and apply to the review of biosimilar      and interchangeable products.       FDA and the regulated industry will periodically and      regularly assess the progress of the biosimilar biological      product review program throughout BsUFA This will allow      FDA and the regulated industry to identify emerging      challenges and develop strategies to address these challenges      to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the biosimilar      biological product review program.  ENSURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT                              REVIEW PROGRAM     Review Performance Goals       1.

Review Performance Goal Extensions       a. Major Amendments       i. A major amendment to an original application, supplement      with clinical data, or resubmission of any of these      applications, submitted at any time during the review cycle,      may extend the goal date by three months.       ii. A major amendment may include, for example, a major new      clinical study report; major re-analysis of previously      submitted study(ies); submission of a risk evaluation and      mitigation strategy (REMS) with elements to assure safe use      (ETASU) not included in the original application; or      significant amendment to a previously submitted REMS with      Generally, changes to REMS that do not include ETASU      and minor changes to REMS with ETASU will not be considered      major amendments.       iii. A major amendment to a manufacturing supplement      submitted at any time during the review cycle may extend the      goal date by two months.       iv. Only one extension can be given per review cycle.       v. Consistent with the underlying principles articulated in      the GRMP guidance, FDA's decision to extend the review clock      should, except in rare circumstances, be limited to occasions      where review of the new information could address outstanding      deficiencies in the application and lead to approval in the      current review cycle.[[Page S4748]]       b. Inspection of Facilities Not Adequately Identified in an      Original Application or Supplement       i. All original applications and supplements are expected      to include a comprehensive and readily located list of all      manufacturing facilities included or referenced in the      application or supplement. This list provides FDA with      information needed to schedule inspections of manufacturing      facilities that may be necessary before approval of the      original application or supplement.       ii. If, during FDA's review of an original application or      supplement, the Agency identifies a manufacturing facility      that was not included in the comprehensive and readily      located list, the goal date may be extended.       1. If FDA identifies the need to inspect a manufacturing      facility that is not included as part of the comprehensive      and readily located list in an original application or      supplement with clinical data, the goal date may be extended      by three months.       2. If FDA identifies the need to inspect a manufacturing      facility that is not included as part of the comprehensive      and readily located list in a manufacturing supplement, the      goal date may be extended by two months.     Program for Enhanced Review Transparency and Communication          for Original 351(k) BLAs       To promote transparency and communication between the FDA      review team and the applicant, FDA will apply the following      model (``the Program'') to the review of all original      Biologics License Applications (BLAs) submitted under section      351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (``351(k) BLAs''),      including applications that are resubmitted following a      Refuse-to-File decision, received from October 1, 2017,      through September 30, 2022. The goal of the Program is to      promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the first cycle      review process and minimize the number of review cycles      necessary for approval, ensuring that patients have timely      access to safe, effective, and high quality biosimilar and      interchangeable biological products.       The standard approach for the review of original 351(k)      BLAs is described in this section. However, the FDA review      team and the applicant may discuss and reach mutual agreement      on an alternative approach to the timing and nature of      interactions and information exchange between the applicant      and FDA, i.e., a Formal Communication Plan for the review of      the original 351(k) The Formal Communication Plan may      include elements of the standard approach (e.g., a mid-cycle      communication or a late-cycle meeting) as well as other      interactions that sometimes occur during the review process      (e.g., a meeting during the filing period to discuss the      application, i.e., an ``application orientation meeting'').      If appropriate, the Formal Communication Plan should specify      those elements of the Program that FDA and the sponsor agree      are unnecessary for the application under review. If the      review team and the applicant anticipate developing a Formal      Communication Plan, the elements of the plan should be      discussed and agreed to at the pre-submission meeting (see      Section I.B.1) and reflected in the meeting minutes. The      Formal Communication Plan may be reviewed and amended at any      time based on the progress of the review and the mutual      agreement of the review team and the applicant. For example,      the review team and the applicant may mutually agree at any      time to cancel future specified interactions in the Program      (e.g., the late-cycle meeting) that become unnecessary (e.g.      because previous communications between the review team and      the applicant are sufficient). Any amendments made to the      Formal Communication Plan should be consistent with the goal      of an efficient and timely first cycle review process and not      impede the review team's ability to conduct its review.       The remainder of this Section I.describes the parameters      that will apply to FDA's review of applications in the            1. Pre-submission meeting: The applicant is strongly      encouraged to discuss the planned content of the application      with the appropriate FDA review division at a BPD Type 4      (pre-351(k) BLA) meeting. This meeting will be attended by      the FDA review team, including appropriate senior FDA staff.       a. The BPD Type 4 (pre-351(k) BLA) meeting should be held      sufficiently in advance of the planned submission of the      application to allow for meaningful response to FDA feedback      and should generally occur not less than 2 months prior to      the planned submission of the application.       b. In addition to FDA's preliminary responses to the      applicant's questions, other potential discussion topics      include preliminary discussions regarding the approach to      developing the content for REMS, where applicable, patient      labeling (e.g., Medication Guide and Instructions For Use)      and, where applicable, the development of a Formal      Communication These discussions will be summarized at      the conclusion of the meeting and reflected in the FDA      meeting minutes.       The FDA and the applicant will agree on the content of a      complete application for the proposed indication(s) at the      pre-submission meeting. The FDA and the applicant may also      reach agreement on submission of a limited number of      application components not later than 30 calendar days after      the submission of the original application. These submissions      must be of a type that would not be expected to materially      impact the ability of the review team to begin its review.      These agreements will be summarized at the conclusion of the      meeting and reflected in the FDA meeting minutes.       i. Examples of application components that may be      appropriate for delayed submission include; stability      updates, the final audited report of a preclinical study      (e.g., toxicology) where the final draft report is submitted      with the original application, or a limited amount of the      data from an assessment of a single transition from the      reference product to the proposed biosimilar biological      product, where applicable.       ii. Major components of the application (e.g., the complete      analytical similarity assessment, the complete study report      of a comparative clinical study or the full study report of      necessary immunogenicity data) are expected to be submitted      with the original application and are not subject to      agreement for late submission.       2. Original application submission: Applications are      expected to be complete, as agreed between the FDA review      team and the applicant at the BPD Type 4 (pre-351(k) BLA)      meeting, at the time of original submission of the      application. If the applicant does not have a BPD Type 4      (pre-351(k) BLA) meeting with FDA, and no agreement exists      between FDA and the applicant on the contents of a complete      application or delayed submission of certain components of      the application, the applicant's submission is expected to be      complete at the time of original submission.       a. All applications are expected to include a comprehensive      and readily located list of all clinical sites and      manufacturing facilities included or referenced in the      application.       b. Any components of the application that FDA agreed at the      pre-submission meeting could be submitted after the original      application are expected to be received not later than 30      calendar days after receipt of the original application.       c. Incomplete applications, including applications with      components that are not received within 30 calendar days      after receipt of the original submission, will be subject to      a Refuse-to-File decision.       d. The following parameters will apply to applications that      are subject to a Refuse-to-File decision and are subsequently      filed over protest:       i. The original submission of the application will be      subject to the review performance goal as described in      Section I.A.1.a.       ii. The application will not be eligible for the other      parameters of the Program (e.g., mid-cycle communication,      late-cycle meeting).       iii. FDA generally will not review amendments to the      application during any review cycle. FDA also generally will      not issue information requests to the applicant during the      agency's review.       iv. The resubmission goal described in Section I.A.1.b will      not apply to any resubmission of the application following an      FDA complete response action. Any such resubmission will be      reviewed as available resources permit.       e. Since applications are expected to be complete at the      time of submission, unsolicited amendments are expected to be      rare and not to contain major new information or analyses.      Review of unsolicited amendments, including those submitted      in response to an FDA communication of deficiencies, will be      handled in accordance with the GRMP guidance. This guidance      includes the underlying principle that FDA will consider the      most efficient path toward completion of a comprehensive      review that addresses application deficiencies and leads      toward a first cycle approval when possible.       3. Day 74 Letter: FDA will follow existing procedures      regarding identification and communication of substantive      review issues identified during the initial filing review to      the applicant in the ``Day 74 letter.'' If no substantive      review issues were identified during the filing review, FDA      will so notify the applicant. FDA's filing review represents      a preliminary review of the application and is not indicative      of deficiencies that may be identified later in the review      cycle.       For applications subject to the Program, the timeline for      this communication will be within 74 calendar days from the      date of FDA receipt of the original submission. The planned      timeline for review of the application included in the Day 74      letter for applications in the Program will include:       a. the planned date for the internal mid-cycle review      meeting,       b. preliminary plans on whether to hold an Advisory      Committee (AC) meeting to discuss the application,       c. a target date for communication of feedback from the      review division to the applicant regarding proposed labeling      and any postmarket requirements or postmarket commitments the      Agency will be requesting.       4. Review performance goals: For original 351(k) BLA      submissions that are filed by FDA under the Program, the      BsUFA review clock will begin at the conclusion of the 60      calendar day filing review period that begins on the date of      FDA receipt of the original submission. The review      performance goals for these applications are as follows:       a. Review and act on 90 percent of original 351(k) BLA      submissions within 10 months of the 60 day filing date.       5. Mid-Cycle Communication: The FDA Regulatory Project      Manager (RPM), and other appropriate members of the FDA      review team (e.g., Cross Discipline Team Leader (CDTL)), will      call the applicant, generally within 2 weeks following the      Agency's internal mid-cycle review meeting, to provide the[[Page S4749]]     applicant with an update on the status of the review of their      application. An agenda will be sent to the applicant prior to      the mid-cycle communication. Scheduling of the internal mid-     cycle review meeting will be handled in accordance with the      GRMP guidance. The RPM will coordinate the specific date and      time of the telephone call with the applicant.       The update should include any significant issues identified      by the review team to date, any information requests, and      information regarding major concerns with the following:       a. The analytical similarity data, including the potential      relevance of any issues (e.g. data analysis issues or      potential clinical impact of observed analytical      differences), intended to support a demonstration that the      proposed biosimilar biological product is highly similar to      the reference product.       b. The data intended to support a demonstration of no      clinically meaningful differences, including discussion of      any immunogenicity issues.       c. The data intended to support a demonstration of      interchangeability.       d. CMC issues.       In addition, the update should include preliminary review      team thinking regarding the content of the proposed REMS,      where applicable, proposed date(s) for the late-cycle      meeting, updates regarding plans for the AC meeting (if an AC      meeting is anticipated), and other projected milestone dates      for the remainder of the review cycle.       6. Late-Cycle and Advisory Committee Meetings: A meeting      will be held between the FDA review team and the applicant to      discuss the status of the review of the application late in      the review cycle. Late-cycle meetings will generally be face-     to-face meetings; however, the meeting may be held by      teleconference if FDA and the applicant agree. Since the      application is expected to be complete at the time of      submission, FDA intends to complete primary and secondary      reviews of the application in advance of the planned late-     cycle meeting.       a. FDA representatives at the late-cycle meeting are      expected to include the signatory authority for the      application, review team members from appropriate      disciplines, and appropriate team leaders and/or supervisors      from disciplines for which substantive issues have been      identified in the review to date.       b. For applications that will be discussed at an Advisory      Committee (AC) meeting, the following parameters apply:       i. FDA intends to convene AC meetings no later than 2      months prior to the BsUFA goal date. The late-cycle meeting      will occur not less than 12 calendar days before the date of      the AC meeting.       ii. FDA intends to provide final questions for the AC to      the sponsor and the AC not less than 2 calendar days before      the AC meeting.       iii. Following an AC meeting, FDA and the applicant may      agree on the need to discuss feedback from the committee for      the purpose of facilitating the remainder of the review. Such      a meeting will generally be held by teleconference without a      commitment for formal meeting minutes issued by the agency.       c. For applications that will not be discussed at an AC      meeting, the late-cycle meeting will generally occur not      later than 3 months prior to the BsUFA goal date.       d. Late-Cycle Meeting Background Packages: The Agency      background package for the late-cycle meeting will be sent to      the applicant not less than 10 calendar days before the late-     cycle meeting. The package will consist of any discipline      review (DR) letters issues to date, a brief memorandum from      the review team outlining substantive application issues      (e.g., deficiencies identified by primary and secondary      reviews), the Agency's background package for the AC meeting      (incorporated by reference if previously sent to the      applicant), potential questions and/or points for discussion      for the AC meeting (if planned) and the current assessment of      the content of proposed REMS or other risk management      actions, where applicable.       e. Late-Cycle Meeting Discussion Topics: Potential topics      for discussion at the late-cycle meeting include:       i. major deficiencies identified to date;       ii. analytical similarity data, including the potential      relevance of any issues (e.g. data analysis issues or      potential clinical impact of observed analytical      differences), intended to support a demonstration that the      proposed biosimilar biological product is highly similar to      the reference product;       iii. data intended to support a demonstration of no      clinically meaningful differences, including discussion of      any immunogenicity issues;       iv. data intended to support a demonstration of      interchangeability;       v. CMC issues;       vi. inspectional findings identified to date;       vii. issues to be discussed at the AC meeting (if planned);       viii. current assessment of the content of proposed REMS or      other risk management actions, where applicable;       ix. information requests from the review team to the      applicant; and additional data or analyses the applicant may      wish to submit.       With regard to submission of additional data or analyses,      the FDA review team and the applicant will discuss whether      such data will be reviewed by the Agency in the current      review cycle and, if so, whether the submission will be      considered a major amendment and trigger an extension of the      BsUFA goal date.       7. Inspections: FDA's goal is to complete all GCP, GLP, and      GMP inspections for applications in the Program within 10      months of the date of original receipt of the application.      This will allow 2 months at the end of the review cycle to      attempt to address any deficiencies identified by the      inspections.       8. Assessment of the Program: The Program described in this      Section I.B shall be evaluated to determine its impact on the      efficiency and effectiveness of the first review cycle for      biosimilar biological products. The assessment shall be      conducted by an independent contractor with expertise in      assessing the quality and efficiency of biopharmaceutical      development and regulatory review programs. The statement of      work for this effort will be published for public comment      prior to beginning the assessment. The assessments will occur      continuously throughout the course of the       Aspects and other measures of the Program that will be      assessed by the independent contractor include, but are not      limited to the following:        adherence by the applicant and FDA to the current GRMP      guidance or the GRMP guidance as updated in accordance with      Section I.D, as applicable        completeness and quality of the submitted application        number of unsolicited amendments submitted by the      applicant        timing and adequacy of Day 74 letters        conduct of the mid-cycle communication        any DR letters issued        late-cycle meeting background package        conduct of the late-cycle meeting        time to approval        percentage of applications that are approved during the      first review cycle        percentage of application reviews that are extended due to      a major amendment        number of review cycles for applications that are      ultimately approved        time to resubmission for applications that receive a      complete response in the first review cycle       This assessment will also include a de-identified analysis      of the issues typically discussed during the mid-cycle      communication and the late-cycle meeting and the ability of      the additional FDA-applicant communications to (a) achieve      resolution of these issues during the remainder of the review      clock, or (b) allow the applicant to better prepare for a      resubmission of the application. Following an FDA regulatory      action, the independent contractor will conduct separate      interviews of the applicant and the FDA review team to      understand each party's perspectives on the review of the      application, including whether issues were or should have      been identified at the BPD meetings to facilitate application      review.       An interim and final assessment of the Program will be      published for public comment, with each report followed by a      public meeting during which public stakeholders may present      their views on the success of the Program to date, including      the ability of the Program to help ensure that patients have      timely access to safe, effective, and high quality biosimilar      biological products. During each public meeting, FDA and the      independent contractor will discuss the findings of the      interim assessment, including anonymized aggregated feedback      from sponsors and FDA review teams resulting from independent      contractor interviews. FDA will discuss any issues identified      to date including any proposed plans to improve the      likelihood of the Program's success.       a. Interim Assessment: An interim assessment of the Program      will be published by December 31, 2020, and FDA will hold a      public meeting by March 31, 2021.       b. Final Assessment: A final assessment of the Program will      be published by June 30, 2022, and FDA will hold a public      meeting by September 30, 2022.     First Cycle Review Management for Supplements with          Clinical Data       1. Notification of Issues Identified during the Filing      Review       a. Performance Goal: For supplements with clinical data,      FDA will report substantive review issues identified during      the initial filing review to the applicant by letter.       b. The timeline for such communication will be within 74      calendar days from the date of FDA receipt of the supplement.       c. If no substantive review issues were identified during      the filing review, FDA will so notify the applicant.       d. FDA's filing review represents a preliminary review of      the application and is not indicative of deficiencies that      may be identified later in the review cycle.       e. FDA will notify the applicant of substantive review      issues prior to or on the goal date for 90% of applications.       2. Notification of Planned Review Timelines       a. Performance Goal: For supplements with clinical data,      FDA will inform the applicant of the planned timeline for      review of the application. The information conveyed will      include a target date for communication of feedback from the      review division to the applicant regarding proposed labeling,      postmarketing requirements, and postmarketing commitments the      Agency will be requesting.       b. The planned review timeline will be included with the      notification of issues identified during the filing review,      within 74 calendar days from the date of FDA receipt of the      original supplement.       c. The planned review timelines will be consistent with the      GRMP guidance.       d. The planned review timeline will be based on the      supplement as submitted.[[Page S4750]]       e. FDA will inform the applicant of the planned review      timeline for 90% of all supplements with clinical data.       f. In the event FDA determines that significant      deficiencies in the supplement preclude discussion of      labeling, postmarketing requirements, or postmarketing      commitments by the target date identified in the planned      review timeline (e.g., significant safety concern(s), need      for a new study(ies) or extensive re-analyses of existing      data before approval), FDA will communicate this      determination to the applicant in accordance with GRMPs and      no later than the target date. In such cases the planned      review timeline will be considered to have been met.      Communication of FDA's determination may occur by letter,      teleconference, facsimile, secure e-mail, or other expedient      means.       g. To help expedite the development of biosimilar      biological products, communication of the deficiencies      identified in the supplement may occur through issuance of a      DR letter(s) in advance of the planned target date for      initiation of discussions regarding labeling, postmarketing      requirements, and postmarketing commitments the Agency may      request.       f. If the applicant submits a major amendment(s) (refer to      Section I.A.5.a for additional information on major      amendments) and the review division chooses to review such      amendment(s) during that review cycle, the planned review      timeline initially communicated (under Section I.C.2.a and b)      will generally no longer be applicable. Review of unsolicited      amendments, including those submitted in response to an FDA      communication of deficiencies, will be handled in accordance      with the GRMP guidance. This guidance includes the underlying      principle that FDA will consider the most efficient path      toward completion of a comprehensive review that addresses      supplement deficiencies and leads toward a first cycle      approval when possible.     Guidance       FDA and industry share a commitment to ensuring an      efficient and effective first cycle review process for all      applications subject to the BsUFA program. This commitment is      consistent with the principles articulated in the GRMP      guidance, which FDA applies to the review of biosimilar and      interchangeable products. FDA will update the GRMP guidance      during BsUFA II to ensure that it encompasses all review      activities for biosimilar and interchangeable products,      including principles regarding notification to applicants      regarding issues identified during FDA's initial review of      the application, principles regarding FDA's notification to      applicants regarding planned review timelines, and the      importance of internal review timelines that govern aspects      of biosimilar and interchangeable product review that are not      part of BsUFA performance goals. FDA will publish a revised      draft guidance for public comment no later than the end of FY      2018. FDA will work toward the goal of publishing a revised      draft or final guidance within 18 months after the close of      the public comment period.     Review of Proprietary Names to Reduce Medication Errors       To enhance patient safety, FDA is committed to various      measures to reduce medication errors related to look-alike      and sound-alike proprietary names and such factors as unclear      label abbreviations, acronyms, dose designations, and error      prone label and packaging design. The following performance      goals apply to FDA's review of biosimilar biological product      proprietary names during the biosimilar biological product      development (BPD) phase and during FDA's review of a      marketing application:       1. Proprietary Name Review Performance Goals During The BPD      Phase       a. Review 90% of proprietary name submissions filed within      180 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of tentative acceptance      or non-acceptance.       b. If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the      sponsor can request reconsideration by submitting a written      rebuttal with supporting data or request a meeting within 60      days to discuss the initial decision (meeting package      required).       c. If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the      above review performance goals also would apply to the      written request for reconsideration with supporting data or      the submission of a new proprietary name.       d. A complete submission is required to begin the review      clock.       2. Proprietary Name Review Performance Goals During      Application Review       a. Review 90% of biosimilar biological product proprietary      name submissions filed within 90 days of receipt. Notify      sponsor of tentative acceptance/non-acceptance.       b. A supplemental review will be done meeting the above      review performance goals if the proprietary name has been      submitted previously (during the BPD phase) and has received      tentative acceptance.       c. If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the      sponsor can request reconsideration by submitting a written      rebuttal with supporting data or request a meeting within 60      days to discuss the initial decision (meeting package      required).       d. If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the      above review performance goals apply to the written request      for reconsideration with supporting data or the submission of      a new proprietary name.       e. A complete submission is required to begin the review      clock.     Major Dispute Resolution       1. Procedure: For procedural or scientific matters      involving the review of biosimilar biological product      applications and supplements (as defined in BsUFA) that      cannot be resolved at the signatory authority level      (including a request for reconsideration by the signatory      authority after reviewing any materials that are planned to      be forwarded with an appeal to the next level), the response      to appeals of decisions will occur within 30 calendar days of      the Center's receipt of the written appeal.       2. Performance goal: 90% of such responses are provided      within 30 calendar days of the Center's receipt of the      written appeal.       3. Conditions:       a. Sponsors should first try to resolve the procedural or      scientific issue at the signatory authority level. If it      cannot be resolved at that level, it should be appealed to      the next higher organizational level (with a copy to the      signatory authority) and then, if necessary, to the next      higher organizational level.       b. Responses should be either verbal (followed by a written      confirmation within 14 calendar days of the verbal      notification) or written and should ordinarily be to either      grant or deny the appeal.       c. If the decision is to deny the appeal, the response      should include reasons for the denial and any actions the      sponsor might take to persuade the Agency to reverse its      decision.       d. In some cases, further data or further input from others      might be needed to reach a decision on the appeal. In these      cases, the ``response'' should be the plan for obtaining that      information (e.g., requesting further information from the      sponsor, scheduling a meeting with the sponsor, scheduling      the issue for discussion at the next scheduled available      advisory committee).       e. In these cases, once the required information is      received by the Agency (including any advice from an advisory      committee), the person to whom the appeal was made, again has      30 calendar days from the receipt of the required information      in which to either deny or grant the appeal.       f. Again, if the decision is to deny the appeal, the      response should include the reasons for the denial and any      actions the sponsor might take to persuade the Agency to      reverse its decision.       g. Note: If the Agency decides to present the issue to an      advisory committee and there are not 30 days before the next      scheduled advisory committee, the issue will be presented at      the following scheduled committee meeting to allow      conformance with advisory committee administrative      procedures.     Clinical Holds       1. Procedure: The Center should respond to a sponsor's      complete response to a clinical hold within 30 days of the      Agency's receipt of the submission of such sponsor response.       2. Performance goal: 90% of such responses are provided      within 30 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the      sponsor's response.     Special Protocol Question Assessment and Agreement       1. Procedure: Upon specific request by a sponsor (including      specific questions that the sponsor desires to be answered),      the Agency will evaluate certain protocols and related issues      to assess whether the design is adequate to meet scientific      and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor.       a. The sponsor should submit a limited number of specific      questions about the protocol design and scientific and      regulatory requirements for which the sponsor seeks agreement      (e.g., are the clinical endpoints adequate to assess whether      there are clinically meaningful differences between the      proposed biosimilar biological product and the reference      product).       b. Within 45 days of Agency receipt of the protocol and      specific questions, the Agency will provide a written      response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment      of the protocol and answers to the questions posed by the      sponsor. If the Agency does not agree that the protocol      design, execution plans, and data analyses are adequate to      achieve the goals of the sponsor, the reasons for the      disagreement will be explained in the response.       c. Protocols that qualify for this program include any      necessary clinical study or studies to prove biosimilarity      and/or interchangeability (e.g., protocols for      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies, protocols for      comparative clinical studies that will form the primary basis      for demonstrating that there are no clinically meaningful      differences between the proposed biosimilar biological      product and the reference product, and protocols for clinical      studies intended to support a demonstration of      interchangeability). For such protocols to qualify for this      comprehensive protocol assessment, the sponsor must have had      a BPD Type 2 or 3 Meeting, as defined in section I.I, below,      with the review division so that the division is aware of the      developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed      and the questions being answered.       d. If a protocol is reviewed under the process outlined      above, and agreement with the Agency is reached on design,      execution, and analyses, and if the results of the trial      conducted under the protocol substantiate the hypothesis of      the protocol, the Agency agrees that the data from the      protocol can be used as part of the primary basis for      approval of the product. The fundamental agreement here is      that having agreed to the design, execution, and analyses      proposed in[[Page S4751]]     protocols reviewed under this process, the Agency will not      later alter its perspective on the issues of design,      execution, or analyses unless public health concerns      unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this      process are evident.       2. Performance goal: 90% of special protocols assessments      and agreement requests completed and returned to sponsor      within 45 days.       3. Reporting: The Agency will track and report the number      of original special protocol assessments and resubmissions      per original special protocol assessment.     Meeting Management Goals       Formal BsUFA meetings between sponsors and FDA consist of      Biosimilar Initial Advisory and BPD Type 1-4 meetings. These      meetings are further described below.        A Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meeting is an initial      assessment limited to a general discussion regarding whether      licensure under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service      Act may be feasible for a particular product, and, if so,      general advice on the expected content of the development      program. Such term does not include any meeting that involves      substantive review of summary data or full study reports.        A BPD Type 1 Meeting is a meeting which is necessary for      an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed      (e.g. meeting to discuss clinical holds, dispute resolution      meeting), a special protocol assessment meeting, or a meeting      to address an important safety issue.        A BPD Type 2 Meeting is a meeting to discuss a specific      issue (e.g., proposed study design or endpoints) or questions      where FDA will provide targeted advice regarding an ongoing      biosimilar biological product development program. Such term      may include substantive review of summary data, but does not      include review of full study reports.        A BPD Type 3 Meeting is an in depth data review and advice      meeting regarding an ongoing biosimilar biological product      development program. Such term includes substantive review of      full study reports, FDA advice regarding the similarity      between the proposed biosimilar biological product and the      reference product, and FDA advice regarding additional      studies, including design and analysis.        A BPD Type 4 Meeting is a pre-submission meeting to      discuss the format and content of a complete application for      an original biosimilar biological product application under      the Program or supplement submitted under 351(k) of the PHS      The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the format and      content of the planned submission and other items, including      identification of those studies that the sponsor is relying      on to support a demonstration of biosimilarity or      interchangeability, discussion of any potential review issues      identified based on the information provided, identification      of the status of ongoing or needed studies to adequately to      address the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), acquainting      FDA reviewers with the general information to be submitted in      the marketing application (including technical information),      and discussion of the best approach to the presentation and      formatting of data in the marketing application.       1. Response to Meeting Requests       a. Procedure: FDA will notify the requester in writing of      the date, time, and place for the meeting, as well as      expected Center participants following receipt of a formal      meeting request and background package. Table 1 below      indicates the timeframes for FDA's response to a meeting      request.                                 TABLE 1------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           Response time                      Meeting type                           (calendar                                                               days)------------------------------------------------------------------------Biosimilar Initial Advisory.............................              21BPD Type 1..............................................              14BPD Type 2-4............................................              21------------------------------------------------------------------------       For Biosimilar Initial Advisory and BPD Type 2 meetings,      the sponsor may request a written response to its questions,      rather than a face-to-face meeting, videoconference or      teleconference. If a written response is deemed appropriate,      FDA will notify the requester of the date it intends to send      the written response. This date will be consistent with the      timeframes specified in Table 2 below for the specific      meeting type.       b. Performance Goal: FDA will respond to meeting requests      and provide notification within the response times noted in      Table 1 for 90 percent of each meeting type.       2. Scheduling Meetings       a. Procedure: FDA will schedule the meeting on the next      available date at which all applicable Center personnel are      available to attend, consistent with the component's other      business; however, the meeting should be scheduled consistent      with the type of meeting requested. Table 2 below indicates      the timeframes for FDA to schedule the meeting following      receipt of a formal meeting request and background package,      or in the case of a written response for Biosimilar Initial      Advisory and BPD Type 2 meetings, the timeframes for the      Agency to send the written response. If the requested date      for any meeting type is greater than the specified timeframe,      the meeting date should be within 14 calendar days of the      requested date.

Meeting Minutes       a. Procedure: The Agency will prepare minutes which will be      available to the sponsor 30 calendar days after the meeting.      The minutes will clearly outline the important agreements,      disagreements, issues for further discussion, and action      items from the meeting in bulleted form and need not be in      great detail. Meeting minutes are not necessary if the Agency      transmits a written response for Biosimilar Initial Advisory      and BPD Type 2 meetings.       b. Performance Goal: 90% of minutes are issued within 30      calendar days of the date of the meeting.       5. Conditions: For a meeting to qualify for these      performance goals:       a. A written request and supporting documentation (i.e.,      the background package) must be submitted to the appropriate      review division or office.       b. The request must provide:       i. A brief statement of the purpose of the meeting, the      sponsor's proposal for the type of meeting, and the sponsor's      proposal for a face-to-face meeting, teleconference, or for a      written response (Biosimilar Initial Advisory and BPD Type 2      meetings only);       ii. A listing of the specific objectives/outcomes the      requester expects from the meeting;       iii. A proposed agenda, including estimated times needed      for each agenda item;       iv. A list of questions, grouped by discipline. For each      question there should be a brief explanation of the context      and purpose of the question.       v. A listing of planned external attendees; and       vi. A listing of requested participants/disciplines      representative(s) from the Center with an explanation for the      request as appropriate.       vii. Suggested dates and times (e.g., morning or afternoon)      for the meeting that are within or beyond the appropriate      time frame of the meeting type being requested.       c. The Agency concurs that the meeting will serve a useful      purpose (i.e., it is not premature or clearly unnecessary).      However, requests for BPD Type 2, 3, and 4 Meetings will be      honored except in the most unusual circumstances.       The Center may determine that a different type of meeting      (i.e., Biosimilar Initial Advisory, or BPD Type 1-4) is more      appropriate and it may grant a meeting of a different type      than requested, which may require the payment of a biosimilar      biological product development fee as described in section      744H of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act before the      meeting will be provided. If a biosimilar biological product      development fee is required under section 744H, and the      sponsor does not pay the fee within the time frame required      under section 744H, the meeting will be cancelled. If the      sponsor pays the biosimilar biological product development      fee after the meeting has been cancelled due to non-payment,      the time frame described in[[Page S4752]]     section I.I.1.a will be calculated from the date on which FDA      received the payment, not the date on which the sponsor      originally submitted the meeting request.       Sponsors are encouraged to consult available FDA guidance      to obtain further information on recommended meeting      procedures.       6. Guidance       a.

FDA will      continue to utilize information and recommendations from a      third party assessment of resource capacity planning,      financial analytics, and modernized time reporting for BsUFA      as part of the implementation plan.       2. FDA will staff a resource capacity planning team that      will implement and manage a capacity planning system across      the BsUFA program in BsUFA       3. FDA will obtain through a contract with an independent      accounting or consulting firm an evaluation of options and      recommendations for a new methodology to accurately assess      changes in the resource and capacity needs of the biosimilar      biological product review program. The BsUFA evaluation will      be conducted under the same contract and by the same      independent accounting or consulting firm that will evaluate      options and recommendations for a new methodology to      accurately assess changes in the resource and capacity needs      of the human drug review program in PDUFA The report will      be published no later than end of FY 2020 for public comment.      Upon review of the report and comments, FDA will implement      robust methodologies for assessing resource needs of the      program. This will include the adoption of a new resource      capacity adjustment methodology that accounts for sustained      increases in BsUFA workload.       4. FDA recognizes that revenue generated by the capacity      adjustment will be allocated to and used by organizational      review components engaged in direct review work to enhance      resources and expand staff capacity and capability. FDA will      document in the annual financial report how the capacity      adjustment fee revenues are being utilized.     Financial Transparency and Efficiency       FDA is committed to ensuring BsUFA user fee resources are      administered, allocated, and reported in an efficient and      transparent manner. FDA will conduct activities to evaluate      the financial administration of the BsUFA program to help      identify areas to enhance efficiency. FDA will also conduct      activities to enhance transparency of BsUFA program      resources.       1. FDA will contract with an independent third party to      conduct an evaluation of BsUFA program resource management      during FY 2018 to ensure that BsUFA user fee resources are      administered, allocated, and reported in an efficient and      transparent manner in BsUFA The BsUFA evaluation will be      conducted under the same contract and by the same independent      third party that will conduct an evaluation of the PDUFA      program resource management. The study will include, but is      not limited to, the following areas:       a. Evaluate all components of the BsUFA program resource      planning, request, and allocation process from when FDA      receives the user fee funds through when funds are spent. The      contractor will recommend options to improve the process and      data needed to enhance resource management decisions.       b. Assess how FDA administers BsUFA user fees      organizationally, including, but not limited to, billing,      user fee collection, and execution. The contractor will      recommend options to enhance the efficiency of user fee      administration.       c. Evaluate FDA's existing BsUFA program financial and      administrative oversight and governance functions. Assess      alternative governance models including roles and      responsibilities, organizational location, and personnel      skill sets required. The contractor will recommend options on      the most effective governance model to support the biosimilar      biological product review program.       d.

Management of Carryover Balance       FDA is committed to reducing the carryover balance to no      greater than 21 weeks of the FY 2022 target revenue by the      end of FY 2022. However, if FDA is unable to reduce the      carryover balance to no greater than 21 weeks during the      final year (e.g., over collections in FY 2022 that increase      the carryover balance beyond 21 weeks), FDA will (1) outline      its plan to reduce the carryover balance to no greater than      21 weeks in the FY 2022 BsUFA financial report and (2) update      the BsUFA five-year financial plan.         improving fda hiring and retention of review staff       To speed and improve development of safe and effective      biosimilar biological products[[Page S4753]]     for patients, enhancements to the biosimilar biological      review program require that FDA hire and retain sufficient      numbers and types of technical and scientific experts to      efficiently conduct reviews of 351(k) applications. In order      to strengthen this core function and increase public access      to biosimilar biological products, the FDA will commit to do      the following:     Completion of Modernization of the Hiring System          Infrastructure and Augmentation of System Capacity       1. Complete implementation of FTE-based position management      system capability.       a. FDA will complete development of position management      baseline accounting of all current positions and FTE counts      engaged in the biosimilar biological product review program      for each applicable Center and Office including filled and      vacant positions, a governance structure for on-going      position management that will be accountable to FDA senior      management, and position management policy and guidelines      ratified by FDA senior management, outlining processes for      adding new positions, deleting positions, and changing      established positions.       b. FDA will complete implementation of the new position-     based management system.       2. Complete implementation of an online position      classification system       a. FDA will finalize the establishment of an online      Position Description (PD) library. The library will include      all current well-classified PDs and current standardized      Once operational, any new PDs classified using the on-line      classification tools, and any newly created standardized PDs,      will be stored and accessible within FDA's PD library and      available for FDA-wide use as appropriate.       3. Complete implementation of corporate recruiting       a. For key scientific and technical disciplines commonly      needed across offices engaged in the biosimilar biological      product review program, FDA will complete the transition from      the use of individual vacancy announcements for individual      offices to expanded use of a common vacancy announcement and      certificate of eligible job applicants that can be used by      multiple offices. As a part of this effort, FDA will complete      the transition from use of individual announcements that are      posted for a limited period to common vacancy announcements      with open continuous posting to maximize the opportunity for      qualified applicants to apply for these positions.     Augmentation of Hiring Staff Capacity and Capability       In recognition of the chronic and continuing difficulties      of recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified      Human Resources (HR) staff, FDA will engage a qualified      contractor to provide continuous support throughout BsUFA II      to augment the existing FDA HR staff capacity and      capabilities. The utilization of a qualified contractor will      assist FDA in successfully accomplishing BsUFA II goals for      recruitment and retention of biosimilar biological product      review program staff.     Complete Establishment of a Dedicated Function to Ensure          Needed Scientific Staffing for Human Drug Review          Including for Review of Biosimilar Biological Products       1. Rapid advances in the science and technology of      biosimilar biological product development and manufacturing      require FDA's biosimilar biological product review program      staff to keep pace with science and learn innovative methods      and techniques for review of new therapies. FDA will complete      the establishment of a new dedicated unit within the Office      of Medical Products and Tobacco charged with the continuous      recruiting, staffing, and retention of scientific, technical,      and professional staff for the PDUFA and BsUFA review      programs.       a. The unit will continuously develop and implement      scientific staff hiring strategies and plans, working closely      with the center review offices and the FDA HR office, to meet      discipline-specific hiring commitments and other targeted      staffing needs. It will function as a scientific-focused      recruiter conducting ongoing proactive outreach to source      qualified candidates, and conducting competitive recruiting      to fill vacancies that require top scientific, technical, and      professional talent.       b. The unit will conduct analyses, no less than annually,      of compensation and other factors affecting retention of key      staff in targeted disciplines and provide leadership and      support for agency compensation oversight boards that      currently exist or may be established as needed to ensure      retention of key scientific, technical, and professional      staff.     Set Clear Goals for Biosimilar Biological Product Review          Program Hiring       1. FDA will establish priorities for management of the      metric goals for targeted hires within the biosimilar      biological product review program staff for BsUFA In      particular, FDA will target hiring 15 FTE in FY 2018, to      enhance capacity for biosimilar guidance development,      reviewer training, and timely communication.       2.

9455,topic-id,578,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to celebrate May as National Foster Care I also welcome those currently in and alumni of our foster care system, along with our supporters, who are visiting Capitol Hill today.  Foster Care Month is a very small way to acknowledge the youth that are a part of the system, along with all of those who make an enormous difference in their lives. This month is about improving the foster care system and providing support to the individuals who selflessly make this system work.  The success of our country depends upon the well-being of our youth today. We know, through much social research, that family stability is directly linked to less behavioral and academic problems. We have the duty as a nation to empower all children so they can have the same sense of promise and possibility as any other, regardless of their circumstances.  National Foster Care Month is a time to celebrate the selfless men and women who embrace children in the foster care system and recommit to helping more youth find permanent families so they can, too, experience stability and the freedom to fulfill their limitless potential.  Mr.Speaker, the foster care system has always and will always be near and dear to my heart. My wife, Angie, and I adopted two children, Austin and Jessica, then 8 and 9, respectively, through the foster care system.  The idea that children belong in stable families is not only one of the most bipartisan issues I have the privilege of working on, but it is one that is important to me and dear to me. Nothing is more important to a child's upbringing and long-term success than a loving and stable home.  The bedrock of the American story is a strong and supportive family. We must do everything we can to care for all of our youth so they can be free from harm and set up for success so that they might pen our country's unwritten future.  Today I have the honor of being shadowed for the day by Kimberly Grosse of Omaha, Kim was in foster care for 8 years. Starting off in a group home, she was later placed at Boys Town, where she graduated from high school.  Kim currently works as a communications specialist, dispatching medical EMS helicopters. She also volunteers her time as a court-appointed special advocate for kids currently in the foster care system. Kim, like so many other alumni of the system, pays it forward with her dedicated support. She is a shining example of determination and perseverance in all aspects of her life. I know that this young lady has an extremely bright future ahead.  I also appreciate my colleagues from both sides of the aisle--Representatives Karen Bass, Diane Black, Trent Franks, Jim Langevin, Brenda Lawrence, and Tom Marino--for their leadership in the Foster Care I am grateful to fellow Members who help advocate for this important cause.  Now, let's continue to embrace the spirit that every child matters and continue to work toward providing all of our sons and daughters an equal opportunity to lead productive and fulfilling lives, not limited to anything but their hopes, dreams, imagination, and perseverance. I salute all of those who are supporters of the foster care system.  I also just want to add, I know, firsthand, when you see your foster children grow to be healthy, successful, independent, and loving adults that you gain a tremendous sense of satisfaction and thankfulness.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4511-2.txt,99999999999999,ORDER OF BUSINESS,2017.0,24.0,May
9370,topic-id,477,"Mr.President, today I wish to celebrate the 175th anniversary of Case IH Agriculture and Farm Equipment and to recognize its outstanding commitment and contribution to Wisconsin's economy.  Mr.Jerome Increase Case, born in 1819 in western New York, was well acquainted with agricultural equipment even as a young man. Case provided threshing services to local farms and realized at the young age of 16 that farming techniques needed improvement after witnessing a demonstration of an early threshing machine that could thresh more in one hour than a man could all day. After settling in Wisconsin in the early 1840s, Case build his first thresher-separator in Rochester, WI, but when the town refused to let Case draw electricity from the local mill, Case loaded his invention into a wagon and headed to Racine,  The J.Case Threshing Machine Company was founded in 1842 at a time when Racine's tallest building was the local grain elevator. By 1848, the company was Racine's largest employer. As a true pioneer in the field of agricultural equipment, J.Case manufactured the first steam engine tractor in 1869. The Old 1 is still on display at the Smithsonian Although it was mounted on wheels, it was still drawn by horses. The first self-propelled steam engine followed in 1876.  Case machines were first transported beyond U.borders in 1871 and won first prize at the Paris By 1886, Case became the largest producer of steam engines in the world.  During World War II, the company's plants manufactured aircraft wings, aircraft towing tractors, artillery shells, and doors for the Sherman tank. In fact, the company's 1942 centennial was celebrated 7 years late because of the war.  In 1985, Case IH became the Nation's second-largest farm equipment manufacturer after J.Case purchased the agricultural division of International Harvest and the business legacies of two major equipment companies were united under one company. In 1999, Case IH merged with New Holland Ag to form a parent company, CNH Global, although equipment was still produced under the Case IH name. Since the merger, Case has remained at the forefront of the farming industry, seeking new ways to adapt to the changing trends. In 2010, Case IH created the world's first tractor to meet the tier 4 emissions requirements of the Environmental Protection Case IH Agriculture and Farm Equipment currently works with more than 4,900 dealers and distributes products in more than 160 countries.  As one of Wisconsin's founding manufacturers, Case has been a major contributor to Wisconsin's farming legacy. Over the past 175 years, this proud company has provided jobs for countless Wisconsin families and economic growth for the State I am so proud to represent.  I offer my sincere congratulations to Case leadership and workers as they celebrate 175 years of business, and I wish them the very best for many more years of success in Racine and around the world.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3208-2.txt,1558,PRAYING FOR A FULL RECOVERY TO THOSE INJURED IN BASEBALL TRAGEDY,2017.0,25.0,April

9543,topic-id,1012,"Mr.President, on Monday morning I stood with workers and fellow public officials in Bridgeport, CT, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the L'Ambiance Plaza disaster. Thirty years ago last Sunday, L'Ambiance Plaza collapsed, 28 families lost loved ones, and 22 others were seriously injured in the collapse. Their worlds collapsed as the lift-slab construction used as the device for building L'Ambiance Plaza, in effect, imploded.  The workers were constructing a 16-story apartment building when that disaster happened. The lift-slab construction method used at that site subsequently was banned. It was banned because it was unsafe.  That disaster was preventable, as so many workplace injuries and deaths are preventable. That was a tragedy in the modern American workplace 30 years ago--L'Ambiance It is an urgent and great need for this Nation to confront. L'Ambiance Plaza collapsed, literally, within seconds, and when it was over, the 28 workers who woke up that day and left their homes never came back. Their families, who said good-bye, never saw them again alive. They were victims of workplace dangers that day, but so many others have followed them since.  Those families are still affected, still grieving. One of them spoke at that ceremony on Monday morning, and it provides for many of us the memories of that day when literally hundreds of workers from throughout Connecticut went to that site, digging, often by hand, through the wreckage, trying to find the living survivors. On that day, and every day since, I have sought to increase the safety of our workplaces and avoid those kinds of tragedies. That is why I am here today, because that pledge would be, in my view, inconsistent with voting for the nomination of Alexander Acosta to be Secretary of  I will state at the outset that I commend Mr.Acosta for his record of public service during the Presidency of George Bush, serving as a National Labor Relations Board member and holding two positions at the Department of Justice, as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division and, later, as U.attorney for the Southern District of I want to thank him for his willingness to serve again. I say that in all seriousness, as a former U.attorney myself.  I believe that, as Secretary of Labor, he will have important responsibilities if he is confirmed in the area of enforcement, and I am constrained to oppose his nomination because I believe, 1, that this administration needs a champion, not simply a bystander, and Mr.Acosta has given me no reason at his hearings and in his record to assure me that he will overcome what I see as a bias against enforcement in this administration.  Last month President Trump proposed a budget that guts the Department of The budget admittedly is short on specifics and boasts little more than one page about the agency that is tasked with ensuring the safety of tens of millions of American workers. Let me make clear: It would slash resources at the Department of Labor by 21 percent. That is $2.5 billion. That means 21 percent fewer inspectors, 21 percent fewer investigators, 21 percent less enforcement. That is one-fifth less enforcement, when, in fact, five times more enforcement is appropriate. The budget, although short on details, singled out programs that helped to train workers and employers in ways to ensure avoidance of hazards on the job.  President Trump has proposed the elimination--the zeroing out--of that program. At his confirmation hearing last week, Mr.Acosta demonstrated neither a willingness nor an interest in challenging the budget or the President's priorities, stressing that his soon-to-be boss, President Trump, guides the ship. I find that view and perspective alarming. There is an old saying that budgets are ``moral documents.'' It is a saying frequently repeated, but it has a real meaning when it comes to enforcement of worker safety. It has a real meaning to real people in their lives or loss of lives. It is a matter of life or death. Where you put scarce dollars and resources reveals moral values and moral priorities.  President Trump has put his values on clear display in this budget. He believes in building a wall, a needless show project that he mentioned repeatedly in his budget, but he has given short shrift or no shrift to efforts that protect people who go every day to workplaces where they are in serious jeopardy, and where--as in L'Ambiance Plaza--they can lose their lives. Voting for Mr.Acosta would mean failing to keep that pledge that I believe I made to the families of L'Ambiance, to the workers who lost their lives there, and to countless other workers in danger every day in workplaces that must be made safer--and can be--through vigorous enforcement of rules and laws that exist now and improvement of those laws.  One of the greatest challenges facing our Nation today is fairness in the workplace, particularly fairness in pay for women, fairness concerning pay disparity between men and women, with women making a fraction of what men make for the same work. On this critical issue also, this nominee is silent. On other issues critical to the modern workplace--overtime pay, minimum wage, protecting workers' retirement, fighting discrimination, matters that affect women and minorities more than others--he has said little or nothing, certainly little to indicate that he will be an enforcer of laws that protect minorities and women and others who may be the victims of discrimination.  There is no question that this nominee is far better than the President's first proposed person to fill this job, Andy Puzder, who rightly and fortunately withdrew, but the standard we should use is not whether he is better than his predecessor, who was found wanting even before the vote was taken, but rather whether they can be trusted to protect workers, to enforce rules vigorously and fairly, and to fight for a budget and a set of priorities that are critical to the future of American workers. On that score, unfortunately, I answer this question with a clear ``no,'' and I will vote against this nominee.

A young man took the lives of 6 UCSB students and injured 14 others. That day families were torn apart by a kind of grief that no one should have to ever experience--the loss of a child.  The tragedy in Isla Vista we remember today is once again a reminder of the consequences of inaction by Congress regarding the epidemic of gun violence across our Far too often there are many red flags of someone intending to do harm, but no one can connect the dots.  Today I introduced legislation, with my colleagues Congresswoman Esty and Congressman Beyer, that will allow families and loved ones who see disturbing warning signs the ability to work with law enforcement and the courts so that they may intervene and better prevent acts of violence.  States like California and Connecticut have led the way on important measures to combat gun violence. This bill would encourage other States to adopt these proven preventative measures. The Gun Violence Restraining Order Act would help ensure that family members can go to court to seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily stop someone who poses a threat to themselves or others from purchasing or possessing a gun.  When someone alerts law enforcement and members of their own family that they wish to do harm to themselves or members of the community, as was the case in Isla Vista, it is irresponsible of lawmakers not to give judges and police the ability to intervene.

David's work was a unanimous first-place winner in the annual Congressional Art Competition in Missouri's First Congressional I have been pleased to sponsor this competition in Louis for the last 16 years without interruption and incident.  For those of you who may not know, many other Members of Congress conduct this contest in their districts as well.

We simply provide a public forum for the most talented young artists in our districts to display their winning artwork in the U.Capitol complex. Yet, without cause or reasonable process and after being viewed repeatedly by Members of Congress, congressional staffers, and thousands of visitors without incident or concern, my constituent's winning entry was removed in an act of politically motivated, unconstitutional, retroactive censorship.  That injustice was initiated by pressure from certain alternative-right bloggers and Mr.Eric Bolling, a host on FOX News channel, who created a mean-spirited and factually inaccurate media campaign to improve his ratings on the back of a young man, and to ultimately force the painting to be removed by the Architect of the  After repeated acts of petty theft by renegade Members of Congress who removed the painting without any authorization and after a storm of rightwing media pressure, the Speaker of the House forced the Architect of the Capitol to trample on the rights of my constituent by ruling that this painting, which he had already approved 10 months ago, was retroactively disqualified.  This unwarranted, arbitrary, and unconstitutional act of censorship will not stand. Now, let me be clear: I do not approve or disapprove of this painting. I did not approve or disapprove the concept of the artwork. I did not judge the competition, but the Architect of the Capitol reviewed, approved, and accepted this student's artwork for public display without incident, comment, or concern, just like every other entry that is displayed in this public exhibition.  Only after the most hateful, intolerant, and reckless media campaign, combined with enormous political pressure from the Speaker and other Members, the Architect of the Capitol miraculously traveled back in time to disqualify the very same painting that he had approved 10 months ago.  Perhaps we should advise the National Academy of Sciences of the Architect of the Capitol's newfound ability to bend the space-time continuum in order to retroactively respond to the most extreme voices in the majority so that they could more easily suppress the rights of my young constituent. It did great harm to an innocent young man who tried to do the right thing.  Because of this outrageous act of censorship, David Pulphus has been subjected to the most vile, racist, and hateful attacks on social media and on talk radio. He has also been deprived of the honor of listing his first place victory in the Congressional Art Competition on his resume. He has even been attacked by the Speaker of the House who called his award winning work ``disgusting.''  So on top of depriving David of his First Amendment rights, the majority and the Architect of the Capitol have placed a terrible personal burden on this bright, talented young man. David does not deserve that. That is wrong. That is totally unacceptable, and the Speaker and the Architect of the Capitol should be ashamed of themselves.  This shameful decision also sent a chilling message to young It told young Americans that their views are not valued. Their voices are not respected.

In closing, let me say that the student artist in question, my constituent, David Pulphus, is a great young man. He is academically gifted, artistically talented, and is now a freshman in college. He is doing everything that we encourage young Americans to do to become successful citizens.  His winning entry is a colorful, symbolic representation of the great anger, pain, frustration, and deep deficit in trust for local law enforcement that many young African Americans feel in their hearts. The painting also reflects generations of struggle, sacrifice, abuse of power, and tenuous relationships between minorities and a system of justice that still provides equal justice for some, but not for all.                              {time}  1700  So the larger, much more fundamental question is: Why does this young American feel that way, and what can we do as leaders of a compassionate and just nation to finally remedy that?

9354,topic-id,1005,"Mr.Speaker, I, indeed, also enjoyed the remarks that just preceded me and that Mr.Conyers made and Mr.Clay made concerning this issue.  I rise today in support of art, freedom of expression, freedom of speech, but also Black Lives Matter and police officers who follow the rules, which 98 percent or more do, who treat citizens appropriately and risk their lives to keep us safe. And I mourn each officer that loses their life or is injured in protecting us and having ordered liberty.  But I rise in opposition to censorship, which is anathema to me, and police officers who go beyond the law--that percentage that do--and soil the badge they wear and use deadly force inappropriately, which has occurred too many times sometimes because they just don't react properly in the heat of battle, sometimes for other reasons, too often upon Black people, which does tend to indicate a prejudice that exists in certain people's minds. Black lives do matter, and people haven't recognized that, and we need to.  The removal of David Pulphus' painting from the Cannon tunnel is troubling on many levels. It raises serious questions about Congress' commitment to the First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of expression. We take an oath to support the Constitution and should do so in our actions as well as our words, as well as in our oath.  Benjamin Franklin warned us that freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a free government. When this support is taken away, the constitution of a free society is dissolved.  Secondly, it raises serious questions about censorship. Unfortunately, in my hometown of Memphis, we have a history that is sometimes not so good on particular cases of race and free expression.  That long history of artistic censorship oftentimes related to race as well as sex, and for nearly 3 decades, in the early part of the 20th century, Memphis had a censor, a public censor, appointed by the government named Lloyd He served as the chairman of the Memphis Board of They banned movies. They banned movies like ``Curley'' in the 1940s because it showed White and Black children in school together.  He prevented Memphians from seeing major celebrities like Lena Horne, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Cab Calloway in our local movie theaters. He was a racist. ``Binfordizing'' became a word. Artistic words that were wrong and Congress must be ever mindful of the slippery slope of censorship.  Thirdly, and perhaps most important, this painting raises serious questions about public policy. Congress should be debating questions of public policy, not banning expressions of them.  The events that took place in Ferguson, Missouri, which are well expressed by this painting, were a wake-up call to many in our Nation about police use of deadly force, injustice in our inner cities, and turmoil rising in our inner cities.  Sobering questions about the fairness of our criminal justice system and about race were raised. And a painting such as this that reflects those issues is most appropriate for display in the hallway where these paintings and artworks are shown because it is representative of a major slice of America in that year.  That, more than most other paintings and artworks there, show something that is relevant to what is happening today and has occupied the news in a major way.  For too long, justice has seemed too lacking, and we saw it in Mr.Clay and I have worked together for display of this artwork. I questioned some professors on another issue, lawyers that specialize in First Amendment issues, speech issues in the Judiciary Committee, and to a one they said it appeared to be censorship and was wrong and was violative.  Of course there is some talk that, well, it is government speech and maybe that is different. But you know some of the same people that have opposed this painting are the same people that say the rules should apply to Whatever laws we pass should apply to Congressmen the same as they apply to other people, and we shouldn't have special privileges. But those people decided on their own to exempt a painting they found distasteful which wouldn't have been prohibited anyplace else because of free speech. They violated their own precepts; the same precepts they may be violating today in other rooms where they are discussing a health bill that will exempt them from the health bill sanctions or requirements and not require them, if they live in a State, to not have the essential benefits of the Affordable Care  So I rise today to commend Congressman Clay for his work, to thank him for his work with me and Senator Duckworth on the Police Training and Independent Review Act, which the need for is expressed here in this artwork. That is why it is so important.  This communicates a story. Beauty is wonderful, and a lot of the artwork is photographs and beauty. Places, fine. Content and ideas are more important. It is always more important to have artwork that challenges your mind and makes you think: What is this about?  As I look at this painting and I think about it, sure, there are a couple of police officers--two police officers in particular--in a certain manner of being displayed. But there is a third police officer on the right that is not shown this same way. And if you look at this painting, you can see this painting says: not all police officers are the same. Some are questionable, some aren't. It revolved around a major incident in our city, Louis, Ferguson, but the arch is in there and expresses that well.  This painting should not have been removed. Congressman Clay is right to stand up for the First Amendment and for his constituent.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to help restore this painting to its rightful place in the Cannon tunnel and to allow people to see it and make their own decisions.  Mr.Speaker, I thank you and appreciate being a part of this.  ",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgH2880-3.txt,,"CONDEMNING TERRORIST ATTACKS IN MANCHESTER, UNITED KINGDOM",2017.0,26.0,April

The Lewiston-Auburn club was the 291st to be chartered and is part of the first great wave of expansion that took the Rotary movement from major American cities to smaller communities and to Canada and  It is remarkable that what began as a small group of civic leaders in Chicago in 1905 has grown to a service organization of 1.2 million dedicated members in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. In any language, Rotarians live up to their motto of ``Service Above Self.''  Rotary International is a powerful force for good around the world. The global effort to eradicate polio is considered to be the most successful public health campaign in human history, one that would not be possible without Rotary's commitment. When Rotary launched its PolioPlus program back in 1985, it was described as a ``gift from the 20th century to the 21st.'' It has been just that.  In addition to its strong support for PolioPlus, the Lewiston-Auburn Club is part of a Rotary International effort to make affordable and safe water more widely available in As a result of this effort, a tanker truck was purchased to address this great humanitarian need.  Locally, the Lewiston-Auburn Rotary Club has a special focus on families and children. The club has been a leader in the creation of Lewiston's Universally Accessible Playground, which will provide recreation for all, regardless of physical or developmental limitations. The club also sponsors an annual event to benefit the Autism Society of Maine and awards scholarships to area high-school graduates pursuing higher education.  ``Service Above Self'' has a special meaning to the members of the Lewiston-Auburn The application for membership in Rotary International was signed on March, 21, 1917, by Frank Hulett of On June 6, 1918, Captain Hulett gave his life in the defense of freedom during the World War I Battle of Belleau Wood in Hulett Square in Lewiston, the Frank Hulett VFW Post, and the Lewiston-Auburn Rotary Club all help to preserve the memory of this great hero.  When Paul Harris led the way in founding Rotary International 112 years ago, he said this: ``Whatever Rotary may mean to us, to the world it will be known by the results it achieves.''

To begin with, the painting's removal by the Architect of the Capitol was an infringement on the free speech rights of the artist and on the Congressman, yourself, Mr.Clay, from  The First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that: ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech. . . .

This is true even when such expression may be offensive to many people or to some people.

Congressional Art Competition display in the Cannon  The painting, sponsored by our colleague--Representative William Lacy Clay--had been displayed in the Cannon Tunnel along with more than 400 winners of the Art Competition for nearly 7 months without incident or comment.  And, rather than upholding the artist's right to free expression and Representative Clay's prerogative to sponsor student artwork from his district, the Architect of the Capitol capitulated to political pressure generated by the right-wing media outlets and ratified these Members' acts of vigilante censorship by having the painting permanently removed from the Congressional Art Competition display in the Cannon  This artwork, seemingly inspired by the events in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 and other incidents that sparked tension between police and minority communities, depicts a protest, with two police officers and a young man facing each other in a standoff, all of three which have animalistic features.  In the background, protesters look on and a young man of color appears to be depicted in a crucifixion tableau.  Whatever message one draws from this painting, several things are quite clear.  To begin with, the painting's removal by the Architect of the Capitol was an infringement on the free speech rights of Mr.Pulphus and Representative  The First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.''  And, it is undisputed that the First Amendment's free speech guarantee extends to artistic expression, including visual art.  This is true even when such expression may be deeply offensive to many people.  As the Supreme Court recognized in F.C.v. Pacifica Foundation, the ``fact that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient reason for suppressing it. Indeed, if it is the speaker's opinion that gives offense, that consequence is a reason for according it constitutional protection.''  While the Members who removed Mr.Pulphus's painting may have acted based on their belief that the artwork's viewpoint was offensive, that belief cannot trump the free speech rights of the artist and Representative  Nor does it justify the Architect's removal of the painting in response to pressure from these and other Members who found the painting offensive.  Once the House established the Congressional Art Competition and opened the Cannon Tunnel to display artwork sponsored by each individual Member office, it created a limited public forum.  Having created such a forum, individual House Members and the Architect cannot then constitutionally discriminate against expression within that forum based on the viewpoint expressed.  Yet, that is precisely what happened here.  Unfortunately, the painting's removal was part of a broader pattern of behavior by the Majority to undermine the fundamental right of free expression in the  For instance, in January the House adopted an unconstitutional gag rule that would allow the imposition of fines of up to $2,500 on a Member for using an electronic device to record, post, or live-stream activity on the House floor.  This rule was a thinly-veiled response to the protest undertaken last year by Democratic Members on the House floor with regard to the Majority's failure to consider comprehensive gun reform.  The rule is a direct attack against the Minority's right to political expression and it is clearly intended to stifle the American public's ability to access that expression.  While it is easy to think that these matters concern only one young artist or a group of House Members, every American should be deeply concerned about such kinds of censorship.  Tyranny starts in small ways. Censor a painting here, a poem there. Ban photos in some instances, videos in others.  When such seemingly minor acts go unanswered, it invites more oppressive conduct in the future.  Ensuring freedom requires vigilance and a willingness to push back vigorously against every instance of censorship.  This is why I applaud the federal lawsuit filed by Mr.Pulphus and Representative Clay seeking to vindicate their free speech rights though it is shameful that they were forced to go to court at all.  And, while the trial court incorrectly concluded that the First Amendment does not protect Mr.Pulphus and Representative Clay, I am confident this conclusion will be overturned on appeal.  All Americans must be free to speak truth to power.  Therefore, it is imperative that we draw a line in the sand now, lest we encourage further and even more troubling acts of censorship in the future.

9541,topic-id,813,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to honor the memory of former Congressman Jay Dickey, who passed on April 20. When Jay Dickey roamed the Halls of Congress, you knew there might be mischief afoot--and what merry mischief it was.  Jay was opinionated, colorful, and zany. Now that he has passed, the warm laughter of memories once again echoes in these cold, marble halls as we reflect on his life.  He died last Thursday after a battle with Parkinson's, a battle he fought like every other--with determination and gusto. I, for one, will miss his counsel and friendship, as will the people of Arkansas whom he loved so deeply.  Jay was an Arkansas original. He was born and bred and in the end breathed his last in his hometown of Pine He shared a lot in common with the mighty pines of South He stood tall and proud of his community's heritage. He was a pillar of the community. A lawyer and a businessman, he left his mark as an entrepreneur, starting franchises throughout the State, as an advocate representing the city and later taking on such famous clients as coach Eddie  Unlike the proverbial tree in the forest, now that Jay Dickey has fallen, the whole State has taken notice.  But, of course, a man's accomplishments are only a window into his character. You had to know Jay personally to get a sense of all the fun there was inside him. It was as if his feet had sunk deep into the soil and soaked up all of the Natural State's richness: its humor, its earnestness, and its strip-the-bark-off candor.  I got to know Jay in my first political campaign. We had never met, and I was a political newcomer, but Jay spent many hours getting to know me and ultimately supported my candidacy, which helped to put me on the map.  Of course, Jay shared a lot of candid advice too. After attending one of my early townhalls, Jay and I went to lunch down the road at Cracker I asked him how I did. Jay replied:       Ya did good. Ya did good. But you gotta cut it down some.      Ya see that baked potato there? That's a fully loaded baked      potato--it's got cheese, sour cream, bacon, onions. Your      answers are like that fully loaded baked potato! Make em like      a plain potato.  That is just one of the countless stories that added to his legend.  This was the man who offered a ninth grader a college-level internship because he thought the kid had potential; the man who answered any phone in his office that rang twice, just to keep his staff on their toes; the man whose dog once drove his truck into a radio station in Hampton because he left the truck running during an interview to keep the dog cool, and somehow that dog put it in gear; the man who kept a picture of Jesus on his wall, and who, when meeting a new client, would point to the picture and say: ``Have you met my friend?''  Yes, the first great joy of his life was his faith, but the second great joy was politics. Jay was the first Republican elected to Congress from South Arkansas since He won in 1992, the very same year Arkansas elected our Democratic Governor as  Despite being who the Democrats must have viewed as the most Republican incumbent in the country, he held onto that seat for almost a decade. Arkansans knew good stock when[[Page S2543]]they saw it. He lost only by the narrowest of margins in 2000, with President Bill Clinton campaigning for his opponent, then-State Senator Mike True to form for Jay, he and Mike would become friends after that race, speaking regularly about issues and their faith.  Jay's time in office will not be remembered as a historical oddity, an anomaly, or a one-off because unconventional though it was, it was also a forerunner of things to come. It was an early sign of a coming political realignment, as the small towns that dotted rural America--towns where few people had ever even seen a Republican, never mind voted for one--were starting to cast their votes up and down the ballot for the Grand Old  In other words, Jay Dickey was a trailblazer--or perhaps a bulldozer. He smashed through history and precedent and grooved a path in rough terrain for the rest of us to follow. For that, he has my thanks and the thanks of the people of Arkansas, and for his humorous, quirky, unparalleled example, he has the thanks of the U.Congress, which today is a little sadder for his passing but also a little brighter for his memory.

9419,topic-id,651,"Mr.President, today I wish to mark a wonderful occasion, a birthday that many do not live to celebrate. Today we honor the 95th birthday and wonderful life of Betty Jenel Olsen Carr, born in Kimberly, ID, on August 2, 1922. Her early life was very much what you would expect from rural Idaho in the 1920s, and in many ways, rural life there now still has some of these echoes of a strong work ethic and family values.  Betty grew up with seven siblings in a family that learned self-sufficiency and self-reliance on an 80-acre farm. Edith, Andy, Lamoin, Melba, Phil, Vera, Nina, and Betty lived cozily together with their parents, Hannah Marie Sandberg and Neils Albert Olsen, in a small, white wooden farmhouse that had no electricity or running water when Betty was a child. However, the home did have a black potbelly cast iron stove that kept everyone warm and fed.  Education figured prominently in Betty's goals, as she graduated at the top of her Kimberly High School class, even though she skipped her final year of high school to start college. She fostered her love of reading through editing the school newspaper. She also played flute in the marching band and, improbably, at just 5 feet, 4 inches tall, played forward on the girls basketball team. She headed off to college at what was then called the Southern Branch of the University of Idaho--now Idaho State University--and studied journalism, but most importantly, she followed through on something she said in high school. She had been looking through her older sister's college yearbook and spotted the photo of a handsome young man. She declared, ``When I get to college, I am going to go out with that guy.'' She did indeed--she met and married Taylor Henry Carr a couple of years into college. Taylor served 3 years in World War II, and a family treasure is the love letters the two sent to each other during that difficult time that they were separated by his wartime service.  When Taylor returned home, he completed his education at the medical school at the University of Utah with the help of the GI bill and became a surgeon. Betty and he raised their seven children in Idaho Falls, Each of those children has become remarkable in their own right, contributing to their communities, States, and country --Katherine Ann, Taylor Douglas, Phillip Olsen, Jan Elizabeth, Kenneth Wright, Steven Edward, and Gregory Their home was filled with love, education, and adventure.  From a personal perspective, there has never been a better child psychologist or wiser parent and aunt. Betty is my mother Melba's youngest sister--my beloved Aunt Betty, who was a second mother to me. She understood teenagers in a unique manner and knew just when to encourage me at those times when young people need to hear advice from someone who loves them and is not a parent. Growing up, I always knew I would find welcoming arms and a warm shoulder just a few blocks from my home. Aunt Betty understood that, ultimately, love and the relationship with our loved ones was more important than anything else, and she epitomized that with her acceptance and encouragement of even the craziest ideas. A few years ago, I was delighted to show her around the U.Capitol when she made the long trip from Idaho to Washington, A treasured item on display in my personal office is a photo with her from that trip.  Today Betty, the lifelong lover of reading, is as sharp as ever. At 95, she remains active, interested, and involved. She races through the crossword puzzle, tends her garden and great-grandkids, and never misses exercise class or bridge club. She recently went underwater in a diving bell in I am privileged to claim her as part of my family and honored to recognize her longevity as an Happy, happy birthday.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4762.txt,250,1600,2017.0,2.0,June

9544,topic-id,640,"Mr.President, I wish to oppose the nomination of Alexander Acosta to be Secretary of  I did not come to this decision lightly, but, after closely examining Mr.Acosta's record, I cannot in good conscience vote for his confirmation to be Labor Secretary on behalf of the American people.  The most troubling part of Mr.Acosta's record is how he handled a 2007 sex trafficking case that he oversaw while serving as the U.attorney for the Southern District of In that case, which left many vulnerable victims devastated when it concluded, Mr.Acosta failed to protect underage crime victims who looked to his office to vindicate their rights against billionaire Jeffrey  The case, led by Mr.Acosta's office and the FBI, involved an investigation[[Page S2544]]of Mr.Epstein for his sexual abuse and exploitation of more than 30 underage girls.  It ended with an agreement, negotiated by Mr.Acosta's office, in which Mr.Acosta agreed not to bring Federal charges, including sex trafficking charges, against Mr.Epstein in exchange for his guilty plea to State charges and registration as a sex offender. Thanks to this agreement, Mr.Epstein served a mere 13 months of jail time and avoided serious Federal charges that would have exposed him to lengthy prison sentences.  What troubles me about this case is not just the leniency with which Mr.Epstein was treated, but how the victims themselves were treated.  In 2004, I authored the Crime Victims' Rights Act with then-Senator Kyl because we both saw that victims and their families were too frequently ``ignored, cast aside, and treated as nonparticipants in a critical event in their lives.'' I strongly believe victims have a right to be heard throughout criminal case proceedings.  My concern with how Mr.Acosta handled this case stems from his office's obligations under the Crime Victims' Rights The victims have asserted that Mr.Acosta's office did not provide them with notice of the agreement before it was finalized, nor were they provided with timely notice of Mr.Epstein's guilty plea and sentencing hearings. Worse, throughout the process, the victims were denied the reasonable right to confer with the prosecutors; this flies in the face of the Crime Victims' Rights Act we authored.  I am very concerned that Mr.Acosta's office did not treat the victims ``with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy'' as required by law. Rather, according to the victims, Mr.Acosta's office ``deliberately kept [them] `in the dark' so that it could enter the deal'' without hearing objections. These allegations raise serious concerns.  From his position of immense power and responsibility, Mr.Acosta failed, and the consequences were devastating.  Another deeply troubling aspect of Mr.Acosta's record comes from his tenure when he led the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division from August 2003 to June 2005. According to the Justice Department's inspector general, that office repeatedly used political or ideological tests to hire career civil servants in violation of federal law.  During his confirmation hearing before the HELP Committee, Mr.Acosta himself admitted that discriminatory actions were taken under his supervision and that they should not have happened.  At a time when the public's faith in government institutions is eroding on a daily basis, Mr.Acosta's handling of these high-profile incidents lead me to question his ability to carry out the duties of Labor Secretary with fairness and impartiality.  This doubt is further compounded by statements that Mr.Acosta made during his hearing regarding whether he will exercise independence in upholding and enforcing certain rules and regulations, such as the fiduciary rule and overtime rule to protect workers.  In response to such questions, Mr.Acosta avoided making a commitment to uphold these rules as Secretary of Labor, and I am greatly concerned that he may not look out for the best interests of workers.  All of the issues I have outlined here simply do not allow me, in good faith, to vote in favor of Mr.Acosta's nomination.  Thank you.

The United States of America and this Capitol stand as a symbol of American values and our freedoms. It just so[[Page H2886]]happens I represent a district that contains 2 of the 10 finest museums in America, at Cleveland and We know a little bit about artistic expression.  Here in the Capitol, we have created a place to gather and celebrate our Nation's highest ideals, and first and foremost among these is the right of every citizen to freely express themselves as equal citizens.  A recent act of censorship here at the Capitol placed this American right under threat, and it is important that all Americans think about this and know about it. I speak to say this action cannot be tolerated. I stand with my distinguished colleagues and with the American people to speak out against the removal of David Pulphus' award-winning painting from the United States  There was a famous French artist named Edgar Degas, who said: ``Art is not what you see, but what you make others see.'' Surely, surely, David Pulphus' painting does this. And I support Mr.Pulphus' continued efforts to appeal a preliminary decision by the District of Columbia Federal Circuit Court that rejected his First Amendment legal claims, and that case will move forward.  In May 2016, his extraordinary acrylic painting that reveals deep meaning, which he named Untitled #1, was awarded the prestigious honor to represent Missouri's First Congressional District in the Congressional Arts  I have entered, for three decades, works from my district in this competition; and just like the other 434 pieces selected to represent a congressional district in the annual competition, Untitled #1 was approved and accepted by the Architect of the Capitol for public display inside our  For over 26 weeks, Untitled #1 hung in the underground tunnel between the Capitol and the Cannon House Office For over 180 days there was no controversy. And for more than half a year, citizens and Members of Congress, congressional staff, thousands and thousands of international and national visitors passed by and viewed it with no concern.  But that changed abruptly when, in fact, a Member from the Republican side of the aisle, I think, likely violated the law and pulled it off the wall in the Capitol of the United It didn't belong to him, but he did that. And, I dare say, that gentleman missed the deeper meaning of what this young man has portrayed.  There was an added twist of irony in that the censorship moment occurred 1 day after our national holiday honoring civil rights icon Reverend Martin Luther King,  The censorship sent a woeful and chilling message to our Nation and one that says that our young people's voices and their thoughts are not respected. I say that is un-Their views and experiences and perspectives must be valued.  When we look at what was done, his freedom of expression, even when expressed through a juried competition, is not protected in the top site of liberty's essence, the legislative branch inside the United States Capitol  So Members of Congress have to take a stand. We must demand that the creative contributions of Americans, young and old, in the arts are embraced, including inside this We cannot tolerate actions that directly and unjustly stifle or threaten an artist's artistic point of view. That is what America is all about.  David Pulphus' painting won the honor to represent Missouri's First Congressional District because it reflects an important, compelling message. His work reminds us of the value of the arts in a free society.  The painting was inspired by the civil unrest that occurred in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, and it depicts the racial confrontation that ensued with police after that fatal shooting of the unarmed teen, Michael Brown,  This is a complex work and it does not deserve anyone's rejection. It tells us about ourselves and our society so that we face it fully. And if you look at it, there are serious messages in here that say, ``Stop Killing,'' ``Racism Kills.'' It talks about ``History.''  And if you really look at it, you see that some of those involved in the killing, there is no right side. One of the perpetrators is portrayed as a wolf. It is very interesting to study the deeper meaning. This painting includes challenging images: a man being crucified, wearing a graduation cap, holding the scales of justice.  This is a young man, he is not even 20 years old, thinking about this.  There is a horned beast in a police uniform tangling with a devil with a pointed tail--looks like a wolf--and demonstration signs that read ``History'' and ``Stop Killing.''  Simply put, this commanding work of art from a teenager is a true testament to the power and immeasurable significance of our Nation's young artists who express us.  The debate sparked by its removal from the Capitol is about something larger than the artwork itself. It is about defending our fundamental First Amendment freedom. This right to artistic expression is considered objectionable by a few and applauded by the vast majority of Americans who understand what free expression in this society is about.  Neither the Architect of the Capitol nor a Member of Congress has the right to censor, self-censor citizens based on their political points of view, whether in the name of official decorum or because they find it offensive or because they fail to grasp its deep meaning.  In America, if you do not like a painting you see in a display, you simply move on to the next one. You don't take it down. It doesn't belong to you.  Nevertheless, as a painter myself and citizen who deeply reveres our constitutional rights, I am confident that in this case justice ultimately will prevail and Untitled #1 will soon resume its rightful place inside our Capitol because a young man with this depth of expression is proudly an If it doesn't come back, I fear for the slippery slope the Architect of the Capitol has begun, and it is not worthy of us as  I want to thank Congressman Clay so very much for standing by this young American who is not even 18 years old yet, I don't think, and who managed to put this complex piece of art together.

9433,topic-id,245,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, Congress has an obligation to ensure that our national counterterrorism programs and policies are as effective as possible. At every opportunity, we should assess gaps and weaknesses and work to find opportunities for improvement.  For example, the committee's investigation into the 2013 tragic Boston Marathon bombings revealed a series of weaknesses we have worked to correct; and many of the recent attacks, including the San Bernardino and Garland shootings, the Orlando Pulse nightclub attack, and other small-scale plots have each prompted review, reflection, and action.  The REPORT Act will provide valuable assistance in this work by requiring the Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with other Federal officials, to submit a report to Congress on incidents of terrorism within 1 year of completion of the investigation.  Importantly, this report will provide Congress with the facts of the incident, a review of security gaps, and recommendations to improve homeland security efforts.  As the committee has learned over the years, it can often be a challenge to obtain timely and comprehensive sharing of information by the executive branch in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. While perhaps understandable, the REPORT Act, offered by Congressman Aguilar, will help ensure that Congress receives the information it needs. This is a valuable addition, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Aguilar for introducing this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I couldn't agree with them more. As bad as Puzder would have been, our standard cannot be ``not Puzder.''  Never has it been so critical to have a Secretary of Labor who is committed to putting workers' protections and rights first, even if that means standing up to President It is with this in mind that I cannot support Alexander Acosta to run the Department of  Given Mr.Acosta's professional history, I have serious concerns about whether undue political pressure would impact decision making at the My concerns were only heightened at his nomination hearing, when Mr.Acosta said he would defer to President Trump on the priorities of the Department of The Trump administration has already cemented a reputation for flouting ethics rules and attempting to exert political pressure over Federal employees. We need a Secretary of Labor who will prioritize workers and the mission of the Department of Labor over special interests and political pressure.  Unfortunately, Mr.Acosta's time leading the civil rights division at the Department of Justice suggests he will not be the mission-focused Secretary of Labor workers across the country have demanded. A formal investigation by the inspector general showed that, under Acosta's tenure, the civil rights division illegally considered applicants' political opinions in making hiring decisions, ignoring their professional qualifications. As Assistant Attorney General, Acosta chose to recuse himself from consideration of a Texas redistricting plan, instead, allowing political appointees to overrule career attorneys who believe the plan discriminated against Black and Latino voters.  Mr.Acosta's past raises questions about whether--instead of making workers' rights and protections the priorities of that Department--he will allow political pressure to influence his decision making.  Mr.Acosta's refusal to take a strong stand on many of the most pressing issues workers face today was equally concerning. We need a Secretary of Labor who is committed to expanding overtime pay to more workers, fighting for equal pay, and maintaining protections for our workers. But in responding to questions about those priorities, Mr.Acosta made it clear that he simply plans to defer to President Trump, who has already made it abundantly clear that he will not stand up for workers.  Mr.Acosta continued to evade addressing my concerns about how he would prioritize workers' interests at the Department of Labor in our followup questions. We need a Secretary of Labor who will remain committed to the core principles of the Department of Labor--someone who will prioritize the best interests of our workforce, who will enforce laws that protect workers' rights and safety and livelihoods, and who will seek to expand economic opportunities for workers and families across our country.

9391,topic-id,414,"Mr.President, there has been a longstanding question of whether there would be drilling for oil in the eastern Gulf of Mexico off of the State of  This had been settled in law 10 years ago. Then, my colleague Senator Mel Martinez and I passed a portion of legislation called That portion of the legislation put the drilling off of Florida in the eastern Gulf--everything east of a north-south line called the Military Mission Line, which is a line running south of approximately Fort Walton Beach--everything east of that is off limits in law to any kind of oil drilling activity, along with the remainder of the coast of Florida; 125 miles from the coast going all the way over to Pensacola and to the Perdido River, which is the Alabama-Florida line.  The reasons for this are many, but not the least of which is called the Military Mission That area of the Gulf off of Florida is the largest testing and training area for the United States military in the world. Compared to other testing ranges, such as the Nevada Test Site--it dwarfs that site. As we can see, from north to south, we have ranges as far as 300 miles from east to west. For example, off of Naples, FL, all the way west to the Military Mission Line is approximately 250 miles. That has been needed by our U.military because of the testing and training.  It has been doubted over the years as the relentless pursuit of oil drilling by the oil industry has tried to erode into that, and that is why, in a bipartisan way, Senator Martinez and I put in law for the period of years through 2022, from when we passed this back in 2006, it off limits.  The question is, What is coming afterward? Well, of course if it is up to the Department of Defense, there will be no oil drilling activity. That is what I wanted to bring to the attention of the Senate today.  Two previous Secretaries of Defense in Republican administrations, including Secretary Rumsfeld, have written letters to state the policy that any oil-related activity in that testing and training range would be incompatible with the mission of the testing and training of the U.military.

We can't suffer that kind of shock again.

9552,topic-id,2050,"Mr.President, I want to address the Senate on the occasion of the solemn memorial of 7 years since the Deepwater Horizon explosion and the resulting oilspill, where 11 workmen were tragically killed.  The oilspill fouled the sensitive gulf ecosystem in ways that we still do not fully realize. Yet we are hearing today that the President is expected to issue an Executive order this week that ignores the implications of that tragedy, which was also the largest environmental disaster in U.history, by blindly encouraging more drilling in very sensitive areas.  I can tell you that drilling off the coast of Florida's neighboring States poses a real threat to our State's environment and our multibillion-dollar tourism industry, and that is because a spill off the coast of Louisiana can end up on the beaches of northwest Florida, just like a spill off the coast of Virginia or South Carolina can affect the entire Atlantic coast.  BP, as a result of Deepwater Horizon, agreed to pay more than $20 billion in penalties to clean up the 2010 oilspill and repay gulf residents for lost revenue. But, apparently, that wasn't enough, if BP's recent spill in Alaska is any indication.  So we shouldn't be surprised, since oil companies and their friends have fought against any new safety standards or requirements, that the President still wants to open up additional waters to drilling, despite the fact that we haven't applied the lessons learned from Deepwater This is at a time when the United States has been able to find all new reserves of oil and gas onshore. So we are not in a time of a shortage of discovery or a shortage of oil reserves. Our domestic energy market is being affected by the low price of natural gas, since so much of the reserves are just tremendous here in the continental United  The most visible change since the Deepwater Horizon spill is the division of the Minerals Management Service into the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental All of those changes were made as a result of trying to improve things after the BP spill, but it doesn't seem to have made any major improvements in oversight, according to a report issued by the GAO last month.  So I have come to the floor to try to alert other Senators about the importance of preserving the moratorium on drilling in the Gulf of It makes no sense to put Florida's multibillion-dollar, tourism-driven economy at risk.  And there is something else at risk.  The Department of Defense has stated numerous times--I have two letters from two Republican Secretaries of Defense that say it--that drilling and oil-related activities are incompatible with our military training and weapons testing. That is the area known as the gulf training range. It is in the Gulf of Mexico off of It is the largest testing and training range for the United States military in the world.  Now, in that gulf training range is where the pilots of the F-22 are trained. That is at Tyndall Air Force It is where the new F-35 pilots are trained, by the way, not only for the United States but also for the many foreign nations that have bought F-35s. Of course, that is essential to our national security.  That is just pilot training. That doesn't speak of the testing done on some of our most sophisticated weapons over hundreds and hundreds of miles of restricted airspace.[[Page S2546]]  Oh, by the way, when the U.Navy Atlantic Fleet shut down our training in Puerto Rico and the island of Vieques, where do you think a lot of that training came to? The Navy still has to train. So they will send their squadrons down to Key West Naval Air Station at Boca Chica When those pilots and their F-18 Hornets lift off the runway, within 2 minutes they are out over the Gulf of Mexico in restricted airspace. So they don't spend a lot of fuel and a lot of time to get there.  That is why a lot of our colleagues across the State of Florida on the other side of the aisle--in other words, this is bipartisan--have weighed in with this administration, urging continued protection for the largest military testing and training area in the world.  Opposition to drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico is bipartisan, bicameral--the Senate and House--but so is our opposition to drilling off the Atlantic coast.  Now, let me just distinguish between the two. Years ago, my then-Republican colleague Senator Mel Martinez and I both offered in law an exemption until the year 2022 of any oil drilling off of the coast of It is actually everything east of what is called the Military Mission It is virtually the Gulf of Mexico off of Of course we did that for the reasons that I have already stated. That is in law up until 2022. But the administration will be coming forth with another plan for the 5-year period for oil drilling offshore for the years 2023 up through 2028.  It is my hope that the words of this Senator and the words of our bipartisan colleagues from the Florida delegation will convince the administration that it is not wise to impede the military's necessary training and testing area, not even to speak of the tremendous economic deprivation that will come as a result of an oilspill.  Just think back to the BP spill. Think back to the time when the beaches, the sugary-white sands of Pensacola Beach, were completely covered with oil. That picture--a very notable picture, a contrast of the black oil on top of the white sand--went around the world.  The winds started blowing the oil from the BP spill off the coast of The winds continued to blow it to the east, and so some of the oil got into Pensacola Bay, some of the oil started getting into Choctawhatchee Bay, and some oil got on the beautiful beaches of Destin and Fort Walton The winds took it as far east as the Panama City beaches. There they received basically tar balls on the beach. Then the winds reversed and started taking it back to the west, so none of the other beaches all the way down the coast of Florida--Clearwater, Petersburg, on down to the beaches off of Bradenton, Sarasota, Fort Myers, Naples, and all the way down to Marco Island--none of those beaches received the oil because the wind didn't keep blowing it that way. But the entire west coast of Florida lost an entire tourist season because our guests, our visitors, the tourists, didn't come because they had seen those pictures and they thought that oil was on all of our beaches.  Let me tell you how risky that was. In the Gulf of Mexico, there is something known as the Loop It comes through the separation of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and the western end of Cuba and goes up into the gulf, and then it loops and comes south in the gulf. It hugs the Florida Keys and becomes the Gulf Stream that hugs the east coast of And about midway down the peninsula, it starts to leave the coast, follows and parallels the east coast of the United States, and eventually goes to Northern That is the Gulf  Had that oilspill been blown south from Louisiana and had the Loop Current come enough north, that oilspill would have gotten in the Loop Current, and it would have taken it down past the very fragile coral reefs of the Florida Keys and right up the beaches of Southeast Florida, where there is a huge tourism business.  By the way, the Gulf Stream hugs the coast in some cases only a mile off of the beach.  That is the hard economic reality of what could happen to Florida's tourism industry, not only on the west coast, as it already did in that season of the BP oilspill, but what could happen on the east coast of Florida too.  Opposition to drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico is certainly bipartisan, but so is the opposition to drilling off the Atlantic coast. In the last Congress, Members from both parties joined together to file a House companion to the legislation this Senator had filed that would prohibit seismic testing in the Atlantic off of The type of seismic airgun testing companies wanted to use to search for oil and gas would threaten thousands of marine mammals and fish, including endangered species such as the North American right whale. The blast from seismic airguns can cause permanent hearing loss for whales and dolphins, which disrupts their feeding, calving, and breeding.  In addition to the environmental damage those surveys would cause, businesses up and down the Atlantic coast would also suffer from drilling activity. Over 35,000 businesses and over 500,000 commercial fishing families have registered their opposition to offshore drilling in the From fishermen, to hotel owners, to restaurateurs, coastal residents and business owners understand it is too dangerous to risk the environment and the economy on which they depend.  There is one unique industry that opposes drilling off the Florida east coast. We made the case way back in the 1980s when Secretary of the Interior James Watt decided he was going to drill from Cape Hatteras, NC, all the way south to Fort Pierce, This Senator was a young Congressman then and took this case on and finally convinced the Appropriations Committee not to include any funds for the execution and offering of those leases. It was a simple fact that that was where we were launching our space shuttle then, as well as our military rockets from Cape Canaveral, and you simply can't have oil rigs out there and be dropping the first stages and the solid rocket boosters from the space shuttle.  As we know, the Cape has come alive with activity--a lot of commercial rocketry, as well as the mainstays for our military space program. In a year and a half, NASA will launch the largest rocket ever, one-third more powerful than the Saturn V, which was the rocket that took us to the Moon, and that is the beginning of the Mars program, as we are going to Mars with humans. Because of that space industry--whether it is commercial or whether it is civilian NASA or whether it is military--you simply can't have oil rigs out there in the Atlantic where we are dropping the first stages of those rockets. That is common sense.  When President Obama took the Atlantic coast off the table from 2017 to 2022--that 5-year period planning in the offshore drilling plan--Floridians finally breathed a deep sigh of relief. They sighed happily too. If President Trump intends to open up those areas to drilling, his administration will receive and can expect to receive a flood of opposition from the folks who know what is going to happen.  It is this week--and here we are midweek--that we are expecting the Trump administration to move forward with an Executive order that would ignore the wishes of coastal communities. I want to say that the areas off of Florida in the east coast of the Atlantic are very sensitive, as I have just outlined, but there is nothing to say that if you have a spill off of Georgia or South Carolina, that it can't move south, and that starts the problem all over.  This announcement by the President will be like a big present for the oil companies, which, by the way, in areas in the Gulf of Mexico that are rich with oil--and there are, in fact, active leases that are not producing the oil. Why would they want to grant more leases in areas that are important to preserve the Nation's economy as well as our military preparedness?  I hope the President thinks twice before putting Florida's economy at such a risk. I hope he refrains from issuing this Executive order, but if he doesn't, this Senator and a bipartisan delegation from Florida will fight this order.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

9425,topic-id,648,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, H.1306 is a culmination of years of work to address the wrongs of the past. The termination era in Federal Indian policy is one of the darkest chapters in American history.  In Oregon, all but one of the Tribes lost their Federal recognition. Fortunately, the Federal Government eventually saw the error of their ways and restored the Tribes, but they were now left with nonexistent or inadequate land bases.  H.1306, the Western Oregon Tribal Fairness Act, will go a long way in[[Page H5414]]helping reestablish, long-promised land bases for the Oregon Tribes, while also giving them the ability to effectively manage their land on their own terms.  I want to thank our colleagues from Oregon, Mr.DeFazio and Mr.Walden, for listening to the needs of the Oregon Tribal people and continuing to push this bipartisan legislation.  The previous version of this bill passed the House by voice vote last Congress, and I now urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, due to flight delays, I was unable to speak on the floor in support of my legislation.  The Western Oregon Tribal Fairness Act is a bipartisan, no-cost, common sense bill that will go a long way to helping resolve some of the problems the Federal government and its haphazard policy shifts have created for three western Oregon tribes.  The bill provides fairness for the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw, the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, and the Coquille Indian  Provisions of this bill were passed by voice vote in both the 113th and 114th I hope this Congress it can finally become law. The tribes have waited entirely too long to receive the fairness owed to them.  For over a hundred years federal policies have unfairly disadvantaged Indian tribes in Western After signing many treaties with the Tribes, the United States removed them from their original homelands and put them on only two reservations--established to house potentially more than 60 tribal governments.  In 1954, Congress made things even worse. All tribes west of the Cascades lost federal recognition when the Western Oregon Termination Act became law.  Scholars called it The Termination Era, and it was terrible federal Indian policy. It was so bad, that it was formally rebuked by Congress less than 30 years later.  In the 1970's, Congress began the process of restoring the Western Oregon tribes to federal recognition and cleaning up the mess and injustice the United States had made.  In fact, I began my Congressional career as the original sponsor of the Coquille Restoration Act, now law, which restored one of Oregon's terminated tribes.  Yet even today, it remains difficult for these tibes to function as the sovereign nations they are and to govern themselves effectively.  Unlike many tribes, the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Tribe, as well as the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, are deprived of any land held in trust.  Unlike any other tribe in the United States, the Coquille Indian Tribe must function under a legal anomaly with regard to managing its forest.  The Western Oregon Tribal Fairness Act makes good on decades-old promises to restore land bases for the Coos and Cow Creek Tribes, and it puts the Coquille Indian Tribe's forest management on equal footing with those of other Indian tribes nationwide.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.LaHood) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.1306.

9357,topic-id,2518,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Clay for convening us this evening to discuss this very important matter.  Why is it so important?  Well, we live in a time of rampant official lawlessness and disrespect for the Constitution of the United  But I am not here to talk about the Emoluments Clause or the power of Congress to declare war, or about equal protection.

The thesis of the book basically was that if windows are broken in the neighborhood and nothing is done about it, it sends the message that you can go on to bigger and better things. In other words, petty crimes and misdemeanors unaddressed go on to become high crimes and misdemeanors.  When we started the 115th Congress, unfortunately, within the first week or two, we started with a broken Constitutional window, Mr.Clay, because we allowed, we tolerated, and we countenanced an act of vigilante discrimination and censorship by certain Members against speech by the constituents of other  So I want to tell the story to the people of America, especially the young people of America, who have open minds and open hearts, and I am delighted that so many young people are in the chamber tonight to hear about what happened here because this is a very important moment in the history of this institution.[[Page H2884]]                                {time}  1630  Now, I am a professor of constitutional law by training. I did that for 25 years before I came to Congress, and I teach, also, the First  There are six rights contained in the First Amendment, and I hope all of you learn the six rights. They are: the right to petition for a redress of grievances; the free exercise of religion; the right of assembly; the right of free press; the right of no establishment of religion; and then, last but certainly not least, the right of freedom of speech.  Here in Congress, since 1982, we have had a Congressional Arts It is a magnificent statement of American values. We invite Members from every district in America--there are 435 districts here, plus five Delegates who come from territories or the District of Columbia--so there are a total of 440 that are eligible.  Each one impanels a group of artists. They have a whole process, and the best artwork is adjudicated and then brought to You can find them in the tunnel connecting the Cannon House Office Building to the Capitol Building, to the Chamber where we are right now. There are hundreds of beautiful, extraordinary, interesting, vivacious, controversial paintings done by the young people of  So what is the issue? Well, we are living in a time of political correctness. Let's say it plain. Sometimes the political correctness comes from the left. It happened recently at Berkeley in California, where the college canceled a planned appearance by Ann Coulter, a rightwing commentator whose views are totally anathema to me, but they canceled her speech.  Now, in fairness to Berkeley, they said there had been violence there and they thought there might be violence again. But there was such a storm of outrage about this example of a kind of leftwing political correctness, they reversed the decision and they said she could come. They understood it was their responsibility to make sure that her speech could proceed without being disrupted and broken up, so they did the right thing.  What are we experiencing here right where you sit in the Congress of the United States, in the House of Representatives? We are experiencing an example of a rightwing political correctness run amok. It is rightwing political censorship because some people didn't like somebody else's expression. Instead of walking on to the next painting, they decided to take it down, remove it, and return it to the office of Congressman Not once, not twice, not three times, not four times, but five times they took this painting down.  Congressman Clay and I wrote a letter to Speaker Ryan protesting this act of vigilante censorship right here in the Congress of the United Speaker Ryan, instead of standing up for the First Amendment, instead of standing up for the Speech and Debate Clause, instead of standing up for artistic expression, instead of standing up for freedom and teaching a lesson to the young people of America, he called the painting disgusting and then initiated an official process whereby they censored it. For the first time in the history of this competition going back to 1982, 35 years, they censored a painting.  Now, luckily they have made this young artist one of the most famous artists in America now, and we can all wish him nothing but magnificent fortune as he goes ahead to develop his skills and his artistic voice. They were not able, I hope, to crush the spirit of this young man, but they did something really deeply injurious to the Republic of the United They engaged in an act of naked viewpoint discrimination against a work of art.  Now, what are the constitutional values here that need to be vindicated for artists like David Pulphus or the winner from my district last year, Alannah Van Horn, who did a self-portrait?  Let's just be clear about one thing: these paintings hung for 6 months before the vigilante censors in the House of Representatives decided to come and take them down. For 6 months, they didn't harm anybody, they didn't hurt anybody, they didn't cause a riot, they didn't cause a ruckus, nothing--until they decided somehow that this painting ran afoul of their political correctness litmus test for what is acceptable in  So what is really at stake here? Well, first of all, it is the rights of the Member who sponsored this painting.  I want to say I am so impressed by the courage and the strength and the determination of Representative Clay to stand with his constituent and his constituency as well as with the Constitution here.  He brought a First Amendment lawsuit with Mr.Pulphus not for money, not for damages, but for a preliminary and permanent injunction against congressional censorship of this painting. So they went to court.  They had a very simple argument. The First Amendment says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. That is it. That is one of the six rights that I referenced when I opened my speech. Congress can't sensor speech.  Congress just censored speech.  The judge in the case, Judge Bates of the United States District Court, rendered a fascinating opinion. He found that this was indeed a clear case of viewpoint discrimination. It was censorship based on the views or the perspective of the artist. There was little doubt, he said, the government was engaged in a blatant act of viewpoint discrimination.  There are lots of cases that make clear that viewpoint discrimination is unacceptable in the United States, like Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, which said that UVA could not set up a program for young journalists and newspapers and magazines at UVA and exclude those from a religious point of view. The Court said, if you are going to set up a forum for speech like that, you can't single out one point of view and then suppress it.  It was the same idea in Texas v. Johnson in 1995, when the Supreme Court said that the right to burn a flag as a political protest is constitutionally protected. You don't have to agree with it, but other people have the right to burn the flag if it is their flag. That is their property.  The Court pointed out also that, in America, flag burning is the proper mode of flag disposal. If you look at the flag treatment protocol, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts burn flags all the time. So, if you punish someone for burning a flag, you are punishing them for a thought crime; you are not punishing them for an action which is done all the time in the United  In any event, the Court says viewpoint discrimination is unacceptable. Nonetheless, Judge Bates said that Congressman Clay doesn't win. Why? It is because of where it took place. He said that the hallway in the Cannon House Office Building leading to the Capitol is not a public forum of any kind. It is not a traditional public forum like a street or park. It is not a limited public forum, something that is set up for the expression of speech, which is precisely what you would think it is. It is not even a nonpublic forum, Judge Bates says. Judge Bates says that the 440 paintings down there are government speech.  Now, that doesn't make any sense. We have lots of people who are in the gallery tonight, and I assume you passed by these paintings on the way over. If you didn't, check them out.  I challenge anybody in America to go down to the tunnel and look at the paintings and regard the magnificent diversity of views and perspectives embodied in this one painting, for example, and say that it is government speech. In fact, the reason it was censored is because it wasn't government speech.  Yet, the court got it wrong. Now, I am not going to say really nasty things about him. I am not President of the United I am not going to say that he is a nonjudge or a so-called judger. I think that he made a serious mistake. I think the D.Circuit will reverse it. I think the U.Supreme Court would reverse it.  You know what? It doesn't make any difference, because everyone who has the honor of serving in this Chamber takes an oath to the Constitution of the United We have got to uphold the First That is a responsibility that we have got. And we can't just say, ``Oh, we will let a court deal with it.'' We have got to deal with the First  And it is very clear--the court said it itself--this was viewpoint discrimination. That is unacceptable. And we[[Page H2885]]should say that, yes, the Constitution applies in the Congress of the United We don't hold ourselves exempt from it. We don't say, if we set up a forum for young artists to bring their paintings in, that we are speaking. That doesn't make any sense. They are the ones speaking.  So where do we go from here?  Well, we are appealing to Speaker Ryan and to our friends in the majority to back off of the regime of rightwing political correctness. Just like it was wrong for Berkeley to try to sensor Ann Coulter, as much as many of us abhor everything she says and stands for, it is equally wrong for the Republican majority here to sensor Mr.Pulphus for your subjective interpretation of what his painting means.  One of the reasons why the Supreme Court has always said you can't sensor art is because art is polysemous. What does that mean? It means it is open to multiple possible significances. Who is to say what this painting means or what Guernica means?  Guernica, by the way, would certainly be censored under the principles that are being advanced here because it is sensationalistic or it deals with contemporary controversy. I mean, what art doesn't deal with contemporary controversy? I mean, it just doesn't make any sense what they are saying.  So I think that the majority should really rethink whether it wants to be in the business of censorship. This is not This is not This is not Saudi This is not This is the United States of  People have a right to paint the painting that they want. If you don't like the painting, you go to the next painting. You don't take it down, especially in the Congress of the United States where we should be setting an example. Justice Brandeis said government is the omnipresent teacher to the people of the constitutional values of the whole society.  Now, we have got one other serious problem I want to mention before I go because, you see, before they engaged in this act of censorship against this young artist who was from Louis who was obviously upset about what happened in Ferguson, Missouri, and painted this painting which I think is actually a very interesting, captivating painting that reminds me of Picasso's Guernica and clearly evokes themes from George Orwell's ``Animal Farm,'' before they did that, you didn't have to agree with any particular painting or sculpture or artwork in the Capitol complex, right?  We have great champions of freedom and justice in the Republic who are portrayed all over the Capitol complex, like Abraham Lincoln, for example, like Rosa Parks, like Martin Luther King, like Lyndon Johnson, like Sojourner  You know what? We also have people who are traitors to the country, people who were Confederate conspirators against the United States, like John Breckinridge, a guy who served as a U.Senator and as Vice President of the United States and then defected from the Union, took up arms against the United States of America, and was declared a traitor and stripped of his titles as a former Vice President and a former  There is Jefferson Davis, the President of the There is a statue of him up. Robert Lee, obviously the general for the Confederacy during the Civil There is John Calhoun, who defected from the Union and took up arms against us.  So we have these portraits, statues, and busts of great Americans who stood for freedom, justice, and equality in America and the And we have people who got themselves into trouble and, I think, brought disgrace to themselves with what they did. But they were all up together.  Now that we are entering into a new area of authoritarian thought control and censorship and political correctness in Congress, how can we have a statue of John Breckinridge up in the Capitol complex? How can we have Jefferson Davis up in the Capitol complex?  If this is government speech, now we are going to have to litigate each one of these artistic displays to see whether or not they are actually consistent with the values of the United States Congress and consistent with the values of the U.Is that where we want to go?  I invite my colleagues--I beseech my colleagues--don't take us there. Reverse this act of censorship against this young man. Don't set out to crush his spirit. Don't step on the First Show America that we believe in the Otherwise, we are going to be engaged in some very interesting discussions about the kinds of artwork that are found all over the Capitol campus.  I just want to salute, again, Congressman Clay for bringing us together and all of my colleagues who have come forward to stand up for the First Amendment tonight.                              {time}  1645  ",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgH2880-3.txt,99999999999999,REPORTING EFFICIENTLY TO PROPER OFFICIALS IN RESPONSE TO TERRORISM ACT,2017.0,26.0,April

It is the perfect time to reflect on the founding of our country and the principles that made our Nation exceptional.                              {time}  1800  At the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, President Kennedy, in his inaugural address, reflected on our founding principles.  JFK said: ``And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the State, but from the hand of God.''  President Kennedy understood the words of our Declaration of Independence: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''  A little more than 100 years before President Kennedy's inauguration, our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln, defended the Declaration and taught all those around him, as well as future generations, how to revere and embrace unwaveringly the sacred and transcendent truths expressed in this monumental document.  Lincoln said in 1858: ``Now, my countrymen, if you have been taught doctrines conflicting with the great landmarks of the Declaration of Independence, if you have listened to suggestions which would take away from its grandeur, and mutilate the fair symmetry of its proportions; if you have been inclined to believe that all men are not created equal in those inalienable rights enumerated by our chart of liberty, let me entreat you to come back. Think nothing of me, take no thought for the political fate of any man whomsoever, but come back to the truths that are in the Declaration of You may do anything with me you choose, if you will but heed these sacred principles.''  Today, Mr.Speaker, let us recommit to the principles set forth in our Declaration, that all are endowed by your Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And let those who have admired the leaders of our country who have reasserted these principles, from Lincoln to Kennedy, join together and continue to fight for the protection of these God-given rights, especially the first right, ``the right to life.''

9359,topic-id,483,"Mr.Speaker, I was sitting in my office watching this debate, and I really appreciate the opportunity to come down. I ran down the stairs because I wanted to speak to this issue.  Now, it really doesn't matter what anybody in here thinks about what I think is a pretty amazing piece of art. Under the banner of artistic discovery--that is the competition that we have, artistic discovery--we are inviting young people, high school students, to express themselves, sometimes to find themselves in the artwork that they do, to clarify ideals for themselves and to challenge people. What is art about, if not that?  So, in my office right now, we are putting together the artwork that has been submitted from the high schools in our district. We take very great pride in our artistic discovery contests, and so we are collecting that artwork.  But as we looked at the instructions before we did it, we saw this new addition that just came up, first time. How long is this? Thirty-two years we have been doing this? This is the first year that it includes suitability guidelines, and it makes very clear that subjects of contemporary political controversy are not allowed.  Then we have to sign, each Member of Congress will be required to submit a letter of support for their work of art. This letter is to ensure that the Member has seen the artwork before it is submitted, has taken responsibility for the content, and has certified that the artwork, in the Member's opinion, adheres to the suitability guidelines.  Now, of course it says: ``While it is not the intent to censor any artwork, we do wish to avoid artwork that is potentially inappropriate for display in this highly traveled area leading to the Capitol.''  What the heck does that really mean? Does that mean that people are not--you know, we have to worry about is somebody going to take offense at something or say, ``Ooh, I don't like that picture''? They are entitled to do it, and the artist is entitled to put it out here.  Now, it so happens that none of the pieces that were submitted, I think, were unsuitable, but who the heck knows anymore? Who makes the decision about what is unsuitable? I don't know.  Some of the--if you look down the hall and look at some of them, some of those self-portraits, I don't know, these kids look troubled to me. Is that something that ought to be taken down? Absolutely no.  This young person lived through a traumatic incident in his community and I think, quite artistically, decided to express his feelings about it. I think it is absolutely an outrage. We already heard about the violation of the Constitution, but each and every American should be offended by that and about these suitable guidelines. I am sorry. I object. I hope you do too.

9534,topic-id,1912,"Mr.President, as Senators continue to negotiate the appropriations bills this week, I want to reiterate my hopes that we can reach an agreement by this So long as we try to operate within the parameters our parties have operated under for the last few spending bills, I am optimistic about the chances for a deal.  I am glad the President has taken the wall off the table in the negotiations. Democrats have always been for border security. In fact, we supported one of the toughest border security packages in comprehensive immigration reform in an amendment offered by two of my Republican colleagues, Senator Hoeven and Senator We may address border security in this bill as well, but it will not include any funding for a wall, plain and simple.  Now, we still have a few issues to work out, including the issue of cost sharing, Puerto Rico, and getting permanent healthcare for miners, which I was glad to hear the majority leader voice support for yesterday--permanent healthcare for miners. I want to salute Senator Manchin, who has worked so long and hard for these poor miners who have struggled and have had hard, hard, hard lives. They shouldn't have their health benefits taken away. But above all, in the bill we have to make sure there are no poison pill riders. That has been a watchword of our negotiations in the past and is what led to success, and I hope both sides of the aisle will pursue that now.  We Democrats remain committed to fighting President Trump's cutback on women's health, a rollback of financial protections in Wall Street reform, rollbacks of protections for clean air and clean water, and against a deportation force. Those are the kinds of poison pill riders that could hurt an agreement, and I hope we will just decide at the given time that we can debate them in regular order, but they shouldn't hold the government hostage and pass them without debate.                        The President's Tax Plan  Mr.President, today we will also be hearing some details--we don't know how many--about the President's tax plan. We will take a look at what they are proposing, but I can tell you this: If the President's plan is to give a massive tax break to the very wealthy in this country--a plan that will mostly benefit people and businesses like President Trump's--that will not pass muster with  The very wealthy are doing pretty well in Their incomes keep going up. Their wealth keeps going up. God bless them. Let them do well. But they don't need another huge tax break while middle-class Americans and those struggling to get there need help just staying afloat. It is already the case that CEOs and other folks at the top of the corporate ladder can use deductions and loopholes to pay less in taxes than their secretaries. We don't need a plan that establishes the same principle in the basic rates by allowing wealthy businessmen, like President Trump, to use passthrough entities to pay 15 percent in taxes while everyone else pays in the twenties and thirties. We don't need a tax plan that allows the very rich to use passthroughs to reduce their rates to 15 percent while average Americans are paying much more. That is not tax reform. That is just a tax giveaway to the very, very wealthy that will explode the deficit.  So we will take a look at what the President proposes later today. If it is just another deficit-busting tax break for the very wealthy, I predict their proposal will land with a dud with the American people.                              North Korea  Mr.President, later today, the Senate will be receiving a briefing by the administration on the situation in North I look forward to the opportunity to hear from the Secretary of State, who I understand drafted the administration's plan, and other senior administration officials about their views on North Korea and the posture of the United States in that region.  I think what many of my colleagues hope to hear articulated is a coherent, well-thought-out, strategic plan. So far, Congress and the American public have heard very little in the way of strategy with respect to North We have heard very little about strategy to combat We have heard very little about a strategy on how to deal with Putin's We have heard very little about our strategy in Only a few weeks ago, the President authorized a strike in Is there a broader strategy? Does the administration support regime change or not? Do they plan further U.involvement?  These are difficult and important questions, and there are many more of them to be asked and answered about this administration's nascent national security policy for hotspots around the globe. I hope that later today, at least in relation to North Korea, we Senators are given a serious, well-considered outline of the administration's strategic goals in the Korean peninsula and their plans to achieve them.                 The President's First One Hundred Days  Mr.President, as we approach the 100-day mark of the Trump administration, we Democrats have been highlighting the litany of broken and unfulfilled promises that President Trump made to working families. It is our job as the minority party to hold the President accountable to the promises he made to voters, particularly the ones he made to working families who are struggling out there. Many of these folks voted for the President because they believed him when he promised to bring back their jobs or get tougher on trade or drain the swamp. So it is important to point out where the President has gone back on his word and where he has fallen short in these first 100 days.  On the crucial issues of jobs and the economy, this President has made little progress in 100 days. His party hasn't introduced a major job-creating piece of legislation to date, and he has actually backtracked on his promises to get tough on trade and outsourcing, two things which have cost our country millions of jobs. I was particularly upset to see the President consider repealing President Obama's law that prevented corporate inversions that allowed big corporations to locate overseas to lower their tax rates.  Instead of draining the swamp and making the government more accountable to the people, President Trump has filled his government with billionaires and bankers and folks ladened with conflicts of interest. Amazingly enough, he was going to clean up Washington and make it transparent. The White House has decided to keep the visitor log secret and, even worse, allowed waivers to lobbyists to come to work at the White House on the very same issues they were just lobbying on, and those waivers are kept secret. We will not even know about them.  These reversals aren't the normal adjustments that a President makes when transitioning from a campaign to the reality of government; these are stunning about-faces on core promises the President made to working                               TrumpCare  Mr.President, I would like to focus now on one issue: the President's promises on healthcare. On the campaign trail, the President vowed to the American people that he would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with better healthcare that lowered costs, provided more generous coverage, and guaranteed insurance for everyone, with no changes to Medicare whatsoever. That is what he said. We are not saying this; he said that. Those are his words: I am going to cover everybody. He said, ``We're going to have insurance for everybody . . . much less expensive and much better.''  ``We're going to have insurance for everybody.'' But once in office, President Trump broke each and every one of these promises with the rollout of his healthcare bill, Did[[Page S2542]]TrumpCare lower costs, as he promised? The CBO said premiums would go up by as much as 20 percent in the first few years under  His bill allowed insurance companies to charge older Americans a whopping five times the amount they could charge to younger folks, and it was estimated that senior citizens could have to pay as much as $14,000 or $15,000 more for healthcare, depending on their income and where they lived.  Did his bill provide for better coverage? In fact, the most recent version of the TrumpCare bill would allow States to decide whether to protect folks who have preexisting conditions. This was one of the most popular things in ObamaCare, even if people didn't like some other parts of it. If you are a parent and your child has cancer, the insurance companies said: We are cutting you off, and you have to watch your child suffer because you can't afford healthcare. ACA, the Affordable Care Act, ended that. They couldn't cut you off or not give you insurance because your child or you had a serious illness that would cost the insurance company a lot of money. But now, in the proposal they are making, it is up to the Tough luck if you live in a State without it.  Did his bill guarantee ``insurance for everyone''? That is what he said. No, far from it. The Congressional Budget Office said that TrumpCare would result in 24 million fewer Americans with health coverage after 10 years.  Despite an explicit pledge from Candidate Trump on the eve of the election that he would protect Medicare--because hard-working Americans ``made a deal a long time ago''--TrumpCare slashed more than $100 billion from the Medicare trust fund.  TrumpCare was the exact opposite of everything the President promised his healthcare bill would be. Americans should breathe a sigh of relief--a huge sigh of relief--that the bill didn't pass.  There is a lack of fundamental honesty here. If you believe that there shouldn't be government involvement in healthcare and the private sector should do it all, that is a fine belief. I don't agree with it. But that means higher costs and less coverage for most Americans, and the President and, frankly, many of our Republican colleagues are trying to have it both ways. They want to say to their rightwing friends: I am making government's involvement much less. But then they say to the American people: You are going to get better coverage, more coverage, at lower rates. The two are totally inconsistent. That is why they are having such trouble with TrumpCare over in the House, and there will be even worse trouble here in the Senate, if it ever gets here, which I hope it doesn't.  Healthcare is another example of why this President has so little to show for his first 100 days. Instead of reaching out to Democrats to find areas where we could compromise on improving our healthcare system--we Democrats have always said: Don't repeal ObamaCare; improve it. We know it needs to have some changes. But, instead, they started out on their own in a partisan way, the very same party that criticized President Obama for working just with Democrats on the issue, despite a yearlong effort to try. So it failed, and it is emblematic of the President's first 100 days. The President's ``my way or the highway'' approach is one of the main reasons he has so little to show on healthcare and so little to show for his first 100 days in office.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

9429,topic-id,681,"Mr.Speaker, I come to the House floor for the second year in a row to read the book ``I Am Jazz,'' a children's book about transgender youth cowritten by Jazz Jennings, pictured here, and Jessica  After an LGBT hate group forced a school to cancel a reading of this book 2 years ago, a movement was launched. Every year since, readings have been held across the country to increase understanding and to show young people that they are welcomed and loved.  Last year I read this book from the House floor, and today I am proud to join this movement to read it again.  ``I Am Jazz.''       For as long as I can remember, my favorite color has been      pink. My second favorite color is silver, and my third      favorite color is green.       Here are some of the many other things I like to do:      dancing, singing, backflips, drawing, soccer, swimming,      makeup, and pretending I am a pop star.       Most of all, I love mermaids. Sometimes I even wear a      mermaid tail in the pool.       My best friends are Samantha and We always have fun      together. We like high heels and princess gowns or cartwheels      and trampolines.       But I am not exactly like Samantha and I have a girl      brain but a boy body. This is called transgender. I was born      this way.       When I was very little and my mom would say, ``You are such      a good boy,'' I would say, ``No, Good girl.''       At first my family was confused. They had always thought of      me as a boy. As I got a little older, I hardly ever played      with trucks or tools or superheroes, only princesses and      mermaid costumes. My brothers told me this was girl stuff. I      kept right on playing.       My sister says I am always talking to her about my girl      thoughts and my girl dreams and how one day I would be a      beautiful lady. She would giggle and say, ``You are a funny      kid.''       Sometimes my parents let me wear my sister's dresses around      the house, but whenever we went out, I had to put on my boy      clothes again. That made me mad. Still, I never gave up      trying to convince them. Pretending I was a boy felt like      telling a lie.       Then one amazing day, everything changed. Mom and Dad took      me to meet a new doctor who asked me lots and lots of      questions. Afterward, the doctor spoke to my parents, and I      heard the word ``transgender'' for the very first time. That      night at bedtime, my parents both hugged me and said, ``We      understand now. Be who you are. We love you no matter what.''       This made me smile and smile and smile. Mom and Dad told me      I could start wearing girl clothes to school and growing my      hair long. Then they even let me change my name to      Being Jazz felt much more like being me. Mom said that being      Jazz would make me different from the other kids at school,      but that being different is okay. ``What is important,'' she      said, ``is that I am happy with who I am.''       Being Jazz caused some of the people to be confused, too,      like the teachers at school. At the beginning of the year,      they wanted me to use the boys bathroom and play on the boys      team in gym class, but that didn't feel normal to me at all.      I was so happy when the teachers changed their minds. I can't      imagine not playing on the same team as Casey and       Even today, there are kids who tease me or call me by a boy      name or ignore me altogether. This makes me feel crummy. Then      I remember that the kids who get to know me usually want to      be my friend. They say I am one of the nicest girls at      school.       I don't mind being different. Different is special. I think      what matters most is what a person is like inside, and inside      I am happy. I am having fun. I am proud.

9554,topic-id,854,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues in the Senate to oppose the nomination of Alexander Acosta for Labor  The test of whether a nominee is qualified to be Labor Secretary is a pretty simple one: Will that person stand up for 150 million American workers and their families? Mr.Acosta has had multiple opportunities in more than 2 months since he was nominated for this position to demonstrate that he would stand up for workers, and time after time, he has refused.  Americans deserve to know where a nominee like Mr.Acosta stands on key policy matters that will have a powerful impact on the lives of working people.  At Mr.Acosta's confirmation hearing, I asked him where he stood on three policy issues that are important to working Americans and their families.  First, will you promise not to delay a rule that will protect 2.3 million Americans from being poisoned by lethal cancer-causing silica on the job?  Second, will you appeal a Texas court's injunction that has halted implementation of a new overtime rule that would give 4.2 million Americans a $1.5 billion raise in a single year?  And third, will you promise not to delay a rule that will stop investment advisers from cheating retirees out of an estimated $17 billion a year?  Now, these are not tough questions. For most people, these would have been total softballs: Will you keep workers from being poisoned, will you make sure that employers pay for overtime, and will you make sure that investment advisers aren't cheating retirees? Come on. This is the very least that a Labor Secretary can do--the very least.  Mr.Acosta refused to answer a single one of these questions. Instead, he bobbed and weaved, stalled and repeated my questions; he even insisted that these topics were so complex that he needed more time to study them. And it wasn't just my questions that Mr.Acosta refused to answer. He spent more than 2 hours ducking, hand-waving, and dodging basic questions from committee members--both Democrats and Republicans--questions about whether he would commit to stand up for workers on issues that profoundly affect their health, their safety, and their economic security.  Mr.Acosta has been so evasive about his views that we still have virtually no idea what he will do to help or harm workers if he is confirmed for this job.  The fact that Mr.Acosta isn't willing to step up on easy questions and tell us that he will be on the side of workers tells us a lot about him--and none of it is good.  That is particularly troubling, since Mr.Acosta is President Trump's nominee, and we can see how President Trump treats workers. In less than 100 days on the job, President Trump has managed to kill, weaken, or undermine an unprecedented number of protections for working people.  He signed a bill to make it easier for government contractors to steal wages from their employees.  He signed a bill to make it easier for employers to hide injuries and deaths that their workers suffer on the job.  He signed a bill to keep cities from offering retirement accounts to more than 2 million employees who don't have access to a retirement plan on the job.  He delayed a rule protecting workers from lethal, cancer-causing beryllium.  He delayed a rule protecting construction workers from deadly silica.  And he delayed a rule preventing investment advisers from cheating retirees--a rule that will save hard-working Americans about $17 billion a year.  That is a pretty long list, and it doesn't even include the devastating impact to workers of the President's proposed 20-percent cut to the Labor Department funding, which means fewer cops on the beat when employers steal wages or force people into unsafe working conditions.  During his campaign, President Trump talked a big game about standing up for workers and creating good, high-paying jobs. But if his first 100 days are any indication, his real plan is to keep corporate profits soaring by gutting the rules that American workers depend on to keep money in their pockets, food on their tables, and to keep them safe in the workplace.  Unlike President Trump's first failed nominee for this job, Mr.Acosta is not openly contemptuous of people who work hard for a living, and I suppose we should be thankful for that. But that is not the test for Labor The test for Labor Secretary is whether this person will stand up for American workers.  Mr.Acosta won't make that commitment, and he has made it perfectly clear that he sure won't stand up to President That is just not good enough. Because of this ongoing evasiveness, I have no confidence that Mr.Acosta is the right choice for this position, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his confirmation.

Joined by 375 sister marches worldwide, we came together with one voice to demand leadership in the fight against climate change. The Science March in Washington over Earth Day weekend, led by a nonpartisan group of scientists, was joined by people in 600 satellite marches around the world.  I went to Earth Day Texas, a truly impressive event, with 150,000 people, making it the largest Earth Day event in the world. It is the passion of businessman and philanthropist Trammell Crow, who has been bringing Republicans and Democrats together to combat climate change since 2011. So for my 165th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I want to thank all of those folks who made their voices heard these past few weeks in the streets or online.  With the Trump administration locked into tone-deaf climate denial, these marches mattered. And how tone-deaf this administration is. Data from Yale's program on Climate Change Communication shows national support for climate action across a broad range of questions. Nationally, 71 percent trust scientists about climate change--right here; trust climate science about global warming, 71 percent. So many folks came out to the Science March to show that.  A majority of Americans, 53 percent, believe climate change is caused mostly by human activity. That compares to 9 percent--9 percent of the Republican caucus here in a vote taken just last History will have to look back and explain why 53 percent of the American people say that is the case and only 9 percent of our Republican caucus was able to recognize that.  Eighty-two percent of Americans want research into clean and renewable energy sources. Seventy-five percent want us to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and 69 percent--right here--want strict CO2 limits on existing coal-fired powerplants.  The President is disparaging the Paris climate agreement, but 7 out of 10 registered voters say the United States should stay in. Republicans favor staying in the Paris agreement by 2 to 1. This chart shows that support for research into renewables is strong across the country, even in coal country: 79 percent in Kentucky, 81 percent in West Virginia, and 82 percent in  It is the same in the oil patch. Seventy-nine percent of Texans support research into renewables. Despite this overwhelming public support, even in the reddest and most fossil fuel States, President Trump is proposing massive cuts to this research--clearly, tone-deaf. It is the same for emissions limits on coal plants. In all 50 States, in all 435 red, blue, and purple congressional districts, there is majority support for emissions limits.  Every single congressional district in the country has majority support for emissions limits. Of course, in some, it goes up into huge numbers like over 75 percent here in Vermont, but the baseline is that every single congressional district, a majority want emissions limits, but of course tone-deaf President Trump has directed his EPA Administrator to look at dismantling the Clean Power  A majority of Americans in every single State and in every single congressional district, which obviously includes every Republican congressional district, agree that climate change is happening. Whether you break it down[[Page S2730]]by State or break it down by congressional district, the results are the same. From here--50 percent and down--are various shades of blue. From here--50 percent and up--are various shades of orange. As you can see, there is not a remaining speck of blue on this map. The American people have settled this question in their minds.  Here is what, by the way, the next generation of Republicans think. The Thomson Reuters Foundation surveyed 21 college Republican clubs, of whom half said their members believe human activities are changing the climate. ``The people that are in power right now, for whatever reason, don't have that same global view,'' said Grace Woodward, the president of the Davidson College  She continued: ``When our generation is in power, we will take climate change much more seriously.'' I am not sure we have the time for that, but I appreciate Grace's sentiment.  Kent Haeffner, president of the Harvard University Republican Club, said he, too, believes it will eventually become politically unviable for Republicans to keep dismissing climate change. He said: ``I think that the folks that are our age are going to have to reshape the party and take it in a different direction.'' It sounds like these future leaders of the Republican Party are putting their elders on notice.  It is not just a majority of the American people and it is not just young leaders of the Republican Party who don't buy President Trump's tone-deaf climate agenda; corporate America is not buying it either. In the lead-up to the inauguration, more than 630 companies and investors, representing nearly 2 million employees and more than $1 trillion in annual revenue, wrote to Donald Trump, counseling him to follow through on U.commitments to combat climate change.  Food giants Kellogg's, Campbell's, and Mars, clothing brands Nike and Levi's, and other corporate heavyweights like Monsanto and Johnson & Johnson urged the incoming President to maintain national efforts to reduce emissions, invest in the low-carbon economy at home and abroad, and keep the United States in the Paris  Just last week, 13 of the largest and most successful companies in America wrote to the President to, and I quote them here, ``urge that the United States remain a party to the Paris Agreement, work constructively with other nations to implement the agreement, and work to strengthen international support for broad ranges of innovation technology.''  I don't know how the business community could state its position much more clearly. That group included BP, DuPont, General Mills, Google, Intel, Microsoft, National Grid, Novartis, PG&E, Schneider Electric, Shell, Unilever, and  As former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg put it, ``Washington won't determine the fate of our ability to meet our Paris commitment.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have both of these letters printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   April 26, 2017.     Donald Trump,     President of the United States, The White House, 1600          Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington,       Dear Mr.President: We write to express our support for      continued participation by the United States in the Paris      climate change agreement.       Climate change presents U.companies with both business      risks and business opportunities. U.business interests are      best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating      an effective and balanced global response. We believe the      Paris Agreement provides such a framework.       Companies based or operating in the United States benefit      from U.participation in the agreement in many ways:       Strengthening competitiveness--By requiring action by all      parties, developed and developing countries alike, the      agreement ensures a more balanced global effort, reducing the      risk of competitive imbalances for U.companies.       Supporting sound investment--By setting clearer long-term      objectives, and by improving transparency, the agreement      provides greater clarity on policy direction, enabling better      long-term planning and investment.       Creating jobs, markets and growth--By committing all      countries to action, the agreement expands markets for      innovative clean technologies, generating jobs and economic      growth. U.companies are well positioned to lead, and lack      of U.participation could put their access to these growing      markets at risk.       Minimizing costs--By encouraging market-based      implementation, the agreement helps companies innovate to      achieve environmental objectives at the lowest possible cost.       Reducing business risks--By strengthening global action      over time, the agreement will reduce future climate damages,      including physical harm to business facilities and      operations, declining agricultural productivity and water      supplies, and disruption of global supply chains.       As businesses concerned with the well-being of our      customers, our investors, our communities, and our suppliers,      we are strengthening our climate resilience, and we are      investing in renewables, efficiency, nuclear, biofuels,      carbon capture, sequestration, and other innovative      technologies that can help achieve a clean energy transition.      For this transition to succeed, however, governments must      lead as well. We urge that the United States remain a party      to the Paris Agreement, work constructively with other      nations to implement the agreement, and work to strengthen      international support for a broad range of innovative      technologies.       We believe that as other countries invest in advanced      technologies and move forward with the Paris Agreement, the      United States can best exercise global leadership and advance      U.interests by remaining a full partner in this vital      global effort.       We appreciate the opportunity to share our views and would      welcome the opportunity to provide further input as the      Administration continues to shape its climate policies.           Sincerely,       Apple, BHP Billiton, BP, DuPont, General Mills, Google,      Intel, Microsoft, National Grid, Novartis Corporation, PG&E,      Rio Tinto, Schneider Electric, Shell, Unilever,                                  ____       Dear President Trump, Members of the US Congress, and      Global Leaders: We, the undersigned members in the business      and investor community of the United States, re-affirm our      deep commitment to addressing climate change through the      implementation of the historic Paris Climate       We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered      by low-carbon energy. Cost-effective and innovative solutions      can help us achieve these objectives. Failure to build a low-     carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the      right action now will create jobs and boost US      competitiveness. We pledge to do our part, in our own      operations and beyond, to realize the Paris Agreement's      commitment of a global economy that limits global temperature      rise to well below 2 degrees       We call on our elected US leaders to strongly support:       1. Continuation of low-carbon policies to allow the US to      meet or exceed our promised national commitment and to      increase our nation's future ambition.       2. Investment in the low carbon economy at home and abroad      in order to give financial decision-makers clarity and boost      the confidence of investors worldwide.       3. Continued US participation in the Paris Agreement, in      order to provide the long-term direction needed to keep      global temperature rise below 2 deg.      Implementing the Paris Agreement will enable and encourage      businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in      existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars      the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity to all.       We support leaders around the world as they seek to      implement the Paris Agreement and leverage this historic      opportunity to tackle climate change.       18 Rabbits, Inc.; 22 Designs; 2pp; 3P Partners;

9560,topic-id,650,"These companies know that climate change could disrupt their supply chains, make water or commodities more costly, or even roil international markets. So they are moving ahead whether the President and congressional Republicans are with them or not.  Mars, the maker of M&Ms and Snickers bars, has pledged to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from its facilities by 2040. When asked by the New York Times if President Trump's threats to leave the Paris accord had any effect on Mars' plans, global sustainability director Kevin Rabinovitch replied: ``This doesn't change our commitments. . . . We're doing this because we see a real business risk.''  Walmart, which already has set a goal of deriving half its energy from renewable sources by 2025, recently announced Project Gigaton, an initiative to eliminate 1 gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030 from its entire supply chain.  Big league sports is engaged too. Major League Baseball stadiums and National Basketball Association arenas have installed wind turbines to generate their own low-carbon energy, or solar panels, like the Red Sox's Fenway  The National Hockey League has partnered with ENERGY STAR and the Natural Resources Defense Council to make its facilities more energy efficient. Salt Lake City's Major League Soccer stadium built one of Utah's largest solar panel arrays, providing more than 70 percent of that facility's energy.  The National Football League has a program to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions during every Super Bowl, which has resulted in the planting of over 50,000 trees in Super Bowl host communities.  In 2016, outdoor retailer REI hit 100 percent renewable energy for the fourth consecutive year, and they just opened a new net-zero energy distribution center in the Arizona desert. Starbucks announced plans to power 116 stores in Washington State on renewable energy. Patagonia created an incentive program for employees who commute to work without driving, saving more than 25,000 gallons of fuel last year, and it invested more than $50 million to purchase 2,500 residential solar units.  And it is not just the business community that makes things; financial firms are urging their clients to factor climate change into their investment decisions.  Last year, the investment firm BlackRock, with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, issued a report titled ``Adapting Portfolios to Climate Change,'' which describes ``how investors can incorporate climate factors to reduce risk and seize opportunities.''  The Asset Owners Disclosure Project last week reported that ``[s]ixty percent of the world's 500 biggest asset owners, with funds worth $27 trillion''--hold your breath on that--``now recognized the financial risks of climate change and opportunities in the low carbon transition and are taking action.''  Bill Gates, along with more than 20 of the world's most successful businesspeople, launched a $1 billion investment fund in late 2016, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by financing clean energy technology.  These clear-eyed assessments of the business effects of climate change are not entirely new. Back in 2009, Donald Trump joined business leaders to warn us about the ``catastrophic and irreversible effects of climate change.'' There advertisement read: ``There will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.'' That was then, I guess.  The country is moving on without President Trump and without the Republican State and local officials are on the march, leading their[[Page S2733]]communities on a path to reduced carbon emissions. Companies are on the march, greening their operations and supply chains. And on campuses across the country, young Republicans and young Democrats are on the march, coming together to prepare for a cleaner future. As the marches and events of the past 2 weekends demonstrated, there is no going back.  I realize it is hard for my Republican colleagues to go against the fossil fuel cartel, but it is not too late for them to finally say enough is enough, to wake up and to join the march.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgS2729.txt,1823,CLIMATE CHANGE,2017.0,3.0,April
