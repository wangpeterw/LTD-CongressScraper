                         OBAMACARE IS NOT OKAY

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, Hoosiers don't like ObamaCare, and they have 
worked hard for 6 years to stop it: electing a Republican House 
majority, a Republican Senate majority, and, eventually, President 
Trump, all on the promise to repeal and replace this failed law.

[[Page H2448]]

  That is what has made last week's failure to vote in the House so 
disheartening. It is inside baseball, politics as usual, and it is not 
okay.
  It is not okay to the millions of families facing soaring premiums 
and worse health care under ObamaCare, and it shouldn't be okay to any 
of us. We cannot walk away now without even a vote with so much at 
stake.
  This debate has gotten really complicated, but to me, it is really 
simple. We need to do what we said we would do: keep our promise to the 
American people, and repeal this failed law with something better.
