                         TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that 
President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are delivering on 
the first meaningful tax cuts in a generation. These tax cuts are in 
the tradition of Ronald Reagan, allowing American families to keep more 
of their hard-earned paychecks and creating jobs.
  Over 80 percent of hardworking American families will keep more of 
their own money. As early as February, American families will see more 
of their own money revealed in their paychecks.
  Additionally, by lowering the corporate tax to 21 percent, American 
businesses will become more competitive overseas and jobs will be 
created, such as Nephron Pharmaceuticals, led by Lou and Bill Kennedy 
of Cayce.
  I am grateful for the success of Speaker Paul Ryan, Chairman Kevin 
Brady, and all House Republicans in delivering tax cuts for American 
families. In the words of the great President Ronald Reagan: ``Whenever 
we lower our tax rates, our entire Nation is better off.''
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  I want to thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for standing tall with 
President Donald Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of 
Israel.
  God Bless Guatemala, courageously led by President Jimmy Morales, for 
being a friend of America today in the United Nations.
