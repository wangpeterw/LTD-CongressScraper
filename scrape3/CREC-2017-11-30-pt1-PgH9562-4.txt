                              THE TAX BILL

  (Mr. O'ROURKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, the tax bill that this Chamber voted on 2 
weeks ago was bad enough, added $1.5 trillion to the debt, 36 million 
middle class households will see their taxes go up, and 50 percent of 
those tax cuts would go to the wealthiest 1 percent in this country.
  But the Senate bill that is being debated on the other side of this 
Capitol right now is even worse. In addition to what I just described, 
we will see 13 million Americans lose their ability to see a doctor, to 
stay healthy, to take care of themselves, and even to live their lives.
  For those lucky enough to have healthcare, their premiums in Texas, 
for example, will go up, on average, $1,700 a year. We will see 1 
million of our fellow Texans lose their health insurance if this bill 
passes.
  Now, many people have called my office to ask what they can do to 
help. The number for the Capitol switchboard is 202-224-3121. It will 
be the public pressure that will help to form the political will for 
our colleagues in the Senate to do the right thing and to vote ``no'' 
on this tax bill.
