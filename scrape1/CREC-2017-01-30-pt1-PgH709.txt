                      LIMIT NASA'S CLIMATE AGENDA

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, NASA has given us a good reason to 
limit the amount of funds the agency gets for climate change.
  They recently claimed that a landslide in Alaska, fires in 
Yellowstone National Park in 1988, and a drought in California were all 
due to climate change. But extreme weather events actually had been 
declining over the last few decades at the same time that carbon 
emissions have been increasing.
  That NASA has played so fast and loose with the facts with the clear 
intent to mislead the American people shows why they can't be trusted 
with hard-earned taxpayers' dollars.
  Cervantes wrote in Don Quixote that ``one swallow doesn't make a 
summer.'' Well, one weather event doesn't presage climate change 
disaster. Ignore the media's exaggerations, the alarmists' predictions, 
and scientists trying to scare men, women, and small children.
  As for NASA, let's get them out of hyping climate change and back to 
exploring space.
