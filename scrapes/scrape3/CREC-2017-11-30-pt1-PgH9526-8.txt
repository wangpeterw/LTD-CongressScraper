            AMBASSADOR HALEY'S STERN WARNING TO NORTH KOREA

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, North Korea, 
ruled by a tyrannical dictator, tested an intercontinental ballistic 
missile that may have the capacity to reach the United States.
  North Korea's latest nuclear missile test was its most provocative to 
date, putting American families at risk of nuclear attack, in addition 
to the families of South Korea and Japan, with also a threat to China 
and Russia of regional chaos.
  During an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, 
Ambassador Nikki Haley issued a stern warning to North Korea: ``We have 
never sought war with North Korea, and still today we do not seek it. 
If war comes, it will be because of the continued acts of aggression 
like we witnessed yesterday.''
  Ambassador Nikki Haley was absolutely right when she urged China and 
its President, Xi Jinping, to do more to stop North Korea from pushing 
the world closer to a nuclear war.
  Ambassador Haley and President Donald Trump are promoting peace 
through strength to keep American families safe, and we should support 
the call for China to cut off oil to North Korea.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
