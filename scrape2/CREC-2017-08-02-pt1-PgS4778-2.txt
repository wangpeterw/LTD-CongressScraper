            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:45 
a.m. on Thursday, August 3, the Senate proceed to executive session for 
consideration of Calendar No. 103, the nomination of the Deputy 
Secretary at the Department of Energy. I further ask that there be 15 
minutes of debate on the nomination equally divided in the usual form, 
and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on 
confirmation with no intervening action or debate, and that, if 
confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon 
the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's 
action.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
