                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Scott W. Wilson, Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Gracious and loving God, once again we pause for a moment to be 
thankful for this land of plenty and to be in awe of Your creation. We 
are truly blessed to be caretakers of such a beautiful and diverse 
country.
  We pray for all of those in leadership roles that they may have 
wisdom and compassion. During this time of rest and renewal, strengthen 
our Representatives and their staffs that they may be able to take on 
the challenges ahead.
  Be with those today in their home districts who are open to dialogue 
that they may have fruitful conversation. Bless all of us as we seek 
Your will.
  Amen.
