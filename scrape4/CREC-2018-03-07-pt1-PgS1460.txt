                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

  SENATE RESOLUTION 425--SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF MARCH 2018 AS 
             ``NATIONAL COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH''

  Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Menendez) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 425

       Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of 
     cancer death among men and women combined in the United 
     States;
       Whereas, in 2018, it is estimated that more than 140,250 
     individuals in the United States will be diagnosed with 
     colorectal cancer and approximately 50,630 more will die from 
     it;
       Whereas colorectal cancer is one of the most preventable 
     forms of cancer because screening tests can find polyps that 
     can be removed before becoming cancerous;
       Whereas screening tests can detect colorectal cancer early, 
     which is when the disease is most treatable;
       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
     estimates that if every individual who is 50 years of age or 
     older had regular screening tests, as many as 60 percent of 
     deaths from colorectal cancer could be prevented;
       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with 
     localized colorectal cancer is 90 percent, but only 39 
     percent of all diagnoses occur at that stage;
       Whereas colorectal cancer screenings can effectively reduce 
     the incidence of colorectal cancer and mortality, but 1 in 3 
     adults between 50 and 75 years of age are not up to date with 
     recommended colorectal cancer screening;
       Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on 
     colorectal cancer prevention, screening, and symptoms are 
     held during the month of March each year; and
       Whereas educational efforts can help provide to the public 
     information on methods of prevention and screening as well as 
     symptoms for early detection: Now, therefore, be it

[[Page S1461]]

       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports--
       (A) the designation of March 2018 as ``National Colorectal 
     Cancer Awareness Month''; and
       (B) the goals and ideals of National Colorectal Cancer 
     Awareness Month; and
       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
     National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month with appropriate 
     awareness and educational activities.
