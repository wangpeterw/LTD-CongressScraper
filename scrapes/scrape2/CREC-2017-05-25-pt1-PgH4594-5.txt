                        PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUDGET

  (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
opposition to President Trump's proposed budget. This budget proposal 
confirms our worst fears about the priorities of his administration.
  The budget is cruel, it is shortsighted, and would be a disaster for 
efforts to strengthen the middle class in my district and across this 
country.
  It will hurt hardworking families and communities throughout New 
Hampshire. It guts public education, afterschool programs, and student 
loan support. It jeopardizes clean air, clean water, and our response 
to the opioid epidemic that is reaching crisis proportions.
  It eliminates critical programs for the most vulnerable, like the Low 
Income Home Energy Assistance Program which keeps low-income seniors 
and families warm in the cold winter months and SNAP which helps 
families feed their children, and decimates successful economic 
development programs like the Northern Border Regional Commission and 
community development block grants.
  The last thing we should be doing is eliminating effective programs 
that create jobs and boost our economic competitiveness.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose these misguided cuts.
