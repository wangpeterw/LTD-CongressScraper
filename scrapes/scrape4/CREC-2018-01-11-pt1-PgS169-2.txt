  SENATE RESOLUTION 373--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF ``KOREAN 
                             AMERICAN DAY''

  Ms. HARRIS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 373

       Whereas the influence of Korean Americans may be observed 
     in all facets of life in the United States, including 
     politics, industry, entrepreneurship, volunteerism, the arts, 
     and education;
       Whereas 102 courageous Korean immigrants arrived in the 
     United States on January 13, 1903, initiating the first 
     chapter of Korean immigration to the United States, the land 
     of opportunity;
       Whereas these pioneer Korean immigrants faced tremendous 
     social and economic obstacles as well as language barriers in 
     the United States;
       Whereas in pursuit of the American dream, Korean immigrants 
     initially served as farmworkers, wage laborers, and section 
     hands throughout the United States;
       Whereas, through resilience, tenacious effort, and immense 
     sacrifice, first generation Korean immigrants established a 
     new home in a new land that became the home for future 
     generations of Korean Americans;
       Whereas the centennial year of 2003 marked an important 
     milestone in the history of Korean immigration;
       Whereas the House of Representatives passed House 
     Resolution 487 to commemorate ``Korean American Day'' in the 
     109th Congress;
       Whereas the Senate passed Senate Resolution 283 to 
     commemorate ``Korean American Day'' in the 109th Congress;
       Whereas, just as other immigrants before them, Korean 
     Americans--
       (1) came to the United States seeking opportunity and a 
     better life; and
       (2) have thrived in the United States due to strong work 
     ethic, family bonds, and community spirit;
       Whereas Korean Americans have made significant 
     contributions to the economic vitality of the United States 
     and the global marketplace;
       Whereas Korean Americans have invigorated businesses, 
     nonprofit organizations and other nongovernmental 
     organizations, government, technology, medicine, athletics, 
     arts and entertainment, journalism, religious communities, 
     academic communities, and countless other facets of society 
     in the United States;
       Whereas Korean Americans have made enormous contributions 
     to the military strength of the United States and served with 
     distinction in the Armed Forces during World War I, World War 
     II, and the conflict in Korea;
       Whereas South Korea will host the 2018 Winter Olympics in 
     PyeongChang, South Korea; and
       Whereas the Centennial Committees of Korean Immigration and 
     Korean Americans have designated January 13 of each year as 
     ``Korean American Day'' to commemorate the first step of the 
     long and prosperous journey of Korean Americans in the United 
     States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``Korean American 
     Day'';
       (2) urges the people of the United States to observe 
     ``Korean American Day'' so as to have a greater appreciation 
     of the invaluable contributions that Korean Americans have 
     made to the United States; and
       (3) honors and recognizes the 115th anniversary of the 
     arrival of the first Korean immigrants to the United States.
