      HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING FOR A BETTER DEAL FOR AMERICANS

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration has turned its 
attention to so-called tax reform, and the American people will face a 
clear choice.
  House Republicans want tax cuts for the wealthy and the well-off. 
That is a raw deal.
  House Democrats are fighting for tax cuts for working families and 
middle class Americans. That is a better deal.
  The American people deserve a country where, if you work hard and 
play by the rules, you can provide a comfortable living for your 
family; but for far too many Americans, that basic contract has been 
broken. That is why House Democrats are fighting for better jobs, 
better wages, and a better future.
  House Democrats are fighting for higher pay, lower costs, and tools 
for the 21st century economy, and House Democrats are fighting for a 
better deal for every single American.
