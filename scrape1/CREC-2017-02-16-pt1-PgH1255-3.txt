                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  The Psalmist cannot find enough words to express trust in You. 
Personal experience of Your presence, care, and abiding guidance gives 
rise to his song: ``O Lord, my rock, my fortress, my deliverer. My God, 
my rock of refuge, my shield, the fullness of my salvation, my 
stronghold.''
  Stir in our hearts today Your Holy Spirit. Touch the soul of this 
Nation, that we may see Your saving work in our work, Your strength 
behind our weakness, Your purpose in our efforts at laws of justice, 
Your peace drawing all of us and the world to lasting freedom.
  You are ever faithful, O Lord, worthy of all our trust. May all that 
is done in the people's House be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
