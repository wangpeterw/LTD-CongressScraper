                MEDIA IGNORES DONATION TO ANTI-COP GROUP

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, you may have heard of Colin 
Kaepernick, the football quarterback who started ``the kneel'' to 
protest the national anthem at NFL games. He was the originator of the 
resistance movement in the NFL against police officers. But you likely 
haven't heard that he donated $25,000 to a group that was named after a 
convicted cop killer.
  Neither national broadcast stations nor major daily newspapers 
reported the donation to an organization honoring Assata Shakur, who 
escaped prison and fled to Cuba after being found guilty in the 1973 
murder of police officer Werner Foerster. Assata is currently on the 
FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list.
  Why did the liberal national media think this story was not 
newsworthy? Do they agree with Kaepernick? Do they approve of 
contributions to organizations named after cop killers?
  The liberal national media seems to have a grudge against law 
enforcement and patriotism, as well as religion and traditional values, 
based on their lack of fair coverage of those subjects. This might 
explain why the media's credibility is at a record low.
