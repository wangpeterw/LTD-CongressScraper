    RECOGNIZING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UTICA OBSERVER-DISPATCH

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 200th 
anniversary of the Utica Observer-Dispatch. Founded in 1817, the Utica 
OD was one of only 421 papers in the country, and the fifth newspaper 
founded in New York State.
  For the past 200 years, the Utica OD has kept our region informed 
through quality reporting on important issues impacting our local 
community.
  As an unwavering member of the fourth estate, the Utica Observer-
Dispatch had a leading role in exposing the inner workings of our once 
organized crime-influenced city. For this dedicated service on this 
very issue, and its campaign for justice against corruption, the Utica 
Observer-Dispatch was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1959.
  I commend the Utica OD for its 200 years of steadfast reporting, and 
I encourage the Observer-Dispatch and its committed members of the 
fourth estate to continue with its stated mission, to keep our citizens 
informed through impartial investigative reporting.
  Also, on a personal note, when I was a teenager, I actually delivered 
the Utica Observer-Dispatch, and it was an honor to do it and a small 
way for me to start off my earning a living.
  So I just want to thank the Utica OD and congratulate them again on 
200 years.
