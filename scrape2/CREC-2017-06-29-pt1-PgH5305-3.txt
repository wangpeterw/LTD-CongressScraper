                                 PRAYER

  Bishop Stephen E. Blaire, Diocese of Stockton, Stockton, California, 
offered the following prayer:
  O God, in this House, many words are spoken just as in our houses of 
worship.
  Grant us, O Lord, the wisdom to speak words that will always be 
edifying--to build up our Nation as a people.
  Let our words not only denounce war, violence, and injustices, but 
promote all that is necessary for building genuine peace through right 
relationships.
  Let our words not only condemn exploitation, racism, and abuses of 
wealth, but demonstrate that the cries of the poor and excluded have 
been heard. Let our words promote building just systems that ensure the 
common good and protect the inherent dignity of every human life.
  Let our words not only lament environmental degradation but promote 
all that is necessary for respecting the Earth as our common home.
  Lord God, grant that our words will always build ``one nation, under 
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''
  Amen.
