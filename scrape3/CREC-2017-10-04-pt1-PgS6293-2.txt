                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, we are grateful that Your will prevails when reliance 
on humanity is futile.
  Give our Senators the wisdom to understand that without Your help, 
they cannot succeed. Today, use them to work and act to accomplish Your 
purposes on Earth. Help them not to repay evil with evil but plant 
seeds of goodness that will bring a harvest of joy.
  Arise, O Lord. Lift Yourself up in these dangerous times to bring 
Your peace to our hearts. Help us to remember that You save the upright 
in heart, and Your justice will sustain us. Keep us from conceiving 
troubles and embracing falsehoods, as we focus on loving and serving 
You.
  We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.
