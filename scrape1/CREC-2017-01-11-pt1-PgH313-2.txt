                          REPEAL AND DISPLACE

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, for almost 8 years, we have heard about 
Republicans' plans to repeal and replace the AffordableCare Act. During 
that time, the House has voted dozens of times to repeal or defund 
ObamaCare; but now as Republicans prepare totake control of the White 
House, it is clear that Republicans don't have a plan to replace 
ObamaCare. Instead, they will repealand displace millions of 
hardworking Americans, cutting them off from quality, affordable health 
care and making it even harderto get ahead.
  The Republican repeal and displace plan will take away health 
insurance from 30 million Americans and will increaseprescription drug 
costs, premiums, and out-of-pocket expenses for American families; and 
it will end health coverage formillions of Americans in order to give a 
huge tax cut to the richest Americans. Repealing ObamaCare will also 
cause a loss of2.6 million jobs, including 12,100 jobs in my home State 
of Rhode Island.
  Mr. Speaker, let's be clear: the Republicans' repeal and displace 
plan is just wrong. It is time for Republicans to end thischarade and 
get back to doing the people's work by partnering with Democrats to 
strengthen and improve the Affordable Care Actand stop threatening all 
these harms on the American people.
