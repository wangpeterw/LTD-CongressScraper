                           THE MARCH FOR LIFE

  (Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this very Nation was founded 
upon the belief that all men are entitled to the most precious right to 
life. It is a right that I fought to defend in the United States Air 
Force, and it is a right I continue to defend in this United States 
Congress. That is why, this week, I will proudly vote in support of the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.
  It is my hope folks across the country are brought together with the 
uplifting message that life is a blessing.
