               ANGER AND HATRED IN POLITICAL ISSUES TODAY

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, this is my 29th year in 
Congress. I have followed the issues since my early teens more than 50 
years ago. I have never seen anywhere close to the anger and hatred 
there is on political issues today.
  Yesterday, on the ``Chris Plante Show,'' he mentioned a professor, 
John Griffin, from the Art Institute of Washington. Last month, 
Professor Griffin posted a link to a Washington Post column, with the 
professor commenting that all Republican Members of the House ``should 
be lined up and shot.'' He added, ``That is not hyperbole. Blood is on 
their hands.''
  That was in support of a Washington Post column by Paul Waldman 
saying the Republican healthcare bill was an ``act of monstrous 
cruelty'' that should ``stain those who supported it to the end of 
their days.''
  Those who have so much hatred and anger in their hearts and minds 
seriously need to seek religious or psychiatric help.
