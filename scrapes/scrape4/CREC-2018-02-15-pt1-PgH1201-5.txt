                          CUTTING EPA'S BUDGET

  (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, 26 percent--that is how much Trump and 
Pruitt want to cut the EPA's budget, a starved agency cut again by a 
full one-quarter. That is massive cuts of staff, massive cuts to our 
health and safety, massive cuts to the EPA's ability to do its job.
  The day after they proposed those cuts, we learned that Mr. Pruitt 
likes to fly first class on the taxpayer's dime. Over one stretch last 
June, taxpayer-funded travel for Scott Pruitt and his aides cost at 
least $90,000. If the administration wants to look for cuts, maybe 
Scott Pruitt shouldn't be flying first class to his meetings. Maybe he 
should have to sit next to the constituents he represents.
  Madam Speaker, the EPA's mission is to protect our environment. 
President Trump's dirty budget wants to cut its budget by $3 billion.
  Madam Speaker, we need to be able to protect our health and 
environment and prioritize funding to do so. It doesn't look like Mr. 
Pruitt is capable of doing that, even from 40,000 feet in the air.
