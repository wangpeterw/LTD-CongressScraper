                              PEARL HARBOR

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it was a calm, cool Sunday sunrise 
over the Hawaiian Islands when the planes came over the horizon. They 
were carrying the emblem of the rising sun on their wings and 
fuselages, the symbol of the imperialist regime of the Kingdom of 
Japan. They were headed for a surprise attack on a place called Pearl 
Harbor, an American naval base. It was December 7, 1941.
  Meanwhile, here in Washington, D.C., hypocritical diplomats from 
Japan were talking peace with the United States.
  The Japanese planes bombed American battleships in the harbor. They 
bombed American aircraft on the ground. After the destruction was over, 
2,403 Americans lay dead, murdered by the imperialist kingdom. It was 
the beginning of America's entry into World War II.
  Nearly 4 years later, over 416,000 Americans were killed in the 
Second World War. Victory over Japan occurred on August 14, 1945, and 
the ``rising sun of aggression'' sank into the sunset of history.
  We honor and remember Pearl Harbor and all the men and women of the 
Greatest Generation who served in that war.
  And that is just the way it is.
