                   WHAT MY CONSTITUENTS EXPECT OF ME

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise because I love my country.
  I rise, Mr. Speaker, because I refuse to stand idly by as a 
billionaire bigot does irreparable harm to my country--a billionaire 
bigot who tolerates the KKK but won't tolerate Islam; a billionaire 
bigot who tolerates anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, 
xenophobia, and homophobia.
  Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the consequences will be, but I do 
know this: the people who sent me here sent me to this Congress to 
fight hate, not to tolerate, not to mitigate, but to eliminate hate. 
The people I represent have an expectation of me.
  Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the vote will be, but I do know this: 
Next week, there will be a vote to impeach. Next week, there will be a 
resolution brought before the Congress, and there will be a vote to 
either table it, send it to committee, or vote it up or down.
  That is what the people I represent expect me to do, and I will do no 
less.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
