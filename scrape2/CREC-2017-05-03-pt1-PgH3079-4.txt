                      THANKING AMERICA'S TEACHERS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Sunday marks the start of 
Teacher Appreciation Week nationwide. The National Education 
Association and the National PTA have teamed up to celebrate America's 
hardworking, dedicated, and passionate teachers.
  Tuesday, May 9, is the official Teacher Day.
  Mr. Speaker, I think every Member of this House can think of a 
teacher who had a positive influence on not only their education, but 
their life. Our teachers push students to achieve their best and they 
show students how to realize their full potential.
  Teachers are often the most underrated, yet powerful professionals in 
the entire world. They truly do shape young minds. Teachers lend a 
caring hand and extend a loving heart. They make differences in the 
lives of our students academically, emotionally, and physically.
  So to every teacher in America, I say to you: Thank you for the job 
that you do, for the hours that you work, for the patience you show, 
and for the impact you have on so many lives. Happy National Teachers 
Week. This Nation would be lost without you.
