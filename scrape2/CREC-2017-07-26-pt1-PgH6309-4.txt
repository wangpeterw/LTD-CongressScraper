                                 PRAYER

  Reverend William D. Johnson, Jr., Harbour Lake Baptist Church, Goose 
Creek, South Carolina, offered the following prayer:
  Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for the day that You have bestowed 
upon us. May our actions glorify You

[[Page H6310]]

in all that we do. We humbly request that You, Lord, place Your 
providential hand of protection upon every Member, their families, and 
those who guard and protect this Chamber.
  O gracious God, remind us daily that while we are here to represent 
the people, our authority comes from You, for there is no authority 
except from God, and those who exist are established by God.
  May there be renewal of prayer across the United States. God, place a 
burden upon us that we may seek You before we undertake any endeavor.
  God bless the House of Representatives, and God bless these United 
States of America.
  I ask this in the name of Jesus Christ.
  Amen.
