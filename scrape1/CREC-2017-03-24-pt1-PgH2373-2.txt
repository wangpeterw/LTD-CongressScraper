                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear Lord, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We are at the end of a difficult week filled with long days of work 
on legislation of great import for all Americans.
  May Your peace descend upon this assembly. May wisdom and good faith 
rule the day, and may each Member proceed, with the help of Your grace, 
on the day's proceedings.
  We all thank You that we have the privilege to serve in the people's 
House.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
