                     REPUBLICAN REFORMS CREATE JOBS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week, I had the 
opportunity to visit every county in the district I represent on an 
annual agenda day tour. I shared with local media and constituents the 
legislative agenda for 2018, as well as my appreciation for the 
Republican tax reform bill, which has already created jobs.
  While walking through Walgreens 2 weeks ago, the owner of Mooneyhan's 
Auto Service, Bill Mooneyhan, told me that, as a direct result of 
Republican tax cuts, he is adding a new bay to his shop.
  Nephron Pharmaceuticals of Cayce, led by Lou and Bill Kennedy, 
announced an annual $1,000 pay increase and is adding 125 jobs in 
Lexington County.
  American Airlines and Aflac are adding jobs, while countless other 
businesses are providing pay increases and bonuses for their employees.
  I am grateful for the leadership of President Donald Trump, Speaker 
Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Republican Whip Steve 
Scalise, and Chairman Kevin Brady. I thank them for providing much-
needed tax relief for citizens to create jobs.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Best wishes to Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed and Marie Royce 
on their decision to conclude service in Congress.
