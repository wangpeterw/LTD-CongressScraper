             ORGANIC PRODUCTION IS GROWING IN PENNSYLVANIA

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week I had the 
opportunity to meet with a number of organic farmers to discuss the 
upcoming farm bill and its impact on organic production.
  In recent years, organic production has continued to grow in 
Pennsylvania,

Pennsylvania being the second largest State for organic production, and 
in many other States.
  There are a number of programs authorized in the farm bill, including 
Beginning Farmers and Ranchers, that help provide financial assistance 
and planning assistance for new farmers and farms. Access to programs 
such as these is essential for supporting the next generation of 
farmers and growing American agriculture.
  As it relates to organic, the farm bill contains numerous provisions 
and programs tailored to organic producers. This includes conservation 
assistance through EQIP Organic Initiative, the Market Access Program, 
Organic Agriculture Research and Extension, and competitive grants.
  The Horticulture title also includes the National Organic 
Certification Cost Share, marketing and data collection, the Organic 
Program, and the Organic Check-Off Program.
  Mr. Speaker, supporting agriculture of all forms through the farm 
bill is critically important for the industry, rural communities, and, 
quite frankly, all Americans.
