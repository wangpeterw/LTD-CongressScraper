                  WE NEED TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN

  (Mr. ROKITA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, we have done our job. President Trump is 
doing his. The House has passed a spending bill that keeps our 
government open, funds our military, and helps protect healthcare for 
millions of low-income children, but Senate Democrats only want to 
obstruct President Trump. They are opposed to a bill that has 
everything in it that they are not opposed to, but they hold out for 
more.
  Why?
  Because they are putting amnesty for illegal immigrants above law-
abiding citizens. This is unacceptable.
  They are putting amnesty for illegal immigrants ahead of healthcare 
for low-income children.
  They are putting amnesty for illegal immigrants ahead of funding our 
military.
  They won't allow anything that includes President Trump's wall.
  This is inexcusable. We need border security. We need to keep our 
government open. We need to fund our military. And we need to provide 
healthcare for millions of low-income children.
  This is not a complicated matter, and voters should hold Democrats in 
the House and Senate responsible.
