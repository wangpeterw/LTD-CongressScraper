SALUTING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF FORMER MARINE AND ONEIDA COUNTY DEPUTY 
                         SHERIFF KURT B. WYMAN

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute Deputy Kurt B. Wyman, 
a Marine Corps veteran and Oneida County sheriff's deputy who was 
killed in the line of duty in 2011 at only 24 years old.
  Deputy Wyman served with distinction in Iraq, earning the Iraqi 
Campaign Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Armed Forces Reserve 
Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. During his 
service in the Oneida County Sheriff's Office, he was named Rookie of 
the Year and earned the Grand Cordon Medal twice.
  Following his tragic death, the Deputy Kurt B. Wyman Foundation was 
created to celebrate and honor his distinguished life of service to our 
community and our Nation. Through the foundation's efforts, the Deputy 
Kurt B. Wyman Memorial Park in Whitestown was constructed as a resource 
for local families.
  Each year, an annual fall festival and a motorcycle ride are held at 
the park to honor and remember Deputy Wyman's legacy. I am honored to 
be joined by so many others who are grateful citizens by riding my own 
Harley-Davidson in this beautiful tribute to Deputy Wyman each year.
  Please join me and our entire community today in celebrating the life 
of Deputy Kurt B. Wyman, who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to 
our community and this great Nation.

                          ____________________
