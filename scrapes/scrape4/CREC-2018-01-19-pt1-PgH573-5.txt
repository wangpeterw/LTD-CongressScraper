               THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REMAIN OPEN FOR ALL

  (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the cause of any government shutdown now 
will be the same as in the past: Republican intransigence. If they 
continue to insist upon an entirely partisan bill that excludes 
DREAMers, they should not expect Democratic votes.
  I want the government to remain open for everyone, including our 
DREAMers. While Republicans firmly control all levers of government, 
they can't keep it operating.
  They will make history, celebrating the first anniversary of Donald 
Trump's incompetence by shutting down the government that they totally 
control themselves. Instead of staying here to work toward a bipartisan 
solution, they are moving to shut down the House first.
  It is the height of irresponsibility. It shows the depths of 
mismanagement that has failed to produce a simple one-year resolution 
to continue the operation of our government.
  We must speak out about the wrong that is being committed here. 
Defend our DREAMers. Defend the continuation of our government and a 
more responsible approach in this new year.
