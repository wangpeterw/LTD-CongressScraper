                      HONORING WORLD WAR II HEROES

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, I had the privilege of 
honoring six World War II heroes at VFW Post 2423 in Indian Trail, 
North Carolina. Each hero was awarded the French Legion of Honor Medal 
by the French consul. They were:
  Charles Richardson, who flew 35 combat missions aboard a B-17 over 
France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
  Andrew McMahon received the Purple Heart while fighting to liberate 
France.
  William Rachui helped liberate Rome and southern France while earning 
five Bronze Service Stars.
  James Crump landed at Omaha Beach on D-day and received two Bronze 
Stars and three Purple Hearts.
  Aster Rider landed at Omaha Beach on D-day. As a rifleman on the 
front lines, he was one of only a handful of soldiers to survive.
  Harold Granger landed at Utah Beach on D-day. He helped save lives by 
finding and disarming landmines.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in thanking these 
brave patriots for their service to the United States and the cause of 
liberty.
