                        HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AMERICA

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, July 4, 1776, Philadelphia, 56 
misfits, rebels, and freedom fighters all filled a small room with the 
intent to form a new nation. They pledged their lives, their honor, and 
their futures on one simple idea: that all people are endowed by their 
Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among those are life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
  As these ideas were put forth on paper, it was clear to the Founders 
that governments are instituted among men to preserve those rights. In 
that hot room, these 56 men put together the first foundation of our 
government, declaring independence from King George III.
  From July 4, 1776, forward, the term ``independence'' has defined 
America. After 7 long, grueling years of war, America gained that 
independence.
  So Tuesday, as Americans across the Nation watch parades packed with 
patriotic red, white, and blue and families gather for picnics, hot 
dogs, barbecue, and fireworks, all small towns and big towns throughout 
the country will remember and pay tribute to our Founders who instilled 
those three principles in our government: life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness.
  The Stars and Stripes are forever. Happy birthday, America. Happy 
Fourth of July.
  And that is just the way it is.
