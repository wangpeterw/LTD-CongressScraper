                   HONORING CAREER OF LOURDES MELUZA

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
distinguished career of Lourdes Meluza, who has recently retired after 
39 years in journalism.
  As a native from my homeland of Cuba and a graduate from the 
University of Miami--Go Canes--my alma mater, I got to know Lourdes as 
she began her tenure as a writer for the Miami Herald, where she 
covered my first election to the Florida State House of 
Representatives.
  In 1987, Lourdes joined Miami's Univision station, and shortly after, 
she became the network's D.C. correspondent, reporting to millions of 
Hispanics in the U.S. about important policy issues being discussed in 
our Nation's Capital.
  For over two decades, Lourdes interviewed Presidents and Members of 
Congress from both sides of the aisle and heads of state. Her 
professionalism has earned her our respect and admiration.
  Lourdes will be enjoying her well-deserved retirement in Coral 
Gables, in my congressional district. Lourdes told me that she never 
considered journalism to be a career but, rather, an adventure.
  Mr. Speaker, to my esteemed amiga, I wish her all the best in her 
next adventure, and I look forward to seeing her in our south Florida 
paradise.
  Godspeed, Lourdes Meluza. Felicidades, amiga.
