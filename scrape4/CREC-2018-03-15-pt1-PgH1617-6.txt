                           TRUMP IN SAN DIEGO

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, President Trump was in my 
hometown of San Diego this week. He went to inspect prototypes for his 
proposed border wall, a wall California doesn't want, doesn't need, and 
is an overly simplistic approach to a complex issue.

[[Page H1618]]

  The President was in San Diego for just a few hours and missed a real 
opportunity to hear from locals about what Americans in California 
actually need. Had he taken the time to actually listen, he might have 
learned how connected Mexico and the United States are and how 
important the cross-border economy is to our region. He might have 
learned about our infrastructure needs, about the contributions of our 
immigrant communities, or the environmental issues facing our region.
  Instead, he flew 3,000 miles on the taxpayers' dime for a photo-op 
for his political base, that achieved very little. Something is wrong 
when a President doesn't listen to the American people.
