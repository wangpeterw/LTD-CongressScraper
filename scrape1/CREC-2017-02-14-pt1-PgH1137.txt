         PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTACKS AGAINST THE CITY OF CHICAGO

  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, there are few places that encapsulate all 
our country has to offer more than my home city of Chicago. The 
strengths of the Nation can be seen in every corner of my district, 
where we celebrate diversity, passion, and resilience. This includes 
our immigrant communities, and I am proud to represent one of the most 
welcoming cities to those seeking a better life in America.
  That is why it is ridiculous to hear the President continue his 
bizarre barrage of attacks against our great city with his newest and 
most misguided claim yet, that elevated gun violence in Chicago stems 
from undocumented immigrants. Not only do his comments do nothing to 
address the gun violence problem in Chicago, but they are just plain 
wrong.
  Like most major cities, we struggle with violence and encourage 
constructive assistance. But studies have shown that immigration has no 
effect on crime rates. In fact, researchers have found immigrants 
generally have the strongest incentives to avoid activity that will put 
them in contact with the criminal justice system.
  The President should stop attacking the most vulnerable members of 
our society and, instead, look for pragmatic, commonsense policies to 
support comprehensive immigration reform and gun violence prevention.
