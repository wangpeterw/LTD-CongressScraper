      RECOGNIZING JANET JOHNSON AS EXTENSION EDUCATOR OF THE YEAR

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Janet Johnson 
for being named Educator of the Year by the National Extension 
Association of Family and Consumer Sciences.
  Janet Johnson has worked tirelessly for the citizens of Allen County 
as an agent for the University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension 
Service. She dedicates her time to extending UK's research knowledge to 
help Kentuckians build strong families.

  Much of Johnson's work revolves around community and economic 
development. In fact, she helped secure nearly $20 million in 
renovation and beautification funding for Allen County.
  Johnson was an integral part of ``Plate It Up Kentucky Proud,'' which 
encourages consumers to purchase and eat local produce. Regionally, she 
was extremely influential in connecting producers and consumers in 
south central Kentucky through the Farm to Table program. These 
accomplishments only scratch the surface of Johnson's contribution to 
outreach and engagement for communities and families in Kentucky.
  Simply put, Janet Johnson is an outstanding professional in family 
and consumer sciences who has paved the way for many transformative 
programs in Kentucky. I am proud to recognize her as Extension Educator 
of the Year and as a distinguished teacher and colleague.
