              REMEMBERING DEPUTY SHERIFF DANIEL MCCARTNEY

  (Mr. HECK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, last night, after many of us went to bed, one 
of my constituents called 911. It was everyone's worst nightmare: an 
intruder in the house.
  But then a superhero appeared, in the dark and in the cold, in the 
form of Pierce County Deputy Sheriff Daniel McCartney: a husband, a 
father of three, and a son.
  His bravery last night was just one of thousands of times he 
protected us, having served 10 years in uniform as a police officer and 
7 years in the Navy. His bravery last night cost him his life, as he 
was gunned down by the intruder.
  We are all shocked and saddened by his loss. We share our grief with 
his family, friends, and his brothers and sisters in blue. Some of them 
will do Deputy McCartney's patrol tonight, in the dark and in the cold, 
and they will come running when we need them.
  Not everyone can do what they do. These are special people with 
special skills and with special abilities.
  May the life of Deputy Sheriff McCartney remain special to all of us.
