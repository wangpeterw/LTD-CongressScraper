                MONTANA IS BENEFITING FROM THE TAX CUTS

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to let colleagues know that 
the tax cuts are working in Montana.
  For the last 2 weeks, I met with hardworking Montanans who are 
benefiting from tax cuts.
  Owners of the Billings Flying Service are investing in new equipment, 
as well as more research and development.
  Workers at the UPS facility in Missoula are receiving expanded 
benefits and more money in their paychecks.
  The owner of KFC restaurants throughout Montana gave employees a 
raise, boosted starting wages, and plans renovations for many of its 
facilities.
  Owners at Loenbro in Great Falls are increasing benefits and 
investing in new equipment.
  A farmer near Bozeman plans to double his food processing staff from 
6 to 12.
  Mr. Speaker, the tax cuts are working in Montana and throughout the 
country. They are leading to job creation, bigger paychecks, greater 
investment, higher wages, and economic growth. We must remain focused 
on policies to encourage growth, optimism, and the American Dream.
