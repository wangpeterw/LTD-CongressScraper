                      MEDIA HELPED ELECT A SENATOR

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the liberal media helped elect a 
U.S. Senator from Alabama. Their alliance with the Democratic Party is 
now so close, we should call them mediacrats. Admittedly, the 
mediacrats got an assist from some Republicans, as well as the 
candidate himself.
  The primary lesson to be learned from the election is that 
Republicans must confront media bias. They must constantly point it out 
and remind the American people of this corrosive effect on our election 
process. Republicans should join the President exposing fake news.
  The media should trust the American people with the facts, not tell 
them what to think. Because the media is so biased, their credibility 
with the American people is at an all-time low.
  For the sake of our country and for the sake of fair elections, I 
hope the media will return to their paramount responsibility: providing 
the American people with unbiased news.
