                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Once again we come to ask wisdom, patience, peace, and understanding 
for the Members of this people's House.
  Give them the generosity of heart and the courage of true leadership 
to work toward a common solution to the many issues facing our Nation.
  As true statesmen and women, may they find the fortitude to make 
judgments that benefit all Americans in their time of need.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
