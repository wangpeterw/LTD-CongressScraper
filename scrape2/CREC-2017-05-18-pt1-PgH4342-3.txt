                         STROKE AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of May as 
Stroke Awareness Month. As a stroke survivor, I understand the 
magnitude of this disease and the hundreds of thousands of lives it 
touches in American families each year.

[[Page H4343]]

  We know that the risk of stroke increases each year, but strokes can 
and do occur at any age. In fact, every 40 seconds, someone in the 
United States suffers a stroke; and every 4 minutes, someone dies from 
a stroke. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United 
States, killing nearly 130,000 Americans per year.
  To help raise awareness on how stroke affects Americans across all 
ages, races, and demographics, today I am reintroducing my resolution 
recognizing May as Stroke Awareness Month. The resolution aims to 
enhance public awareness by urging and continuing the coordination and 
cooperation among researchers, families, and advocates for improving 
treatment for individuals who suffer stroke. Together, we can combat 
this illness and work together toward long-term solutions to prevent, 
treat, and improve the lives of those suffering from stroke.
  I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) for joining me as an 
original cosponsor of this bipartisan effort. Mr. Speaker, I ask others 
to please sign on.
