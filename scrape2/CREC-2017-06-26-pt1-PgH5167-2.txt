                        WELCOMING PRESIDENT MOON

  (Mr. ROYCE of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome President 
Moon of South Korea to the United States of America as he makes his 
inaugural visit here later this week. President Moon's trip comes at a 
critical time for America's strategic relationship with South Korea, 
and I look forward to welcoming him to Capitol Hill.
  The friendship between our two nations, which was forged during the 
Korean war, has withstood the test of time and so many challenges. The 
people of South Korea have persevered in the face of incredible 
adversity and succeeded in building a modern, prosperous nation.
  Today, we stand together in defense of democracy, freedom, and 
prosperity. And the strength of our friendship is now more important 
than ever as we face growing challenges in the Asia-Pacific region.
  As the President begins his visit, let's also recognize the 
contributions of Korean Americans to the relationship between our two 
countries. The close bond that many Korean Americans have for South 
Korea, the country of their heritage, creates a strong sense of 
community that extends across the Pacific Ocean. This is the keystone 
in the bridge of our alliance.
  Mr. Speaker, I welcome President Moon, and I look forward to our 
meeting.
