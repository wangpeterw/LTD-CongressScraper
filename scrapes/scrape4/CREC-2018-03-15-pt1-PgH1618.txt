                     CHEERING ON SETON HALL PIRATES

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, today begins the best time of the year. 
March Madness is in full effect as of noon today, and I am here to 
support a team that I have followed for 50 years in college basketball, 
the Seton Hall Pirates from South Orange, New Jersey.
  Thirty years ago, Madam Speaker, they played for the championship in 
the Final Four against a Michigan team and lost by 1 point. Today we 
have another team that has the potential of going all the way.
  I would just like to acknowledge the Seton Hall Pirates as they start 
their journey for a national championship against the North Carolina 
State Wolfpack and ask that we honor seniors Ismael Sanogo, Khadeen 
Carrington, Angel Delgado, and Desi Rodriguez as they start their trek.
  Go, Pirates.
