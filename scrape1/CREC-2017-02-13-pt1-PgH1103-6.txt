     Trump's administration, I hereby resign effective 9:00AM on 
     February 10th, 2017, from the United States House of 
     Representatives.
       The opportunity to serve the citizens of the Sixth District 
     of Georgia has truly been one of the greatest honors of my 
     life. This job and my passion for serving would not have been 
     possible without the support, love, and friendship of family, 
     constituents, community, colleagues, and staff throughout the 
     years. It has been a blessing to work with such talented and 
     bright minds to advance real solutions to some of our 
     nation's toughest issues and challenges.
       My first professional calling was not that of an elected 
     official, it was to care for patients--following in the 
     footsteps of both my father and grandfather who were also 
     physicians. The caring relationship a doctor has for their 
     patients is what brought me into public service, and it is 
     that caring approach I wish to continue at the Department of 
     Health and Human Services.
       With the remarkable challenges that lay ahead for our great 
     nation, I am enthusiastic for the opportunity to be a part of 
     solving them on behalf of the American people. There is much 
     work to be done to ensure we have a health care system that 
     works for patients, families, and doctors; that leads the 
     world in the cure and prevention of illness; and that is 
     based on sensible rules to protect the well-being of the 
     country while embracing its innovative spirit.
       It will be my honor to continue working with you and every 
     other Governor of these great United States to ensure that 
     that our health care system becomes one that is more patient-
     centered, innovative, responsive and affordable for all 
     Americans. Thanks to you for your service, friendship, and 
     support.
           Yours truly,
                                               Thomas Price, M.D.,
     Member of Congress.
