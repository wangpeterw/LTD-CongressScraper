PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP'S PROMISE TO BUILD A WALL WITH MEXICO AND 
                 MAKE THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT PAY FOR IT

  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, you might recall, during the campaign, 
President-elect Donald Trump promised to build a wall with Mexico and, 
of course, make the Mexican Government pay for it.
  Well, now we are hearing that Republicans intend to come to this 
body, Congress, to spend your hard-earned money and mine, American 
taxpayer money, to build a wall with Mexico. They are estimating $10 
billion to $12 billion.
  Well, do you know what? In comprehensive immigration reform, which I 
was proud to support last session, we had over $40 billion for border 
security. So apparently Donald Trump is building one-quarter of the 
wall, all directly with deficit spending.
  In comprehensive immigration reform, we not only paid for that border 
security, not only paid for that $40 billion and required people who 
were here illegally to pay fines and register and get right with the 
law, it actually would reduce the budget deficit by over $200 billion 
over 10 years.
  So what we have is one-quarter of the wall and deficit spending with 
Donald Trump. With Democrats, four times the wall and reduce the 
deficit by $200 billion.
  Mr. Speaker, the choice is obvious.
