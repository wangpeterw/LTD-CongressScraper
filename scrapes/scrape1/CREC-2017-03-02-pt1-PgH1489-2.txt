               COMPREHENSIVE EVERGLADES RESTORATION PLAN

  (Mr. MAST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of including 
Everglades restoration in the President's infrastructure plan for 
America.
  The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is the most ambitious 
ecosystem restoration ever attempted and represents the ultimate 
infrastructure package for Florida, but many critical projects designed 
to add harmful Lake Okeechobee discharges and algal blooms into my 
community are far behind where they should be and becoming far more 
costly by the delay in full funding.
  The President has touted his record of building world-class projects 
ahead of schedule and under budget; so I am calling on him to create an 
Everglades restoration infrastructure task force, secure the full 
funding, and accelerate the CERP projects to completion.
  Mr. Speaker, my constituents have waited long enough to realize the 
massive benefits of Everglades restoration. Now let's seize this moment 
and put this President and this Congress to work to finish the job.
