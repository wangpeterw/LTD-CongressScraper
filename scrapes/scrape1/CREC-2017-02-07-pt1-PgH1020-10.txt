minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask for support and prayers for our 
giants still among our midst. Leader Bob Michel is struggling and in 
ill health. Bob was born and raised in Peoria, Illinois. He is 93 years 
old, a World War II vet, fought across Europe, and was part of the D-
day invasion.
  For 38 years, he served in this Chamber being minority leader from 
the 97th Congress through the 103rd Congress. That is a total of 14 
years.
  Bob was honored by then-House Speaker Foley when he was asked to take 
the gavel on November 29, 1994. I would encourage my colleagues to look 
at that C-SPAN tape.
  Bob, we love you. We are thinking about you at this critical time.
