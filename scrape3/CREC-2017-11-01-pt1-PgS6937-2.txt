                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal and ever-blessed God, thank You for waking us to see the 
light of this new day. Lord, on this All Saints' Day, we remember the 
unseen cloud of witnesses that surrounds us. We are grateful for all 
the saints who from their labors rest but whose works follow them.
  We thank You for the many lawmakers in our history whose integrity, 
creativity, and diligence have helped to keep us free.
  Lord, we praise You for all of Your gifts, the glimpses of beauty, 
the echoes of truth, and the kindness of friends. Thank You for all 
those who lived and died for freedom. Grant us in our day and 
generation to live to honor our noble heritage.
  And Lord, please remember all of those affected by the violence in 
New York. Bring a speedy recovery to the injured.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
