My patients have dealt with skyrocketing premiums, unaffordable deductibles, and a formulary so restrictive it is an insult to call it a real treatment.  Medicaid expansion is no better and gives only the illusion of sound coverage. These patients can't find doctors. They can't find specialists who will see them, which results in more hospital admissions, more unnecessary hospital referrals, more expensive trips to the emergency room, and higher costs to the program and to the taxpayers.  There is nothing compassionate about cramming more people into a failed system just so politicians can score political points. All they have done is force a second-class insurance onto first-class people.

Let me say to our chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Cedric Richmond for bringing this Special Order hour here tonight. So much has been said already. But let me say how honored I am to join my colleagues as we address and talk about ``A Response to President Trump's Inaugural Address and New Deal for African Americans.''  Like so many of my colleagues tonight, Mr.Speaker, and the countless Americans who are watching at home, I remain deeply concerned and troubled about several of the statements that Mr.Trump made and also about the stances of Mr.Trump's Cabinet members, comments about minorities and women and immigrants, and, of course, comments about our own colleague Congressman John  Unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, in Trump's inaugural address, he did nothing to ease those concerns or to unite us. On the contrary, all I heard on Friday was another campaign speech of more of the same divisive rhetoric and recycled ideas from his campaign trail, ideas like the new deal for Black America that he mentioned on the campaign trail, a proposal that you have heard a lot about tonight that embraces the same trickle-down economic assumptions that didn't work for African Americans in the past and certainly won't work today.  Mr.Speaker, during his campaign speech, Trump talked about gangs roaming the streets and how African American communities are being decimated by crime. He went so far as to say, overwhelmingly, the majority of Black people living in inner cities in the United States are ``living in hell.''  Well, Mr.Speaker, I want President Trump to know that I am I grew up in the United States inner city, but I didn't live in hell. And here I stand now, educated in the public schools, attended a historically Black university and college, and I am a Member of the United States  Mr.Trump said: ``We are one Nation--and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success.''  He was referencing mothers and children strapped in poverty in our inner cities. He was referencing rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation, and an education system flush with cash but leaving our young students deprived of knowledge.  Well, Mr.Speaker, I want to see his plans for public education. I want to see his plans for inner-city students. I want to see his plans flush with all that cash that he talked about going into our public schools. I want us to unite to help eradicate the cycle of poverty and eliminate the too-often traveled pipeline from underperforming schools to overcrowded prisons.  I want to see Mr.Trump's plan on criminal justice reform. I want a fair Attorney General vetted and confirmed because they will stand up every single day for equal rights of all Americans, for freedom of speech, for freedom to vote, and much more--not an Attorney General who lacks the ability to represent disenfranchised groups, not someone who fails to champion the least of us.                              {time}  2115  I have not seen those things in nominee  Lastly, I want Cabinet members who will be champions for our seniors--people like my 92-year-old mother. I want Cabinet members who will stand up for minorities and minority businesses. See, we need greater assistance in minority businesses and funds for minority business. I want Cabinet members who will build on and strengthen our healthcare system--yes, to make it greater, not to take away health care from 30 million people. Let me just say that I want to plan for workforce development programs and reentry training programs for those laid-off factory workers. I want to see plans for mothers and families because we certainly know, when women succeed, America succeeds.  Yes, Mr.I dare ask that women get equal pay for equal work.

10875,topic-id,2097,"Mr.President, our founders knew that ``while history does not repeat, it does rhyme.'' That is why they mined the politics of ancient Greece and Rome for lessons about the promise and the perils of self-government. In their wisdom, they placed those lessons at the heart of the American political experiment. Two hundred thirty years later, that experiment has exceeded their wildest hopes, in no small part because generation after generation of Americans--including elected officials, including Members of this body--understood that our government is far more than the sum of our laws or the letter of our Our system is also held together by rules, written and unwritten, that help elected officials resolve their differences without unleashing a downward spiral of recrimination that could endanger the Republic itself.  They understood, for example, that while civility, compromise, and cooperation are not required by law, laws cannot pass without them. They recognized that while the majority may have the power to rule on its own, it should not trample over the minority. They understood that, at some point, partisanship should give way to patriotism.  Throughout history, including moments far more difficult than our own, these principles were the quiet guardrails of our politics, keeping dysfunction at bay. But in recent years, we have begun tearing these guardrails down, and in doing so, we risk the revenge of history by ignoring it.  There is a tendency around here to think that our problems are unique and that the consequences of our actions are fleeting.  Some 2,400 years ago, the ancient history of Korsia was consumed by civil war. According to Thucydides, both sides spared ``no means,'' he wrote, ``in their struggles for ascendancy. . . . In their acts of vengeance they went to even greater lengths, not stopping at what justice or the good of the state demanded, but making the party caprice of the moment their own standard.''  As the civil war intensified, both sides struggled to end it because ``there was neither promise to be depended upon nor oath that could command respect; but all parties dwelling rather in their calculation upon the hopelessness of a permanent state of things, were more intent upon self-defence than capable of confidence.''  The Founders read They knew that once factions cross the line, once they violate tradition in an escalating retaliation, it becomes very hard to turn back.  James Madison in particular understood the peril of faction. He wrote how people with ``a zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points'' have ``divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to cooperate for their common good.''  They also feared that, once in power, majority factions would abuse that power to run roughshod over the minority. In a country with such diverse beliefs and traditions, doing so could threaten the very stability of the  For these reasons, the Founders embedded checks in the design of our government. That is why in the Senate we represent entire states, not gerrymandered districts. Colorado, for example, has roughly equal numbers of Democrats, Republicans, and That is why the Senate gives smaller States disproportionate representation, with Colorado receiving the same votes as  That is why traditions of the Senate hand the minority tools to encourage consensus between political parties. The filibuster is one of those tools, and it has been used for good and for ill throughout our history. By requiring the consent of 60 Senators to proceed on key votes, the filibuster ensures that the legislation we pass and the nominations we approve reflect at least a modest level of consensus. The filibuster is meant as a tool of last resort, but in recent years it has become yet another weapon in our endless partisan warfare. It was not always that way.  From George Washington to George Bush, the filibuster was used just 68 times against Presidential nominees. But during just the first 5 years of the Obama administration, Republicans used the filibuster 79 times against his nominees. That was my first term in the Senate, and at that time, I saw the filibuster the way many Americans still do--as an undemocratic tool for delay and gridlock. So in 2013, after unprecedented Republican obstruction of highly qualified nominees, I voted with the Democratic majority to end the 60-vote threshold for most Presidential nominations, invoking what is known as the nuclear option.  Although Republicans were wrong to abuse the rules, Democrats were wrong to change them. Even as we changed the rules, however, we made a point to retain the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, recognizing their profound influence on our country's laws.  Last year, dysfunction in the Senate reached a new low when Senator McConnell denied Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee for the vacancy left by the late Justice Scalia, the courtesy of even a hearing, to say nothing of a vote. That was an offense to the traditions of this body and our  I recognize that it is impossible to separate politics from the courts, but at the same time, we must not allow the judiciary--and especially the Supreme Court--to become a pure extension of our partisan elections and politics. Alexander Hamilton wrote that ``liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have everything to fear from its union with either of the other departments.'' Continuing, he wrote that because of ``the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches.''  Our actions over the last few years--and I would say over the last few days--jeopardize not only the Senate,[[Page S2347]]but also the judiciary. Today, some of my colleagues plan to filibuster President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil The Republican leadership has responded by threatening to invoke the nuclear option, which would eliminate for all time the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees and allow them to confirm Judge Gorsuch with the narrowest partisan majority. This is precisely the outcome our Founders feared, when lifetime appointments to our highest Court, which touches every aspect of American life, become just another partisan exercise. We must not go down this road.  This President may have several more opportunities to nominate a Supreme Court Justice during his term. If that happens, Republicans would face enormous pressure to nominate an extreme candidate, knowing that they could confirm them without a single Democratic vote--indeed, that they would be expected to confirm them without a single Democratic vote. And to those who believe that President Trump could not nominate someone more outside the mainstream than Judge Gorsuch, I would say to just look at some of President Trump's Cabinet nominees, some of whom are among the least qualified and most radical ever confirmed by this body. By the way, under the change to the rules that we made, it is the first Cabinet to be confirmed requiring just 51 and not 60 votes.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but if you don't like the ring of Judge Gorsuch, how do you feel about Justice Pruitt, who doesn't believe in climate change, or Justice Sessions, who has a record of opposing civil rights and equality? If we continue down this path, both of those could be confirmed with a slim majority vote.  With respect to Judge Gorsuch, I am proud he is from But I am concerned by his judicial approach, which too often seems to rely on the narrowest interpretation of the law with little appreciation for its context. In particular, I believe he has far too much confidence in the original meaning of the words in legislation or, for that matter, even the Having worked on legislation for nearly a decade now, I know these words, so often written in the dead of night in meager attempts to let everybody go home, cannot be explained without reference to the legislative context or human history or lawmakers' intent. Sometimes a comma really does end up in the wrong place.  Although I have reservations about his approach to the law, I do not have reservations about his qualifications for the He is a committed and honorable public servant, and that is why so many members of the Colorado bar and bench support his nomination. Qualified nominees deserve an up-or-down vote. That is the tradition of this body. How members vote is a matter of conscience for each of us.  For all of these reasons, and in the hope of preserving the minority's voice in our government, which so many generations before us have done, I will oppose efforts to filibuster this nomination. If we go down this road, we will undermine the minority's ability to check this administration and all those who follow.  Today we have a President who does not appreciate the separation of powers and who has made unprecedented attacks on the free press and the judiciary. The country needs an empowered Senate minority right now, more than ever. More than that, the country needs a Senate that can forge a consensus about our future, rather than carrying on the bitter and tired divisions of the past. I know it can be hard. I have been here long enough to know it can be hard for both sides to see beyond the partisan tactics of the moment. Lawmakers will never lack for an excuse to break with custom or change the rules to their benefit. They may even argue, as some recently have, that the damage is not that bad--that everything can continue on as normal.  We should know better than that. Our Founders certainly did. They would recognize our path today in the currents of history. The Roman Republic endured for nearly 500 years, but it was brought low by events that should seem eerily familiar to people in this  In 60 BCE, the Roman Senate was consumed by a controversial land reform initiative. One side was led by a Senator named Cato; the other, Julius To stop land reform and other initiatives, Cato employed delay tactics similar to the filibuster, freezing the Roman Senate for months. While the action was within the rules, it broke with Senate custom. Caesar vowed to press forward. Cato's allies responded by declaring a religious holiday for the rest of the legislative calendar, stopping the reform effort in its tracks.  In a further break with precedent, Caesar bypassed the Senate and took the bill to the people's assembly for approval. Furious, Cato's allies boycotted the government and postponed the next election by 3 months. While Caesar eventually triumphed, the incident intensified a cascade of recrimination that the Roman Senate struggled to escape. Legislative strikes, delayed elections, and believe it or not, shutdowns grew in frequency. Manufactured crises became routine.  As the dysfunction grew, the Senate became increasingly irrelevant, as power flowed to Caesar and military leaders. Even as Senators recognized the danger, they failed to correct course. Too much damage had been done. Centuries-long custom had been broken. Trust among Senators had eroded. Confidence in the body collapsed.  As dysfunction in the Senate rose, so did popular calls for a strongman to clean up the mess. Within a decade, Caesar crossed the Rubicon with an army, and the Republic soon gave way to tyranny. It would take 1,300 years for another large Republic to emerge--this time in the United States of  Unlike us, our Founders knew this history as well as their own. But they could not guarantee that we would heed its lessons. That is why they built institutions to check the worst impulses of faction, to help us navigate profoundly consequential decisions--like confirmations for the Supreme Court--without tearing each other apart. But the Founders also placed their faith in the willingness of elected officials to resist the lure of narrow interests or passions of the moment and rise up to defend their institutions and our traditions, especially in hard times. We must not betray their faith.  With each escalating crisis, we damage not just the Senate, but the The Rubicon may be far, but with each rule and custom broken, we draw nearer. Choices on both sides have brought us to this low point, but I have faith that we can choose--and we should choose--a different path. We can choose to step back from the brink to find common ground, to fulfill our obligation in the time we are serving here to sustain the American experiment for the next century and beyond.

That support speaks to the deep necessity for fundamental reform of the Federal Communications  As Members of Congress, we hear from constituents whose applications at the FCC are left to languish unresolved while consumers and businesses let opportunities slip by because they haven't received approval yet from a Federal Government agency. It is even worse when the FCC, under its public interest mandate, decides to put its[[Page H575]]thumb on the scale in favor of one technology sector or another, often without providing reasonable evidence that its intervention is necessary and appropriate.  While I have faith that Chairman Pai will bring about real reform at the FCC, without legislative changes, I am afraid that this type of jury-rigged rulemaking will return under a future administration. That is why I have supported this bill each time it has made its way through our committee and each time it has come to the House floor. I believe that strong process can restore the agency's integrity and rein it back in the interest of the stakeholders and the society that it should serve.  The bill requires the FCC to conduct a notice and comment rulemaking in order to adopt clear rules to guide its own process. By giving the FCC flexibility when setting procedures and deadlines, we are not hamstringing the agency; rather, we are providing them with goals to meet and allowing them to determine the best way to meet those goals.  We are asking the FCC to consider and adopt rules for itself that would provide clear deadlines on starting and stopping comments, clear deadlines for resolving petitions filed by the public, clear notice of status to those affected by petitions and rules, and clear schedules of statistical reports.  The bill also requires the FCC to consider publication of Commission documents to be considered at an open meeting and to consider whether cost-benefit analysis just might improve their rulemakings. This legislation also changes the existing Sunshine Act to allow for greater collaboration between  There was fine bipartisan work that went into these bills, and I thank my Democratic colleagues for working with us to improve the agency.

Today we are considering a very worthy piece of legislation, which has been introduced in each of the last two Congresses by Vice Chairman Barton, Vice Chairman Lance, and Representative All of them have put a lot of hard work into this bill, and I thank each of them for their dedication in pursuing a much-needed update to the Truth In Caller ID  Spoofing is the act of altering the number that will appear on the receiving end of the caller It is a trick that has been around for more than a decade. Spoofing provides a false identity to bad actors and criminals who seek to harass and defraud our hardworking taxpayers, oftentimes through various scams.  Sometimes the scams are elaborate, and other times they are simple. But these schemes are all petty; and once carried out, they are criminal. Spoofing lets the bad guys disguise their identity and will often pose as official entities, such as credit card companies, hospitals, and government agencies to target their unsuspecting victims. These crooks regularly target seniors and use intimidation tactics to extract personal and financial information.  The FCC has the authority to levy penalties and criminal fines against individuals that use fake caller ID information for the purpose of defrauding or harming another. However, current law only covers traditional voice calls. While this was considered a good fix when it was enacted in 2009, the Truth in Caller ID Act no longer sufficiently protects consumers. New communication methods and an evolving consumer trend towards text messaging have left the law with significant holes for the fraudsters to fly through and avoid prosecution.  H.423 would extend and clarify provisions of the Truth in Caller ID Act to include text messages and Voice over Internet Protocol services and would also apply the penalties to violators outside of the United  The bill would also seek to make it more challenging for those using fake caller ID information. In the past, you needed to have advanced skills and expensive equipment in order to spoof. Nowadays, it isn't hard. All someone needs to have is a smartphone and access to any of the various apps on the market that can instantly generate a fake caller  This is another classic case where technology has outpaced the laws that govern it. We will never be able to legislate ahead of technology advancement, nor should we try to do so. But when we find areas where legislation can help shield our consumers and hold the bad guys accountable, it is incumbent on us to act.  I believe that the legislation we are considering today is a good next step in our pursuit of stronger protection for our consumers. This bill will not prevent spoofing and it will not make our constituents invincible from the related scams and harassment, but what this bill does is important. By updating the law to more accurately reflect today's environment, we will be equipped to hold violators subject to the penalty of law.  I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH576.txt,1748,0915,2017.0,23.0,January
10960,topic-id,576,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the committee report for this legislation from the last                  H.423, Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017                  background and need for legislation       Spoofing is a practice in which a phone number shown on a      phone or caller identification device is deliberately      falsified, often to portray an official entity such as a      government agency or credit card company, typically with      malicious intent. Spoofing is a commonly used tool for a      number of illegal practices, including phishing for personal      information and swatting--calling in a fictitious crime in      progress in order to generate a police response. The original      Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 prohibits spoofing voice      caller identification. However, as communications methods and      consumer habits continue to evolve, so too do the attempts by      third parties to fraudulently gain personal information for      criminal use. Many Americans are now relying on text      messaging to stay connected, and this method of communication      has become a target for spoofing in much the same way voice      calls have been.       H.423 extends the provisions of the Truth in Caller ID      Act to include text messaging as well as Voice over Internet      Protocol services. The legislation, introduced by      Barton, Lance, and Meng, also addresses the growth      of services that allow users to knowingly transmit misleading      or inaccurate caller identification information by adding a      definition of ``spoofing service'' to the Truth in Caller ID            In amending H.423, the Committee significantly changed      the definitions of ``text message'' and ``text messaging      service.'' The changes are designed to exclude from these      definitions those online messaging services that use      traditional telephone numbers for the purpose of identifying      a user's account, just as other online services may use an      email address or username for a similar purpose. The excluded      services do not use telephone numbers to interconnect with      the public switched telephone network or enable communication      with individuals who do not subscribe to the same messaging      service. The Committee intends the Commission to devise its      rules using the meanings set forth in the legislation.      ``Short message service'' and ``multimedia message service''      should be narrowly interpreted consistent with current      industry standards (see, e.g., ETSI, Technical Specification,      3GPP TS 23.040 version 12.2.0 Release 12, ETSI TS 123 040      v12.2.0 (2014), available at www.etsi.org).       The Committee takes notice of the fact that the language      set forth in the version of H.423, as ordered reported, is      identical to the text relating to the same subject contained      in 253, the Communications Act Update Act of 2016, as      passed by the U.House of Representatives, on September 27,      2016. The House passed 253, as amended, by unanimous      consent. The foregoing discussion should therefore serve as      an explanation of that bill's provisions for purposes of      legislative history.             section-by-section analysis of the legislation       Section 1. Short title       This section provides that the Act may be cited as the      ``Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017''.       Section 2.

This section also requires the Commission, in coordination      with the Federal Trade Commission, to develop consumer      education materials regarding caller ID scams and      technologies that can help consumers protect themselves      against fraudulent activity.       This section also requires a Government Accountability      Office report on the actions taken by the Federal      Communications Commission and FTC to combat caller ID fraud.

10971,topic-id,646,"Mr.Speaker, one of the most disturbing aspects of the Republican attack on the Affordable Care Act and the success we have had in extending care to Americans has been the specific attack on Fourteen million of the 24 million people who will lose coverage under the Republican bill are under the Medicaid program. Medicaid is critical to the provision of health care in the United Medicaid covers more people than  Medicaid expansion has been transformational in the 31 States that took advantage of the provision in the Affordable Care Act to provide coverage to people who make up to 138 percent of poverty--roughly $16,600 for a single individual and almost $34,000 for a family of four.  Until then, Medicaid has provided extension of care to the elderly, to the poor, and to the disabled. It was helpful, but very restrictive. In some cases, people who earned a modest sum--$7,000, $10,000, $12,000--were ineligible, especially in those 19 States that refused to take advantage of the opportunity to expand the Medicaid coverage at Federal expense.  Mr.Speaker, this is So even though these poor, disabled people did not have access to Medicaid, many of them did ultimately secure health care. But they got it too late. They got it in the emergency room. They didn't get it in a clinic in a timely fashion. And, of course, the cost for that charity care in emergency rooms or in clinics was borne by the rest of us in increased costs for our insurance.  The Republican draconian provisions, even before they put into effect an absolutely unnecessary and unenforceable work requirement, will be devastating to millions. Bear in mind, these people now are receiving care in an appropriate clinic session. They will be getting it now when it is too late, and that burden shifted on to the rest of us.  There will be a tax credit that doesn't help people who don't have enough money to buy meaningful coverage in the private market. Under the Republican plan, coverage will become worse, deductibles and copays will become higher, and we risk destabilizing the insurance market for the rest of us.  Now, we have heard on the floor, in committee, and on the news shows our Republican friends and the President talking about the Affordable Care Act is in a death spiral and that the insurance industry is collapsing.  There was a fascinating article in the weekend New York Times that looked at the insurance industry. Since March of 2010, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the overall stock market has more than doubled. It has increased 136 percent. But the managed care health organizations have increased their stock value almost 300 percent. The largest, UnitedHealth, 480 percent.  A signal of an industry in a death spiral?  Absolutely not. The companies are healthy and investors are bidding up their stock. The CBO report that our Republican friends did not want us to have before we voted on the bill in committee in the middle of the night testifies to this underlying stability of the insurance market and the Affordable Care  Medicaid under the Republican plan will be shifted back increasingly to the States, which have repeatedly proven that they are incapable of maintaining high eligibility funding to help the poor and the near poor. And when budget crunches hit, it is the poor who suffer most with restrictions in their coverage.  We have also heard that the Republican plan will provide much-needed flexibility. That is nonsense. There is already ample flexibility under the Affordable Care I represent We were able to negotiate an agreement with the Federal Government under the 1115 waiver program that other States have that represented a unique partnership with the Federal Government to achieve better care, better results, and restrain Medicare costs. We have got the flexibility. There is no need to destroy the program.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2245.txt,99,NOMINATIONS,2017.0,21.0,March
10800,topic-id,1149,"Mr.President, I am pleased to be here with a number of my colleagues to oppose H.37. As it has just been announced, we will vote on it later today. I am glad to be joined by so many of my colleagues to fight against efforts to limit the application of the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order.  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I fought to ensure that harmful provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017 seeking to limit the applicability of this Executive order to DOD were stripped from the final bill signed into law in December, and I continue to feel strongly that we must do everything possible to defend American workers. That is what this issue concerns.  In 2014, President Obama issued a critical Executive order, the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order. Then, last summer, after thorough analysis and due diligence by the Department of Defense and several other agencies, he implemented what is known as the fair pay and safe workplaces rule. That rule requires companies doing business with the Federal Government to disclose when they violate any of 14 laws. The list of laws include some that are very familiar to all of us, like the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Civil Rights This list includes some other laws that may be somewhat more obscure, but those laws have been around for decades. They are well known in the workplace, and they are designed to protect[[Page S1592]]veterans, women, and people with disabilities from harmful, debilitating discrimination.  There is no requirement that companies disclose trivial allegations; rather, the rule requires disclosures of violations that rise to a determination by a court or administrative body of an actual violation or serious pending administrative proceeding by an agency. Companies would know of such violations.  Most companies play by the rules; all they need to do is check a box confirming they are in compliance. For those companies with compliance issues, the contracting agency would take information about those violations into consideration in the procurement process, and the contracting agency would then try to work with the company to make sure that it comes into compliance with the law. This Executive order is not about exclusion or about blackballing; in fact, it is about including and working with companies to bring them into compliance so they obey the law, knowing what the rules are, and wanting everybody to play by the same rules--not having an unfair advantage.  This rule is not about blackballing or blacklisting companies. It is about ensuring that, if they want to do business with the Federal Government, they follow the law and provide a safe and equitable workplace, protecting American workers--veterans, women, and people with disabilities--who may be victims of harmful, debilitating discrimination.  The rule is an effort to make Federal resources go to companies that are complying with the law or that are coming into compliance with Federal law. The reason behind it is to protect American workers, but it is also about creating a level playing field for all contractors and making sure there is a relationship of trust with contractors because we need partners who can be trusted to carry out the Federal Government's important work, especially in the area of building our defense weapons.  Companies that violate the law are creating an unlevel playing field, forcing law-abiding companies into unfair competition, potentially raising their costs. They skirt the law, saving dollars, presenting low-ball offers, based on noncompliance, cutting corners by, in effect, ducking their legal obligations. If they are hired, they are also at risk of providing poor performance because a company that violates the law and disregards its obligation is much more likely to disregard its moral as well as its legal duties in complying with the contract.  It is not just about saving dollars. It is about workers. Every year, tens of thousands of American workers are denied overtime wages, they are unlawfully victims of discrimination in hiring and pay, they have their health and safety put at risk by Federal contractors when they do cut corners, or they are denied basic workplace protections. That is another reason we need this rule, this Executive order, protecting workers and creating a level playing field.  Some have called the fair pay rule one of the most important advances for workers in years, and it is. According to one assessment, one in five Americans are employed by companies that do business with the Federal Ensuring that those one in five workers are protected helps countless It helps them in those workplaces, and it also sets a model for workplaces elsewhere.  It is basic, simple transparency that enables the American people to know who executive agencies task with the work, using taxpayer dollars. So requiring companies to disclose--and this rule is about disclosure--compliance records is something that many States, including Connecticut, already have in place through responsible bidder programs that use self-reporting to improve contractor quality by identifying companies with records of violating workplace laws, among other things.  President Trump was rightly praised by many of my colleagues in calling for a ``level playing field'' for businesses in his speech before us, in Congress, last week, and he has been lauded for saying we need to deliver ``better wages for Americans.'' Yet here we are, just weeks into the administration and this new Congress, and we are seeing what the real priorities unfortunately are. Once we put aside the rhetoric, actions are what matter, and these actions truly demoralize and destroy law-abiding companies' chances to compete fairly, and they decimate rights of workers to safe and fair workplaces.  I am troubled that rolling back this Executive order which I fought to achieve in the NDAA is so high a priority for the new administration and my colleagues here. Many organizations opposed this effort, and I am proud to join them in trying to forestall this rollback--the Easterseals organization, Paralyzed Veterans of America, VetsFirst, Vietnam Veterans of America, and many others who rightly fear that this course of action will do damaging injustice to our veterans and constituents with disabilities. It will also do potential damage to countless other workers involved in doing the people's work, such as performing contracts for the Federal Government funded with taxpayer dollars--our dollars--that can be used in discriminatory and unfair ways if this resolution is approved.  I urge my colleagues to vote against H.37 later today and protect the fair pay and safe workplaces rule. For the sake of our constituents--women, veterans, workers with disabilities, and businesses of America--we must reject this assault on fairness and common sense.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

10871,topic-id,3100,"Mr.President, we will vote today and tomorrow on the Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, in the midst of a looming constitutional crisis. Only in the past few weeks, the Director of the FBI has confirmed that his agency is investigating ties between President Trump's associates and Russian meddling in our recent election.  The urgent need for an impartial investigation and the possibility of the Supreme Court's having to rule on a subpoena directed to the President of the United States is very real. The repeat of United States v. Nixon is far from idle speculation. The independence of our judicial branch has never been more important. It has never been more threatened.  When the story of this constitutional crisis is written, I believe that the heroes will be an independent judiciary and a free press. An independent judiciary is the bulwark against overreaching and autocratic tyranny, and the free press has uncovered much of the facts that have prompted the FBI investigation and, I hope, eventually--sooner rather than later--an independent prosecutor because only a special prosecutor can bring criminal charges that will hold accountable wrongdoers who have broken our criminal laws.  In this constitutional crisis, respect for an independent judiciary is more important than ever before, but it is threatened by forces that are powerful and undeniable. It was threatened first by the denial to Merrick Garland of a hearing and a vote, relying on an invented principle found nowhere in the Constitution that the President of the United States--then Barack Obama--somehow lost his power to appoint Justices during the fourth year of his term. That act of political expediency demeaned this institution, the U.Senate, and it also disrespected our judiciary. It dragged the Supreme Court into the partisan mire that has caused such drastic dysfunction in this branch of government.  President Trump demonstrated his own disrespect for the judiciary through his constant, repeated, relentless attacks, calling one member of the bench a ``so-called judge'' simply because he ruled against him and struck down on constitutional grounds President Trump's illegal travel ban--really a Muslim ban. His demeaning and disparaging comments have attempted to shake the foundation of respect for judicial rulings that have held him accountable and potentially every President accountable to the American people, along with the Senate and the House of He has attempted to convince his audience that judges who rule against him are not only wrong but illegitimate--in one case, because of a judge's ethnic heritage.  I would have thought that there would have been bipartisan shock and outrage at such suggestions, but the silence across the aisle has been deafening. Such a campaign by the Executive against the judicial branch would be extraordinarily disturbing regardless of the circumstances but particularly so now in the midst of this constitutional challenge.  President Trump's disrespect for the judiciary was emphasized, as well, by how he selected his nominee for the Court and how he established a litmus test for that nominee. He proudly proclaimed that litmus test, declaring on multiple occasions that his nominee would automatically overturn Roe v. Wade and strike down gun violence prevention measures. He outsourced that selection process to extreme rightwing groups, like the Heritage Foundation, choosing from their list, from their preapproved selectees. Against this backdrop, President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme  I want to make clear that despite my outrage about what happened to Merrick Garland, which was far worse than a filibuster--one of my colleagues has termed it the ``filibuster of all filibusters''--and despite my deep concern over a nomination from a President who so disrespects the judicial branch, I was prepared to give Judge Gorsuch a fair hearing. I believe my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and I provided that hearing, and we will provide a vote.  I strongly believe that during this process, Judge Gorsuch had a special obligation to be forthcoming. I want to be clear that that is not opining on cases or controversies that may come before him or issues that may be before his Court if he is confirmed. Unlike prior nominees, he absolutely refused to say whether he agreed with core principles and precedents, well-established and long-accepted decisions of the Supreme Court that embody and enshrine principles that the American people have accepted and that they expect the Supreme Court to implement.  There is no tradition of a Supreme Court nominee's refusing to answer every question posed to him as Neil Gorsuch did, even questions about iconic cases. Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts answered unambiguously that they believed that Brown v. Board of Education was rightly decided. Justice Roberts also said of the decision in Griswold v. Connecticut: ``I agree with the Griswold Court's conclusion.'' On the related case of Eisenstadt v. Baird, Justice Alito said: ``I do agree with the result in Eisenstadt.'' Such statements do not prejudice any litigants or prejudge any cases; instead, they provided Senators and, more importantly, the American people with the confidence that these Justices adhere to long-settled legal principles that have formed the basis of critically important cases that came afterward. How far these principles may extend is a live issue, but their underlying legitimacy is not and should not be.  Unfortunately, at his hearing, Judge Gorsuch would tell us only that Griswold and Eisenstadt were precedents--or decisions--of the Court, and he doubled down on his evasiveness in response to written questions that were submitted just last week. There was no reason for him to diverge from the kinds of answers that were provided by Justice Roberts and Justice Alito unless he, unlike them, disagreed with the reasoning that was used in these cases.  These cases go to the core of the right to privacy and equal treatment under the rule of law. The constitutional right to privacy underlies not[[Page S2343]]just the rights of couples to use contraception, which was the issue in Griswold and Eisenstadt, but the right of women to control their own bodies, as established in Roe v. Wade, and couples of different races to marry, as established in Loving v. Virginia, or the right of same-sex couples to equal treatment, as established in Lawrence v. Texas and Obergefell v. Justice Brandeis, in one of the original privacy decisions, called this right to privacy ``the right to be left alone,'' and it is a core constitutional principle that Chief Justice Roberts endorsed as well.  If Judge Gorsuch does not believe in this fundamental right or equal protection under the rule of law, the American people deserve to know it. Unfortunately, his continued evasion of my questions and those of others tells a different story. I am left with the inescapable conclusion that Judge Gorsuch passed the Trump litmus test--an automatically anti-choice, pro-gun conservative and an acolyte of hard-right special interests who screened and selected his name. Yet I am equally and maybe more concerned by Judge Gorsuch's approach to cases dealing with worker safety and consumer rights, issues relating to clean air and water and the fundamental role of the public sector in protecting individuals and putting their rights above corporate interests.  The important concerns my colleagues and I have raised have been caricatured by some Senate Republicans to a belief that judges should always rule for sympathetic plaintiffs, and that is simply not so. The TransAm Trucking case, which has been discussed at length on the floor and in committee, is of concern not because of the individual but because of the reasoning he used. He relied on a handpicked dictionary definition to rule against a worker who left his truck as he was under threat of grave physical peril and perhaps death, and he distorted the meaning of the statute, leaving aside basic common sense and feeling. He called Congress's declared statutory purpose--protecting health and safety--too ``ephemeral and generic'' to provide an interpretive guide. That is how he characterized our purpose here in protecting the safety of workers. This approach shows that Judge Gorsuch looks for guidance not in the words that Congress has chosen but in his own dictionary. And it may not even be Webster's; it may be the dictionary that is in his head or is in the heads of the rightwing groups who screened and proposed his name.  Then there is Judge Gorsuch's open hostility to the Chevron doctrine, which is a term that was likely meaningless and incomprehensible to most Americans before these proceedings and may be again after we are done. Yet it is a profoundly important principle of law that essentially stands against judicial activism--the very defect that many of our Republican colleagues believe is too characteristic of the courts today.  The structure of our government depends on the flexibility of these agencies that protect the purity of our drinking water, the safety of workers on construction sites, the integrity of our financial markets, and much, much more, so that it may do its job and enforce rules and laws that provide not only protection for ordinary people, everyday Americans, but also a level playing field for the good guys who want to do the right thing, and they are the majority of businesses in this country.  The proposed abandoning of the Chevron doctrine that Judge Gorsuch supports would eviscerate the enforcement of these basic rules that protect workers and consumers--people who drink water in their homes and breathe the air and go to work every day and expect to come home safely, as well as people who invest their money in a way that is protected against fraud.  As Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner wrote this Sunday in the New York Times:       Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that Congress can use broadly      written laws to delegate authority to agencies in the first      place. That can only mean that at least portions of such      statutes--the source of so many regulations that safeguard      Americans' welfare--must be sent back to Congress, to redo or      not.  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 1, 2017]                  The Government Gorsuch Wants To Undo                   (By Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner)       At recent Senate hearings to fill the Supreme Court's open      seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch came across as a thoroughly bland      and nonthreatening nominee. The idea was to give as little      ammunition as possible to opponents when his nomination comes      up this week for a vote, one that Senate Democrats may try to      upend with a filibuster.       But the reality is that Judge Gorsuch embraces a judicial      philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the      structure of modern government--including the rules that keep      our water clean, regulate the financial markets and protect      workers and consumers. In strongly opposing the      administrative state, Judge Gorsuch is in the company of      incendiary figures like the White House adviser Steve Bannon,      who has called for its ``deconstruction.'' The Republican-     dominated House, too, has passed a bill designed to severely      curtail the power of federal agencies.       Businesses have always complained that government      regulations increase their costs, and no doubt some      regulations are ill-conceived. But a small group of      conservative intellectuals have gone much further to argue      that the rules that safeguard our welfare and the orderly      functioning of the market have been fashioned in a way that's      not constitutionally legitimate. This once-fringe cause of      the right asserts, as Judge Gorsuch put it in a speech last      year, that the administrative state ``poses a grave threat to      our values of personal liberty.''       The 80 years of law that are at stake began with the New      President Franklin Roosevelt believed that the Great      Depression was caused in part by ruinous competition among      companies. In 1933, Congress passed the National Industrial      Recovery Act, which allowed the president to approve ``fair      competition'' standards for different trades and industries.      The next year, Roosevelt approved a code for the poultry      industry, which, among other things, set a minimum wage and      maximum hours for workers, and hygiene requirements for      slaughterhouses. Such basic workplace protections and      constraints on the free market are now taken for granted.       But in 1935, after a New York City slaughterhouse operator      was convicted of violating the poultry code, the Supreme      Court called into question the whole approach of the New      Deal, by holding that the N.I.R.was an ``unconstitutional      delegation by Congress of a legislative power.'' Only      Congress can create rules like the poultry code, the justices      said. Because Congress did not define ``fair competition,''      leaving the rule-making to the president, the N.I.R.     violated the Constitution's separation of powers.       The court's ruling in Schechter Poultry v. the United      States, along with another case decided the same year, are      the only instances in which the Supreme Court has ever struck      down a federal statute based on this rationale, known as the      ``nondelegation doctrine.'' Schechter Poultry's stand against      executive-branch rule-making proved to be a legal dead end,      and for good reason. As the court has recognized over and      over, before and since 1935, Congress is a cumbersome body      that moves slowly in the best of times, while the economy is      an incredibly dynamic system. For the sake of business as      well as labor, the updating of regulations can't wait for      Congress to give highly specific and detailed directions.       The New Deal filled the gap by giving policy-making      authority to agencies, including the Securities and Exchange      Commission, which protects investors, and the National Labor      Relations Board, which oversees collective bargaining between      unions and employers. Later came other agencies, including      the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety      and Health Administration (which regulates workplace safety)      and the Department of Homeland Still other agencies      regulate the broadcast spectrum, keep the national parks      open, help farmers and assist Americans who are overseas.      Administrative agencies coordinated the response to 11,      kept the Ebola outbreak in check and were instrumental to      ending the last financial crisis. They regulate the safety of      food, drugs, airplanes and nuclear power plants. The      administrative state isn't optional in our complex society.      It's indispensable.       But if the regulatory power of this arm of government is      necessary, it also poses a risk that federal agencies, with      their large bureaucracies and potential ties to lobbyists,      could abuse their power. Congress sought to address that      concern in 1946, by passing the Administrative Procedure Act,      which ensured a role for the judiciary in overseeing rule-     making by agencies.       The system worked well enough for decades, but questions      arose when Ronald Reagan came to power promising to      deregulate. His E.P.sought to weaken a rule, issued by the      Carter administration, which called for regulating      ``stationary sources'' of air pollution--a broad wording that      is open to interpretation. When President Reagan's E.P.     narrowed the definition of what counted as a ``stationary      source'' to allow plants to emit more pollutants, an      environmental group challenged the agency. The Supreme Court      held in 1984 in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council      that the E.P.(and any agency) could determine the[[Page S2344]]     meaning of an ambiguous term in the law. The rule came to be      known as Chevron deference: When Congress uses ambiguous      language in a statute, courts must defer to an agency's      reasonable interpretation of what the words mean.       Chevron was not viewed as a left-leaning decision. The      Supreme Court decided in favor of the Reagan administration,      after all, voting 6 to 0 (three justices did not take part),      and spanning the ideological spectrum. After the conservative      icon Justice Antonin Scalia reached the Supreme Court, he      declared himself a Chevron fan. ``In the long run Chevron      will endure,'' Justice Scalia wrote in a 1989 article,      ``because it more accurately reflects the reality of      government, and thus more adequately serves its needs.''       That was then. But the Reagan administration's effort to      cut back on regulation ran out of steam. It turned out that      the public often likes regulation--because it keeps the air      and water clean, the workplace safe and the financial system      in working order. Deregulation of the financial system led to      the savings-and-loans crisis of the 1980s and the financial      crisis a decade ago, costing taxpayers billions.       Businesses, however, have continued to complain that the      federal government regulates too much. In the past 20 years,      conservative legal scholars have bolstered the red-tape      critique with a constitutional one. They argued that only      Congress--not agencies--can create rules. This is Schechter      Poultry all over again.       And Judge Gorsuch has forcefully joined in. Last year, in a      concurring opinion in an immigration case called Gutierrez-     Brizuela v. Lynch, he attacked Chevron deference, writing      that the rule ``certainly seems to have added prodigious new      powers to an already titanic administrative state.''      Remarkably, Judge Gorsuch argued that Chevron--one of the      most frequently cited cases in the legal canon--is      illegitimate in part because it is out of step with (you      guessed it) Schechter Never mind that the Supreme      Court hasn't since relied on its 1935 attempt to scuttle the      New Nonetheless, Judge Gorsuch wrote that in light of      Schechter Poultry, ``you might ask how is it that Chevron--a      rule that invests agencies with pretty unfettered power to      regulate a lot more than chicken--can evade the chopping      block.''       At his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch hinted that he      might vote to overturn Chevron without saying so directly,      noting that the administrative state existed long before      Chevron was decided in 1984. The implication is that little      would change if courts stopped deferring to the E.P.A.'s or      the Department of Labor's reading of a statute. Judges would      interpret the law. Who could object to that?       But here's the thing: Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that      Congress can use broadly written laws to delegate authority      to agencies in the first place. That can mean only that at      least portions of such statutes--the source of so many      regulations that safeguard Americans' welfare--must be sent      back to Congress, to redo or not.       On the current Supreme Court, only Justice Clarence Thomas      seeks to strip power from the administrative state by      undercutting Chevron and even reviving the obsolete and      discredited nondelegation doctrine, as he explains in      opinions approvingly cited by Judge But President      Trump may well appoint additional justices, and the other      conservatives on the court have expressed some uneasiness      with Chevron, though as yet they are not on board for      overturning it. What would happen if agencies could not make      rules for the financial industry and for consumer,      environmental and workplace protection? Decades of experience      in the United States and around the world teach that the      administrative state is a necessary part of the modern market      economy. With Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, we will be      one step closer to testing that premise.

10872,topic-id,424,"His philosophy represents the height of activism, because it would allow courts to substitute their policy judgments for agency expertise. Abandoning the Chevron doctrine and the principles it represents invokes a desire to destroy a broad array of rules that protect critical rights. One such rule was issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the aftermath of a Connecticut tragedy at L'Ambiance Plaza decades ago when a collapse killed 28 workers in Bridgeport, The rule prohibiting the use of the lift slab construction technique that led to L'Ambiance's collapse has now saved the lives of others. But would it have survived a review by Judge Gorsuch? My fear is that he would have struck it down and substituted the activist instinct of a judge instead--protecting the corporations that might use it.  Today we still know very little about Judge Gorsuch's core beliefs because he evaded so many questions. But here is what we do know. We know that the man who hired him has said he passes his rightwing litmus test. We know that conservative organizations have spent millions of dollars on the prospect that he will move American law dramatically to the right. And we know that he will not answer questions that his Republican-appointed predecessors answered about core tenets of American jurisprudence. In short, he has left us with substantial doubt.  Let me conclude on this note--that doubt. Important and critical doubt that should preclude us from confirming him today leaves women wondering how long they will have autonomy over their healthcare decisions, same-sex couples questioning whether they might be denied the right to marry the person they love, workers and consumers doubting their rights, and Americans fearing the Court will abandon protections of privacy, equality, and the rule of law.

10852,topic-id,747,"Mr.President, the Senate is at a crossroads. Senate Democrats at the behest of far-left activist groups are leading the charge to break a 230-year-old precedent of confirming Supreme Court nominees by a simple majority vote. Why?  Well, when you go down the list, there is only one reason. That reason is not based on substance or reality; it is purely partisan. Judge Gorsuch is eminently qualified. That does not seem to be in dispute. His credentials are exceptional. His resume is impressive. His judicial demeanor, professional competence, and integrity all exceed what you expect in a nominee for the highest Court in the land.  Judge Gorsuch checks every box, so much so, that the American Bar Association gave Judge Gorsuch its highest rating. The ABA's assessment, mind you, has been referred to by the minority leader as the ``gold standard'' when it comes to evaluating a nominee's fitness to serve on the Senate Democrats must be concerned about Judge Gorsuch's past then. Again, that is not the case. No one was able to dig up anything remotely resembling a scandal in Judge Gorsuch's past during this process. You can't manufacture a controversy where none exists. Nothing about Judge Gorsuch has come to light during this confirmation process that could conceivably merit blocking a vote on the nominee.  I have heard some Democrats try and argue that Judge Gorsuch is out of the mainstream. That hasn't stuck, either. This is a judge who has been with the majority of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals 99 percent of the time, and 97 percent of his decisions were unanimous. Judge Gorsuch is about as mainstream as you are going to find.  Editorial boards from newspapers across the country, including USA Today, have written in support of his nomination. Does anyone honestly believe that USA Today, which is far from a conservative newspaper, would support confirming Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court if he were out of the mainstream?  Now Senate Democrats are seemingly creating new standards out of thin air to justify this blatantly partisan action. According to the talking points, the nominee is now expected to tell the Senate and the American people exactly how he or she would rule on matters that may come before the Court, especially the instances where the activist base has a very keen interest. As the Judiciary chairman rightly pointed out, the standards set by Justice Ginsburg in her confirmation hearings that it would be inappropriate for a nominee to offer hints or make commitments on matters that may come before the Court have been adhered to ever since.  This leaves Senate Democrats with a filibuster that lacks a reason. The minority leader has suggested that the Senate abandon Judge Gorsuch's nomination if cloture is not agreed to and ask the President to submit a new nominee. This demand rings hollow. Here is the truth: If this nominee cannot get the Senate Democrats' blessings for a vote, then no nominee put forward by the President can.  Again, we are talking about a top rung in his profession. Judge Gorsuch is well qualified, and he was unanimously confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court of As I mentioned earlier, he received the highest possible rating after an exhaustive evaluation from the American Bar  Senate Democrats failed to create outrage and controversy over Judge Gorsuch's nomination because there is simply none to be found, but that didn't stop them. They made this amazing 180-degree turnaround. Senate Democrats who just last year pushed for an immediate vote at the height of a contentious Presidential election now appear to be fine with leaving that seat vacant literally for years. Just last year the minority leader sounded the alarm about the judicial chaos a deadlocked Court could lead to. He appears to be no longer concerned about that. By this logic, a vacancy on the Supreme Court for a few months would be a devastating blow to democracy, but one held vacant for years would be acceptable. This makes absolutely no sense. The only explanation for it is that Senate Democrats expect to be voting on a nominee put forth by a Democratic administration, not one put forth by President  Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed to the Supreme Court this week. It is unfortunate that we may have to break longstanding precedent to do so, but Senate Democrats actually are to blame for that.[[Page S2328]]  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.

10816,topic-id,702,"Mr.President, Americans are working longer and Americans are working harder than ever before, with less and less to show for it.  Over the last 40 years, GDP has gone up, corporate profits have gone up, executive salaries have gone up--all because American workers are more productive. Again, GDP is up, corporate salaries are up, corporate profits are up, executive salaries are up--all because of the productivity of American workers. Unfortunately--tragically--a big problem in our society is that workers don't share in the economic growth they have created for their companies.  On Friday, at the John Glenn School in Columbus, I rolled out a plan to do something about it. Instead of working to raise wages, the Senate is debating a measure to give large corporations even more ability, more leeway, more opportunity to shortchange American workers. It is as simple as that. One in five Americans works in a company that does some business with the American We are talking about a rule that affects companies employing as much as one-fifth of the workforce. These workers deserve to be paid what they earn. They deserve safe workplaces, just as all American workers do.  Before this worker protection rule was put in place, nearly one-third of the companies in the United States with the worst safety and health violations were receiving taxpayer dollars in the form of Federal contracts. Federal dollars are going to these companies. They then turn around and hire workers in contract with the government and hire workers and cheat them and shortchange them. These corporations broke the law. They didn't pay their employees what they were owed or they broke health and safety rules. Yet they continue to rake in Federal dollars. That is unfair to workers. It is unfair to the good companies that play by the rules. It is unfair to those who are undercut, competitors that willfully and constantly follow the law. The good companies often are losing out. They are playing by the rules, yet lose out to the companies that aren't.  That is why the Obama administration put in place the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order. If you want the privilege of doing business with American taxpayers, if you want a contract with the Federal government paid for by taxpayers, you must follow the law. It is as simple as that. That was yesterday. Also, yesterday the rule ensured that workers have accurate information about the hours they work, the overtime pay they can earn, the wages they are being paid--basic things that above-board companies are already doing anyway. That was yesterday.  Today this body is voting to undo that. Why would we want to roll back commonsense worker protections? Why would we reward companies that cheat their workers by giving them more taxpayer dollars? There is only one possible explanation: to make it easier for some big companies to cheat both their own workers and their competitors. When voters reject Washington, it is maneuvers like this they have in mind: Congress watering down rules that protect workers, that protect taxpayers, that let corporations that break the law off the hook.  The President came to Ohio a lot last year. He made a lot of big promises during his campaign. He is already facing a choice on issues like this one. Is he going to keep his promises to working families in Trumbull County, OH, Warren, Mansfield, Toledo, Springfield[[Page S1600]]or is he going to sell them out in favor of the same old corporate billionaire agenda?  The President has come to a fork in the road. He can go down the fork where workers will do better in this administration--make better wages, have a safer workplace--or he can take the other fork in the road that undercuts wages, that shortchanges workers, that makes the workplace less safe. Unfortunately, the President and, I am afraid, this Senate have chosen that fork in the road, the one that undercuts workers and makes the workplace less safe.  I hope my colleagues will join me in rejecting this attempt to undercut American workers.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

10876,topic-id,1614,"Mr.President, I always appreciate the remarks--the well-thought-through remarks of my colleague, and the history lesson putting it into context is always so important and something we should do more of in this body.  I thank Senator Bennet for his words.  The Supreme Court, as we know, has tremendous influence over the lives of our country, the lives of Ohioans, my State, and the lives of so many. Nominees must defend the rights of all Americans to make their own healthcare decisions, to collectively bargain for safe workplaces and fair pay, and to be protected from discrimination and Wall Street greed.  Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch is simply not that nominee. His record is clear. He has ruled that corporations are people. I am not a lawyer, but I understand that it is a relatively recent concept in American jurisprudence to equate corporations with people. When you do that, you simply give corporations more rights than individuals have. When you come from that position, it means that judges repeatedly rule to choose corporations over workers; they choose polluters over communities; they choose Wall Street over consumer protections; they choose special interest money over our citizens. We have seen too much of that in this country.  We have seen a decline of the middle class, in part because the Federal judiciary is choosing corporations over[[Page S2348]]workers. If chosen, polluters over communities; if chosen, Wall Street over consumer protections; if chosen, special interest money over citizens--that is the Court we have seen in far too many 5-to-4 decisions, as Senator Whitehouse has pointed out so effectively on this floor.  The misguided idea that corporations are people is far outside the mainstream of what most Ohioans believe. It may work for graduates of Harvard and Yale Law Interestingly, if Judge Gorsuch is approved, all nine of the Supreme Court Justices will have attended Harvard or Yale Law I don't know what is wrong with Ohio State or the University of Toledo or Akron University or University of Cincinnati or Case Western or Michigan or Chicago or anywhere else. That is whom Presidents have chosen; those are the people we seem to confirm.  But this view that corporations are people simply doesn't wash with the American people. It is how we got rules that allow Wall Street banks and hedge funds to wreak havoc on ordinary working people and ordinary working families, with no consequences.  Judge Gorsuch himself has argued against the rights of working Americans to band together to hold Wall Street and corporations accountable. He ruled against children with autism. He ruled against students with disabilities. We have a President in the White House who makes fun of disabled people. Now, we are going to put a Justice on the Court who rules against students with disabilities. We have a Secretary of Education who barely knew what IDEA was--the provision of the law that guarantees disabled students an education.  Why we are moving in this direction, I think, amazes most people in this country, whether you have a disabled person in your family or not. His views of protecting students with disabilities are so outside the mainstream that last month, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected his reasoning.  A boy with autism, Luke, wasn't making progress in school, and it was recommended that he be placed in a residential program. An impartial hearing officer and two different judges agreed. But Judge Gorsuch disagreed. He said that, as long as a student with a learning disability is making ``merely . . . more than de minimus'' progress in his or her education, the school district didn't have to do anything else. Think of that. That student, he counts a little bit, but he really doesn't count that much. He doesn't count as a full human being with full rights and full citizenship in this country.  If your disabled child is getting more than nothing, I guess that is good enough, according to Judge Luckily, this Supreme Court, as conservative as it usually is, overturned Judge Gorsuch's precedent that denied a real education to students like Again, they overturned him unanimously. Chief Justice Roberts noted that a student offered an educational program providing merely more than de minimus progress from year to year--this is Justice Roberts, a very conservative Chief Justice--can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.  In other words, what Judge Gorsuch thinks and thought about this case was that doing only a little bit for this student was meeting the obligation of this civilized society that we are proud of. Fortunately, the eight members of the Supreme Court--four Republican conservative nominees, four more moderate to liberal nominees from the Democrats--unanimously came together and disagreed with Judge  But think about what can happen the next time. If an Ohio family has a child with a learning disability and struggles with that school system, they won't find sympathy from Justice In fact, forget sympathy. They can't count on him to protect their child under the law.  Take a look at the case of Alphonse Maddin, the truckdriver from He was hauling meat through Illinois when he stopped to refuel. His brakes froze. He was stranded. He called for help, for a company repair unit. He waited for hours for help. He nearly froze to death. He couldn't feel his legs. It was 14-degrees below zero in the truck. He needed to get to shelter or risk losing his limbs or worse.  But his company fired him. They claimed he abandoned his cargo. Mr.Maddin later returned to get the cargo and completed his job. But it just did not matter to the company. To the company, the cargo was more important than Mr.Maddin's life. To Judge Gorsuch, that company's interests were more important than Mr.Maddin, more important than his health, more important than his life.  Imagine that. That is what we mean when we say he puts corporations ahead of workers. At the beginning, you remember I said there is this relatively new idea in American jurisprudence that corporations are individuals and people are corporations. When you say that, it means that you side with corporations over workers. You side with polluters over communities. You side with Wall Street over consumer protections. You side with big, dark money from billionaires in Citizens United over citizens.  Take a look at the case of a mother who had leukemia and had to take time off for treatment. After the treatment was over, her doctors advised her not to return to work quite yet. There was a flu epidemic. Her immune system was compromised from chemotherapy. But her employer told her she needed to show up within a week or they would fire her despite 15 years of dedicated service. Guess who Judge Gorsuch sided with? It was not the worker suffering from cancer, who had dedicated a decade and a half of her life to her employer and who wanted to return to work, but she simply was advised against it by her doctor.  This woman's daughter, Katherine, said that when Judge Gorsuch issued his ruling, ``he didn't even think about the impact that this had on our family.'' She said his ruling ``set the precedent that a company's needs come before workers like her mother.''  At a time when Americans work longer and harder than ever before, when we devalue work in this country, when workers' wages--for huge percentages of workers in this country--are stagnant, when people work longer and harder with less and less to show for it, the last thing we need to do is elevate someone who sees workers as nothing more than a cost to be minimized.  That is what is at stake here. We are talking about putting someone on the Court who wants to give corporations special rights, but he has a record of ignoring the rights of ordinary citizens, choosing corporations over people, saying that corporations are, in fact, people. That means that he is almost always, in his cases, choosing corporations over workers, choosing polluters over communities.  Judge Gorsuch's record makes clear that he would turn back the clock on a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions, or LBGT rights, or clean air and clean water, or safe food and medicine.  That is what is at stake here. If the Senate does not reject his nomination, the decisions Judge Gorsuch hands down will haunt our Nation for generations. My opposition to this nominee has nothing to do with what has occurred in the Senate over the past 8 years, as despicable as it has been. It has everything to do with what could happen over the next 100.  This is about our children and our grandchildren. Seven of the eight current justices have met the 60-vote benchmark. In other words, seven of the eight justices on the Court right now were fairminded enough and centrist enough and agreeable enough that far more than 60 Senators--people in both parties--came together to confirm those nominees.  With so much at stake, it is up to Judge Gorsuch to earn the votes of 60 Members of this body. I do not believe someone who fundamentally wants to give and has given corporations more rights than individual citizens has earned that broad support. The solution is not to change the rules; it is to change the nominee.  That is what we mean by advice and consent. The American people need a Supreme Court Justice who looks out for the interests of all Americans, not just the 1 percent, not just the most powerful, not just the most privileged.

We are showing that seniors and veterans are at a greater risk for homelessness and that about a 60-percent increase in the need for affordable housing is being driven by Americans who are paying more than 50 percent of their income in rent, making it an unaffordable situation.  We are introducing this important legislation that, we hope, will build 400,000 additional affordable housing units across the United States and that will also help create additional jobs.  This is an issue that we are sending to the Finance Committee before, and I would hope my colleagues on the Finance Committee would take swift action. I say that because the report found three key factors. One is an increase of 9 million renters since 2005. That is a huge increase since 2005. How did we get there?  Over 7 million Americans lost their homes due to foreclosure in the economic crisis. As a result, home ownership rates have been at their lowest levels since the mid-1960s. Over the last 10 years, we have seen the largest gain in the number of renters in any 10-year period of time on record. That is right. We increased the number of renters in this last 10-year period of time more than at any other time on the books.  It kind of makes sense if you think about it. If the economic crisis caused you to downsize, and you were in a home and you could no longer afford it,[[Page S1593]]you would put pressure on the rental market. For those already in the rental market, it pushed many of them out of market-based rates and into solutions that were less affordable. As we all know, in major cities and urban areas across our country, it caused an actual homelessness crisis, as well, as many people could no longer even afford basic rent.  The affordable housing crisis is exploding all over the country, and we face pressures from all sides. Demand for rental housing has increased by 21 percent, but we are building units at the lowest rate since 1970. It does not take more than basic economics to see that, with demand so high and supply so low, we need to do something if we are going to make a dent in this problem. If we do not increase the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, then, by the year 2025, we are going to have 15 million Americans who are spending more than half of their income on rent, and this is truly unacceptable.  Our report shows that in the last decade the total number of Americans who have faced this extreme housing problem--that is, paying more than half of their incomes in rent--ballooned by 60-percent, and that has put a lot of pressure on many of our For my home State, the affordability crisis is actually getting worse than the national average. Since 2000, median rents have risen by 7.6 percent, which is 2.5 percent higher than in the rest of the country. As I said, it is all of those people coming from the foreclosure market into the rental market. On average, there is about a 3.5-percent increase in rents across the United In addition, there are 16 percent fewer affordable rental homes available in Washington State compared to the U.average. Overall, 400,000 Washingtonians are paying more than half of their monthly incomes in rent.  We saw these numbers, and we saw specifically how seniors and veterans and homelessness are also driving the increase in demand. Senior unaffordability, which is the term given to people who are paying more than half of their incomes in rent, rose by 30 percent. With the veteran unaffordability, which is the number of the veterans who are returning and being part of the housing market, we will see an increase of over 500,000 veterans who need affordable housing.  I think the Acting President pro tempore knows well that in his home State there are people who are trying to provide solutions in small towns and urban areas for our veterans so that they can have affordable places to live. The report also shows that doing nothing is going to continue to exacerbate the problem. We will see another 25-percent increase in unaffordability. That is just unacceptable.  To help solve the problem of affordable housing, my colleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and I are reintroducing the bipartisan Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act to strengthen and expand the Low-Income Housing Tax  Under this provision, the expanded tax credit would help create and preserve 1.3 million affordable homes over a 10-year period of time, which would be an increase of 400,000 new units nationwide. According to the National Association of Home Builders, annual LIHTC development--this is the overall appropriation--supports approximately 95,700 jobs and $9.1 billion in wages. Investing in the low-income housing tax credit, which gives our citizens more affordable housing, is good for them, but it is also good for our economy. Enacting the proposal would create an additional 450,000 jobs over the next 10 years and would support the construction of these important units.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the National Association of Home Builders that talks about the economic benefit of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and this particular proposal, with their estimates of increased Federal revenue of $11.4 billion, State and local revenue of $5.6 billion, and a total of 452,000 jobs being created in that 10-year period of time.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           National Association of                                                Home Builders,                                Washington, DC, November 11, 2016.

10803,topic-id,383,"Mr.President, I enter that into the Record because it is so important for our colleagues not to get stymied over the next several months, as we discuss proposals for economic development and for infrastructure across the United States, and not take action on this issue because we do not know how we can afford it. What we cannot afford is the rising number of Americans who no longer can afford rent or home ownership. What we need to do is to make sure that there is a roof over their heads and that they can be productive parts of our economy.  Since its creation over the last 30 years, this tax credit has financed nearly 2.9 million homes across the United States, leveraging more than $100 billion in private sector investment. That is what I like most--a little bit of the tax credit going a long way to leverage the private sector into making investments in affordable housing. Between 1986 and 2013, more than 13 million people have lived in homes that have been financed by this tax credit.  I hope my colleagues will take a look at this legislation that we are introducing today and help us support it. The crisis is real across Our report shows the crisis is only going to be exacerbated because of demographics and demand. The best way out of this problem is for us to make an investment that only we can make, as 90 percent of the affordable homes are built with the tax credit. Without increasing the tax credit by 50 percent, we are just writing our own statistics for a very, very dire situation across the United States of  I see communities in my State that look like and reflect pictures that I have seen from the Great I know the recession hit us hard, but we have to climb out of this homelessness problem by making an investment in the affordable housing tax credit.

10825,topic-id,3031,"Madam President, I take this time to explain to the people of Maryland and our Nation my views on Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United  There is no more important responsibility that a Member of the Senate has than the advice and consent of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Of the many important responsibilities we have, this is one of the most important responsibilities.  I have taken this on to try to understand as much as I can about Judge Gorsuch, to understand the dynamics of what his membership on the Supreme Court would mean, because I recognize it is not just an appointment for this term of This is a lifetime appointment, and it is very possible that he, if confirmed, will serve on the Supreme Court for a generation. So his impact on the workings of the Supreme Court is something that is extremely important to each Member of the  I think many of us are looking for an Associate Justice who can bring about more consensus on the Supreme Court, who can try to deal with some of the great divisions in our Nation in a way that represents the values of our Constitution, that will allow our Nation to move forward in a united way.  We also recognize that the Senate must give an independent evaluation of a Supreme Court This is not because the President of your party nominated someone to the Supreme Court, whether you support or oppose; it is the independent review process that each Senator undertakes to determine whether the nominee should get our support.  So what I look at is someone who would be a mainstream jurist, who is sensitive to the civil rights of all Americans, who would understand the importance of our Constitution, which has been a Constitution that has expanded rights and not one that we would look at ways to move in the wrong direction on extending constitutional protections--that is, move backward rather than forward.  First, let me start by stating that I am troubled by the process President Trump followed in nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme During his campaign, he talked about a litmus test for Supreme Court Justices, that they must be pro-life in the mold of Justice The list that was submitted to him in which Judge Gorsuch was a part was proposed by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist That is not a good way to start a process of bringing in a consensus nominee to the Supreme Court of the United  To my knowledge, there was no consultation with any Democrats prior to the nomination being made. The reason why consultation with all Members of the Senate is important is that if you engage in real understanding as to what the Senate--and we represent the entire country--is looking for in a Supreme Court Justice, you have a much better chance of ending up with a nominee who is going to enjoy broader support, bipartisan support, real bipartisan support in the U.Senate, and then the 60-vote threshold does not become a hurdle.  There is a reason we have the rules we do in the Senate, and the 60-vote concept on a controversial nominee is so that we don't end up with an extreme candidate who would end up being on the Supreme Court of the United States, that there must be that process that would generate 60 votes.  So despite my concern about the process that was initiated by President Trump in the nomination, I have tried to look at all of the opportunities to understand Judge Gorsuch's record and his likely actions as a member of the Supreme I took the time to meet with Judge Gorsuch, and I found that interview, that process, to be extremely helpful in understanding his judicial philosophy. I monitored the hearings that took place in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I found that testimony to be helpful. I reviewed the testimony of experts who had submitted both verbal and written comments in regard to Judge I have reviewed his extensive legal record. We do have an extensive legal record that I am going to comment about that went into my own process in determining whether I can support him.  I came to the conclusion that I could not support Judge Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States because he is not a mainstream candidate. I am concerned that he would put corporate interests before individual rights. The strength of our Constitution is in the individual. Individual rights should be paramount to special interests or corporate interests.  I saw in his legal opinions a hostility toward environmental interests, women's health, marginalized students with disabilities, and other vulnerable types of individuals, that had me greatly concerned.  I was particularly concerned about whether he could separate his political views from his legal views. This is an extremely important point. We want our Justices on the Supreme Court not to be influenced by the politics around us.[[Page S2310]]  In the legislative branch, it is perfectly legitimate to take into consideration political views. The President of the United States is nominated by a political party; that is understood. But the Supreme Court--the Justices on the Supreme Court need to leave their political views outside of their responsibilities. I was deeply troubled, after reading the opinions of Judge Gorsuch and his writings, that he would not be able to separate his political views from his legal views.  I was concerned about whether he would truly be an independent check on the We know that President Trump is testing the constitutional reach of his office. We have seen that in some of the Executive orders he has issued. And I have little confidence by his responses at the hearings that Judge Gorsuch would be an independent voice toward the President of the United  Let me cite some examples to fill in the blanks on what I am saying. Judge Gorsuch challenges the Chevron deference doctrine. In the Gutierrez case, he indicates that judges rather than agencies should be basically administering our laws. The longstanding deference to agencies to interpret our law has allowed agencies to carry out their mission. Without that authority, it is extremely challenging to see how an agency can carry out the missions of laws we have passed. Judge Gorsuch raises questions as to whether that document is still relevant.  Let me make it clear. Who benefits from the Chevron doctrine? The Chevron doctrine has allowed agencies to protect workers' rights, protect our environment, protect consumers, food safety, and the list goes on and on. Each of our States has examples to show how important the Chevron doctrine has been. In my State of Maryland, the Chesapeake Bay is critically important to Maryland's economy, critically important to the character of our State we have in Maryland and our future. The protection of the public health of the Chesapeake Bay has very much been advanced by the Chevron deference doctrine.  Judge Gorsuch wrote: ``Chevron appears to qualify as a violation of the separation of powers.'' Then he argued that its ``primary rationale is no more than a fiction.'' Looking at what he has said about a fundamental document that is there to protect our environment, protect workers, protect public health, versus what Justice Scalia once explained--and I quote from Justice Scalia: ``In the long run, Chevron will endure and be given its full scope, because it more accurately reflects the reality of government and thus more adequately serves its needs.'' In the Gutierrez case, Judge Gorsuch was showing a more activist conservative agenda than Justice  Let me move on to Citizens We have talked about Citizens United probably more than any Supreme Court case on the Senate floor. We know it is a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision. We know it opened up the floodgates for dark money, allowing corporations to have constitutional rights which we thought were only for individuals.  In the Riddle case, Judge Gorsuch announced a strict scrutiny standard to political contribution limits that quite frankly would make the Citizens United case even worse and would gut campaign finance law limits. I think each of us should be concerned about that decision.  Let me move on to the TransAmerican Trucking case. Here, Judge Gorsuch was in dissent. He was in the minority. What he basically said was that a truckdriver had to sacrifice his life in order to protect his job; otherwise, he could be fired. What I mean by that, as I think many of our colleagues know, but let me say to those who might not be totally familiar, the truckdriver found himself abandoned because the brakes of his trailer were frozen in subzero temperatures. He contacted his dispatcher for help and after several hours recognized that his life was in danger because of hypothermia. He did not have adequate heat in his cab.  He had one of three choices. He could try to maneuver the cab and the trailer with frozen brakes, maybe costing himself his life or the lives of other people on the road; he could remain as he was instructed by the dispatcher and perhaps freeze to death; or he could do what I think any reasonable person would do: He disconnected the cab, took care of making sure he was safe, warmed himself up, and returned to the trailer in order to complete the mission. For that, he was fired, and Judge Gorsuch said that was acceptable. That is an extreme opinion and one that gives us great pause as to how Judge Gorsuch will act on the Supreme Court of the United  Let me talk about NLRB v. Community Health Services, wherein Judge Gorsuch was again in the dissent. It had to do with backpay for workers. In this opinion, he showed real hostility to workers and unions--something that had me greatly concerned.  Another case that received a great deal of publicity in this body was Hobby I raise it here for one principal reason. What the Court was saying and Judge Gorsuch was agreeing with was that the religious protection that is provided under the Constitution--that it is more important for a company to be able to exercise that religious freedom than the employees. Once again, one of my principal concerns is whether Judge Gorsuch will protect the rights of individuals or whether he will side on behalf of business. Clearly, in the Hobby Lobby case, he decided on business, to the detriment of women's rights, the LGBT community, and others.  In the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah case, he showed a direct hostility to Planned Quite frankly, this case is very difficult to understand because Judge Gorsuch would have allowed the Governor to cut off funds even though the case had been settled and the parties had not asked to have the case retried.  We talk about activism and that we do not want to see activist judges. To me, that demonstrates that Judge Gorsuch, indeed, will be an activist judge in his trying to move a particular political agenda.  In Endrew v. Douglas County School District, which is a case that came in during the confirmation hearing process, we had a severely autistic child, and Judge Gorsuch was responsible for the absurd reading of the de minimis benefit of defending against private placement. The Supreme Court rightly rejected that logic on an 8-to-0 decision.  Justice Roberts wrote the opinion about the IDEA law in that there are protections for disabled students in our school system. Judge Gorsuch would turn back the progress that we have made on civil rights and on constitutional protection.  As I mentioned earlier, I am very concerned about whether Judge Gorsuch can keep his political views separate from what he says--how he acts as a potential Justice on the Supreme Court of the United I go to a 2005 National Review article in which he wrote:       American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom,      relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and      the ballot box as the primary means of effecting their social      agenda. . . . This overweening addiction to the courtroom as      the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and      bad for the judiciary.  I mention that particular case and quote Judge Gorsuch because we do not want a judge to side with either being a liberal or a conservative. We do not want a judge to say: I have a responsibility to promote an agenda as a judge. We do not want a judge to be able to take a political view and take that onto the bench. Whether it is a person whom we agree with politically or disagree with politically, we want to have an independent judiciary. This National Review article causes me grave concern as to whether Judge Gorsuch can, in fact, be that neutral person on the  Judge Gorsuch appears to be an activist judge and will become an activist judge and will turn back progress to protect individual constitutional rights. That is something that gives me grave concern. It is the reason I cannot support this nominee to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  Let me turn to process for one moment, because it looks as though, sometime tomorrow, we are going to be called upon to vote on a cloture motion. I want to comment on that if I might.  As I said earlier, to me, Judge Gorsuch is not mainstream. He will put[[Page S2311]]corporate interests above individual interests. He shows a hostility toward the environment and women, health, women's health, et cetera. He has political views that, I think, he would not be able to differentiate, and he would not be an independent check and balance in our political system.  For all of those reasons, it seems appropriate to me that this is why we have a 60-vote threshold--to make sure that we do not take extreme nominees and allow them to be confirmed by a partisan vote. We want to have a broader consensus, and Judge Gorsuch did not earn that broader consensus.  There are additional considerations here, and this goes back a few years with the Republican leadership. What they did to President Obama's judicial nominations must be underscored because this is not in a vacuum. We did not get to this place in a vacuum from what has happened already but in our going back to President Obama when his district court nominees were delayed--in some cases, totally blocked--and required a record number of cloture motions to have been filed and acted upon--a record number. We had, as I understand, more clotures and more filibusters of President Obama's nominees by Republicans than we did in the entire history of the U. There has been a direct effort by the Republican leadership to filibuster judicial nominees. That is wrong. It should not have been done. Yes, there are reasons for some but not for the record numbers that were done. You should be able to allow for the comity.  Quite frankly, in 2013, the Republican leader told President Obama: No more DC Circuit Court judges. Let me repeat that. In 2013--this was the first year of the President's term--the Republican leader said: No more DC Circuit Court judges. We had 3 vacancies in the DC Circuit Court; 8 of the 11 had been filled, and 3 were vacant, and it had nothing to do with the nominees. They just said that they were not going to consider any of them, and they used a filibuster to block any filling of these positions.  First, I quote from Chief Judge Henry Edwards when he talked about the DC Circuit:       The review of a large, multi-party, difficult      administrative appeal is the stable judicial work of the DC      This long distinguishes the work of the DC Circuit      from the work of other circuits. It also explains why it is      impossible to compare the work of the DC Circuit with other      circuits by simply referring to the raw data of case filings.  Chief Justice Roberts noted that about two-thirds of the cases before the DC Circuit involve the Federal Government in some civil capacity. That figure is less than 25 percent nationwide. He also described the DC Circuit's unique character as a court with the special responsibility to review legal challenges of the conduct of the national government.  My point is clear. This is the second most important court in our land, and in the first year of President Obama's term, the Republicans announced that they would filibuster any attempt to put any judge on this circuit. Then we had the ultimate filibuster by the Republicans, and that was Merrick  In February 2016, after Justice Scalia's death, a nominee was submitted to us by President Obama who was acknowledged to be mainstream, acknowledged to be well qualified, acknowledged to be a consensus nominee, and he got the ultimate filibuster. Most of the Republicans in the Senate would not meet with him. He did not have a committee hearing or a committee vote, and he did not have a floor vote. That was the ultimate filibuster. It was wrong, particularly when we know that he would have received 60 votes.  So you cannot compare Judge Gorsuch with Judge Garland because, unlike Judge Garland, Judge Gorsuch does not share the same evaluation of being able to be a consensus, mainstream candidate who would receive a 60-vote threshold.  For all of these reasons, if the majority leader is going to pursue the cloture vote on the Gorsuch nomination, I will not vote in favor of cloture. I would hope that we would be able to return to the comity that is important in the U.Senate, but we recognize there are times in which you should have a 60-vote threshold. When the President of the United States goes outside of the norms and the process has already been employed by the Republicans, I urge my colleagues to rethink the course that we are on.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt,,"DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE GENERAL",2017.0,4.0,March

I consider the U.S.-Israel relationship to be a strategic anchor for the United States in the Middle East and one of our most important relationships with any country.

This bilateral relationship is also sustained by the deep bonds of friendship between the people of our two countries. This relationship has benefited Israel and has benefited the United  Given the range of strategic challenges across the globe that our country faces and the unprecedented instability and violence embroiled in the Middle East today, it is critical that we take steps to unify support for the U.S.-Israel relationship across the political spectrum.

10767,topic-id,1144,"Mr.Speaker, within hours of taking the oath as President of the United States, Donald Trump signaled that his much touted ``New Deal for Black America'' is just the same ``old deal'' of discrimination, voter suppression and establishment entitlement. In politics, as in life, actions always speak louder than words. And the speed of his repudiation of the inclusive agenda of the Obama administration shouts his intention to turn back the clock on civil rights for a broad swath of our nation.  Since the Supreme Court suspended the application of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County Case, African American communities around the nation have fought the passage of discriminatory voter identification laws as part of a scheme to suppress the vote. The states of Texas and North Carolina have been particular battlegrounds, where important victories were achieved in the federal courts. The work of civil rights advocacy groups received important support from the Voting Section of the DOJ Civil Rights Division in reversing some of the most aggressive state-passed voter suppression plans.  As many have feared, the election of Trump threatens to produce a radical change in support for voting rights from the White Unlike even President George Bush, who signed the reauthorization of Section 5 of the VRA, Trump has exhibited an hostility to voting rights not seen since the Civil Rights era.  By Friday afternoon, lawyers for the Department asked for a delay in the hearing scheduled for tomorrow on the Texas voter ID case, citing the change in presidential administrations. The motion noted that ``Because of the change in administration, the Department of Justice also experienced a transition in leadership, . . . and requires additional time to brief the new leadership of the Department on this case and the issues to be addressed at the hearing before making any representations to the Court.'' It is generally expected that DOJ will reverse course in the case.  This case is a bellwether of what can be expected from a Trump DOJ on civil rights. Given the size of Texas and the precedential impact of the case, the stakes in this litigation could not be higher for the minority community.  The voting law at issue in the case, known as SB 14, set strict requirements for permissible ID to vote. While it included such identification as a driver's license, passport and a concealed handgun license, it excluded identification like federal government or student  In July, the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans ruled that the law violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it disproportionately affected minorities. The Department of Justice had previously argued that the law violated the Voting Rights Act and was intended to directly impact the abilities of minorities to vote, as more than 600,000 minorities lacked the ID necessary under state law to vote.  The belief that the Civil Rights Division will change position and will be under attack is well founded. Last Thursday, it was reported that the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Violence Against Women Grants and the Legal Services Corporation would be target for elimination and the Civil Rights Division would have its funding cut as part of Trump plan for reducing the size of the federal government.  Most troubling, it was also reported that John Gore, an attorney who led the legal teams on several key cases attacking civil rights, would be the head of DOJ' s Civil Rights Division as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil  Gore was one of the defense attorneys who argued in court on behalf of North Carolina's legally dubious and discriminatory anti-transgender bill The bill blocks transgender people from using public bathrooms that align with their gender identity. The bottom line here is that Gore was on the side of discrimination in the country's most high-profile LGBTQ rights case of the past year. (Many will recall that this legislation generated a huge economic backlash against the state, including the relocation of major sporting events).  His record of being a legal champion for discriminatory causes appears to be a highlight of Gore's legal career. One of his main areas of expertise appears to be defending redistricting plans against claims of civil rights violations, with his online bio boasting of a number of successful such defenses.  One of the most high-profile civil rights cases Gore has litigated in recent years is the Florida Purge case. This case brought many of us to the floor to denounce yet another attempt at voter suppression that was designed to alter the balance of state politics. The state of Florida was found to have violated the National Voter Registration Act with a systemic purge of voters it suspected of being non-citizens. As the New York Times wrote of Florida's voter restriction attempt:       The program to identify and remove noncitizens from the      rolls prompted a national outcry and several lawsuits in 2012      because it was riddled with mistakes and was being pushed      through months before the election. A number of people on the      lists, which were sent by the state to county election      supervisors, were, in fact, citizens (including the two lead      plaintiffs in the lawsuit).  Just as we opposed the nomination of Jeff Sessions to serve as Attorney General, we must similarly build a record against John Gore to head the Civil Rights We simply cannot entrust our legacy civil rights statutes to any person who has shown a lack of sensitivity and balance in protecting the interests of justice in our society.  Though Trump's inaugural speech invoked an image of my home City of Detroit, I fear what his vision will mean for my community and vow to continue the struggle for jobs, justice and peace. He stated that ``the time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.'' I take him at his word and his actions send an unmistakable message: His action is to appoint a defender of discrimination to head the Civil Rights His action is to retreat from an agenda on Community Oriented His action is to undermine affordable healthcare. His action is to appoint cabinet officials who fail to represent the mosaic that is  The Congressional Black Caucus took to this floor tonight to outline our response to the President's Inaugural Address & New Deal for African-While our views may not find much in common, I believe we can agree on this: the time for talk is indeed over and the hour for action has arrived.

That is why we are the beacon on the hill.

10786,topic-id,534,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In 2014, in a unanimous ruling delivered by Chief Justice Roberts, the Supreme Court concluded that the police may not search a cell phone without first demonstrating probable cause.  Citing an obvious Fourth Amendment interest--namely, the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure--in the vast amount of data we store on our personal devices, the Court wrote:  ``The fact that technology now allows an individual to carry such information in his hand does not make the information any less worthy of the protection for which the Founders fought. Our answer to the question of what police must do before searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple--get a warrant.''  With that decision, the Court took a bold step toward reconciling the Fourth Amendment with the advent of modern communications technology.  Today the House takes a similar step to reconcile our interests in privacy and due process with the realities of modern computing. We do so for the second time.  H.387, the Email Privacy Act, recognizes that the content of our communications, although often stored in digital format, remains worthy of Fourth Amendment protection. And to investigators and government agents who seek access to our email, our advice is rather simple: get a warrant.  It is an idea whose time has long since come. So this bill will allow us to move to a clear, uniform standard for law enforcement agencies to access the content of our communications; namely, a warrant based on probable cause.  H.387 also codifies the right of the providers to give notice of this intrusion to their customers, except in certain exigent circumstances that must be also validated by the court.  We should note the absence of a special carve-out from the warrant requirement for the civil agencies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue  Last Congress, in the Judiciary Committee, we reached quick consensus that a civil carve-out of any kind is unworkable, unconstitutional, or maybe both. I would have preferred to keep the notice provisions of the original bill, which are absent from the version we reported from committee.  In the digital world, no amount of due diligence necessarily tells us that the government accessed our electronic information. The government should have an obligation to provide us with some form of notice when intruding on a record of our most private conversations.  I fully understand that not everyone shares this view, and I am willing to compromise, for now, in order to advance the important reforms that we will adopt today.  I am proud of the work we have done. Last Congress, the House passed this legislation that has already been noted by 419-0. I hope that today we can send our colleagues in the Senate a similarly strong signal to pass this bill.  This legislation is several years in the making, and it should not be delayed any further.

10832,topic-id,1110,"Mr.President, Members of the Senate have been coming to the floor talking about the important vote we will be casting tomorrow and then again on Friday which will result in the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme  Having served on the Senate Judiciary Committee since I first came to the Senate, it has been my honor to participate in the confirmation hearings in the committee on now five Supreme Court Justices, Judge Gorsuch being the latest.  What I have been struck by when it comes to Judge Gorsuch is how much our friends across the aisle--who cast a party-line vote in the Judiciary Committee against the judge on his confirmation--how much they have been struggling to come up with even one intellectually honest argument against the nominee, in spite of his obvious and tremendous qualifications and bipartisan support.  For example, I heard our colleague from Virginia, my friend Senator Kaine, criticize a couple of decisions that the judge made. What he left out is that Judge Gorsuch participated in 2,700 panel decisions on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals during his 10-year tenure there. Ninety-seven percent of them were unanimous. As the Presiding Officer knows, that means that each of the judges--three judges on the typical panel or in an en banc--basically that everyone agreed, whether they were nominated by a Republican or So this whole idea of cherry-picking the judge's judicial report to try to find some straw, to grasp at some straw with which to disagree with his confirmation is pretty striking to me.  But last night we saw the latest act of desperation to try to justify the unprecedented partisan filibuster of Judge For example, it was reported that a handful of lines in a 2006 book were borrowed from other sources. Well, the timing of this says it all. This book has been published for 10 years. The only reason for this allegation is a last-minute attempt to try to make something, really anything stick to tarnish the character of someone who will soon serve on the Supreme  This kind of baseless attack is not only disingenuous, it is transparent and it has absolutely no merit. Even the author of the main article allegedly plagiarized has rejected that characterization. So this is the person who wrote the article who Judge Gorsuch was claimed to have plagiarized, in essence. Well, the author of the main article rejected the characterization of plagiarization. She said that under the circumstances, it would have been awkward and difficult for Judge Gorsuch to have used different language.  Other academic experts have also rejected the claim and made clear that the preferred methodology for facts is to cite original sources, which is exactly what Judge Gorsuch did. Talk about an eleventh-hour baseless attack.  The bottom line is this: Instead of evaluating the judge based on his qualifications, the sterling reputation he has among people across the political spectrum, our friends across the aisle are determined to attempt the first successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. That is disappointing, but it is also destined for failure.  Yesterday, I pointed out how we actually got here. Back during President George Bush's first term, Senator Schumer and others laid the groundwork and then executed a strategy for unprecedented obstruction of judicial nominees. That was in response to the election of the last Republican This is in response to the election of a new Republican I think for him, following the election of the current one, obstruction of a perfectly qualified nominee to the Supreme Court is just the next step. It actually represents the ultimate escalation of this weaponization of the filibuster used in judicial confirmations.  As I have said before, based on the merits of the nominee, the justifications for opposing Judge Gorsuch are paper thin. Our colleagues across the aisle unanimously supported Judge Gorsuch when he was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals just 10 years ago. He got everybody's vote. It was a voice vote. This was to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, a lifetime tenured position. All of them agreed he[[Page S2316]]should be confirmed. Well, that includes then-Senator Obama, Senator Clinton, and Senator So I would ask you, what has changed in the last 10 years that now cause them to reach deep into their bag of tricks and to filibuster this nominee for the Supreme Court? Well, it is not his track record as a judge, that is for sure. As I mentioned, of the 2,700 cases he has participated in, 97 percent were unanimous--97 percent.  One recent analysis put him in the middle of the circuit ideologically speaking, and for a decade he has done good, fair work as a judge on the Tenth Circuit--really outstanding work, to be honest. That should tell you something about this judge and this man, but it should also tell you something about the opponents of this nominee, many of whom, like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as I mentioned, supported his nomination just 10 years ago. The only thing that has changed, the only thing that explains the radical shift of Democrats in opposition to this good judge, is that now President Trump is in the White  I honestly believe that every excuse they have come up with to engage in this unprecedented filibuster is completely without merit. What they are really upset about is what happened on November 8. I don't believe--if they won't confirm Judge Gorsuch, they will never vote to confirm any nominee of this President, period.  What we are talking about and all we are asking for is an up-or-down vote. If they want to vote against the nomination, that is their right, but, as everybody knows, to get to that, we first have to get 60 votes to close off debate and then get to the majority up-or-down vote. But they will not even allow us to move to a vote.  I hope our Democratic friends who are obstructing will reconsider. I believe there are four Democrats who are going to join all of the Republicans in voting to confirm this nominee, so he will enjoy bipartisan support, as he should.  This judge is a faithful interpreter of the law. He believes in an independent judiciary and enjoys support across the ideological spectrum. He will be confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice, but it is up to our Democratic friends to determine just how that occurs.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

10998,topic-id,556,"Mr.President, I listened carefully to the statement by theRepublican leader on the floor, and I am hoping we can reach some agreement later today as to the nominations to be consideredthis day and very quickly next week. I will, for the record, make it clear that the seven nominees who moved through on thefirst day of the Obama administration were people who had their ethics statements filed on time, had filed all the legallyrequired papers on time for review.  Unfortunately, that is not the case for all of the nominees by the new Some of them bring to this nomination some extraordinarily challenging financial data, and because of theircompanies, because of their lifestyles, because of their wealth, it takes longer to go through these documents than it does forpeople of modest means. When we proposed, by the Obama administration, Penny Pritzker, of Chicago, to serve as Secretary ofCommerce, it took 6 months to clear the paperwork on her financial background. The more complex the financial data, the moredifficult and challenging it is for the committees of the Senate to do their work and to do it properly.  We want to makecertain we don't cut any corners. We don't want to create any advantage for any single nominee. They have to be held to the samestandard as the nominees under the Obama administration. I am hoping we can move on it with dispatch on some of these nominees,and I don't quarrel with the Republican leader's premise that there are some noncontroversial nominees who would be easier tohandle than others.  Let me quickly add, for those who have forgotten the record of the Republicans in the Senate when itcomes to delaying nominations, exhibit A will continue to be the vacancy on the U.Supreme For the first time in thehistory of the United States of America, the Republican majority in the U.Senate refused a hearing and a vote on a nominee tofill a vacancy on the U.Supreme That went on for the entire duration of the Obama Some 11 months, thatposition on the highest Court in the land remained vacant because of the specific political strategy of the Republican leader onthe other side.  He said: We will keep this open in the hopes that a Republican President will be able to fill it. He had agrin and a smile and, I guess, a feeling of accomplishment on election day when a Republican was elected That vacancycontinued for political reasons, regardless of the fact that it created at least a hardship and some confusion on the highestCourt of the land. It went on for 10, 11 months, and it continues to this day.  I might also remind him that the nominationof Loretta Lynch for the highest law enforcement position in America sat on that Senate calendar for months, with no objectionstated by any Member on the other side. They refused to call her name and allow a vote for the Attorney General of the UnitedStates of Similarly, an Assistant Secretary of the Department of Treasury, a key position to deal with terrorismfinancing, was held on that calendar, I believe, for a year or more with no controversy. They hadthe power to do it, and they did it. So this notion that we slowed things down really negates and ignores the reality of therecord before us.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

10855,topic-id,1651,"Mr.President, I rise to offer my support for the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States of  Several weeks ago, shortly after President Trump announced this nomination, I came to the floor to say what an admirable choice he had made and had known him for some time.  After meeting with Judge Gorsuch to discuss his nomination and after reviewing his qualifications and after observing my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee thoroughly vet him, I am all the more convinced that this man is eminently qualified to serve as America's next Associate Justice of the Supreme  I was impressed that both of his Senators introduced him to the committee for the hearing. I was kind of surprised that the biggest comments that I heard about the hearing itself, were that he did not answer some of the questions directly. As with previous Justices, they do not answer questions directly when they are asked a theoretical question about some possible future case that might come before them and are without the details.  Another reason that I am convinced that he is very qualified is that the people with whom he went to school have all had good comments to say about him. The people he went to law school with have had good comments. The people who have been on the bar with him--in the legal arena--have had good comments to say about him and so have the other judges with whom he has worked through the years as he has moved up through the different processes.  I am confident that he is qualified to be our next Justice because of his extensive judicial experience, his commitment to the rule of law, and his principled character.  Neil Gorsuch's first job out of law school was a couple of blocks from here. Even back then, he was already preparing to serve his country on the[[Page S2329]]Supreme Court by learning from some of the best jurists in He performed clerkships first for the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and later for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy at the U.Supreme  After working in private practice and at the Department of Justice, in 2006 President George Bush nominated Judge Gorsuch to serve on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth The Senate confirmed him by a voice vote. That is unanimous.  Let me say that again because it is relevant to the misplaced--in my opinion--partisan rancor we are hearing over this nomination. In 2006, only Lindsey Graham bothered to attend the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing to consider Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Tenth Circuit Court of This body--including then-Senators Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama--was so confident about Neil Gorsuch's character and his qualifications to serve as a Federal judge that he was confirmed by the Senate without anyone even asking for a recorded vote.  With what was in essence an endorsement from three of the most influential political figures then serving in the Senate among my colleagues across the aisle, I find some of the opposition to Judge Gorsuch and the questioning of his qualifications somewhat baffling. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will put aside the political bickering and scorekeeping that have dominated Washington over the last several months and give Neil Gorsuch a fair vote, up or down, based on his qualifications and his suitability for service on the Supreme  Since joining the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has been a busy man, doing exactly the kind of work that makes him qualified for this nomination. The Tenth Circuit exercises appellate jurisdiction of Federal cases originating in eight States that cover about 20 percent of America's landmass. That jurisdiction does include my home State of  As a member of the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch estimates that he sat on appellate panels considering approximately 1,800 criminal cases and 1,200 civil cases. The list of citations of case decisions he has authored is a single-spaced, 21-page document. After hearing all of those cases and drafting all of those opinions, even Judge Gorsuch's detractors have criticized only a mere handful of the hundreds of opinions he has authored.  I am confident that Neil Gorsuch is qualified to be a member of the Supreme Court because of his steadfast commitment to the rule of law. The many opinions he has written are known for being clear and easy to understand. But, most importantly, his opinions reflect his respect for following the law as it is written and for applying and adhering to judicial precedent. He is a judge who applies the law to the facts of the case and reaches the conclusion that the examination yields, regardless of his own personal beliefs.  As he said, ``Personal politics or policy preferences have no useful role in judging; regular and healthy doses of self-skepticism and humility about one's own abilities and conclusions always do.''  Judge Gorsuch is an adherent to, and defender of, America's Constitution and the separation of powers that document prescribes. As he said, ``Judges must allow the elected branches of government to flourish and citizens, through their elected representatives, to make laws appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the day.''  Throughout this nomination process, during all of which Judge Gorsuch has been under a political microscope, we have seen that he is a man of admirable character with a temperament that makes him well suited to serve as a Supreme Court  We know he has a resilient character and thick skin--qualities important to any Justice--because we have seen his demeanor and response to the criticism of his career and negative characterizations about some of his previous decisions--very few of them, I should add. We have seen his reaction in the face of accusations about his judicial independence. In the face of that--biting disparagement about the work he has spent his life trying to perfect--Judge Gorsuch has been respectful, remarkably patient, and resolutely committed to upholding the ethical canons and conduct demanded of him as a jurist.  We have glimpsed Judge Gorsuch's character as he has spoken about the people he values and those he strives to emulate. His legal heroes are people like Justice White, who he said ``followed the law wherever it took him without fear or favor to anyone''; Justice Anthony Kennedy, who, Judge Gorsuch said, ``showed me that judges can disagree without being disagreeable''; and Justice Scalia, who reminds us ``that the judge's job is to follow the words that are in the law--not to replace them with words that aren't.''  Neil Gorsuch has told us that he has also looked closer to home, to his family, to shape his character: his mother, who he said ``taught me that headlines are fleeting, but courage lasts''; his father, who he said showed him that kindness ``is the great virtue''; his paternal grandfather, who Judge Gorsuch said taught him that ``lawyers exist to help people with their problems, not the other way around.''  Neil Gorsuch has demonstrated his commitment to the law, his scholarship, and his temperament befitting that of a judge. He is eminently qualified to be a member of the Supreme Court--not in my opinion--that is what the judges have said.  I am not the only one who believes this. My office has received hundreds of calls and letters from my constituents in Wyoming urging the confirmation of Judge He has a lot of support from folks in the Wyoming legal community, from both parties, whom I know and trust and whose opinions I value.  Judge Gorsuch has earned a ``well qualified'' rating--the highest rating they award from the American Bar To give him this rating, the ADA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary conducted a peer review of Judge Gorsuch's integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament.  As children we all learn that you might be able to fool your parents or our teachers, but you can never fool your peers. You especially cannot fool ones with whom you have worked long hours like most judges and lawyers are known to do. You can't fool your peers. They are the ones who see you at your best and at your worst. That is why it is so remarkable that dozens of Neil Gorsuch's Harvard Law School classmates--people representing many different political and philosophical persuasions and who have known him for more than a quarter of a century--signed a letter supporting his nomination to the Supreme  Among our most important duties as Members of this body is to carefully vet all nominees who come before us. Never is that responsibility so stark and so substantial than when our Nation faces a vacancy on the Supreme  In November, millions of people went to the polls and rejected the kind of tired, partisan bickering when they voted for a change in Those same voters went to the polls knowing that there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court and that whoever became the next President would choose that nominee.  For many weeks now, Judge Gorsuch has been before us as that nominee. He has undergone scrutiny under which most of us would wither. We have all had time to examine his record.  I thank Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and all of our Senate colleagues who serve on the Judiciary Committee for conducting such thorough and detailed nomination hearings that provided us ample opportunity to examine Judge Gorsuch's qualifications and temperament.  I believe there is only one logical conclusion to reach after all of this examination; that is, that Judge Neil Gorsuch is supremely qualified for and capable of the solemn and mighty task of serving as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this confirmation.

11041,topic-id,1168,"Mr.President, I rise today as the Senate considers the nomination of Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to be the Director of the White House Office of Management and That is We are long overdue in confirming Mr.Mulvaney to this key post because our Nation has so many pressing budgetary issues requiring the attention of this new administration. First among them is the staggering $20 trillion debt burden we are now faced with after 8 years of anemic economic policy and growth--and growing at the rate of half a trillion dollars a year. Confirming an OMB Director we can work with will put America on a more responsible fiscal path.  With their unprecedented attempts to delay the new Cabinet, Senate Democrats have ensured that the President has now been without an OMB Director longer than any other President in the past 40 years. That is how long the Budget Act has been in place. According to Senate records, from President Jimmy Carter to President Obama, the longest it has ever taken to approve a first budget director for a new President was 1 week--1 week. We are now in week 4, with little or no movement. As Majority Leader McConnell said last week, this is the slowest time for a new Cabinet to be up and running since President George Washington--and that was last week. It is even slower than that, and we are still not done.  It is vital that we fill this position as soon as possible because the Director of the Office of Management and Budget will help set the President's budget priorities and play an important role in working with Congress on setting the appropriate spending levels for the This position is crucial to helping the Federal Government function in what is shaping up to be a very challenging fiscal environment that requires all of our attention.  Some may wonder why Democrats are opposed to Mr.It could be because he has been a vigilant budget hawk during his 6 years in Congress, focused on the question of how we ultimately stop the Federal Government from overspending while continuing to fund the country's core priorities and responsibilities. They could be worried that the White House Budget Director will be a prominent voice, arguing for fiscal restraint, for responsible budgets, and for honest budgeting that avoids the use of gimmicks, such as emergency funding designations for nonemergencies.  I am hopeful Mr.Mulvaney and the OMB will ensure the taxes the hard-working Americans send to Washington are spent in the most efficient and effective way. The Federal Government has not been currently focused on making sure hard-working taxpayers get the best deal for their money. A new OMB Director focused on responsible budgeting can help ensure that when duplication in government programs and agencies is discovered, it is addressed. This will help make the Federal Government more accountable and effective.  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, every year outlines tens of billions of dollars in savings that can be achieved through various efficiency measures. OMB can play an important role in ensuring that spending programs do not duplicate each other while protecting hard-working taxpayers. Additionally, reforming and consolidating these programs can ensure that they focus on real needs and be managed with an eye on real results.  The Federal Government has grown so large and so complex that no one seems to know how many Federal programs exist. Even the executive branch can't tell us how many programs it administers. I have directed a lot of questions to the past administration, trying to find out exactly that. Of course, I would like to not only know how many programs they administer, I would like to know how many dollars are involved, I would like to know how many people it employs and how many customers they serve. There ought to be some kind of relationship there that means we are making a difference, but nobody is looking at it.  Several years ago, Congress even passed a law requiring the administration to publish a list of all Federal programs on a central governmentwide website, along with related budget and performance information--some of what I was just talking about. Unfortunately, when the program lists were put online, GAO reviewed the information and discovered that the inventory, in their words--listen to this carefully--was ``not a useful tool for decision making.'' What were they afraid of? But even if the government can't answer that question, we can find strong evidence that the number is on the rise, and Mr.Mulvaney will be able to play a crucial role in taming the unchecked growth of the Federal  I also look forward to working with him on the urgent need to reform the broken budget process, which has contributed to the budgetary stalemate and recurrent continuing resolutions to which Congress now routinely resorts in order to postpone hard decisions about spending and debt, which delays agencies from being able to plan.  There is an urgent need for important reforms to the process, such as implementing biennial budgeting so they can plan 2 years at a time, and the overhaul of outdated budget accounting concepts that have outlived their usefulness. Ultimately, my goal is to have Congress work with this new administration to produce comprehensive and lasting budget reform that can put our Nation on a better fiscal path. The Budget Committee has been working on that for a year in a very bipartisan way. It is time for us to put some of those into place.  Despite its significance, the preparation of the President's annual budget submission is only one of the responsibilities of As an entity within the Executive Office of the President, OMB has numerous governmentwide management responsibilities, in addition to budgeting and spending, that[[Page S1171]]concern various activities carried out by Federal agencies. These include agency rulemaking, agency contracting, agency grants management, agency financial management, information technology, program assessment, personnel policy, property management. We don't even have a list of what property we have, let alone when it is probably going to outlive its usefulness and when it needs to be replaced. That would be capital budgeting. I hope we can do that at some point.  It is for these reasons and more that I encourage the Senate to exercise its constitutional duties to provide their advice and consent on this key Cabinet-level position and confirm Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to be Director of the Office of Management and  I have talked to him extensively. I have known him for a long time, and I know he will do a spectacular job with this at providing good advice to the President so we can do whatever we can do and bring as many people together in meeting the responsibilities of this government.

I'm particularly proud of a bipartisan provision I first authored in the 112th Congress that I'm pleased is included in this legislation today. This provision would modify current FCC rules to allow three or more Commissioners to hold non-public collaborative discussions, as long as no agency action is taken.  Today, under the FCC's ``Sunshine Rule,'' three Commissioners or more are prohibited from talking to each other outside of an official public meeting.

It must be able to collaborate freely and deliberate on our nation's most pressing communications issues, from enhancing universal service and public safety, to making more spectrum available for mobile broadband.

Our job is to assess how this nominee's decisions will affect the American people and whether he will protect the legal and constitutional rights of all  I have had this in mind throughout the entire process. Let me begin with an aside. I represent a large State, and I do pay close attention to constituent letters, calls, and emails. A weekly report lets me know on what issues people are focused and what they think. I take this feedback very seriously.  In general, my barometer has been that when I receive over 30,000 calls, emails, or letters, that is when I know an issue is reasonably meaningful to many people in the To be clear, I don't base my final judgment on any issue or nominee solely on the numbers of calls and letters I receive. However, this is a representative democracy. I find this to be an important measure of what California constituents are thinking.  When it comes to this nomination so far, my office has received a total of 112,309 calls, emails, and letters from California constituents; and 92,799, or 83, percent, oppose this nominee and 19,510, or 17 percent, support this nominee.  Let me read a few of the emails. One constituent from Silverado, CA, wrote:       ``In 1971, when abortion was illegal, I was forced to have      a child at age 16. That was 46 years ago. With Gorsuch, we      would step back into that world where women and girls have NO      choice but an illegal and unsafe abortion OR become a mother.      It is wrong. The choice is untenable and dangerous.      Filibuster Gorsuch and do whatever it takes.''  I was a college student in the 1950s, and I remember very much what life was like before a woman had the right to privacy, to control her reproductive system according to Roe v.  Another constituent from San Diego emailed:       ``As a beneficiary of the right to marry 3\1/2\ years ago,      I personally understand how important Supreme Court decisions      are. I also attended a segregated elementary school when I      was a little boy. I do not trust that Neil Gorsuch would      advocate for the best interests of women & minorities. Please      do not confirm him.''  A woman from Richmond, CA, wrote:       ``I believe that we, the people, will have a difficult time      getting fair and equal treatment with Gorsuch being on the      Supreme He will help the rich corporations, and the      poor and middle-class will suffer irreparably.''  I don't comment on any of these because none of these are sacrosanct, but they are opinions.  Brandon Gregg from Burlingame wrote:[[Page S2324]]         ``The republicans did not give Merrick Garland a hearing,      instead waiting until Trump could propose a young right-     leaning judge who will take our country backwards. Gorsuch      will not advance the agenda of human rights within our      Constitution, but will plunge us back into the past where      minorities had little protection, women did not have equal      rights, people of color were denied the right to vote, and      protections for all people that we take for granted, did not      exist. This is not the world I want for myself, my children,      or my grandchildren. Filibuster Gorsuch's confirmation.      Please.''  The bottom line is that Californians are letting me know loud and clear that who sits on the Supreme Court matters. Unfortunately, up to now, much of the press coverage on this nomination has been about politics and process.  In contrast, little has been said about how the Supreme Court affects the lives of Americans, their families, and their communities. So, let me say, in the past 24 years that I have been a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have seen that the Supreme Court is, in fact, the last word in so many areas: the personal rights of all Americans, including whom they can marry, and whether women have the right to privacy that allows them to control their own bodies.  The Supreme Court determines whether decisions about healthcare will be determined by families or businesses. The Supreme Court has the final say on whether States and localities will be able to pass laws that make it harder for low-income people, people of color, seniors and students to vote. The Supreme Court will decide whether corporations are able to pollute our air and water with impunity.  It is the Supreme Court that will be the final world on Executive authority, whether it is used to waterboard, detain individuals indefinitely, or overreach in other ways.  Each year, more than 350,000 civil and criminal cases are filed in Federal courts. The Supreme Court hears arguments for only about 80 cases a session and makes decisions on approximately 50 more cases without hearing arguments.  Now, this means the Supreme Court only hears a very small percentage of cases--less than 0.02 percent.  Before the current vacancy, the most significant questions were closely decided by 5-to-4 decisions, with five votes coming from Republican-appointed  These include important decisions that affect our elections, like Shelby County and Citizens United, decisions that weakened the power of average voters by expanding the role of dark money and gutting a key provision of the Voting Rights We also saw a 5-to-4 decision in Heller that overturned 70 years of precedent on the Second Amendment and blocked the District of Columbia's commonsense gun regulations.  As my colleague Senator Whitehouse outlined in the Judiciary Committee, in the last several years, this Supreme Court has issued an additional 11 5-to-4 decisions that promote the rights of corporations over the rights of everyday people, on topics as wide-ranging as age discrimination and harassment to limiting access to courts and juries.  So who sits on the Supreme Court matters. Just look at some of the key cases that have come down since this vacancy arose last year. For example, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-to-4 on a case to determine whether unions are able to fight for fair pay and benefits for all workers by requiring them to contribute to a union's action on their behalf.  We know this issue will go back to the Supreme If, next time the Court rules against unions like the California Teachers Association, it will be overturning a 40-year precedent known as ``agency shop,'' and it will permit an assault on worker's rights.  Also last year, the Supreme Court considered the case on North Carolina's law that reduced early voting days, eliminated same-day registration, and established new restrictive photo ID requirements to vote. The Fourth Circuit struck down North Carolina's law concluding it had ``targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' Yet, when the Supreme Court considered it, they deadlocked 4 to 4. Who sits on that court matters.  After 4 days of hearings and reviewing Judge Gorsuch's record, we have learned that he, indeed, has strong views of what the law should be and how it should be interpreted. While Judge Gorsuch was not responsive to many questions, he did tell us that he is happy to be called an originalist, and that he embraced the term. He also stated that he believes judges should look to the original public meaning of the Constitution when they decide what one of its provision mean.  According to him, ``the Constitution isn't some ink blot on which litigants may project their hopes and dreams. . . . but a carefully crafted text judges are charged with applying according to its original public meaning.''  Original public meaning--that takes us back to 13 colonies, 4 million Americans, and 1789. I find this originalist judicial philosophy to be deeply troubling. It essentially means that judges and courts should evaluate all of our constitutional rights and privileges as they were understood in 1789. To freeze our understanding of the Constitution in 1789, I think, ignores the Framer's intent. But more importantly, it would ignore the vibrancy and growth of our  We are no longer a society that condones slavery. We no longer permit segregation. We do not allow child labor. We recognize that women not only deserve an education but can be leaders in business, government, and their homes.  We cannot turn the clock back 230 years.  As Justice Brennan said, asking judges to resolve legal questions by looking only to what people believed when our country was founded was ``little more than arrogance cloaked as humility'' that ``while proponents of this facile historicism justify it as the depoliticization of the judiciary, the political underpinnings of such a choice should not escape notice.'' After all, ``[t]hose who would restrict [legal claims] to the values of 1789 specifically articulated in the Constitution turn a blind eye to social pro-gress. . . .''  This is Justice Brennan's speech in 1985 at Georgetown This is an important point that I think bears repeating. A judge's decision to adopt an originalist philosophy is inherently political because it discounts the expansion of constitutional protections beyond White men who owned property. Yes, that is the way it was back then.  The U.Constitution, I deeply believe, is a living document intended to evolve as our country evolves. We are not supposed to ignore social progress, and I don't believe the Founders of our country ever intended us to do so.  Another concern with Judge Gorsuch's record is his extreme, conservative view of the Federal For example, he has indicated he believes the longstanding legal doctrine that allows agencies to write rules to effectively implement laws should be overturned. That doctrine, as the Presiding Officer well knows, is the Chevron doctrine. It was discussed in committee.  Chevron was itself a unanimous opinion authored by the liberal Justice Stevens and joined by conservatives, including Chief Justice This legal doctrine has been in place for decades and has been cited more than 15,000 times. If Chevron is overturned, as Judge Gorsuch has advocated, many important laws that Congress has passed would become ineffective.  I want to give a personal example.  In 2007, Senator Olympia Snowe and I finally passed legislation, thanks to Senator Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye, to increase the mileage efficiency of cars. This was critical to address because pollution was clouding up our cities, and it was important to improve the functioning of our automobiles.  Our legislation required the Department of Transportation to set standards so that fuel economy would increase at least 10 miles per gallon over 10 years--that is the time we could foresee--and continue to rise after that. We instructed the agency to achieve the ``maximum feasible average fuel economy'' and directed the Secretary of Transportation to consider ``technological feasibility, economic practicality, the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the government on fuel economy, and the need of the United States to conserve energy.'' That is directly from the bill.  Here is the result. It has just been announced that this program will raise fuel economy to more than 50-miles per[[Page S2325]]gallon by 2025. I think the specifics were 54 miles to the gallon.  This would have been impossible in 2007 when we were trying to pass the bill. We could not possibly understand, 10 years hence, technical details of specific automobile efficiency technologies and how they would develop in the decades to come.  Federal agencies simply must play a role. We need their technical expertise and ongoing involvement to ensure the legislation we pass is implemented effectively--as intended by  In committee, I discussed Judge Gorsuch's textualist view. This means that he believes statutes should be interpreted only by ``the plain meaning of the language.''  Combined, this judicial philosophy includes: One, limiting laws and statues to a dictionary definition that he selected. Two, reversing precedent to say that agencies can't interpret ambiguous laws. Three, reinstating a legal doctrine to further limit agency experts. Taken together, these three points would require Congress to pass bills so that they are either so specific that they would be very limited in effect or so broad they would actually be meaningless.  For example, Senator Collins and I have been working on legislation that would require the FDA to ensure the safety of personal care products such as we all use--shampoo, deodorant, cosmetics, shaving creams, lotions. The FDA does not do it in this country, but they do it in Our bill asks the FDA to evaluate the safety of the chemicals that are put in these products.  In committee, we had testimony about a shampoo that once used, hair fell out of the individual's head and many thousands of complaints had been registered.  Congress does not have the expertise to do the chemical evaluations, and without deference to the FDA, the bill would have to be thousands of pages long to cover every contingency for every product made by hundreds of companies, and that simply is not workable.  If Congress can no longer rely on Federal agencies, and if all laws can only be interpreted by limited dictionary definitions, then government would have no ability to regulate markets, defend against a financial crisis, protect workers, build safe roads, or safeguard our environment.  We depend on the scientists, the biologists, the economists, the engineers, and other experts to help ensure that our laws are effectively implemented. So this is really a dastardly controlling mechanism.  Under the arguments proposed by Judge Gorsuch, this would no longer occur.  Instead, only congressional action would be able to address these important issues. These rules that agencies would bring would have to be written by And even that would be severely limited. Such a radical change in law would hurt ordinary Americans, certainly their safety, and certainly our communities.  Let me say once again that who sits on the Supreme Court matters.  The issues facing our country are consequential, and they have a real-world impact on all of us. Justices on the Supreme Court must understand that the Court's decisions have real-world consequences for men, women, and children across our  Unfortunately, based on Judge Gorsuch's record at the Department of Justice, his tenure on the bench, his appearance before the Senate, and his written questions for the record, I cannot support this nomination.

10836,topic-id,913,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be our next U.Supreme Court Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution entrusts Members of the Senate with a responsibility vital to our democracy: providing advice and consent on the President's Supreme Court nominees.  The significance of this task cannot be overstated, and it is one that I take very seriously. Days after President Trump nominated Judge Gorsuch to fill the late Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court, I shared the qualities that I wanted to see in a They included a strong commitment to the rule of law, first-rate credentials, and a solid judicial record. The time has come to determine whether the nominee meets those criteria.  After meeting personally with Judge Gorsuch, watching his confirmation hearing, and evaluating his background and legal record, I believe that answer is a resounding ``yes.'' Judge Gorsuch's credentials are exemplary. He has an extraordinary resume and a brilliant mind. For 10 years he has served on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth The Senate confirmed him to this position by unanimous consent in 2006. No rollcall vote was needed because all 100 Members supported the nomination.  To date, Judge Gorsuch has decided 2,700 cases, and 99 percent of the time he sided with the majority. He has offered opinions in 800 of those cases, and 98 percent of the decisions in these cases were unanimous. This record tells us something important: He is well within the mainstream. It is why he has gained the respect of prominent attorneys on the right and on the left. Several of my Democratic colleagues have made similar observations.  Senator Donnelly recently said that he would support Judge Gorsuch's nomination because ``he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law.''  Similarly, Senator Heitkamp indicated that she would vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch because ``he has a record as a balanced, meticulous, and well-respected jurist who understands the rule of law.''  My colleagues have it right. A Justice should be a follower of the Constitution, not a trailblazer or an advocate. His or her role is to interpret and uphold the laws, not to create them. Judge Gorsuch understands this. He takes it seriously.  In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Gorsuch emphasized the importance of judicial precedent and a fair approach to the law. He said: ``I come here with no agenda but one . . . to be as good and faithful a judge as I know how to be.'' Similarly, in a private meeting in my office, the judge promised to ``follow the law, wherever it may lead.''  Judge Gorsuch recognizes the pivotal but limited role that the Constitution allows judges to play in our During long days of testimony at his confirmation hearing, he made clear that while legislators answer to the people, a judge answers only to the law. At the same time, Judge Gorsuch said that he interprets his judicial oath as a promise to ``make sure that every person, poor or rich, mighty or meek, gets equal protection of the law.''  ``Equality before the law'' is Nebraska's State motto. It represents the commitment Nebraskans made 150 years ago when we entered the That principle remains strong today. It should be a cornerstone of judicial philosophy for any nominee to our Nation's highest It is why the words ``Equal Justice Under Law'' are engraved on the front of the Supreme Judge Gorsuch is dedicated to this principle. He is committed to applying the laws neutrally, equally, and fairly to all people.  Some of my Democratic colleagues are saying that Judge Gorsuch is out of the mainstream. They argue that he will not look out for the little guy. They are prepared to take the unprecedented and extreme step of filibustering this nomination. This would be the first successful totally partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court Justice in the history of the U. Let me share some of the facts about this institution. In our country's history, no Cabinet nominees have ever been denied their appointments by a Senate filibuster. In our country's history, no Federal district court judges have ever been denied their seats by a Senate filibuster.  The first time a filibuster was used to defeat a judicial nomination was for a Circuit Court judge, Miguel Estrada, who was nominated by President George Bush to the U.Court of Appeals for the DC  In our country's history, the filibuster has been invoked only to block a Supreme Court nominee. It was in 1968, and a threatened bipartisan filibuster by Republicans and Democrats prevented Associate Justice Fortas from becoming Chief Justice of the Supreme The nominee ended up withdrawing because of ethical concerns. Two sitting members of the Supreme Court were confirmed by fewer than 60 votes on an up-or-down vote, but neither one was the subject of a filibuster.  A filibuster of this nominee sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the reputation of this institution. Judge Gorsuch will make an excellent Supreme Court The American people deserve to have him on the bench. I look forward to voting in support of Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve as our next Supreme Court And I urge my Senate colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

10812,topic-id,1376,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the effort by my Republican colleagues, including the President, to dismantle the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order and roll back protections for workers.  For too long, many workers in this country have been subject to dangerous working conditions, wage theft, discrimination, and harassment. While most companies follow the law and play by the rules, a few have cut corners at the expense of workers' rights and safety and have factored in paying penalties as just another cost of doing business. That is not fair for workers, and it is not fair for the businesses that play by the rules. It is time we put a stop to it.  We certainly should not be spending taxpayers' dollars to pay Federal contractors who violate--and sometimes repeatedly violate--Federal labor laws. Repeated violations by Federal contractors is a serious problem.  According to a 2013 HELP Committee staff report, 49 government contractors accounted for 1,776 Federal labor law violations. We are talking about things like an unsafe workplace, discriminating against workers, or failing to pay workers what they earned. Understand when I talk about unsafe workplaces, I am talking about fatalities. But despite these widespread violations, these companies continue to receive taxpayer-funded Federal contracts worth $81 billion a year.  My colleagues may have seen a recent Politico Magazine report on VT VT Halter is a major Navy shipbuilder, but its safety track record is deeply concerning. In 2009, two workers were killed and five others injured--some severely--when an explosion occurred at a VT Halter shipyard. A month later, they received an $87 million Federal contract. About 6 months after the explosion, VT Halter settled charges relating to the explosion, admitting that they had willfully violated at least 12 Occupational Safety and Health Administration--or OSHA--workplace safety rules to prevent incidents like this from occurring--an incident in which two workers died. They willfully violated--willfully; that is willfully violated.  That explosion wasn't VT Halter's only incident. In 2009, a worker fell to his death at another VT Halter shipyard where there were no handrails or fall protections. In 2012, the company was fined by OSHA after a worker at a VT Halter shipyard was killed when the lid on a pressurized pot exploded. They were fined again in 2014 for violating crane safety rules after two cranes tipped over, injuring five workers, including one 63-year-old worker who now has the mental capacity of a child.  It doesn't make sense to keep rewarding companies like this with lucrative contracts when they repeatedly--and, again, willfully--disregard basic safety protections.  To address this problem, in 2014 President Obama issued an Executive order that essentially says that if you have repeatedly broken our labor laws, the Federal Government will need to examine a company's compliance record on labor law violations before awarding large taxpayer-funded government contracts. Companies with poor track records will need to prove they are taking action to make sure that these types of egregious labor law violations don't happen again.  In addition to cracking down on repeat violators who bid for Federal contracts, the President's Executive order also includes two other important provisions that I support: a requirement that companies give workers a pay stub each pay period and a provision to make sure workers are able to access justice if they have been wronged.  As the Presiding Officer may know, employers are required, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, to accurately report the number of hours an employee works and their pay. But, surprisingly, employers are not always required to give this information to an employee on a pay stub each pay period. This matters. This matters because when a bad actor cheats its employees by undercounting hours or underpaying wages, it is a lot harder for an employee to recover damages if they don't get a pay stub.  It is often low-income workers who work variable shifts who are most easily exploited in these cases. For example, last year, a group of janitors in the[[Page S1599]]Twin Cities won hundreds of thousands of dollars of back pay because their employer had miscounted their hours. And because most of them weren't given pay stubs, it took them much longer to discover that they had been underpaid. One of their key demands, in addition to being paid fairly, was that they start getting pay stubs to ensure they don't get cheated again. This seems to me like a sensible thing to ask.  Let's be clear. Most employers already give their employees pay stubs, so this requirement isn't a big change for them, but it makes a big difference for the workers who are most vulnerable to wage theft. And because this provision has already been implemented, repealing it will have real and obvious consequences for working families.  The fair pay and safe workplaces rule also took an important step toward protecting workers' fundamental rights by banning the use of forced arbitration in cases of discrimination or sexual assault and harassment. As we have seen in a multitude of contexts in recent years, corporate America is increasingly preventing its employees or customers from accessing the court, relying instead on forced arbitration to avoid accountability when people seek justice for being cheated or mistreated. And some of the most egregious cases we have heard are from workers whose rights have been viciously violated and whose cases were forced into the dark.  I have made it a priority during my time in the Senate to combat the widespread and harmful use of forced arbitration. In fact, the forced arbitration regulations within the fair pay and safe workplaces rule build on an effort that I successfully championed 8 years ago.  I first became interested in the issue after learning that major Department of Defense contractors charged with performing vital national security functions were using arbitration to sweep cases of sexual assault and harassment under the rug. I heard stories of women who were assaulted or subjected to hostile working conditions while employed by a DOD contractor. And when those women sought justice for the actions--or inactions--of their employers, they were forced into secret arbitration where none of the traditional safeguards of a public court of law apply. As a result, countless other victims were left in the dark about the women's cases, and the contractors were shielded from accountability, both from the courts and from the public eye.  So in 2009, I introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act that prevented certain DOD contractors from forcing their employees to arbitrate claims of discrimination or sexual assault and harassment. The amendment passed with bipartisan support. In the years since, it continues to be passed on a bipartisan basis as a part of the Defense appropriations process each year, most recently in December of 2014.  Now, it is unclear to me what has changed in the years since we passed my amendment that would make my Republican colleagues shift course. But what is clear is that now is not the time to roll back these critical protections for our workers.  According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, at least 25 percent of American women say they have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. And recent high profile revelations about abuse--for example, former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes' abuse of his employees, as well as the allegations of sex bias at Kay and Sterling Jewelers--demonstrate that we are far from addressing this issue on a broader scale. So I urge my Republican colleagues to reconsider their support for this resolution. I urge them to not force vulnerable women who have been wronged into the dark and into forced arbitration.  Blocking the fair pay and safe workplaces rule is just wrongheaded. A vote to repeal this rule is a vote to support giving taxpayer dollars to companies that break the law, it is a vote to help employers who cheat their employees out of fair pay, and it is a vote to take away workers' fundamental rights to access to the court.  I urge a ``no'' vote, and I thank the Presiding Officer for the generous window of 10 to 15 minutes.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

We are strong allies, and we have a strong military, diplomatic, economic, and cultural relationship with the State of As a Jew, the importance of that relationship is something that I feel in my bones, and as a Senator, working to[[Page S1957]]make our relationship with Israel stronger is a major priority. I strongly believe that part of strengthening that relationship is doing everything we can to help make progress toward a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Helping to resolve that conflict has consistently been one of the top diplomatic priorities of the United  There are very important implications in this selection for the Israeli people, the Palestinian people, the Middle East region, and even beyond. We need an Ambassador who can rise to the challenge, someone who can bring the parties together for negotiations and be regarded as legitimate in the eyes of all parties. Mr.Friedman is not that man.  Mr.Friedman's past conduct demonstrates that he lacks the tools one needs to be a good diplomat. For starters, diplomacy is about choosing your words carefully. It is about reasoning with those with whom you disagree. Diplomacy means not resorting to insults and to name-calling when you have a disagreement, which is something that Mr.Friedman has done time and time and time again.  In an op-ed he penned for the newspaper Arutz Sheva, Mr.Friedman called supporters of the American Jewish Organization J Street ``far worse than kapos.''  Now, for those who don't share the history, I was born in 1951, and I grew up with the holocaust and the stories of the holocaust pounded into my head, and I know what ``kapos'' are. It is the term that refers to Jews who collaborated with the Nazis--with the Gestapo, the guards at the concentration camps during the holocaust. When asked to repudiate his statement on J Street, Mr.Friedman refused, and in fact doubled down, stating ``They're not Jewish, and they are not pro-Israel.'' For those who don't know, J Street is a pro-Israel organization dedicated to the two-state solution--a goal that is shared by successive U.administrations, both Democratic and The two-state solution is the only way to keep Israel a Jewish State and a democracy.  Mr.Friedman's smearing of our fellow Jews--my fellow Jews, many of whom are members of J Street, this is a calumny. This should be a disqualifier for someone seeking to represent the United States in the State of Mr.Friedman's statement shows that he lacks understanding of history--of our history, the history of the Jewish people--it shows he is intolerant of opposing views, and he is profoundly insensitive. That is probably why so many of my fellow Jews have reached out to me, have urged me to reject his nomination.  Mr.Friedman's offensive remarks don't stop there. He regularly insults those with whom he disagrees. He even called me a clown and a moron after I pointed out the anti-Semitic stereotypes evoked in the Trump campaign's final ad. As I told Mr.Friedman when we met in my office, I have been called a moron before--that kind of thing happens in campaigns all the time--but as I also reminded him, part of being a diplomat is being diplomatic.  Now, while I have serious concerns with Mr.Friedman's temperament, my biggest issue with this nominee is his lack of commitment to the peace process. For example, right after being nominated to serve as Ambassador, Mr.Friedman stated that he ``looked forward to doing this from the U.embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem.''  It has been a longstanding policy of the United States to recognize Tel Aviv as the capital of This policy has been viewed by successive administrations as important for helping maintain regional stability and peace with Israel and its neighbors. An abrupt change in this tradition would make it more difficult for the United States to play the role of arbiter, to achieve peace and security between the Israelis and the At a time when we need to reduce tensions in the region, Mr.Friedman was sending the exact wrong message. What I find even more troubling is Mr.Friedman's support for settlement building. Successive U.administrations have recognized that new settlements are barriers to peace. Mr.Friedman has served as president and has been actively fundraising for the American Friends of Beit El, the nonprofit that supports the expansion of that settlement--expansion which is illegal under international law, an expansion deep inside of Palestinian territory.  How can we possibly help advance peace between the two parties with a man who believes there ought to be more settlements--one of the very things that observers on both sides of this conflict recognize as a significant obstacle to peace. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has remained intractable for far too long, proving a hardship--a tragedy--for Israelis and Palestinians both and impacting regional and even global security. I believe--I am convinced that a just and lasting agreement between the two parties on a two-state solution, though very difficult, can and must be achieved. Confirming David Friedman as Ambassador of the United States to Israel will only serve to make that job more difficult, if not impossible, and in my mind would be a tragedy.  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Friedman nomination.  I thank the Presiding  ",CREC-2017-03-23-pt1-PgS1955-2.txt,1969,1730,2017.0,23.0,January

We have had them come and express their opposition to an individual who has proved himself to be a mainstream judge, who has proved time and again that he has the respect of his colleagues on the Tenth Circuit Court--the bench of the Tenth Circuit Court, as well as circuit courts around the country, and that he has the respect and admiration of the Justices of the U.Supreme Court, where Judge Gorsuch clerked for Justice White, the last Coloradan to be on the Nation's High Court, and where he clerked for sitting Justice Anthony  Judge Gorsuch has been known and has become known as a feeder judge--somebody who provides clerks to the Supreme Court because they understand the quality and caliber of Judge Gorsuch's work.

We know about his record as it relates to being reversed or overturned.  We know that our colleagues who, for some reason, are opposing Judge Gorsuch continue to come to the floor and talk about the reasons they apparently can't support Judge Gorsuch: because he will not violate judicial ethics--the ethics judges are expected to keep; because he will not preview how he would rule under a certain fact circumstance. George Washington himself could come down from a mountaintop and would be rejected by the U.Senate to be a Supreme Court  It is pretty incredible to see and hear the arguments that have taken place--some lasting all night--because some of these arguments are nothing more than sour grapes. Some of these arguments are nothing more than that two wrongs must make a right, in their minds. They criticize Republicans for invoking the Biden rule or the Schumer rule, and then they decide because of that, they are going to demand the seat be held open--not confirmed--because they believe it was taken from them. In their mind, if you do two things that are wrong, it must be a right. We have taught our children that is not true.  We know, in this instance, that the American people decided who the Supreme Court Justice would be.  In 2006, Judge Neil Gorsuch was nominated to serve on the Tenth Circuit A dozen sitting Members of this Chamber didn't object to his nomination then. They didn't oppose him. They didn't come and register their ``no'' vote. In fact, nobody even showed up at his confirmation. Lindsey Graham was the only one. That is how objectionable he was then. So either of a couple of things has happened: Nobody did their work then to find out what kind of judge he was going to be or they have decided that the politics have changed.  To me, the most egregious part of this debate is that the politics of the time are demanding that there be absolute obstruction for the first time in over 230 years of a Supreme Court Justice, trying to defeat a Supreme Court Justice with a partisan filibuster for the first time in two centuries, of a judge who agreed 99 percent of the time with the opinions of the court. Ninety-nine percent of the time, his opinions were made with a majority of the court; 97 percent of the time, they were made unanimously.  This is an individual who has outstanding legal credentials: Harvard, Columbia, and, most importantly, time spent at the University of  He is a fourth-generation I think an old joke of the late Justice Scalia was that four of the five boroughs in New York have their own Supreme Court justice. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a Supreme Court Justice from west of the Mississippi River, another western voice on the Supreme Court, a judge who comes from a circuit court that represents 20 percent of the landmass? If you are a Westerner and you have a choice of putting a judge on the Supreme Court who is familiar with Tribal law issues, a judge who is familiar with water issues, a judge who is familiar with public land issues, that is a pretty good pick for the High Court, to represent a vast part of America that is underrepresented on the Nation's High  This institution can seem pretty puzzling at times because you consistently hear the outcry for bipartisan support: Let's work together. Let's have bipartisan support. Then the President nominates a judge who has strong bipartisan credentials from the people who know him the best. Look, most people in Washington, DC, most people in this Chamber have known Neil Gorsuch for just a couple of months since the time of his nomination. Most conversations people in this Chamber have had with Judge Gorsuch have consisted of an hour or two at a judicial confirmation hearing or perhaps when he visited the office prior to the hearing. That is the extent of their relationship and their knowledge and their understanding of Judge  But the people who know him best--the people out in Colorado, Republicans, Democrats--believe he is well qualified and should be confirmed, that he deserves an up-or-down vote. People like Democratic Governor Bill Ritter believe that Judge Gorsuch should have an up-or-down vote and be confirmed.  Some people find Judge Gorsuch to be so unreasonable or so unfit to serve on the High Court, they might find it hard to believe that the 2008 cochair of the Democratic National Convention is supporting Judge Gorsuch's confirmation.  Jim Lyons, an attorney and close friend of President Bill Clinton, supports the confirmation of Judge  They know his record. They have reviewed the cases that the opposition has stated that they find so egregious, and they still believe he is worthy of confirmation to the  The standard that has been set by those who oppose Judge Gorsuch is a standard that simply says: No Justice could be confirmed. Why? We know that because Judge Gorsuch's credentials, his academic background, his judicial history, his temperament, his qualifications, his ratings show that he is more than able to serve and deserving to serve on the Supreme  There is a certainly a difference in philosophy that has been presented here, a difference of philosophies that some people believe that a judge should just be a judge who follows the law or rules and makes a decision based on where the law takes them, but there are people who believe that a judge somehow has to be maybe a focus group of opinion or policy preferences, that a judge should be somebody who puts their thumb on the scale of justice to reach an outcome that is preferred by a political party. That is not what our Founders had in mind when they wrote the That is not what justice is about.  Judge Gorsuch believes that you take an opinion, you take a decision where the law takes you, where the law leads you as a guardian of the  He understands the separation of powers, but apparently that is not good enough for some. They want an activist judge, but I hope that over the next several hours and the next few days that our colleagues will come realize that those who know him best believe that he is qualified, that he deserves an up-or-down vote, that a judge who votes 99 percent of the time in the majority agrees with them.  I look forward to our conversations as we confirm Judge Gorsuch at the end of this week.  The PRESIDING The Senator from Rhode  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt,99999999999999,,2017.0,4.0,January
10865,topic-id,268,"Mr.President, one of the most important constitutional duties we as Senators have is to decide whether a Supreme Court nominee is the right person for the job.  When we make a decision, we should always consider what is best for the people of this country. Three branches of government were created to serve the people, so no matter what we do--whether it is here in the Senate, whether it is in the White House, or whether it is across the street in the Supreme Court--the American people should always come first. And our rights--our individual rights should never be subordinate to the rights of corporations.  The Supreme Court is supposed to be the ultimate protector of our individual rights--the ultimate arbiter of justice for our citizens.  Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch, over the course of his career, has made it clear that he thinks the rights of corporations are more important than the rights of individuals.  For someone who describes himself as a strict constructionist--as a so-called textualist--his judicial ruling on corporate rights in the Hobby Lobby case is one of the biggest distortions of our sacred principle of individual rights that I have ever seen.  And now President Trump has nominated Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, where he could end up ruling on many more cases related to individual rights.  In my State, just like in many of yours, there are thousands and thousands of families who will be directly affected by the decisions the Supreme Court makes in the next few years: voting rights, workers' rights, reproductive rights.

11087,topic-id,2691,"Mr.Speaker, it is an honor to get to come into this hallowed Hall and to have a chance to address ourpeers.  It was a rather enjoyable day yesterday, even with all the vitriol, but I was reminded and couldn't help butreminisce a bit and walk a bit down memory lane yesterday as we heard from Members of the House on the other side of the aisleexpressing repeatedly a desire to have open debate and not shut off debate.  The reminiscing took me back to a time last yearwhen, as far as we could find, the only time in American history one party in the United States Congress physically preventedanother party from coming to the floor and going into session and trying to begin debate and trying to discuss the business ofthe day. We can't find that any party ever staged such a sit-in.  We know there are House rules about not eating on the Housefloor and about not having things to drink on the House floor other than water, and yet our friends across the aisle were eatingand drinking. It is actually a violation of the House rules to sing on the House floor. Every now and then, people look theother way from the violation, but certainly not to take pictures and broadcast.  I approached the Sergeant at Arms and askedhim why this wasn't stopped.  I was told: Well, they won't stop; we have told them repeatedly.  I said: Well, you won'tlet Republicans get away with this kind of conduct. They are preventing debate. They are preventing a session from startingtimely. This has been going on for hours.  I was told: Well, Congressman, when we tell you Republicans that you are violatinga rule, you stop and you follow the rules. We have told them repeatedly, and they will not stop violating the rules. They willnot stop preventing you from going into session, so we don't know what else to do.  Mr.Speaker, I had issues like that whenI was a felony judge, and they didn't last long because we had bailiffs who would drag people out to stop such inappropriateconduct. It just seemed that, in this potentially last bastion of civility where we can use words and debate issues, it israther ironic, to say the least, to be preached to repeatedly about the desire for open debate and the desire to not be shutdown from speaking when that is exactly what happened last year by the very people who were standing up, and some of them werereading a script pointing out how offended they were by being prevented by the rules under which we have been proceeding fromgoing forward and debating. So it is rather ironic and rather incredible actually.  I also recall back when we were debatingObamaCare and some of us wanted to get amendments into Of course, some of us remember the fact that John Dingell waschairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce that had jurisdiction over the healthcare debate and the healthcare bill. Hehas been working for a healthcare bill, something like what passed, for all of his time, as I am aware of, in the  Iwas told by someone that his father may have worked for the same bill for years. So that was something that was going to be acrowning glory for an incredibly honorable man. We see differently on many issues, but I know him to be an honest and honorableman. His word has always been good. When he has given it, it was always the way it is. I have great respect for him.  Anyway,he understood that the cap-and-trade bill that was being pushed here in the House by then-Speaker Pelosi was going tounduly harm the Nation's poor more than anybody else in the country. If you are very rich, if you are on Wall Street, you arefriends of the Obama administration, and you have gotten $656 million in grants to open a non-carbon-based energy facility, youare not worried about the price of anything because your friends in the Obama administration were giving you millions andbillions of dollars that you could fritter away as you wished.  But for our Nation's middle class, lower middle class, andpoor that don't have the ability to absorb increasing energy costs, the cap-and-trade bill would have been devastating. That iswhy, when John Dingell was asked about the cap-and-trade bill, he responded something to the effect that it is not only a tax,it is a great big tax, it will unfairly hit the poor, and he was not going to bring that bill out of committee. So SpeakerPelosi, at that time, took whatever actions were required to remove him as chair and replace him with Henry  Chairman Waxman made clear: We don't need your votes; we don't want your input; so we don't care what you want in thehealthcare bill.  Joe Barton, the longest serving Texan in the House right now, had indicated, as a former chair of thatsame committee, that it is interesting if[[Page H89]]John Dingell--the consummate professional and honorable man that he is--had beenallowed to remain as chairman of that committee, he would have instinctively gotten Republican input into that bill and includedthings in the bill that Republicans would have had a hard time voting against. If he had been allowed to remain as chairman ofthe Energy and Commerce Committee, John Dingell would have probably been able to get a bill through that would not even be takenup by this body to be repealed and ripped out by its roots.  Hopefully that is what we are going to be able to do with theextremely partisan bill. There were groups that were telling Republicans: Look, of course we are negotiating with the We have got to have a seat at the table.  I would tell them: Not when you are on the menu.  But there weregroups like the Big Pharma, like the American Hospital Association, the AMA, and some of the health insurance businesses thatended up getting behind it. Of course, AARP totally sold out retired folks because they were going to makehundreds of millions--billions perhaps--more than they would have without ObamaCare being passed. They had no interest insupporting a bill like I proposed that would have ended any need for a senior citizen to ever have to pay for supplementalinsurance on top of Medicare; they would have been totally covered.  But I didn't realize, at the time I asked them tosupport it in 2009, that the year before they had made, I think, over $400 million or so in profit as a nonprofit organizationon getting their members to buy their insurance that they had sponsored and put their mark of approval on.  So anyway, therewere people that were going to make a lot of money. But I could see that in the end it would probably spell the doom of thepharmaceutical industry. Yes, it would be years down the road; yes, there would be executives at pharmaceutical companies whowould see massive billions of dollars come in more than would have otherwise; and, yes, they would likely take their goldenparachutes and their millions in severance in retirement and be gone before they were relegated to perhaps producing medicationswithout getting reimbursement for research and development. This is the way this whole ObamaCare thing would have eventuallyplayed out, and still they got on board with ObamaCare because they were going to make short-term extra billions of dollars.  So having all of that in mind, as it has all appeared to me, it had just been astounding to be here yesterday and hear allthe comments about the inability to have open debate.  I have talked to numerous friends across the aisle who were greatlytroubled over the last 6 years. Actually, the Office of Congressional Ethics was started by Speaker You are allowedto file complaints without anybody knowing who filed the complaint. The OCE is then able to go after a Member of Congress andstart demanding things that they could not possibly be entitled to under the Constitution if a Member of Congress were gettingdue process.  I haven't been run through the ringer like so many have. But when you set up a process like that, and you havethe Office of Congressional Ethics set up, they have no one at all to whom they are accountable--no one--and they are encouraged,even if they filed the complaints themselves, to enable them to continue to grow from the little office they had over here inthe Longworth I am told they have a massive amount of space in one of the big Federal buildings now, and they continueto grow. So apparently, they were offended that their budget was cut and they were put under the Ethics Committee so that theywould have some accountability. There were an awful lot of great people--good friends--across the country that did not know abouthow unconstitutionally they had been acting--I mean more abusive even than the IRS at times from the reports of some of mycolleagues to me of what they have been through.  I stand here, Mr.Speaker, as a judge who has had to look people in the eyeand sentence them to death--something that is never taken lightly. I may be the only person here in Congress who has ever lookedsomeone in the eye and sentenced them to death and been appointed as counsel against my wishes to represent an indigentdefendant on appeal from a capital murder conviction under sentence of death and was able, appropriately, to have his casereversed and to save his life as the law should have been. So I feel rather strongly that, yes, people should be accountable,but they must have due process, and that is not what is provided for by the                              {time}  1715  Wonderful people, including our incoming President, were not aware of just how crazy the abuses have been.One of the Members was telling me yesterday that he was out about half a million dollars in attorney's fees responding toridiculous demands and still never got to know who the accuser was. You don't get to necessarily even see what the specificcomplaint is.  So we didn't do a good job of educating people of how grossly unfair the OCE process was, could be, buteverybody in Congress, the judiciary, and executive branch needs someone to whom they are accountable, and that would includethe  We have got to do something about this, but we do need to go about it in an appropriate way to make sure that, onceagain, justice is done. But when you hear ``ethics watchdog group,'' then immediately you think, Gee, they are going to stop anethics watchdog group? That is outrageous. That is what I would think if I didn't know all the background.  So it made for aninteresting day yesterday, but I have been amazed, though, that some who have told me that they wanted to eliminate the OCE whostand up on the other side of the aisle and preach about ethics, apparently referring to the effort to place OCE and make themaccountable under somebody for a change--in this case, under the Ethics Committee--and would demagogue the issue, in essence, whenthey have been mistreated by the OCE, according to what I have been told by them in the past.  So I think if we can just setthe politics aside and work together for appropriate due process, we can have a bipartisan group that could work out somethingthat would create due process and would make people accountable so that when you have somebody with $90,000 of cold, hard cashin their freezer, there is accountability. In that case, it was a crime and it needed to be addressed. So there does need to beaccountability.  I know we have friends here. I saw my friend, Steve King, at the back just a moment ago. We feelstrongly that when a Federal judge intentionally refuses to go along with what they know the Constitution says, that ought to bean impeachable offense. They are not keeping their oath, and that is as offensive as anything is when it comes from a judge.They ought to be able to impeach a judge like that.  I don't think we have done enough removal, impeachment of judges whohave violated their oath. Yes, we were removing a judge who had committed sexual assault. Well, that should have been a no-brainer, but that took literally an act of Congress to eventually get that done.  For another judge, it was not until weactually impeached him for his terribly inappropriate actions of suppressing information when he was being investigated forbeing a Federal judge, but from his days as a State judge. Apparently, as a State judge, he didn't have a problem, if tuitionwas due for his son, to just send the secretary or somebody to one of the law offices which he often appoints and then have themfill up the envelope with a bunch of cash and use that to pay his son's tuition. That didn't seem to be a problem for thatjudge. Those are all things that should have been appropriately taken into account before he was ever made a Federal judge.  I see my friend here on the floor. I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa).  Mr.I was listening to the gentleman's remarks on a couple of these topics here that are veryimportant.  He led off with the situation that occurred with the sit-in that occurred here on this House floor last year,some months ago, and I found that to be very appalling for the decorum, for[[Page H90]]the honor, for the history, for all the thingsthat are important about conducting ourselves in a society where order is needed in order to conduct business.  This Housefloor was not treated with that respect that is necessary to have order, to have an honest debate, and a debate that isconstructive when you have a sit-in like that where basically the folks on the other side of the aisle--some of them--decided totake over the entire building outside of session, outside of the rules. As Mr.Gohmert mentioned, many rules were violated.  I had the appalling experience of walking on the floor just a few minutes after they concluded their sit-in and, honestly,the garbage that was laying on the floor. I saw food crumbs, old newspapers, magazines, a couple of blankets. They didn't evenpick up after themselves. They expected the staff of the building to pick it up and haul it off for them because their OccupyWall Street moment was over with. This is not the sixties. This is not the hippy era. This is the United States House of This week, rules were proposed that say, when you violate rules in such a fashion where videotaping orPeriscoping, as they call it, is occurring--sending these speeches during a nonofficial, non-session time, basically bootleggingthem to the American public via C-SPAN; and I am a little annoyed with C-SPAN actually playing along with the violation ofHouse rules of piping this out the way they did.  If you want to have a protest out on the front lawn, fine. That is withinthe rights of free speech, the First Amendment, and all that. You don't do it in violation of the rules of a fairly, some mightsay, sacred place--this House floor--the way that happened then. For them to be piping it out live that way, I found it to becompletely wrong.  There are those folks that might say: Well, this is all First Amendment rights, not in violation of thedecorum of the House rules. So I am glad Mr.Gohmert brought that up. Rules are put in place this week to address peoplethat are going to violate the very House rules that help us keep order and do business of the American public. We lost part of,I think, three session days that we could have been grinding out the important business that the people expect of this country.  We lost that session time and, indeed, had to come in here and the Speaker or whoever wasintroducing legislation that day had to yell over the process here to do things in order for the I find that appalling.It isn't very mature. I think with some of the penalties that are put in place by the rules this week, there will be a littlemore accountability for that.

11088,topic-id,667,"I recall being told when that was going on and afterit happened that Republicans should not respond, and that we were assured that people who violated the rules back then would bepunished. Well, adopting rules now, specific penalties, don't really punish people that violated those very rules last year.  So I am surprised that there is any complaint at all since basically it means people who violated the rule with such abandonwould complain about inserting a specific penalty now, meaning they got a free one. They didn't even get probation. They gotnothing. They got pardoned, basically.  Perhaps it is not too late for those that feel like putting a penalty in place now isunfair. I don't think it is too late. It is not unusual to have punishment assessed in a felony case 6 months or more after anevent. Perhaps if they think it is unfair, then we ought to have ethics hearings on what happened back then.  I haven't heardof the OCE, by the way, taking any action on such widespread abuse that didn't require investigation. All you needed was footagethat was being streamed out from the very violators of the rules. So it should have been an easy thing to pursue, if OCE werereally that interested in making sure our rules were not violated.  I yield to my friend.  Mr.It wouldn't be inappropriate since OCE is a hot topic this week.  The accountability goes both directions. Sowe have heard our colleagues talk about unjust charges that can be brought from anywhere, out of the blue, against a Member ofthe House without justification, without even a due process for that Member to have a chance to address directly what thatcharge is, and then have their name run through the newspaper, giant headlines, and maybe a year's worth of investigation.  When you see it, Congressman being investigated, well, that is an ugly headline. It can be used to manipulate it forpolitical purpose when it might be a trumped-up charge, something that has no merit, and many times talking to my colleaguesthat have faced this, hundreds of thousands of dollars of cost to them for attorney's fees, their reputation besmirched by this,when, really, there is an investigative process that is open, with oversight.  Now we didn't have the perfect piece oflegislation in the rule this week. We probably need a little more time for it to be aired out and a little more widely. Itwas withdrawn after at least getting the idea out on the table.  So I am proud of my colleagues who are going to take this upand work in a bipartisan fashion and get the input to make some needed reforms to the OCE so that we have an ethics process thatis fair to the Members, but obviously enforces ethics for this House that are needed and clearly demanded by the public and us.  We are talking here tonight about a decorum, a code, a process that our House is to be conducted by. So that sit-in is oneextreme. The other one is charges that are, in many cases, absolved months later without giant headlines but are not evensometimes an oops or I am sorry for trumped-up charges being brought up against somebody that would affect them negatively intheir ability to serve their districts or to fend off the huge costs of legal matters that they have to go through.  So manyof my colleagues here strongly care and want to have a strong ethical process in this place, but there needs to beaccountability and balance to it. That is what we are all looking forward to, is accountability with OCE and our EthicsCommittee who, in a bipartisan fashion, can weed through all these processes.  I think we will get to that. For those thatare concerned around this country that some here want to get rid of that ethics process, that absolutely couldn't be furtherfrom the truth. We all demand that with the code of conduct of this House, on the floor and off, of our  ",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgH88-3.txt,1801,,2017.0,4.0,January
11089,topic-id,3654,"I thank my friend, Mr.LaMalfa for great insights. Such truth.  I also wasjust advised this afternoon that the EPA, apparently in accordance with some frenzied effort to have this administration put asproblematic regulations in place to stifle the economy, stifle and skyrocket further costs of energy, has apparently givennotice to all gas operators that they have 60 days to comply.  One such operator in Texas was saying the date on the noticesays it was received December 15, but he was out of the country. Somebody in the building accepted it. The date for the 60-daycompliance kicks in January 18, 2 days before President-elect Donald Trump would be able to strike such an arbitrary andcapricious regulation down.                              {time}  1730  Apparently, they must have backdatedthe 60-day compliance before they ever got notice saying you have got until January 18 to comply. So what we have heard from somany small-business owners, they get notices like this: You have all of a sudden got to comply. You have got to give us allthese records, those records.  It has cost them a fortune. It has stifled their ability to expand their business and hiremore people and give more people opportunity and give more people opportunity to make more money than they had been making.Those have been so completely stifled by this administration. I understand there was a political article glorifying the greatefforts of the Obama administration in helping the economy, and to justify that, took one quarter out of, I guess--four timeseight--32 quarters and said, ``Look what they did in this one quarter,'' when actually, as I understood, if you take the wholeterm that we have numbers on and adjust the growth for inflation, President Obama's administration, his policies,[[Page H91]]his cronycapitalism, helping people with no-bid contracts like IBM, giving $1.6 billion to this company to create mirrors to heat waterand however much it was, hundreds of millions for Solyndra--there are just so many companies. They have squandered so much money.And yet, with all the money squandered, the economy grew, when adjusted for inflation, at about half the growth rate during theJimmy Carter administration.  Now, I understand this administration is extremely proud of what they accomplished, but I wouldhumbly submit, Mr.Speaker, if your policies cause the economy to grow at half the rate of the Jimmy Carter administration, youhave done more damage to the American people and the American economy than you have done good, and that is for sure. And that isat a time when, scientifically, we were having such breakthroughs that we found out we could actually be totally energyindependent if this administration had not been spending so much money on too expensive of sources of energy and all the otherthings this administration supported.  We had a hearing in Chairman Rob Bishop's Committee on Natural Resources in ourSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, a hearing on some of the abuses. I know there are legitimate groups and businessesthat have invested in this idea of having this fantastic carbon-free energy production out in California, and, yes, it took amassive amount of acreage. I believe it was Federal land that they were allowed to use. I believe. I am not certain.  I wasintrigued, they were going to create all these mirrors that would reflect the Sun's light in concentrated amounts towards threedifferent towers, and the towers would then be superheated, superheat the water, turn the water to steam. The steam would turnturbines that would produce electricity. If I recall correctly, they got $1.6 billion in government loan; and to help them maketheir loan payment, they got over $600 million in grants.  When I asked over this period of time that they have beenoperating how much of their $1.6 billion in government loan was paid back, I believe he said $6 million had been paid back from,it may have been, $656 million that they had given to them by this administration.  But we also came to find out thatapparently there have been problems. One of the towers got super-superheated and was totaled, was destroyed because of themassive sunlight reflected and damaged to where it wouldn't function. Because, apparently, they had squandered so much of theirmoney, they had to find a cheap source, an extremely cheap source of energy because they had contracts to supply a certainamount of electricity. With the third tower not in operation, they were not able to supply over 30 percent of the energy theyhad contracted to provide. They very quickly, cheaply, efficiently built a natural gas electricity production plant, and, wow,apparently it is working great. Of course, anybody that studies natural gas understands, if they know what they are doing, thatnatural gas is an amazingly clean form of energy.  Anyway, now about a third of the energy is being produced using naturalgas, when the whole purpose of the massive $1.6 billion in the government-backed loan and the $656 million or so that was givento them was because it was not going to be carbon based at all.  But it is not just the one problem, apparently, of thetower. This is out in an arid area where there is not much water. Well, they didn't need much water other than what they had inthe towers, really; but what they didn't anticipate was something that I am told operators, others in the area refer to asflamers.  Flamers, as I was given to understand, those are birds, perhaps some of them endangered species, that make themistake of flying through the superheated beam of sunlight and immediately explode or burst into flame. Apparently, if you are abird that gets superheated and explodes, bursts into flame, then masses of fluid keep covering the mirrors, which need to bekept clean.  Normally, you would figure out in a desert or an arid area, you are not going to need to clean those mirrorsvery often, so you are not going to need much water. But then when it turns out you have got all these flamers that supercoatthe mirrors so they are constantly having to be recleaned, those poor birds that our nature-loving friends are exploding, it isrunning up the water bill as well because, gee, it is just not healthy to be exploding birds that fly through this superheatedbeam of sunlight.  So 8 years of misguided policies have made, probably, a lot of Democratic millionaires, but the Americanpublic has suffered; and when adjusted for inflation, the American people are, on average, worse off.  I was surprised to seea video where the President actually admitted, he had actually acknowledged, that in his administration, for the first time weare aware of in the history of the United States, 95 percent of the income in America went to the top 1 percent of the incomeearners. I have read articles since then about, actually, even that 1 percentthat was making 95 percent of the Nation's income, they still weren't making, many of them, quite as much as they had before,because that is what happens when you hurt and throttle down an economy, as has happened. We haven't really adjusted.  Ofcourse, we have had the Fed that has had interest rates down to basically nothing, and it was clear they were doing everythingthey could to try to help the Obama administration's economy look better than it was. Now that people have started having hopebecause we have President-elect Trump and the policies are going to change dramatically, we are going to hopefully be completelyrid of, or as completely as possible, the crony capitalism. I know my colleagues here in the House, actually on both sides ofthe aisle, have made clear we want to stop crony capitalism, and I am looking forward to that stopping once we get out fromunder this administration.  So the economy is showing great signs. I have got people back home telling me they are startingto hire again just based on the hope and the promise. President Obama was supposed to bring hope and change, but all myconstituents tell me so many of them are left with, after he has been President, a little change left from what they had when hetook office.  But there is real hope, and people are gearing up to grow, and the economy should take off, and we should getenergy independent. I expect President-elect Trump to keep his promises. He assured me personally he was going to. So I amexpecting great things. But just on that, the economy has started going up, on the assurance that President Obama would not bearound any longer than January 20, and as a result now, the Fed finally has started increasing interest rates because they don'thave to artificially try to protect President Obama's reputation and his poor economy.  So just the fact that the EPA wouldsend out regulations in such a capricious manner as they have, demanding that well operators start monitoring all theiremissions, something to that effect, I am looking forward to getting into it and just seeing how abusive the EPA has been asthese oligarchs. Not to give a chance for true input into an arbitrary and capricious rule, not to give businesses a chance toget ready and to adjust, I mean, this is the kind of thing that has stifled so much growth and has sent so many high school andcollege graduates to their parents' home.  I think there are a lot of people who voted for President Obama and were excited.I think it is unfortunate that so many people expressed that they voted for a President because of his skin color--and I am nottalking about Donald Trump--that they made a racist vote to vote for a man who was not White so they could feel good about votingfor someone who was not White, where some of us--and it is one of the things for which I love Alveda King, Martin Luther King'sniece. I mean, she believes in his dream, and the Americans that voted for Donald Trump, they believe that skin color should notmatter. It is racist to vote for a candidate because of what his race is.  Let's look at the character. Let's look at thequalifications. What have you built that you actually built that someone else didn't build for you? Let's look at those thingsand then make a determination rather than voting for[[Page H92]]someone just because of his race. Let's do as Martin Luther King, Jr.,was so profound in saying in looking forward to the day when people were judged by the content of their character rather thanthe color of their skin. I am looking forward to that day. That day has been set back tremendously.  It was a highlight forme back at the end of the fall to go back to my hometown of Mount Pleasant, I had mentioned to a reporter sometime back,though I didn't vote for President Obama, I had hopes that he would do for America what Coach Willie Williams did for ourfootball team. Actually, I didn't say ``football team.'' I said ``our team.''                              {time}  1745  Liberals immediately put up an article saying that I said my basketball coach, my favorite coach, wasAfrican Apparently, liberals think, if you are African American, you must be a coach of basketball because of yourrace. When actually, it was the year before I went to the varsity, I was on the junior varsity, and I enjoyed playing for CoachWilliams more than any coach I had ever played for.  And unfortunately, Coach Williams' memory is still intact. I haven'tseen him in decades. But I was asked to come give a motivational talk for the team I played for--the Mount Pleasant Itwas such a treat being with those players that morning. It had a rough year to that point. I got to be with them on the fieldduring the game. It was such a treat. Those young people were just inspirational. They fought hard, and some say it was the bestgame of the year. They won singlehandedly against a team from a bigger town than Mount They even gave me the gameball.  And as much as that meant to me, the real highlight was, as we went into halftime, somebody told me that my old coach,back from over 40 years ago, was up in the press box, and I got to go up. I was so thrilled to see him. We hugged and smiled bigas ever. I was so elated in seeing him and talking to him. Somebody said when I got back here--when I said: I finally got to seeCoach Williams after all these years. It was wonderful.  Well, did you get a picture?  I didn't even think about apicture. That is not a very good politician. But I didn't think about a picture. But it is a shame.  His memory is so goodbecause he remembered. We didn't have a lot of talent on that team. We didn't. He made us so cohesive. We played well together.We didn't have any outstanding talent, but we had a winning season. And it was a fun season because Coach Williams made it thatway. He inspired us together. Everybody got treated just the same. Nobody got special treatment. Nobody got treated more harshlythan anybody else. And we came together as a team.  He remembered. He said: Yeah, you guys didn't have much talent on yourteam, but you played so well together. Well, that was because of him. He brought us together.  And I so hoped that PresidentObama would do that for I didn't vote for him, but I thought it will be awesome if he can bring us even closertogether. And now at the end of his administration, it is so grievous that America seems more divided than ever.  I see anarticle here about more police officers again being shot in our U.cities. I heard the former police chief, I believe, inChicago this week saying that Black Lives Matter was supposedly organized to try to stop killings of Black, especially young,men. And yet, what Black Lives Matter has done is actually increase the number of people being shot.  I was absolutelyastounded to hear a quote from the A speech, apparently, he was making. I heard it on the radio. Maybe he was givingan interview. But he was saying that we know that cities that have more gun control laws just have less violence. That is calledgaslighting. That is called creating a fiction and trying to push it across and make somebody who knows the truth think thatthey are crazy and that this alternate truth is really what is going on.  The fact is that cities with the most gun controllaws, like Chicago, for heaven's sakes--I mean, the hundreds of precious Black lives that have been taken, been killed, themassive gun control laws have not helped They have got a massive number of gun control laws there than we do in anycity in east Texas, and yet nowhere in east Texas has that kind of violence at that percentage rate. It is insane.  It istime to quit trying to gaslight the American people, convince them they are going crazy, and that what they know to be true isfiction. It is time to just have a truthful assessment of where we are. We need to follow the law. We need to have enforcementof our borders.  We will continue to be the most generous Nation in the world, not just in giving funds to help others, notjust in giving lives of our citizens to help freedom for other countries like nowhere else in history, but also most generous inthe number of visas and the number of people that we allow to come into the United States and visit. Yet, that generosity hasbeen abused. As the border patrol has said, every time we hear somebody in the government in Washington say anything aboutlegalizing anything, or anybody that is here illegally, it is like a shiny object that draws even greater numbers illegallythrough our borders.  And what is our border patrol ordered to do? Don't turn them back and prevent them from entering theUnited Oh, no. Let them step foot on American soil, then in-process them, and we will ship them around different places.Although, I saw an article last week where there were some aliens illegally here who were just dropped off at a bus stop.  Ihave an article from Julia Edwards Ainsley, January 3, from Reuters: ``Trump Team Seeks Agency Records on Border BarriersSurveillance.'' It is fantastic. I mean, here they are trying to gear up, yet they want to know information. They don't want tobe gaslighted. They want to know what is the truth so that they can start making hard preparations for taking office on  An article, December 30, from Paul Bedard from the Washington Examiner says that the Department of Homeland Securitysays 94 percent of deportations are people illegally here, terror threats, or gang bangers. The CBP--border patrol--reportsassaults on border agents have skyrocketed 231 percent in 2017.  So not only has this President's rules of engagement gottenabout four times more Americans killed, our military members killed in Afghanistan, in the same amount of time as Commander inChief George Bush had, in addition to the rules of engagement getting our people killed four times faster than underCommander in Chief Bush, but also the assaults on our own agents have gone up 231 percent just in this year--in 1 year. We are getting our border patrol harmed.  Another article by Chris Tomlinson in Breitbart: ``600 `Underage'Migrants Turn Out to Be Adults.'' I mean, I have seen that in the middle of the night down on the border. People coming in,switching off Xeroxed indications they were going to use for their identification: This is who I am. For whatever reason, theywould look at their thing and switch out as to who was going to be who. They weren't able to vet those people, but they werestill ordered to in-process them anyway.  This article from Michael Patrick Leahy, December 7, reported that Somaliarefugees were arriving in the United States at the highest rate ever in the first two months of fiscal year 2017, which would beOctober and So just astounding when America was making very clear we need to protect American citizens. It is not justthe people in this room, as we did yesterday, who take that oath, but the President takes that oath. You have got cabinetmembers that take the oath, yet they are not doing their jobs. People are getting killed. 85,000 refugees under Obama, but lessthan 10 to the District of So, apparently, let's put those refugees in your backyard. We certainly don't want them inWashington, D.C.'s backyard, apparently, according to this administration.  Then it is pretty amazing, but just 10 Statesresettled more than half of recent refugees to the United Naturally, way more than anywhere else was California andThe Daily Caller reported that the ``State Department claims no one used sham visas from fake embassy.'' Yet, we haveseen hundreds and hundreds of people that--the report showed--had been[[Page H93]]given citizenship by mistake when they were supposedto have been deported. It doesn't seem like a very innocent mistake when it is that egregious.  Back in December, TheWashington Times reported that the ``Obama administration fails to check immigrants against FBI databases, approvescitizenship'' anyway.  The Afghan refugee program has not been totally successful. A report here, Afghan refugee in Decemberwas arrested for rape and murder of a top EU official's daughter. So, apparently, that was not working out so well. But that wasin the country of Germany where you have a like-minded leader in Angela Merkel, who wants to defeat terrorism, as our Presidentdoes, with love and compassion. Well, love is a stronger emotion than hate. Love can overcome evil.  But when people arereligiously dedicated to wiping another group of people off the planet for what they deem to be their holy god, those are peoplethat have to be defeated. They are at war with you. You defeat them militarily. That puts radical Islam back in a box until someother well-meaning fool like former President Carter--a fine man, just a foolish President--not demeaning his character, but hewas just very foolish--in citing the Ayatollah Khomeini as a man of peace, as he was so welcoming in the Ayatollah Khomeinitaking over That released radical Islam out of the box, gave them control of a major country, major country military, andthousands and thousands and thousands of people continue to die because of that mistake.  We know going back to the earlydays of the United States when so much of the Federal Treasury was used to pay ransom to get our sailors back who were beingcaptured by radical Islamists in North Africa, and Jefferson couldn't understand why they kept attacking American boats.                              {time}  1800  He asked the Islamist whom he was negotiating with why they keptattacking American ships. We are not a threat to you. We don't even have a  Reportedly, the response was, in essence:Look, if we die, in attacking someone like you, we go straight to paradise.  Jefferson was amazed. He couldn't believe therewas a world religion--or even people's interpretation of a world religion--that advocated that you could go to paradise forkilling innocent people. Of course, they maintained they are not innocent because they don't believe exactly like the radicalIslamists believe.  President Obama basically did the same thing with Qadhafi was not a good man; but, since 2003, thereports were clear, as others in North Africa and the Middle East reported, that he was about the best friend that the UnitedStates had in helping to fight terrorism in that area; yet this administration took him out. There were times on this floor thatI and others were begging the administration not to take out Qadhafi, not to keep helping the rebels, not to keep bombingQadhafi's troops until we knew how extensive al Qaeda was. We knew that at least a part of the people fighting were radicalIslamists, but the administration went on and turned the country into chaos.  Thank God America is going to have a newadministration before we completely go to chaos ourselves.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgH88-3.txt,1801,,2017.0,4.0,January
10787,topic-id,794,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today, the House of Representatives will again vote to approve legislation that reforms and modernizes the Electronic Communications Privacy Act or Last year, identical legislation passed with unanimous bipartisan support by a vote of 419-0.  Reforming ECPA has been a top priority for me as chairman of the Judiciary I have worked with Members of Congress, advocacy groups, and law enforcement agencies for years on many complicated nuances involved in updating this law.  The resulting bill is a carefully negotiated agreement to update the procedures governing government access to stored communications content and records.  Thirty years ago, when personal computing was still in its infancy and few of us had ever heard of something called the world wide web, Congress enacted ECPA to establish procedures that strike a fair balance between the privacy expectations of American citizens and the legitimate needs of law enforcement agencies.  In 1986, mail was sent through the U.Postal Service, a search engine was called a library, and clouds were found only in the sky. In 1986, computer storage was finite and expensive. It was unheard of that a commercial product would allow users to send and receive electronic communications around the globe for free and store those communications for years with a third-party provider.  So much has changed in the last three decades. The technology explosion of the last three decades has[[Page H991]]placed a great deal of information on the internet, in our emails, and on the cloud. Today, commercial providers, businesses, schools, and governments of all shapes and sizes provide email and cloud computing services to customers, students, and employees.                              {time}  1745  The Email Privacy Act establishes for the first time in Federal statute a uniform warrant requirement for stored communication content in criminal investigations, regardless of the type of service provided, the age of an email, or whether the email has been opened.  The bill preserves the authority for law enforcement agents to serve the warrant on the provider because, as with any other third-party custodian, the information sought is stored with them. However, the bill acknowledges that providers may give notice to their customers when in receipt of a warrant, court order, or subpoena, unless the provider is court-ordered to delay such notification.  The bill continues current practice that delineates which remote computing service providers, or cloud providers, are subject to the warrant requirement for content in a criminal investigation.  ECPA has traditionally imposed heightened legal process and procedures to obtain information for which the customer has a reasonable expectation of privacy, namely, emails, texts, photos, videos, and documents stored in the cloud. H.387 preserves this treatment by maintaining in the statute limiting language regarding remote computing services.  Contrary to practice 30 years ago, today, vast amounts of private, sensitive information are transmitted and stored electronically. But this information may also contain evidence of a crime, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly dependent upon stored communications content and records in their investigations.  To facilitate timely disclosure of evidence to law enforcement, the bill authorizes a court to require a date for return of service of the warrant. In the absence of such a requirement, H.387 requires email and cloud providers to promptly respond to warrants for communications content.  Current law makes no distinction between content disclosed to the public, like an advertisement on a website, versus content disclosed only to one or a handful of persons, like an email or text message. The result is that law enforcement could be required to obtain a warrant even for publicly disclosed content. The bill clarifies that commercial public content can be obtained with process other than a warrant.  Lastly, H.387 clarifies that nothing in the law limits Congress' authority to compel a third-party provider to disclose content in furtherance of its investigative and oversight responsibilities.  Thirty years ago, the extent to which people communicated electronically was much more limited. Today, however, the ubiquity of electronic communications requires Congress to ensure that legitimate expectations of privacy are protected, while respecting the needs of law enforcement. I am confident that this bill strikes the necessary balance and does so in a way that continues to promote the development and use of new technologies and services that reflect how people communicate with one another today and in the future.  I would like to thank Congressman Yoder and Congressman Polis for introducing the underlying legislation.  It is my hope that today the House will once again approve this legislation that embodies the principles of the Fourth Amendment and reaffirms our commitment to protecting the privacy interests of the American people without unduly sacrificing public safety. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt1-PgH988.txt,446,0915,2017.0,6.0,April

11019,topic-id,1093,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding to me.  The gentleman just brought up an interesting point. It is true that in the Netherlands, when they reviewed their experience, they found that just legalizing physician-assisted suicide actually increases the amount of nonphysician-assisted suicide. It sends the wrong message. It absolutely sends the wrong message.  I want to thank the good doctor from Ohio for introducing this bill because certainly the Nation's Capital is one where we should be very careful since the Constitution has entrusted us with approving or disapproving the laws in the Nation's It behooves Congress to take a good look at a law like this, the so-called Death with Dignity Now, that is striking because most people don't associate suicide with dignity in any way, shape, or form, and for good reason. But I will get to that.  There are a lot of myths associated with the bill. First of all, assisted suicide somehow offers patients more choices. It actually doesn't. What it does is it actually sends a very strong message that regardless of the many types of disease you might have and the many types of treatment that may be available, there is one final, common pathway that the State--in this case, the District--would now say is perfectly acceptable. In fact, it is not only perfectly acceptable, it is legal to actually go to a physician and ask them to participate in your suicide. That doesn't lead to more choice; that ultimately leads to less choice.  But the use of the word ``dignity'' is striking to me because the number one group of individuals, if we would collectively look at how we would describe those individuals to whom this applies, really, are individuals with some kind of disability, perhaps with a disease or disability that, according to the law, two physicians would just have to agree, knowing how imperfect the idea to predict lifespan is, that those could result in death in 6 months. Associating that kind of problem with the ultimate outcome of death by suicide I think removes dignity. It doesn't add dignity to anyone's life.  Worse than that, what we have done now and what we have seen in terms of the functional reduction of choice is that, according to many of the new payment systems for health care in this country, you actually align the incentives of the patient's health care from top to bottom.  What do I mean by that?  Now over half the physicians in the country no longer work for themselves; they are employed by entities. Frequently, these entities share the same financial risk as the physicians in terms of their being driven to save money. That is it. There are numerous incentives to save money within the law. If you don't believe me, go back and read the Medicare rules and regulations.  In fact, it should be noted that in the Netherlands, where assisted suicide has been legal for years, the average age for women is 65 who participate; for men it is 62. That means, Mr.Speaker, almost half the individuals are Medicare patients. There are powerful incentives built into Medicare to save money--powerful incentives--accountable care organizations, for instance, where the physician who is the patient's attending physician happens to work for the same healthcare system that shares in financial incentives if money is saved.  Mr.Speaker, I would proffer--and I think any Member who is against this legislation and for the Death with Dignity Act should stipulate that, clearly, it saves money to give someone a $300 prescription for secobarbital rather than pay for expensive cancer therapy or expensive therapy that might cure a patient. That doesn't give a patient dignity. That doesn't add to their dignity. What that does is it now places the patient in the situation, if they truly understand the financial incentives in the system, to actually question whether their physician is doing the right thing for them.  In fact, the consulting physician under the Death with Dignity Act doesn't have to belong to a different financial entity. A physician working for this healthcare entity who actually saves money through the act of suicide can send the patient right across the hall to a consulting physician to agree, that consulting physician being a part of the same accountable care organization. That is wrong. But that is the situation patients will find themselves in, questioning whether their physician has a financial incentive to write that lethal prescription.  Now, the other straw man that is set up very frequently, and if you look at the Pew Research study that asks people their opinion, ``Do you think we should allow death with dignity?'' they frequently mention only one situation: a patient with terminal disease in extreme pain. But, Mr.Speaker, the data[[Page H1001]]is that only 20 percent of patients who seek physician-assisted suicide have pain as their primary reason.  Now, we are all compassionate people. Every human being has suffered pain, some human beings more than others, and it is not hard to understand how someone answering that poll question thinking of a patient with terminal illness in severe pain, knowing what pain is about, how difficult it is to treat pain unless it is done with the most modern methods, might say, yeah, maybe dying is better. But, Mr.Speaker, that is a straw man: 80 percent of patients say it is something else; 92 percent saying it is losing autonomy--losing autonomy.  Our solution to losing autonomy in a patient or being less able to engage in activities making life enjoyable, 90 percent of patients saying that, society's solution is to write a lethal prescription?  I will tell you, I am most troubled--and I will close with this. As a physician, I went into medicine to actually help people, to help people get better. That is why people go into health care. That is why my daughters became nurses. They became nurses to help people get better. God knows that is what we want to do. That is true compassion.  But now to say that if a physician, against their Hippocratic oath, shall prescribe a medication that knowingly kills a patient--and let's not mince words. That is what the Death with Dignity Act does. It says a licensed practitioner with a license to heal now has a license to kill--knowingly kill--a patient put under their care. That is a step, Mr.Speaker, I would offer that, as a society, we should take a long and hard look at before we ask our healers to, effectively, become killers.

11017,topic-id,672,"Thank you very much, Representative I appreciate so much your leadership on this issue, as well as Wenstrup, bringing this very, very necessary bill to the floor. Time is of the essence, and literally lives are at stake. Sometimes you hear that discussed here, well, this bill is going to impact life. This one truly does. This is a life-or-death matter with just a time limit.  The way that this works is that the Constitution gives Congress authority over the District of While they can have their own council and they can make laws, we have ultimate oversight as elected Representatives of this country over what happens here. When they pass a bill here allowing death to occur by physician-assisted suicide, we have the opportunity and we have the obligation to step in and to say no.  As Representative Rothfus said, this is the people's town. This is representative of our entire country here, and this does not represent what we stand for, that if someone has an awful diagnosis that they are encouraged and enabled to be able to take their own life without any--any--oversight in this.[[Page H1000]]We have got to reject this. That is why we are here tonight.  The statistics are staggering. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death across the spectrum of ages, and the death toll is, sadly, on the rise. Nearly 43,000 individuals took their own life in 2014. Now, that is a heart-wrenching number of people desperate and seemingly without hope and whose solution to traumatic life situations, clinical depression, or mental disorders was to take their own life.  But another, more sinister layer to this suicide crisis in America arises when agents of healing become distributors of lethal dosages. Five States now and the District of Columbia have legalized physician-assisted suicide.  The taking of human life is a criminal act in nearly every State and throughout the Federal Code; yet a few regions of the country, sadly, have embraced the tragic idea that it is better to prescribe death than to provide life-sustaining care, and they are tasking the medical profession, those sworn to provide and take care of people--they have tasked them with carrying out this ghastly deed.  So you go to your doctor on one hand when you have an illness or your child is sick and you are asking and expecting the doctor to be looking out for your best interests and to prescribe medicine to help you get better, and then the next day you are tasking that same physician--you are supposed to go back and ask them to kill your relative and prescribe death medicine? This is wrong.  But here is another sobering fact: legalizing physician-assisted suicide can lead to an increase in overall suicide rates. That was just what was shared by Representative Hice, what has exactly happened in Oregon, with an over 40 percent higher rate of suicide there than in other places. So if you are concerned about suicide prevention, you should be concerned about efforts to normalize doctors prescribing a bottle of pills intended to end a patient's life.  Physician-assisted suicide preys on the sick, the elderly, and the disabled. The frail are the most vulnerable to rising healthcare costs, elder abuse, and physician-assisted suicide. There is no accountability should a family member, friend, or medical provider determine that a particular patient is too sick, too old, or too disabled to continue living. Any doctor can write a prescription, and no witness is required.  Physician-assisted suicide shreds human dignity by legally and subjectively distinguishing between a life worth living and a life better off dead. The focus should be on improving healthcare options, palliative, and end-of-life care for terminally ill patients, not killing those suffering from sickness or disease.  So I call on my fellow Members of Congress to pass the resolution of disapproval sponsored by Brad Wenstrup to reject D.C.'s dangerous policy and to ensure that all Americans, including those here in the District of Columbia, are granted the basic right to life.

10869,topic-id,4838,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak out against the abuse of the Executive authority. Before I do, I want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Alaska for his cogent remarks here today on the floor. He is one of the great new additions to this body, and he ought to be listened to. I personally respect him and appreciate the words he said here today.                            Antiquities Act  Mr.President, I rise today to speak out against the abuse of Executive authority under the Antiquities  Over the last two decades, past Presidents have exploited the law in the extreme, using it as a pretext to enact some of the most egregious land grabs in our Nation's history. My home State of Utah has been hit especially hard by this Federal overreach. Time and again, Presidents have abused their power under the Antiquities Act to proclaim massive monument designations--to lock away millions of acres of public land.  My State has fallen victim to not one but two catastrophic monument designations. These designations were made unilaterally, without any input whatever from our congressional delegation or even the local Utahans whose lives would be directly affected by such decisions. Rather than advancing the important cause of conservation, these national monuments have come to symbolize Washington at its worst.  How did we get here? How did a century-old law, which is intended to give Presidents only limited authority to designate special landmarks, become a blunt instrument for Executive overreach? In answering this question, some background is necessary.  In 1906, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which granted the President limited authority to establish national monuments to protect areas containing ``historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest.'' The Antiquities Act was a well-intentioned response to a serious problem: the looting and destruction of cultural and archaeological sites.  When applied as intended, the law has been indispensable in preserving our Nation's rich cultural heritage. But the law has not always been applied as intended; rather, it has been abused, exploited, and distorted beyond all recognition. It has been hijacked by past Presidents not to preserve archaeological features but to satisfy special interests and to advance a radical political agenda--all at the expense of States' rights.[[Page S2339]]  By signing their authority under the Antiquities Act, past Presidents have seized millions of acres of public land, violating both the spirit and arguably the letter of the law. We need only look at the history of the Antiquities Act and its enactment to see how far we have come and how far we have strayed off course.  As with any law, congressional intent is key. On this point, I would like to refer to the House Congressional Record dated June 5, 1906. When asked how much land would be taken off the market in the Western States by passage of the Antiquities Act, Congressman John Lacey, the bill's lead sponsor, gave a simple response: ``Not very much.''  The bill provides that it shall be the ``smallest area necessary for the care and maintenance of the objects to be preserved.'' ``The smallest area necessary.'' These words are damning in light of recent monument designations which, far from regulating the smallest area necessary, have sought to restrict the largest area possible. I wonder what Congressman Lacey would say today if he could see how his bill has been manipulated for extreme partisan ends. I wonder what he would say if he could see how his legislation has been exploited by past Presidents to lock up entire sections of State land--all without congressional approval. And I wonder what he would say about the two most recent monuments designated in Utah: Bears Ears and the Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments. Together, these two monuments encompass 3.25 million acres--an area roughly the size of the State of To say that Congressman Lacey and his colleagues would be disappointed is an understatement.  In passing the Antiquities Act more than 100 years ago, Congress did not intend to cede undo authority to the executive branch, and they certainly did not intend for future Presidents to proclaim the massive land grabs of the recent past. They intended to give Presidents only limited authority to designate special landmarks, such as the unique national arch or the site of old cliff dwellings. Yet today, when it comes to the Antiquities Act, there is a shocking disparity between what Congress intended and what has actually happened.  As a case in point, look no further than my home State of Utah, where President Obama's last-minute, lameduck monument designation at Bears Ears is wreaking havoc on the local population. In the parting shot of his Presidency, President Obama defied the entire Utah congressional delegation and the will of his own constituents when he declared the Bears Ears a national monument. With the stroke of a pen, he locked away an astonishing 1.35 million acres--a geographic area larger than the total acreage of all five of Utah's national parks combined.  If that is not enough, consider that Utah's second most recent national monument, the Grand Staircase-Escalante, spans 1.9 million acres. That is an area double the size of all of Utah's national parks combined. When President Clinton proclaimed the Grand Staircase-Escalante a national monument more than 20 years ago, I remember standing on this very floor and speaking out then, just as I am speaking out now. My words back then are just as applicable today. I said:       While the 1906 Antiquities Act may indeed give the      President the literal authority to take this action, it is      quite clear to me that in using this authority, he is      violating the spirit of U.environmental laws. Real damage      has been done here. The failure even to consult prior to      making this decision should be considered devastating to      representative democracy.  To this day, the Grand Staircase proclamation remains among the most flagrant abuses of Presidential power I have ever seen. Without so much as a ``by your leave'' from Utahans, this unilateral action cut off access to millions of acres of land, suffocating economic development and uprooting the lives of thousands of Utahans who relied on the region's resources for their very survival. And just like Bears Ears, this designation came with no input from Utah's Governor, the Utah congressional delegation, or even local communities.  The Grand Staircase monument designation exemplified Executive overreach of the worst kind. Even Democrats were stunned by this shocking power grab, and many of them conceded to me privately when I was then shouting publicly that the President was never meant to set aside millions of acres through the Antiquities  Even the San Francisco Chronicle--by no means a conservative newspaper--panned President Clinton's Grand Staircase proclamation. In 1996, the editorial board stated:       The question is whether a decision of such magnitude should      be carried out by Executive order. We think not. This may      well be a worthy idea, but it deserves a fair hearing. It      deserves to go through public deliberations, as slow and      messy as democracy may be, to fully air the concerns.  That was more than 20 years ago. In the intervening period, nothing has changed. Bears Ears was Grand Staircase all over again. When President Obama declared the Bears Ears a national monument in the twilight hours of his Presidency, he ignored the years of work Utah's congressional delegation had spent fighting to pass legislation to protect the region via a fair and open process. He ignored the State legislature and the He ignored the stakeholders and even local Utahans who were all working together to find a workable solution. He ignored the best interest of Utah and cast aside the will of the people, all in favor of the top-down unilateral approach meant to satisfy the demands of far-left interest groups. This is Executive hubris at its worst. It was never supposed to be this way.  Congress, not the President, is solely responsible under the Constitution for the management of property and land within the Federal domain. Only through passage of the Antiquities Act can Congress grant authority to the President to make limited monument designations. Congress entrusted the executive branch with narrow authority, but the executive branch has violated that trust time and time again.  For years, I have fought to check the abuse of Executive power under the Antiquities As far as back as 1997, in the aftermath of the Grand Staircase proclamation, I introduced legislation requiring an act of Congress before the President could establish any national monument of more than 5,000 acres. As early as last year, in anticipation of the eminent Bears Ears debacle, I wrote a bill prohibiting any further extension or establishment of national monuments in Utah without express authorization from  Most recently, I have been working closely with the Trump administration from day one to right the wrongs of previous administrations. Within days of his nomination, I indicated to Secretary Ryan Zinke that undoing the harm caused by the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase monument designations was among my top priorities.  In a private meeting in my office, I even told Secretary Zinke that my support for his nomination would depend largely on his commitment to this cause. After gaining assurances from Secretary Zinke that he would work with us in this effort, I was eager to support his confirmation. I probably would have supported it anyway because he is a fine man. But I am really pleased that he agreed with me on the injustices that have occurred in  Just 2 weeks later, I found myself in the Oval Office where I engaged President Trump for over an hour on a wide-ranging discussion that focused specifically on the public lands issue. I have to say that I was amazed at the President's willingness to help. He listened intently as I relayed the fears and frustrations of thousands in our State who have been personally hurt by the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase monument designations.  I explained the urgency of addressing these devastating measures. I asked for his help in doing so. I was encouraged that, unlike his predecessor, President Trump actually took the time to listen and understand the heavy toll of such overreaching actions. Our President even assured me that he stands ready to work with us to fix this disaster. More than any of his predecessors, President Trump understands what is at stake here.  I was really buoyed up by the conversation with him in the Oval Indeed, in all my years of public service, I have never seen a President so committed to reigning in the Federal Government and so eager to fix the damage done by these overbearing monument designations. We are fortunate now to have the White House at our side in the fight for local control.[[Page S2340]]  There are many areas in this country that merit protection. I welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues to further that cause. But the process to determine how best to protect these areas is equally important. That is why, for decades now, I have vehemently opposed unilateral actions to restrict the use of entire landscapes without even the charade of a public process.  Using the Antiquities Act to protect our public lands, we must set a new precedent of collaboration and trust between the States and the Federal I look forward to working with President Trump to establish this new precedent.  Mr I will turn to another matter of pressing importance, the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Justice on the U.Supreme I have been in a lot of these battles over the years. I have to say, this one bothers me as much as any battle we have had.  In early January of this year, the Democratic leader issued a warning to then-President-Elect Donald Trump regarding the President-elect's anticipated selection of a Supreme Court nominee. Even before President Trump took the oath of office, the Democratic leader was already threatening the soon-to-be-President to either pick a ``mainstream and independent'' nominee or the Democrats would oppose the President-elect's choice ``with everything we have.''  Well, President Trump did exactly what the Democratic leader asked when he nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Not only is Judge Gorsuch a mainstream and independent judge, he is easily one of the finest and most qualified nominees to the High Court that I have seen in all my 40 years in the His selection was also the result of the most transparent Supreme Court nomination process in American history.  President Trump and Hillary Clinton both made the Supreme Court a centerpiece of their campaigns and spoke at length about the type of judge they would appoint to replace Justice Candidate Trump even made the novel pledge to nominate someone from a list of judges his campaign released to the public. This gave the American people the opportunity to vet the list and to discuss more generally the proper role of judges in our system of governance.  When the American people elected Donald Trump to be our next President, they ratified his list of candidates. When President Trump subsequently selected Neil Gorsuch from that list to be his nominee, he kept his promise to the American people. That is who I expected him to select at that time.  Judge Gorsuch's judicial record on the Tenth Circuit paints a clear picture of the judge's judicial temperament and philosophy. Of the more than 2,700 cases Judge Gorsuch has participated in on the Tenth Circuit, 97 percent of them were decided unanimously. Judge Gorsuch voted with the majority on that court 99 percent of the time, even though the majority were  In the 1 percent of the cases in which Judge Gorsuch dissented, he did so with almost the same frequency, whether the majority opinion was written by a judge nominated by a Republican or a Democrat Additionally, Judge Gorsuch has gained bipartisan support, including from President Obama's former Solicitor General, Neal Katyal, a man whom I respect, said that Judge Gorsuch is committed to the rule of law and the judiciary's independence.  Judge Gorsuch was described by six former Solicitors General appointed under four different Presidents as, ``highly respected'' and ``admired by his colleagues appointed by Presidents of both parties and law clerks of all political stripes.''  The American Bar Association gave Judge Gorsuch its highest rating of ``well qualified'' to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme I think we can all agree that this is a far cry from the profile of an extreme or activist judge. It is a far cry from that. That needs to be pointed out. I want to know how anyone can, while keeping a straight face, honestly make the case that Judge Gorsuch is anything but mainstream.  In reality, quite the opposite is true. Judge Gorsuch is exactly the kind of judge we need on the Supreme He is an impartial, thoughtful man with tremendous judicial experience, a person that you can't help but respect. He has been educated at some of the best schools in the world and has excelled at every stage of his career.  He has served with character, courage, and integrity for more than a decade on the Federal bench. It would be hard to even imagine a better, more suitable choice for the Supreme Court than Judge After seeing the judge sit through several grueling days of confirmation hearings and nearly 20 hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee, my confidence in Judge Gorsuch has only been solidified.  Despite the Democrat's best efforts before and during the hearings to distort his record, he demonstrated time and again that his judicial philosophy is to impartially interpret and apply the law and the Constitution wherever it might take him.  Now we are about to witness something unprecedented in the history of our The partisan minority is going to block a vote on a Supreme Court nominee. In all of the Senate's 228-year history, that has never happened before. Three Supreme Court nominees have faced filibusters in our Nation's history. The first, Abe Fortas, faced a bipartisan filibuster by Senators of both parties concerned about Fortas's questionable ethics background.  The second and third, William Rehnquist and Samuel Alito, endured partisan filibusters by Democrats who disagreed with these nominee's judicial philosophies. The filibuster against Fortas succeeded, in part, because Fortas lacked a clear majority support, and, in part, because he was ethically compromised. The filibusters against Rehnquist and Alito, by contrast, failed. Rehnquist and Alito both enjoyed clear majority support and both were confirmed. But that was a different Senate at the time. There was a lot more open mindedness about the qualifications of these judges and their right to sit on the bench.  I regret to say that we are likely to add a fourth filibustered Supreme Court nominee, Neil Like Justices Rehnquist and Alito, Judge Gorsuch enjoys clear majority support. Like Justices Rehnquist and Alito, Judge Gorsuch faces opposition from Senate Democrats who don't like his judicial philosophy. Why, I will never understand. In particular, they object that Judge Gorsuch takes the law as he finds it, rather than trying to bend the law toward liberal social ends.  Unlike Justice Rehnquist and Alito, however, Judge Gorsuch is apparently not going to clear the 60-vote threshold for cloture. This is because Senate Democrats, with only a few exceptions, have concluded that no nominee who does not subscribe to their views of hot-button social issues should be allowed to serve on the Supreme Never, never, in the history of this body has the Senate allowed a partisan minority to defeat a Supreme Court nomination for which there is clear majority support.  The only successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in our Nation's history was bipartisan, and it involved an ethically compromised nominee, Abe Fortas, who resigned from the bench shortly after his nomination failed rather than face impeachment for serious conflict-of-interest violations. Those circumstances are not even remotely comparable to the situation we face today.  The filibuster of Judge Gorsuch, should it go forward, will be entirely partisan. It will have nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch's ethics or character, which are above reproach, and it will occur in the face of clear majority support for the nominee.  Senate Democrats' decision to block Judge Gorsuch should come as no surprise to anyone who has been following the confirmation wars for more than the last 5 seconds. My Democratic colleagues will no doubt shout to the hilltops--some of them. There are some that are standing up here too. But they will shout to the hilltops that Republicans are ruining the Senate if we decide to put a stop to their unprecedented obstruction of this nominee.  They will no doubt cry that the 60-vote threshold for cloture on Supreme Court nominees is sacrosanct and that by putting an end to Democrats' unprecedented obstruction, Republicans are somehow undermining this institution's ideals.[[Page S2341]]  When the American people hear these claims, when they hear Senate Democrats argue that Republicans should respond to their unprecedented obstruction by allowing a nomination with clear majority support to fail, they should recognize these arguments for what they are: hypocrisy. The fact is, we are only in this situation, forced to choose between rewarding Democrat obstructionism and changing the Senate's rules, because of Democrats and the campaign they have waged against qualified judicial nominees for the past 30 years.  Every single escalation of the confirmation wars can be laid at the feet of This is a simple truth, and nothing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can say can change it. I speak from experience. I have been here for through all of it. I was here in 1987 when Democrats started the confirmation wars with their disgraceful treatment of Robert Bork, one of the greatest lawyers in the country and a person who was supremely qualified to be on the Supreme  I remember vividly the day the late Senator from Massachusetts came to this floor and smeared Judge Bork as a man would somehow turn back the clock to darker days in our Nation's past. I have to say, Senate Democrats twisted Judge Bork's words, misrepresented his record, and in sum, did their best to turn a good and decent man into some sort of a monster.  In their scorched-earth campaign against Robert Bork, Senate Democrats sowed seeds of destruction that are coming now to full fruition.  Next came Clarence My Democratic colleagues learned from their Bork experience that fabrications and misinterpretations can bring down even the most qualified nominee, so they set to work on Judge Not satisfied merely with denigrating Judge Thomas's professional qualifications, they set out to destroy him personally as well.  I have been in the Senate for 41 years, and never in all my time have I seen a lower moment than the way the Senate Democrats treated Clarence No baseless allegation, no lurid lie was too low for my Democratic colleagues' attention. To his great credit, Judge Thomas endured this slander with dignity and respect and was confirmed by a slim 52-to-48 margin.  Thankfully, after the Thomas ordeal, we stepped back from the brink. When Bill Clinton became President and had two Supreme Court vacancies early in his term, Senate Republicans did not play tit for tat. Instead, we gave Justices Ginsburg and Breyer fair hearings and confirmed them overwhelmingly. And how did Senate Democrats pay us back for our fair treatment of President Clinton's nominees? They filibustered President George Bush's nominees.  I have used the word ``unprecedented'' to describe Democrats' expected filibuster of Judge Well, what the Democrats did to President Bush's judicial nominees was also unprecedented. For the first time in history, Senate Democrats successfully filibustered 10 court of appeals nominees. These were nominees with majority support in this body. These were nominees who would have been confirmed had they gotten an up-or-down vote. I cannot overstate how dramatic a change this was to Senate norms and procedures. For the first time in history, Senate Democrats created an effectual 60-vote threshold for judicial nominees. Remember that Clarence Thomas was confirmed with only 52 votes. Had Senate Democrats filibustered his nomination, it would have been defeated. But they didn't because partisan filibusters of nominees with majority support were simply not in the accepted playbook. What Senate Democrats did during George Bush's Presidency changed the Senate forever.  Next up was Samuel Like Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Alito faced a partisan filibuster by Senate Like Chief Justice Rehnquist, he overcame that filibuster. But what is notable about Justice Alito is he received fewer than 60 votes for confirmation. He overcame the filibuster because 19 Senate Democrats voted to end debate on his nomination even though only 4 ultimately voted for confirmation. Fifteen Senate Democrats chose not to filibuster Justice Alito even though they opposed his nomination because they recognized that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee with clear majority support had no precedent in this body's norms or history.  What happened when Barack Obama became President and Republicans had an opportunity for payback? Did they filibuster Sonya Sotomayor and Elena Kagan? Of course not. Indeed, many Republicans voted against Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan, but no Republican tried to prevent their nominations from coming to a vote. Once again, Senate Democrats escalated confirmation wars, and Senate Republicans chose not to reciprocate.  How did Democrats pay us back for our restraint on Justices Sotomayor and Kagan? They nuked the filibuster for lower court nominees. The irony of this move is really something. It was the Democrats who, 10 years earlier, for the first time in Senate history, began the practice of filibustering courts of appeal judges in an effort to stop President Bush's nominees. When Senate Republicans then had the gall not to roll over for President Obama once the shoe was on the other foot, Democrats simply changed the rules back to what they were in practice 10 years prior. Democrats, that is, raised the effectual confirmation threshold to 60 votes by instigating filibusters to block Republican nominees and then lowered it back down to 50 votes to push through Democratic nominees. They did so after only seven failed cloture votes. The Republicans, by contrast, endured 20 failed cloture votes during President Bush's term and never changed the rules.  That brings us to today. Having Borked Judge Bork, smeared Justice Thomas, instigated the filibuster for lower court nominees when it was in their interest, filibustered Justice Alito, and then eliminated the filibuster for lower court nominees when it was in their interest, Senate Democrats now expect Republicans to drop our hands and allow them to block Judge Gorsuch--an unquestionably qualified nominee with broad support from across the legal community and the country as a whole.  Enough, Mr. We have let our Democratic colleagues get away with their games for too long. They were for the filibuster before they were against it before they were for it. They were the ones who created an effectual 60-vote threshold for judicial nominees. They were the ones who then undid that threshold to assist their short-term political interests when they were in power. They are the ones who now, for the first time in history, are seeking to block a Supreme Court nominee with clear majority support.  To put the matter bluntly, my Republican colleagues and I are fed up with these Democratic Party antics. We will no longer be bound by their games and petty partisanship. We will no longer allow them to dictate the terms of debate in ways that always advantage their side and always disadvantage ours.  I regret deeply the point we have arrived at. I am an institutionalist. I love the Senate and what it represents. I love my Democratic colleagues, and they know it. I have been very fair to them through the years, and I continue to be. I value debate, and I honor bipartisanship. But 30 years ago, my Democratic colleagues sent us down this path, and they have done nothing in the years since to turn us from this course. To the contrary, they have only hastened our descent.  If Democrats will filibuster a person like Judge Gorsuch, they will filibuster anyone--anyone--who holds to the traditional judicial values Republicans embrace. Neil Gorsuch is as good as they come. If he is not good enough for Democrats, no one will be.  Democrats demand that Republicans choose a nominee they would choose if they held the White House, when that has never been the standard for Supreme Court nominees and defies all logic and common sense. They demand the power to veto President Trump's choice even though the Supreme Court was, in all likelihood, the issue that won him the election. And I believe that. And they demand that Republicans keep the rules sacrosanct when they have changed the rules and changed the rules and changed the rules.  I am not happy that we are where we are, but I can say without reservation[[Page S2342]]that we are here because of what Democrats have done over the past 30 years to poison the confirmation process.  I am about to change the rules if necessary to put Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme I won't be happy about that, but I will do it because Judge Gorsuch deserves confirmation and because I refuse to reward Democrats for 30 years of bad faith in blocking, stalling, and smearing Republican nominees.  Enough, Mr. I hope my colleagues will come to their senses and realize that we ought to be working to support people of the quality of Judge Neil There will come a time when they are going to have nominees before this body--I kind of hope that doesn't happen, but I think it is bound to happen--and when they do, I hope my fellow Republicans won't treat their nominees the way they are treating ours. It is abominable, it is abysmal, it is wrong, and I think it is time for everybody in this country to know that.  Mr.President, I used to try cases in Federal court, in Pittsburgh and in I had tremendous respect for Federal court judges. Mainly the judges in Pittsburgh were all The judges in Utah more often were Democrats, some But I have got to say that they were good judges, and I was very proud to be able to present my cases in front of them.  All I can say is that in all my years of working on the Judiciary Committee, trying cases before I came here, having an AB rating, the highest rating that Martindale-Hubble grants to attorneys for ability in both Pittsburgh and Utah, I have to say that I am very disturbed by the arguments made against Judge Gorsuch, and I have to say that I don't think you can find a better more qualified person to be on the Supreme  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

After receiving degrees from Columbia, Harvard, and then Oxford, Judge Gorsuch went on to clerk for notable Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy before entering private practice.  After 10 years of private practice, Gorsuch began his career in public service as a Deputy Associate Attorney General at the U.Department of In 2006, he was nominated by President George Bush to the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and he was confirmed unanimously by the U. Let me repeat that. He was confirmed unanimously by this body. I believe that says a lot about Judge Gorsuch as a candidate. In a body that is so often divided, a candidate who can receive unanimous support is truly noteworthy.  When nominated by the President, Judge Gorsuch said: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge . . . stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.'' During his tenure on the Tenth Circuit, he has demonstrated fair and prudent judgment in his opinions.  In addition to his impressive professional background, Judge Gorsuch has roots as a westerner and will bring those roots and a much needed perspective to the Supreme Because decisions that come from the Court affect the lives of Americans from across the country, it is important that the Court be composed of Justices from different regions of the country. It is critical that our next Supreme Court Justice have a familiarity with the challenges Western and Midwestern States face, like my home State and others--issues such as States' rights, Second Amendment rights, land use disputes, and the complex relationship between State and Tribal governments. These are the everyday realities we face across this country that the Justices must deal with.  I expect many of these important issues to come before the Supreme Court in the coming months. In fact, just yesterday, the Court decided to move forward on litigation regarding former President Obama's waters of the U.rule, also known as WOTUS, which has had a significantly burdensome impact on farmers and ranchers and threatens the constitutional role of the  Judge Gorsuch's background also makes him a prominent voice for Indian As chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I believe it is important for our next Supreme Court Justice to have a concrete record of respecting Tribal sovereignty. I was pleased to learn that he has earned the support of a number of Native-American groups, including the National Congress of American Indians and the Native American Rights  Judge Gorsuch has had a long history of handling cases that have affected Native Americans from his time on the Tenth Circuit, and he has demonstrated a consistent understanding of the unique legal principles that are involved in Federal Tribal law. The boundary between State and Tribal authorities is often ambiguous; yet Judge Gorsuch was able to bring clarity as he diligently studied the law and respected existing precedents in Tribal sovereignty.  For example, the Ute Tribe of Utah has been engaged in legal battles with the State over the State's authority to prosecute Native Americans on Tribal land. Judge Gorsuch has consistently ruled in favor of Tribal sovereignty.  In Hydro Resources v. EPA, a case in which EPA overreach was redefining the boundaries of Indian lands, Judge Gorsuch overruled the EPA's interpretation and respected the current Tribal boundaries.  For all of these reasons, I urge a ``yes'' vote on Judge Gorsuch's nomination. As the highest Court in the land, the decisions have a widespread impact on millions of  When the stakes are this high, it is necessary that we confirm someone with a sound, fair, and prudent approach to the law.

I rise in support of this bipartisan bill, which builds on the work that Majority Leader McCarthy and I and others in this House have been doing to modernize government technology and renew America's faith in government.  In 2016, exit polls showed that dissatisfaction with the government spanned the political spectrum. That is a shame because government is supposed to be a force for improving people's lives, keeping our country safe, and expanding opportunities for all  That is why I unveiled the House Democrats' Renewing Faith in Government agenda last summer. We must present bold solutions to reform our democracy and our government. Certainly, on both sides of the equation, that is what the American people were saying in the last election.  One of the goals of our agenda is modernizing government technology. Most Americans understand the transformative power of technology--the Majority Leader spoke of it in so many different aspects of our lives--and how digitizing businesses makes them more efficient, transparent, and accountable. We have seen it in the private sector. Every day, millions of Americans shop on sites like Amazon or Etsy and catch a ride using Uber or  Government technology is in terrible shape, and bringing the latest practices from Silicon Valley into government would make a huge difference in serving our citizens and streamlining the way government works for the American people.  Last year, I worked closely with the Obama administration and Tony Scott to advance one of its top priorities in this area: creating a technology modernization fund for the rapid upgrade of[[Page H285]]the most outdated, costly, and insecure technology systems across the Federal Mr.Hurd was involved deeply in that effort. The result was the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which the House passed overwhelmingly with the help of Chairman Chaffetz and Majority Leader  Last month, Majority Leader McCarthy and I expressed our bipartisan support for one of President Obama's most successful efforts at bringing Silicon Valley talent into the Federal workforce: the U.Digital Service and GSA's 18F program. In fact, I visited the 18F program in San Francisco and was extraordinarily impressed with the individuals who peopled that project and were giving of their time. I guess we were paying them a little bit, but, relatively speaking, they were giving their time.  Today's bill, the TALENT Act, would make permanent the precursor to both these programs: the Presidential Innovation This program has a proven track record of bringing top talent from the innovation economy into the Federal workforce where it is sorely needed.  I hope the next administration will continue all of these innovative programs, which have begun to change the culture within our government.  I also hope that the talented individuals--many of whom, as I referenced, left high-paying jobs in the private sector--will stay on through the transition and continue to serve their country by improving government technology.  President Obama made real progress in this area, including with the launch of his Open Data Directive, his We the People petition platform, and his Cyber National Action More could have been achieved if Congress had agreed to his request to invest more in these areas. We have seen a dramatic example of why cybersecurity investment is so critically important for our country, not for Democrats, not for Republicans, but for all This is an effort toward that end.  I hope we can work together in this new Congress to unleash the transformative power of modern technology within government and help renew America's faith in our government.

10716,topic-id,597,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy), the majority leader.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, the government is many things. It is large, it is complicated, and it is ineffective. I don't think anyone would call it modern. While the world is rushing forward with things like voice-based interfaces, autonomous vehicles, online retail, and data analytics, government is stubbornly years, or even decades, behind.  We do not have to accept it. One of the purposes of the Innovation Initiative, our effort here in the House, is to bring government into the modern age.  Right now, it can still take hours for citizens to get the IRS on the phone to ask the most basic questions. Parents and students still deal with the clunky user interfaces when applying for tuition assistance. And the VA still uses a scheduling system that is a quarter century old. It doesn't have to be this way.  We have a program right now, the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, that brings in highly talented professionals from across the country to help upgrade our government's use of technology. Now, these are engineers, designers, innovators, and thinkers. They challenge the old ways of thinking and introduce new approaches to make our government work the way the American people deserve it to work.  I sponsored the TALENT Act to make sure this innovation program continues into the future. By drawing on the great talent of the American people, we can make government effective, efficient, and accountable.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in strong support of the TALENT Act, a bill to ensure that we continue to bring top private sector innovators into government to help solve complex technological problems at Federal agencies.  The Presidential Innovation Fellows program was established by President Obama in 2012 to identify and pursue projects that apply and implement innovative private sector techniques in as little as 6 months. The program was made permanent by Executive Order 13704 in 2015, and would be codified by the bill before us today.  H.39 would require the General Services Administration to continue managing the program with guidance from an advisory board comprised of representatives from different executive branch agencies. Over 100 Presidential Innovation Fellows have already been appointed to work alongside dedicated civil servants at 25 Federal agencies and departments.  At those agencies, fellows have been able to merge their experience from top universities, pioneering companies, and successful nonprofits with their desire to contribute to society through public service. This collaboration has allowed the Federal Government to obtain new tools, develop new technologies, and ultimately become more effective and efficient.  Presidential Innovation Fellows have reshaped the way Americans interact with their government in areas ranging from health care and science to law enforcement and disaster response. Fifteen million Americans can access their health data as a result of the program's Blue Button initiative, and cancer patients can search for clinical trials as part of work to support the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot initiative.  Scientists can now obtain more weather data collected by NOAA, and veterans can now more readily access custom prosthetic designs.  Citizens can review police records, including crime statistics and data on officer-involved shootings. And FEMA and other first responders can better target and prioritize their response to natural disasters.  All of these things have been made possible through the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, and it is crucial that we continue our support of these and other endeavors by ensuring its permanency.  I urge my colleagues to support H.39.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH283-3.txt,2269,,2017.0,10.0,March
10717,topic-id,347,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today, I am urging my colleagues to support H.39, the TALENT Act, introduced by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of This bill passed the House on a strong bipartisan vote in the 114th Congress, and I am glad to be part of the team working to enact this important legislation into law.  The TALENT Act makes permanent the Presidential Innovation Fellows program that was created in 2012. This highly competitive program recruits talented, private sector innovators and technologists from across the United  Presidential Innovation Fellows serve in the Washington, D.C., area for 12 months at an executive agency. These agencies include the Department of Energy, NASA, and the Department of Veterans  Fellows bring with them their experience in the private sector to help government turn ideas into tangible results that ultimately benefit the American people. Since 2012, at least 96 top innovators have participated in the program.  Past and current fellows have come from companies large and small and hold degrees from top universities across the country. They have won a variety of awards, including Fulbright scholarships, Silicon Valley Business Journal's 40 Under 40 recognition, and Truman National Security Project fellowships. These fellows truly are the best and the brightest the United States has to offer, and they seek to utilize their skills for the American people.  Presidential Innovation Fellows are giving the Federal Government the tools it needs to successfully operate in the 21st century. Previous projects completed by fellows include Uncle Sam's Fellows created a database to offer a centralized information center in which agencies can forgo buying new commodity IT and support services in favor of existing services provided by the Federal agencies. This program has saved an estimated $2.5 billion, and it is helping government become more effective and efficient.  I commend Majority Leader McCarthy for the work to bring this innovation to the government. Again, I urge support for this bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.

10828,topic-id,1576,"Madam President, I also rise to discuss the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch of the Tenth I take this very seriously.  I started my legal career as an appellate law clerk in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the South, working for a spectacular jurist, Judge Lanier Anderson He taught me about what it was to be an appellate judge: humility, not making a case a personal cause, and careful application of the law.  I then went on to practice law in the State and Federal courts, the trial and appeal courts, including the U.Supreme Court as a civil rights lawyer for 17 years. When I was the Governor of Virginia, I twice had to appoint members of the Virginia Supreme Court and grappled with qualifications to serve on an appellate bench.  Maybe most especially, my wife was a judge. So with a judge in the house--she was a judge for 8 years--I spent a lot of time also thinking about the characteristics of a good judge. Judge Gorsuch has some strong characteristics, educational background, and professional experience. These are characteristics that are worthy of respect. But I have decided that there is an additional characteristic that is very important--judicial philosophy.  And as I have looked at Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, I have concluded that I cannot support him. I have read scores of his opinions. I met with him in my office. I am so proud of my colleagues--Democrat and Republican--because in 2 months, Judge Gorsuch has enjoyed something that Merrick Garland didn't get in 10 months. Judge Gorsuch has had meetings with virtually all He has had a Judiciary Committee hearing, a Judiciary Committee vote. He is getting floor debate, and he will get a floor vote. Those are the five things he is entitled to, and he is getting all of them.  Judge Merrick Garland was nominated. Republicans wouldn't meet with him. They wouldn't hold a hearing. They wouldn't do a committee vote. They wouldn't do a floor debate, and he wouldn't get a floor vote. He got nothing he was entitled to as a sitting judge on the DC Also, the Senate didn't exercise the advice and consent function that is part of our constitutional job description.  Let's talk about Judge Gorsuch's record. Many of my colleagues have been speaking for hours. I want to focus on one aspect of his record. Judge Gorsuch was promoted by President Trump as not an activist. And Judge Gorsuch has written with scorn about activist judges, saying that judges who impose their moral or social preferences on others can't square their position with the He even scorned activists in courts, saying that liberals are addicted to the courtroom, as if somehow bringing constitutional claims in courts is wrong.  So I think it is fair to look at Judge Gorsuch by his own standard. Is he an activist or not? The best definition of a nonactivist judge was the definition given by Chief Justice Roberts during his confirmation hearing. He said: I am an umpire. I have no platform. I have no agenda. I call balls and strikes without fear of any party, without favor to any party. I am an umpire.  I looked at Judge Gorsuch's record and talked about a set of cases that determine whether that is, in fact, true. And I have concluded that Judge Gorsuch is definitely an activist. He may not be an activist on everything. I don't think you have to be an activist on everything to be an activist, but I do believe he is an activist. It shows through in no area clearer than it shows through in cases dealing with women's ability to make their own decisions about their own healthcare, especially reproductive health.  There is a famous 2013 case that has been much discussed during these discussions and in committee--Hobby Lobby v. It was a challenge brought up in the Tenth Circuit, where Judge Gorsuch now sits. The legal question before the circuit court was pretty straightforward. Under a congressional act designed to protect religious liberty--the Religious Freedom Restoration Act--a company claimed that its religious views conflicted with the contraception mandate of the Affordable Care And, if so, could they gain protection for their own position?  It was sort of a controversial case because the notion that a company could assert religious views was sort of a novel theory at the time. But, with Judge Gorsuch as part of the majority, the majority in the Tenth Circuit ruled that, yes, a company could assert a claim based on sincerely held religious beliefs under the RFR statute. And they could assert that their beliefs conflicted with the ACA's contraception mandate.  Then, in 2014, that ruling was upheld by the U.Supreme Court--a controversial decision, but the majority agreed with the position that, yes, a company could assert that its sincerely held religious beliefs were, in fact, in conflict with the statute, and they could get relief from the statute for doing that. Judge Gorsuch joined the ruling, which was later affirmed by the Supreme  What interested me about Judge Gorsuch in the case was that he chose to write a concurring opinion. Most folks know what they are. If you are not a lawyer--when a panel writes an opinion, there is a majority opinion that is the ruling in the case. If a judge feels that it is wrong, a judge will write a dissenting opinion saying: No, you are wrong, and here is why. You are dutybound, if you think the majority is wrong, to write a dissent.  A concurring opinion is about as voluntary as it gets. A concurring opinion is: I agree with the outcome, but I have a point I want to make. I can't convince the rest of the majority to go along with me, and I want to make this point.  So Judge Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion that was incredibly revealing. It was voluntary, and that shows you a little about a person's philosophy. It was incredibly revealing for two reasons. First, Judge Gorsuch had already joined the majority opinion to say that the employer, Hobby Lobby, could challenge the employer mandate of the He had already joined that, but he stretched beyond to rule that, in addition, the individuals owning the company should be able to sue to challenge the employer mandate, even though they weren't the employer.  The ACA mandate applied only to the employer of the female employees. The employer was Hobby But even though the mandate didn't even apply to the Green family who owned the company, Judge Gorsuch said that they should be able to challenge the ACA anyway.  I practiced law for a long time. There is a complete separation--there is supposed to be--between individuals and an incorporated company. You can run a business and not incorporate it, and in that case, there is no separation. But as soon as you incorporate it, you get all kinds of protections, especially that you can protect your own personal assets from liability for corporate actions. The Green family had done that. But Judge Gorsuch said: Even though you voluntarily separated yourself from the company and even though the mandate doesn't apply to you, you should be able to file a lawsuit to challenge the mandate. I found that to be highly unusual--a great stretch. I asked him about it when we talked. He did not give me a satisfactory answer.  Here was the thing about the Hobby Lobby case that was more notable. It was the way Judge Gorsuch described what the case was about. The majority opinion in the Tenth Circuit and the majority opinion in the Supreme Court described the case the same way. They basically said that the owners of this company claimed that the contraception mandate was contrary to their religious views. That is what the case[[Page S2315]]was about. The clash was between the owners' religious beliefs and the statute. That is what the case was about. But Judge Gorsuch described the case completely differently. Here are his words:       All of us face the problem of complicity. All must answer .      . . to what degree we are willing to be involved in the      wrongdoing of others.  He didn't describe it as a clash between the owners and the statute. He described it as a case about whether you are willing to be complicit in the wrongdoing of others. That wasn't the legal issue at all. In the Gorsuch concurring opinion in Hobby Lobby, what does that phrase mean--``the wrongdoing of others''? Who are the others he is talking about? He is talking about female employees of Hobby Lobby, who wish to make their own choice from among available and lawful methods of contraception. Those are the others he is referring to.  He is also referring to that choice as ``wrongdoing.'' That is a completely editorial comment that is not drawn from what a lawyer said or what a plaintiff said. That is his own characterization of the case, and it is completely irrelevant and, I would argue, insulting. It is a completely irrelevant and insulting reference to something that was not part of the case at all, except Judge Gorsuch decided to inject it into the case.  Somebody who looks at women making their own choice of contraception as the ``wrongdoing of others''--that is very telling.  The PRESIDING The time for the Democrats has expired.  The majority whip.

The parties were fine with the decisions. They were going back to the district court and they did not apply to have the cases reheard en banc. But in both those cases, Judge Gorsuch took the highly unusual step of trying to get the appeals heard anyway, even though the parties did not want to have them reheard. In my experience as an appellate advocate, that is virtually unheard of. I have talked to litigators in the Tenth Circuit, and they have said the same thing. It is highly rare. The fact that Judge Gorsuch would do it in two cases--both of which involved women's health access--is important.  Finally, in his confirmation hearing, Judge Gorsuch was asked directly whether he agreed with the decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 decision that said married couples could not be criminalized for using contraception.  He said it was a precedent worthy of respect like all precedents, but he would not agree--he would not say he agreed with the case. Chief Justice Roberts, during his confirmation, said he agreed with the case. Justice Thomas said: I have no quarrel with Justice Alito said he agreed with the case. But Judge Gorsuch would not.

11045,topic-id,1381,"Thank you, Mr. I rise to speak on the nomination of Representative Mulvaney to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the matter currently pending before us.  I will vote against the nomination because of Representative Mulvaney's opposition to bipartisan budget accords, targeting of Federal employees, and his willingness to use the full faith and credit of the United States as negotiating leverage.  This is a really important position and I am on the Budget Committee that oversees OMB and its opportunities. The OMB Director is a primary adviser to the President on budgetary matters. The OMB Director is in charge of preparing the annual budget submission to Congress, and the management function of the OMB is a very important one in terms of management of the Federal workforce and the work of the executives.  We have seen OMB Directors in the past deeply involved in fiscal negotiations of national importance, most notably in the time I have been here on deals to address the across-the-board sequester cuts and even the shutdown of government in October of 2013. So it is very important that in this position the Director have a proven record of public service. One side or the other is fine, but there has to be a recognition of the value of bipartisan compromise, putting the country first, putting pragmatism ahead of ideology, and a commitment that is rock solid to maintaining the fiscal credibility and integrity of the country. I worry about Representative Mulvaney in each of these areas.  With respect to bipartisan compromise on budget matters, I was a budget conferee in 2013 after the government shutdown. The Senate and House each had a budget. There was a refusal to sit down to do a budget conference. That led to the absence of a budget and the shutdown of the government for 16 days--the greatest government on  As we came out of that, there was a recognition and an agreement that we would sit down and try to hammer out a budget compromise. People didn't give us a lot of odds that we would do it, but because of the leadership of then-Budget chairs, now the current Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, and Patty Murray, the Budget chairs enabled us to reach a compromise that was for the good of the country by the end of calendar year 2013.  At that point, the nominee was a Member of Congress and played a very active role in opposing the budget compromise. He voted against the deal we needed to get following the shutdown of the government, and his quote was:       It seems, yet again, that Washington cannot wean itself      from its spending addiction. Indeed, what we saw today is      another example of how we got $17 trillion in debt: we can      have lots of bipartisanship, as long as we spend more money.  The unwillingness to embrace a bipartisan compromise, even after the Government of the United States shut down, troubles me significantly.  I worry about his pragmatism on these matters. He has supported using government shutdown and the threat of government shutdown as a lever--as a lever to defund Planned Parenthood, as a lever on other matters that he thinks are important, and that is fine, but to use those as a lever--to use the shutdown of the Federal Government--that government that Abraham Lincoln said was a government by, of, and for the people and it should not perish from the face of the Earth--I view that as we shouldn't shut the Federal Government of the United States down--but he has used debt ceiling and shutdown as a leverage to gain his way on points of lesser importance than whether the government stays open.  He has continued to support the sequester, which I believe is bad policy for the United States: ``We want to keep the sequester in place and then take the cuts we can get.''  There is also a significant issue that matters to me in my I asked him about it during the hearing that demonstrates an ideology over pragmatism, which is, Does he accept the science behind climate change? Why does that matter for an OMB Director?  Well, we are investing money in storm relief. We are investing money in[[Page S1173]]emergency relief. We are investing money when we rewrite the flood insurance program.  In Hampton Roads, Virginia, in the State where I live, 1.6 million people--the biggest center of naval power in the country--deeply affected by sea level rise. If you are a Budget Director, some of what you do is make recommendations for how to spend money on things like resilience to sea level rise, but if you do not believe that humans are affecting climate change, then your budgets are not going to show that you think that is a priority. In questions before the committee, Representative Mulvaney challenged the notion that humans are affecting climate change.  Finally, I worry about his effect on the Federal workforce. There are more than 170,000 Federal employees in Virginia, a large part of my constituency. They do a great job. There is going to be some challenging employees in any entity, whether it is in the Senate or whether it is in a private entity. On balance, our Federal employees are people who deserve our thanks for the job they do.  The House took an action at the beginning of January--the Senate did not take this action, but the House took an action that reinstated something called the Holman rule. The Holman rule is a longstanding, but for a long while unused, doctrine that allows the House, in an appropriations bill, to target an individual employee and reduce their salary to as low as $1 a year. They couldn't fire someone without violating civil service rules, but the House voted to be able to target individual employees and reduce their salaries to $1 a year. This, together with a Federal hiring freeze and other actions, is causing a great deal of angst among the Federal workforce. Congressman Mulvaney supported the notion of bringing back the Holman rule so individual employees could be targeted. I asked him about that when we visited in the office, and he did not have an answer that I found convincing or credible.  Finally, the debt ceiling. We are going to confront within a few months the debt ceiling of the United States--our willingness to honor the obligations of the debt that has previously been incurred. The full faith and credit of the United States shall not be questioned is something that is very important. I think it is in the 14th amendment to the Certainly, that has been our example that we have set around the world; that we have strong credit and no one can ever question whether the United States will stand behind its debts.  Congressman Mulvaney has often taken the position that the United States could default on debt and then prioritize which debts it would pay. That happens in the commercial space sometimes. Sometimes it is an intentional tool and sometimes it is an accidental tool and we have bankruptcy laws to allow the prioritization of debt. The United States does not repudiate its debts, and we should not flirt with something like a debt ceiling and suggest that we are going to repudiate our debts.  In closing, I am troubled by the nominee's opposition of bipartisan budget efforts. I am troubled by an ideological position that says we could potentially default on our debts or flirt with shutting down the government to achieve my way on this or that issue. For those reasons, I would oppose him.  His public service in Congress is something I respect, and I respect the fact that he has been returned to the body multiple times by his voters. That should be worthy of respect as well, but in terms of being the chief budget official for the United States, I do not think he has demonstrated the ability to do that and to keep America's fiscal policy and reputation sound.  For those reasons, I will oppose him.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

Caller ID spoofing occurs when a scammer calls and attempts to disguise his or her identity by manipulating the recipient caller's caller ID display. The scammer may be posing as an IRS agent, a police officer, or a representative from another governmental agency. After tricking people in picking up the line, the criminal then attempts to entice the other person to giving up personal information.  To date, hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, have been defrauded, including veterans, immigrants, and senior citizens.

10912,topic-id,1519,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong support of H.612, the United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, let me start by thanking Chairman Ratcliffe for his leadership on the subcommittee and, in particular, on the issue of cybersecurity. I have greatly enjoyed our partnership on this and many issues. I appreciate his due diligence and his hard work on many national security issues.  Let me also start by expressing my deep gratitude to Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson in acting so quickly to bring this bill to the floor. Both the chairman and ranking member led a very productive committee last Congress, and I am very pleased that their commitment to protect our national security has extended to swift action this year as well. That urgency is particularly relevant to this bill, the United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement  As Chairman Ratcliffe mentioned, last May, he and I traveled to Israel to meet with public and private cybersecurity officials. I think I can speak for my friend when I say that we were very impressed by the Israeli's efforts in this space. Israel was one of the first countries to recognize the potential threat posed by interconnected computer systems, and they have been leaders in cybersecurity now for decades.  For instance, the first stateful firewall technology was first developed by an Israeli firm. Today, these firewalls are ubiquitous across the information security landscape. In fact, despite its size, Israel is the second largest exporter of cybersecurity goods and services, behind only the United U.companies have certainly taken notice. Mr.Ratcliffe and I, as he mentioned, met with some of their representatives during our trip.  Just last week, Reuters reported that one of the components of Microsoft's $1 billion per year cybersecurity strategy is acquisition of three Israeli corporations.  Collaboration with our closest Middle East ally only makes sense from a national security perspective. Preserving Israeli security is essential to stability in the region.  We clearly have a lot to learn from each other as well, which is why I have championed government-to-government interaction on cybersecurity, such as the recent letter of intent for more information-sharing between DHS and Israel that was championed by former Deputy Secretary  Beyond our governments working together, Chairman Ratcliffe and I also believe the government can do more to encourage collaboration between our private sector and nonprofit entities on issues directly relevant to homeland security. That is why, upon our return, we worked in close collaboration to develop two bills to enhance these cooperative relationships.  I could not have asked for a better partnership in this effort. I was thrilled that our first bill, the United States-Israel Advanced Research Partnership Act, was signed into law last month. It is our second bill, which passed the House in November, but failed to make[[Page H800]]it through the Senate before Congress adjourned last year, that we are discussing today.  Specifically, this bill creates a cybersecurity grant program for joint research and development ventures between Israeli and American entities. Projects would be selected after a merit review process and would have to address requirements in cybersecurity determined by the Secretary of Homeland The grants would also be subject to a cost-sharing requirement, with at least 50 percent of project funds coming from a non-Federal source.  Importantly, H.612 leverages existing United States-Israel R&D infrastructure, specifically the Binational Industrial Research and Development, or BIRD Foundation, and the Binational Science Foundation, or Both organizations have a proven track record of encouraging joint research ventures.                              {time}  1645  BIRD, for instance, has financed R&D and commercialization projects that have led to a cumulative $8 billion in commercial sales since its founding, while BSF regularly funds collaborations between the top scientists in our respective countries as 45 Nobel laureates have received support from the  Now, using the existing infrastructure, as was done in 2007 when Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act that led to the creation of BIRD Energy, also allows us to capitalize on both foundations' robust networks of United States and Israeli entities to help seed these joint ventures. All of these factors are particularly critical in the fast-moving cybersecurity domain where offensive and defensive tactics and techniques change on a monthly or even weekly basis.  As such, advances in the discipline require a near constant reexamining of assumptions, and having people from different backgrounds and security cultures working together engenders an environment where such reexamination is encouraged. While both the U.and Israel have robust cybersecurity communities, further collaboration will spur more advances to combat the threats that we face.  Although some of these advances are technological in nature, basic cybersecurity research, such as investigations into the psychology of secure interface design and social engineering, is also supported by the bill. All told, the programs authorized in H.612 will both address urgent homeland security needs and build capacity for further transnational collaboration on cybersecurity, all while matching Federal investment with private sector dollars and funds from the Israeli  Mr.Speaker, I normally preface my remarks on cybersecurity with an explanation of the threat our country faces. I would hope that, given recent events, I don't have to remind my colleagues of the dangers that we face in this sphere which, as I see it, is one of the key national security challenges of the 21st century.  I would hope that incidents like the recent attack on the Ukrainian power grid demonstrate the power of a computer keyboard to affect our critical infrastructure. I would hope that the breach of hundreds of millions of accounts at Yahoo, which affected around 10 percent of the world's population, demonstrates how pervasive data collection is and its vulnerabilities. I would certainly hope that the Russian information warfare operations targeting the very foundations of our democracy, our elections, demonstrate the stakes that we face.  In the face of these threats, we must join together with our allies to protect a free and open internet and ensure that the amazing benefits of technology are not overshadowed by the new vulnerabilities that they open up. Mr.Speaker, H.612 is an important step to driving the innovation we need in the security space to meet these two goals.  As with any bills that make it to the floor, this bill owes much to the dedicated staff on both sides of the aisle who spent countless hours behind the scenes reviewing this legislation. I thank them for their extraordinary and exceptional work.  I am also very grateful, again, to Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Richmond for their continued leadership on cybersecurity and, in particular, Chairman Ratcliffe for his work and for their assistance in quickly actualizing the lessons that we have learned on our trip to  Finally, in closing, I owe, once again, a debt of gratitude to my friend across the aisle, Chairman Ratcliffe, who, in his first term, immediately had a substantial impact on our Nation's cybersecurity and with whom it has been a great pleasure to work. I look forward to our continued work in this Congress and beyond.  Mr.Speaker, H.612 does three things: it encourages innovative approaches to address top priorities in homeland security R&D; it strengthens ties with Israel, one of our closest allies; and it does so in a public-private partnership that matches Federal investment.  Mr.Speaker, if you indulge me for a moment, I would like to read something the Saudi Arabian Computer Emergency Response Team put out last week: ``Following a recent cyberattack which targeted several national organizations, this is an urgent call for your cybersecurity team to be on the alert for Shamoon 2 and ransomware attacks that could possibly cripple your organization's systems.''  For those of my colleagues who are not aware, the Shamoon attacks of 2012 took down tens of thousands of computers at the Saudi state oil company, Saudi The Shamoon 2 variant has been targeting Saudi Government agencies and private industry since  I bring this up, Mr.Speaker, because open source intelligence reports point to Iran as being responsible for the original Shamoon attack. I believe there is a good chance that Iranian-aligned actors are behind the recent incidents as well. Our Israeli partners live under this threat every day, and, to be frank, so do we.  Last year, the Justice Department indicted seven Iranian hackers for attacks on the U.financial sector and for probing the networks of a New York dam. The same threats that leave me unable to sleep keep my friend Matania, head of the Israel National Cyber Bureau, up at night as well.  Closing our aperture of vulnerability will be difficult, Mr.Speaker, but it is possible if we work together to bring our countries' unique perspectives to bear on the problem. I know my colleagues in the Senate share these sentiments, and I hope they will move quickly to take this bill up and start fostering further collaboration as soon as possible.  Let me again thank Chairman Ratcliffe for his leadership and his outstanding work on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.612.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

10842,topic-id,5987,"Mr.President, first I wish to commend the senior Senator from Washington State for her terrific statement.  I know, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, that we reported the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch by the narrowest margin--a party-line vote. The majority leader then filed cloture to cut off debate on this nominee. He has shown that he will use whatever tactic is necessary to ensure this nominee is confirmed, no matter the concern of Senators or millions of other  Today is just the 75th day of the Trump administration. After only 75 days of having a Republican-controlled White House and Congress, the Republican leader has promised to vitiate the historic rights of the minority in this institution. He is prepared to abdicate the Senate's constitutional duty to serve as a check on the President and our responsibility to protect the independence of the Federal judiciary, all in the service of Donald Trump's agenda and because, as we know, Donald Trump asked him to.  Senate Republicans seek to justify their tactics by claiming that Democrats would do no different were the shoe on the other foot. They are free to make that argument, but it is wrong. There is one claim in particular that I need to address. Some Republicans have asserted that, if President Bush had made a Supreme Court nomination in 2008, the final year of his term, Democrats would have pocket filibustered that nomination the same way that Senate Republicans did to Chief Judge Merrick Well, I was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee during that time, and I can assure them that they are wrong. Democrats did not invent an election year exception to the Look no further than when a Democratic-led Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy during a Presidential election year.  If President Bush had made a Supreme Court nomination in 2008, that nominee would have had a hearing, and all Senators would have had the opportunity to debate that nomination on the floor. As Senator Hatch and I wrote in 2001, ``The Judiciary Committee's traditional practice has been to report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate once the Committee has completed its consideration. This has been true even in cases where Supreme Court nominees were opposed by a majority of the Judiciary Committee.'' This Senator would not have disregarded precedent and constitutional obligation because of partisan politics. Whether such a nominee would have been confirmed would have depended on his or her views, but the nominee would have been given a fair process, which Senate Republicans denied Chief Judge Garland when they pocket filibustered him.  My record in 2008 shows that I treated President Bush's nominees fairly. We confirmed 28 circuit and district nominees in 2008, including 10 in 1 day, just weeks before the election, and reduced the number of judicial vacancies to just 34. Compare that to 2016, when Senate Republicans allowed just nine circuit and district nominees to be confirmed in total. That is less than 33 percent of the 2008 number. Moreover, Republicans' pocket filibusters, even for nominees supported by home State Republican Senators, allowed the number of judicial vacancies to skyrocket over 100. Of course, they had done the same thing at the end of the Clinton administration, pocket filibustering more than 60 nominees. Those are the facts. Anyone who claims that judicial nominees were never obstructed before 2001 has conveniently forgotten those facts.  When Senate Democrats changed the cloture rule for lower court nominations in 2013, we did so reluctantly and only after Senate Republicans repeatedly abused Senate rules to wage in unparalleled obstruction of President Obama's nominees over a period of years. By November 2013, the Republican leader had orchestrated an unprecedented number of filibusters, including requiring cloture motions on 34 circuit and district nominees in less than 5 years--compared to 18 nominees who faced cloture motions during the entire 8-year tenure of President  When it comes to judicial nominations, the filibuster has been a tool to protect the independence of our courts by compelling Presidents to find mainstream, consensus nominees who do not bring an agenda with their lifetime appointments to our courts. Senate Democrats filibustered a small number of President George Bush's nominees, but it was not because they were conservative, or had been nominated by a Republican It was because we had serious doubts about their ability to put partisanship and ideology aside and be fair, neutral judges. Or it was because the President had ignored the traditional role of home State Senators when selecting the nominee. We confirmed numerous[[Page S2320]]conservative nominees, including Judge Neil In fact, during the 41 months that I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee while President Bush was in office, the Democratic-majority Senate confirmed more circuit and district nominees than were confirmed during the 55 months when Republicans held the majority.  When President Obama took office, Senate Republicans imposed a new standard. Just 2 days after he was sworn in, a group of extreme conservative activists instructed Senator McConnell to treat President Obama's judicial nominees in an ``unprecedented'' way, and that is what he did. For the first time, even noncontroversial district court nominees were subject to filibusters--Leader Reid was at one time forced to file for cloture on 17 of them in a single day because of Republican obstruction, even though none were particularly controversial and many actually had the support of their home State Republican  Republicans filibustered judicial nominees they ultimately supported. They stalled Senate action for weeks and months on judicial nominees who they did not oppose and who they ultimately voted to confirm once their filibusters ended. Senate Republicans kept making up new excuses for filibustering nominees that had nothing to do with the nominees themselves. They abused the Thurmond Rule to filibuster Judge Robert Bacharach, even though he had been reported almost unanimously and was supported by his two very conservative Republican home State It was obstruction for obstruction's sake.  But the final straw was when Republicans blockaded the DC The Senate had confirmed four of President Bush's nominees to that court, but only one of President Obama's five nominees. When Senate Republicans filibustered President Obama's last three DC Circuit nominees in late 2013, they barely even bothered to pretend to find fault with the nominees themselves. These were mainstream nominees with broad support. Their only alleged flaw was that they had been nominated by President Senate Republicans unilaterally decided that President Obama should not get to make additional nominations to that court, effectively trying to nullify the results of the 2012 election--a prelude to their unprecedented treatment of Chief Judge Merrick  Compare that to the situation we are in this week. We are told that we must rubberstamp Judge Gorsuch or the majority leader will change the rules. Now, some may remember reports from last year where several Senators promised to blockade any Supreme Court nominations by one of the Presidential candidates if that candidate won the election. Of course, those were Republican Senators talking about Secretary But that proposed blockade is not what is happening here. The fact is that there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and that vacancy should be filled with a qualified, mainstream judge. I know that a Republican President would probably make a different selection than the one I would make, but I have always been willing to consult with Presidents of both parties to find mainstream, consensus nominees. That is my constitutional obligation as a  Now, all Presidents, including President Trump, are entitled to have their Supreme Court nominees considered on the merits. Over my 42 years in the Senate, I have evaluated every nominee on the merits, and I have never gone to reflexive partisanship. In fact, I have voted to confirm six Supreme Court nominees of Republican I do not know if there is any Republican in this Senate who could say that about nominees of Democratic  Although I had concerns that Judge Gorsuch would bring a partisan agenda to the Court, I went to his hearing with an open mind. I had hoped he could convince me that he was a conservative I could support, as I did Chief Justice I voted for Chief Justice Roberts not because I thought I would always agree with him--and I do not--but because I was able to take him at his word that he did not have an ideological agenda. I cannot take Judge Gorsuch's word that same way.  It is no secret that Judge Gorsuch is very conservative--that much was evident back in 2006 when he was confirmed to the Tenth Back then, he did not have a judicial record, but he gave answers that were reassuring. He discussed the importance of following precedent and of judicial restraint and deference to He said, ``Precedent is to be respected and honored. It is not something to be diminished or demeaned. It is something you should try to uphold wherever you can, with the objective being, follow the law as written and not replace it with my own preferences, or anyone else's.'' He explained that judges should not be ideologues who disregard precedent ``to effect [their] own personal views, [their] politics, [their] personal preferences.'' Well, I wish that same judge were before us today, but he is not.  Judge Gorsuch has a fine resume. I do not take issue with the qualifications on paper, but my concern is that he has not lived up to his own standard. I am concerned that his personal views and his politics have permeated throughout his judicial philosophy. That is, in fact, the reason why his nomination is before us today.  To know what kind of a Justice Judge Gorsuch would be, we have to understand why he was chosen. President Trump made very clear right from the beginning that he had a litmus test: Anyone he nominated to the Supreme Court would automatically overturn Roe v. Then-candidate Trump proceeded to outsource the selection process to far-right interest groups. The leader of that unprecedented vetting process admitted they were not driven by ``Who's a really smart lawyer and who has been really accomplished?'' but by a search for someone ``who understands these things like we do.''  Let us be clear. These are not groups that support independent judges who act with restraint. These groups search for nominees who will skew the courts, who will call to reject precedent, and who will further their partisan agenda. And they gave President Trump a list and said: Here, you are allowed to pick from our people. If these groups sought a mainstream, widely respected, and independent jurist, they would have been as supportive as I was of Chief Judge Merrick Instead, they funneled money to push Senate Republicans to hold Chief Judge Garland's nomination hostage and to have the Senate defy the Constitution of the United States for the first time ever in not allowing advice and consent.  The Federalist Society's purpose statement, which is on their website, calls for ``reordering priorities within the legal system to place a premium on,'' among other things, ``traditional values.'' These groups and the billionaire donors who fund them have a clear agenda--one that is antichoice, antienvironment, and procorporate. I am not one to gamble, but in my mind they would not have gambled with millions of dollars on Judge They chose and invested in him for a reason. They are supremely confident he shares their far-right agenda. So is the White  The White House Chief of Staff has said that Judge Gorsuch ``has the vision of Donald Trump.'' He said that, with this nomination, ``We're talking about a change of potentially 40 years of law.'' It is clear that the people who vetted Judge Gorsuch do not want a nominee who will ``call balls and strikes.'' They want a nominee who will expand the strike zone to the detriment of hard-working We should all find that concerning.  At his public hearing, Judge Gorsuch did nothing to allay my concerns. In fact, he solidified them. I cannot recall a nominee refusing to answer such basic questions about the principles underlying our These were fundamental questions that we should ask every nominee seeking a lifetime appointment to our Highest Court, but Judge Gorsuch would not answer. Some of the questions that I asked him were not intended to be difficult. Several could have been answered by any first-year law student, with ease; yet, unless we were asking about fishing or basketball, Judge Gorsuch stonewalled and avoided any substantive response. He was excruciatingly evasive. His sworn testimony and his approach to complying with the Judiciary Committee's historic role in the confirmation process was, in my view, patronizing.  Judge Gorsuch claimed that he did not want to prejudge potential cases.[[Page S2321]]That is a valid concern, but only within reason. It should not be used to evade questions on long-settled precedent or on the meaning and purpose of constitutional provisions. Judge Gorsuch would not even state whether he agreed with certain landmark Supreme Court cases such as Brown v. Board of He refused to say whether he believes that the Equal Protection Clause applies to women. He refused to say whether the framers of the First Amendment believed it permitted the use of a religious litmus test. He refused to provide information regarding his selection by extreme special interest groups and a billionaire businessman. And he even refused to confirm whether he would continue to recuse himself from matters involving that billionaire--as he has done on the Tenth Circuit--even if presented with the exact same facts.  Other Supreme Court nominees have been far more forthcoming. When asked whether he agreed with important precedents, then-Judge Alito answered the questions. When I asked then-Judge Roberts whether Congress has war powers, he said, ``Of course. The Constitution specifically gives that power [to declare war] to Congress.'' I asked whether Congress has the power to stop a war, and he said, ``Congress certainly has the power of the purse,'' but added, ``as a judge, I would obviously be in a position of considering both arguments, the argument for the Legislature and the argument for the The argument on the Executive side will rely on authority as Commander in Chief, and whatever authorities derive from that.'' It was perhaps not the answer I would have liked, but he certainly engaged with the question and showed that he understood the issue in a way that did not prejudge any potential case.  I later asked then-Judge Roberts whether ``Congress can make rules that may impinge upon the President's command functions.'' He responded: ``Certainly, The point that Justice Jackson is making there is that the Constitution vests pertinent authority in these areas in both branches. The President is the Commander in Chief, and that meant something to the On the other hand, as you just quoted, Congress has the authority to issue regulations governing the Armed Forces, another express provision in the Those two can conflict if by making regulations for the Armed Forces, Congress does something that interferes with, in the President's view, his command authority, and in some cases those disputes will be resolved in Court, as they were in the Youngstown case.'' Whether one agrees with it or not, that was a substantive answer.  I asked Judge Gorsuch a similar question in writing--whether he agreed that ``the Constitution provides Congress its own war powers and Congress may exercise these powers to restrict the President--even in a time of war'' as the Court held in Hamdan v. Here is the totality of his response: ``I agree that Hamdan v. Rumsfeld recognized limitations on the power of the It is a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled to all the weight due such a precedent.'' Perhaps that is better than no response at all, but not by much.  When I asked Judge Gorsuch a straightforward question about whether the Framers of the First Amendment believed it permitted the use of a religious litmus test, he refused to answer. Any first-year law student knows the answer to that one.  I asked then-Judge Roberts a similar question--whether he would reject Korematsu and hold it unconstitutional to intern U.residents who ``have a particular nationality or ethnic or religious group.'' He said: ``I suppose a case like that could come before the I would be surprised to see it, and I would be surprised if there were any arguments that could support it.'' I do not think he prejudged any cases, but he was still able to provide a real answer to a basic question--and he earned my support.  I had hoped that, if Judge Gorsuch was not willing to be transparent for the lights and cameras, he would at least answer written questions--given time to carefully craft answers. Again, he declined. He refused to expressly acknowledge that Congress has war powers, even though we know we do. Every high school student knows that the Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. He again misstated the holding of Citizens United in an attempt to evade my question about Congress's ability to enact campaign finance legislation. He provided no answer at all to questions regarding the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County to gut the Voting Rights Act or about women's rights to obtain contraception. And, again, he refused to answer whether the First Amendment prohibits the President from imposing a religious test, even when the Trump administration has adamantly claimed such a litmus test is not at issue with his travel ban.  Previous nominees respected the Judiciary Committee's constitutional role by answering questions in a substantive way, not with mere platitudes. The difference is clear to As an editorial in the Rutland Herald put it:       Gorsuch's affable muteness sent a message: I am above the      people and their concerns. I have no responsibility to anyone      but the narrow band of millionaires and ideologues who have      advanced my nomination and to the President who has declared      war on the American government.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks the full editorial.  Judge Gorsuch claimed that his personal views do not matter so he would not share them. But that did not stop him from speaking at length about overcriminalization and arguing that there are too many Federal criminal laws and regulations. Those of us on the Judiciary Committee know this is a substantive and controversial policy issue that has been vigorously debated in recent years. I have to wonder why this was the only issue where he put forward his actual views. That is not good enough for me. As the article by Garrett Epps in the Atlantic put it, Judge Gorsuch's refusal to answer questions implied that the role of a judge is ``a job which calls, apparently, for neither values nor any firm connection to human life as it is lived.'' The American people know better.  All of this matters because court decisions, especially Supreme Court decisions, are not simply detached applications of neutral principles. If there were, all judges would reach the same results. They do not. Legal decisions are not mechanical. They are matters of interpretation and, often, matters of justice. One Supreme Court Justice said more than a century ago: ``When we take our seats on the bench we are not struck with blindness, and forbidden to know as judges what we see as men.''  Whether he will acknowledge it or not, Judge Gorsuch's record says a lot about his judgment and his sense of justice. In a policy role at the Justice Department, he embraced broad and discredited assertions of Executive power. Judge Gorsuch once complained about liberals relying on the courts to vindicate their constitutional rights, but, once on the bench, he had no problem rubberstamping the far right's social agenda when he ruled that employers could control their employees' access to contraception. As a judge, he twisted statutory language to limit the rights of workers, of women, and children with disabilities.  Judge Gorsuch also reached for broad constitutional questions that were not before him in order to advance his agenda. Just last summer, Judge Gorsuch wrote a concurrence to his own opinion in a case called Gutierrez-Brizuela v. His unanimous panel opinion decided the case on narrow grounds. But Judge Gorsuch nevertheless wrote a separate concurrence to argue that the Chevron doctrine should be overturned. The Chevron doctrine not only forms the basis for our modern government, but it is well-settled law and has been for decades. As Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner wrote in the New York Times, ``The administrative state isn't optional in our complex society. It's indispensable.''  Judge Gorsuch's rejection of that has shown that he is not a mainstream nominee. His judicial record demonstrates a partisan agenda--a hostility toward our government's power to enact environmental, labor, consumer rights, and other regulations that keep hard-working Americans safe and ensure a level playing field--not just for the wealthy few, but for all hard-working Americans.[[Page S2322]]  Between not answering questions, Judge Gorsuch spoke repeatedly about the limited role that judges play in our democracy. His actual record belies that claim. I think that is precisely why these extreme-right interests groups selected Judge That is why the President's Chief of Staff promised he will bring a change of 40 years of law, and that is why I cannot support this nomination.  It is for this nominee that Senate Republicans have brought us to this precipice, but perhaps we should not be surprised. Republican leadership has sought to govern only by simple majority since day 1 of the Trump administration. They paraded before the Senate the most extreme and partisan slate of Cabinet nominees I have ever seen. Their signature legislative goal--to repeal the Affordable Care Act--collapsed under the weight of their own intraparty infighting. Then, they dusted off the Congressional Review Act and, by party-line votes, rolled back more than a dozen environmental, workplace, privacy, healthcare, and transparency protections--all over the objections of the minority.  Think about that. Republicans have not sought compromise on anything in this That is not the way to govern. To give you one example, they repealed an important internet privacy rule that protected Americans' online activity. That means that by party-line vote, hard-working Americans will now see their private internet activity sold to the highest bidder for greater corporate profits. They are allowing these companies to basically come in and spy in your house because they are making money.  But Senate Republicans didn't stop there. They rolled back protections to ensure that all students have the same educational opportunities. They eliminated rules requiring employers to maintain records of workplace injuries so employers could avoid accountability. In other words, if you have major injuries, you do not have to keep a record of that to make sure nobody knows this is a dangerous place to work. They rolled back rules holding coal companies accountable for their pollution. Most recently, Republicans undermined healthcare access for millions of Americans, rolling back protections under the title X program. In underserved communities and rural areas like Vermont, title X is critical in making sure women have access to the basic healthcare they need.  But that is what one-party rule gets you. They are great at looking out for corporate interests. They struggle at looking out for the interests of hard-working The irony of it all is that even these partisan efforts have been too partisan for some Three times this year--the most of any Vice President since 1911--Vice President Pence was forced to make the trip to Capitol Hill to break a tie and ensure some of these extreme measures passed.  With the Gorsuch nomination, Republicans are proving they have no interest in playing by the rules; they prefer to break them. The unprecedented obstruction of Chief Judge Merrick Garland is going to be a permanent stain on this body. But then, days after the 2016 election--after Republicans turned their back on the Constitution for a whole year, even though they had sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution, which calls for advice and consent, they refused to advise and consent and have a vote on Chief Judge Merrick Garland--Republican leaders threatened to change the rules to get their own nominee through--before we even had a name. After disregarding his constitutional obligations for nearly a year, the majority leader now tells us we must rubberstamp President Trump's nominee or he will forever damage the  It is interesting that the majority leader's argument for obstructing Chief Judge Merrick Garland was that the American people needed to weigh in on this decision, as if they had not weighed in when they reelected President Obama in 2012. But when the American people did vote last November, nearly 3 million more of them chose Secretary Clinton over Donald In fact, Ezra Klein had it right 2 months ago when he wrote that this nomination ``makes a mockery of the popular will.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous that the article, ``The country deserves a compromise Supreme Court nominee. Neil Gorsuch isn't one,'' by Ezra Klein, also be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Because of the divergence between the popular and electoral vote, Klein argued, ``This is a time, if ever there was one, for a compromise nominee, and Gorsuch is not a compromise nominee.'' This is exactly what the 60-vote threshold is for. It helps ensure that Presidents consult with Senators of both parties and find mainstream, consensus nominees. The filibuster protects the rights of the minority and of individual Senators; it protects the constitutional role of the Senate, and it helps us protect the independence of the Supreme The Court is no place for someone with a radical, partisan agenda.  Senate Republicans are defending their threat to change the rules by claiming that Judge Gorsuch is essentially a perfect nominee and that, if Democrats filibuster Judge Gorsuch, then we would filibuster anyone. That is nonsense. We have asked only for a mainstream nominee. Perhaps they are confusing our approach with their blockade of Chief Judge Unlike committee Republicans' treatment of Chief Judge Merrick Garland, I take my constitutional duty to independently evaluate a President's Supreme Court nominees seriously. As I have said, my votes on Supreme Court nominations have never been about reflexive partisanship. I have evaluated every nominee on the merits--and I have voted to confirm six Supreme Court nominees of Republican  If the Senate does not vote to end debate on this nomination, that is a judgment on defects of this nominee. I remind the Republicans that they do have a choice here. We can work together with President Trump to find a mainstream, consensus nominee. I expect that an actual mainstream nominee would be confirmed easily, even if nominated by President Recall the process President Obama used when he selected Chief Judge Merrick He sought advice from both Republican and Democratic Members of Congress and was told this was a person who would get a solid majority vote. He said: ``We have reached out to every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to constitutional scholars, to advocacy groups, to bar associations, representing an array of interests and opinions from all across the spectrum.'' President Obama nominated somebody who, in normal times, would have gotten the vast majority of votes of Republicans and If President Trump would have followed that template, we would not be in this extraordinary place.  Let me conclude with this. In the committee, I said I respect this institution as much as anyone. I have been here for more than 42 years. I have devoted myself to the good the Senate can accomplish. We 100 Senators stand in the shoes of 320 million We should be the conscience of the First and foremost, we must do what is right by 320 million And I am not going to vote solely to protect an institution when the rights of hard-working Americans are at risk. It is for these reasons that I must oppose this nomination.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, 5, 2017]                             No to Gorsuch       Senate Democrats are prepared to block the appointment of      Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and the Republican      majority is prepared to change the Senate rules to push the      appointment through anyway.       Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders are willing to      filibuster the Gorsuch nomination, offended by the      candidate's evasiveness and alarmed by his ideological      rigidity. Mounting a filibuster comes at a cost, however.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the      Republicans would rewrite the Senate rules in order to      prohibit the use of a filibuster to block Supreme Court      nominees. As it stands the Republicans would need 60 votes to      shut down debate; if the Republicans change the rules,      Gorsuch would need only 51 votes to gain confirmation.       Elimination of the filibuster on high court nominations      worries some But what do they have to lose? If      they give in to McConnell they will have retained the right      to filibuster but would have lost the power to exercise it.      Instead, they would have surrendered to one of the most      egregious power grabs in the nation's history, allowing the      Republicans to place their stamp on the judiciary in order to      impose an agenda on the nation that the nation has shown no      indication it supports.[[Page S2323]]       The Republican campaign to seize dominance of the judiciary      must be seen as an effort by narrow interest groups to force      measures into the law that the American people would never      allow the legislative branch to advance. In order to pursue      this agenda, the Republicans have resorted to a contemptuous      assault on the role of Congress as the body that must consent      to judicial appointments.       The refusal of the Republicans to allow even a hearing on      President Barack Obama's appointment of Merrick Garland to      the Supreme Court showed that they were willing to scoff at      their own constitutional obligations in service of their      ideological and economic loyalties.       Gorsuch's refusal to answer even the most basic questions      about his thinking was an expression of the same contempt for      Congress that McConnell displayed in refusing to allow a      hearing for Gorsuch's affable muteness sent a      message: I am above the people and their concerns. I have no      responsibility to anyone but the narrow band of millionaires      and ideologues who have advanced my nomination and to the      president who has declared war on the American government.       Much is at stake with the Gorsuch nomination. His own      rulings suggest he adheres to a view that the high court went      astray in the 1930s in decisions allowing the federal      government to give rule-making power to agencies established      to protect workers, consumers, investors, air, water, the      purity of food and drugs. There is a cohort of extreme      conservatives--President Donald Trump's adviser Steve Bannon      is their godfather--who have declared that they want to      destroy the ``administrative state.'' Gorsuch's rulings and      his refusal to describe his thinking suggest he is one of      them.       The filibuster is an antidemocratic tradition in the Senate      that allows a minority to block action by refusing to end      debate on a measure. It is usually defended as a means to      demand from senators comity and a willingness to join with      the other side to find middle-of-the road solutions. In      normal times, the majority would nominate a centrist justice      in order to draw support from both sides so that the minority      would not see the need to mount a successful filibuster.       But these are not normal times. The Republicans have      succeeded in getting their way by refusing to compromise, and      they will continue to get their way until the Democrats stand      up to them. McConnell may ditch the filibuster this time, but      he may rue the day after the people revolt against the      disaster of the Trump administration and elect a Democratic            Leahy and Sanders are taking a necessary and principled      stand against the Republican effort to steal a seat on the      Supreme The Democrats may not win this battle, but      they are on the right side.                                  ____                       [From Vox, 3, 2017.] The Country Deserves a Compromise Supreme Court Neil Gorsuch                                Isn't                            (By Ezra Klein)       The problem with Neil Gorsuch's nomination for the Supreme      Court is not Neil He is, by all accounts, a      brilliant jurist and a kind man. But he is an extremely      conservative judge at a moment when an extremely conservative      judge makes a mockery of the popular will. For the good of      the country and the Court, this moment demands a compromise      nominee, and Gorsuch is not that.       Antonin Scalia's seat came open under a Democratic      president and a Republican This should have led to a      centrist nominee. And President Barack Obama tried to offer      one: Merrick Garland, who had previously been suggested for      the Court by Republican Orrin Republicans did not      oppose They refused to consider him, or anyone else,      for the opening. They insisted that no opening on the Court      could be filled in an election year--an absurd faux principle      which implies that vacancies on the Court must be left      unfilled fully 50 percent of the time.       Having blocked efforts to replace Scalia under Obama,      Republicans were relieved when Trump won the Electoral      But Democrats decisively won the popular vote and      gained seats in the I do not want to overstate this:      US elections are not decided by simply tallying up votes. But      though the public will doesn't decide elections, it should      still weigh on those who hold power. This is a time for a      center-right nominee, just as Obama put forward a center-left      nominee in       The choice is all the more important because the Supreme      Court is, itself, a strange and undemocratic institution. It      is insulated from popular opinion, and judges serve for life.      Forcing it unnaturally out of step with the public is bad for      both the Court and the country.       Senate Democrats have the power to filibuster nominees to      the Supreme I don't agree with those who think      Democrats should filibuster anyone who isn't Garland, as      Jeff Merkley is threatening. But Democrats should insist on a      compromise nominee--it would be wise of them to offer a      realistic list of more centrist candidates--and use the      filibuster to give their position teeth.       It's true that Republicans could eliminate the filibuster      with only 51 votes, but it's not clear why that's relevant.      If the Supreme Court filibuster will be eliminated the moment      it's used, then it's a fiction, and there's little cost to      seeing it unmasked as such. If Republicans would prefer to      destroy the filibuster than make any accommodation to the      majority of voters who wanted a Democratic president to be      making this pick, then that's their prerogative--at least the      Democrats' base will know their legislators did their best.      Democrats need not be in the business of protecting a      filibuster they cannot use.       It's a mistake to see Supreme Court nominations as about      the individual's resume rather than the country's wishes. If      the question is whether Gorsuch is qualified to be on the      Court, of course he is. But that's not the question. The      question is whether Gorsuch should be on the Court--whether      he is the right pick for this moment, and for the decades in      which he's likely to serve. He is not.       Republicans lost the popular vote in the presidential      election preceding Scalia's death. They lost the popular vote      in the presidential election after Scalia's death. The will      of the people might not be all that matters in politics, but      nor should it be meaningless. This is a time, if ever there      was one, for a compromise nominee, and Gorsuch is not a      compromise nominee. Republicans do not need to nominate a      liberal, but Democrats should insist they nominate a justice      more in the mold of Anthony Kennedy than       The Supreme Court is undemocratic enough as it is.

Mr.Friedman has made a career of derogatory and inflammatory statements about U.policy in the Middle East, about former U.officials, about the Palestinians, and about American Jews who have views that differ from his own.  He has written falsely that President Obama and Secretary Kerry engaged in ``blatant anti-Semitism,'' that liberal American Jews are ``far worse than kapos,'' and that they ``suffer a cognitive disconnect in identifying good and evil.''  He has accused the State Department of a ``hundred-year history of anti-Semitism,'' apparently because diplomats in both Republican and Democratic administrations have not always agreed with the actions of some of Israel's leaders.  Those comments alone should disqualify him for this sensitive position.  Mr.Friedman has also raised millions of dollars for Israeli settlers and bragged about leading the effort to remove the two-state solution from the Republican Party's platform.  Regarding the two-state solution, he wrote that it is ``an illusion that serves the worst intentions of both the United States and the Palestinian Arabs.'' That renunciation of longstanding U.policy should also, by itself, disqualify him for the job of Ambassador to  Mr.Friedman is certainly entitled to his own views as a private citizen, even if they are offensive and counter to U.interests and values. But can anyone honestly say that this nominee is qualified or suited to represent the American people in Israel?  Five former U.Ambassadors to Israel, who served under Republican and Democratic Presidents going back as far as President Reagan, say the answer is no.  An alliance as longstanding as ours with Israel, which has far-reaching consequences for the entire Middle East, requires effective daily management by an experienced diplomat who not only has knowledge of the region but the temperament and appreciation of our short- and long-term interests.  I do not see how anyone could conclude that Mr.Friedman possesses the requisite temperament or objectivity. The record is devoid of evidence that he appreciates the critical distinction between the interests of the United States and the parochial interests of an extreme constituency in Israel that he has fiercely advocated for over the course of his long career.  Mr.Friedman's confirmation hearing provided him the opportunity to assuage concerns about his divisiveness, including the many disparaging remarks he has made and his close identification with and support for, the Israeli settler movement.  During the hearing, he disavowed his past undiplomatic statements, saying he was speaking as a private citizen.  Mr.Friedman's remarkable confirmation conversion falls far short of convincing evidence that changing his title to ``Ambassador'' will cause him to divorce his life's work and objectively serve the interests of the American people.  We all want what is best for the American people. We also share a desire to find a viable solution to the[[Page S1958]]Israeli-Palestinian conflict that protects the rights and security of both peoples.  Neither goal can be achieved by pursuing policies that further inflame tensions and erode the role of the United States as an honest broker for peace.  There are any number of qualified Americans who could capably support that role. Mr.Friedman is not among them.

In my nearly 20 years in the House, I cannot recall a darker, more pessimistic view of our Nation from an incoming President.[[Page H601]]  The President's inaugural address distorted the truth about our communities. He used dog whistles to paint a frightening picture of our neighborhoods and stoke fear.  Let me be clear: America is not the downtrodden, helpless Nation President Trump described. Yes, we have much more work to do to ensure equal justice under the law and to address the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. But this means public investments in housing, education, jobs, not budget cuts and corporate tax breaks that just do the opposite and also dismantle the safety net.  Within hours of taking office, the President already began to unravel the progress of the last 8 years. With the stroke of a pen, the President stuck a dagger in the heart of the Affordable Care Act that will take away health care for millions and pull the rug out from under low-income families seeking to buy homes.  These destructive policies are an attack on the most vulnerable in our society. It is clear that these executive orders will disproportionately harm communities of color, the African American community, and the poor.  Repealing the Affordable Care Act is just the tip of the iceberg. We have seen the Trump administration planning a full scale attack on the most marginalized community in our society.  Last year, after continually insulting the African American community, Trump's so-called new deal for Black America really did just add insult to injury. Rather than helping struggling families, this agenda would gut Social Security, repeal the Affordable Care Act, and abolish the safety net. We know that these cuts now will just lead to more poverty. This approach is dead wrong.  Instead of stepping on the most vulnerable to benefit special interests, President Trump should follow the CBC's lead by supporting a national strategy to eliminate poverty and extend economic opportunity to all  He can start by supporting our Half in Ten Act, which would reduce poverty in half over 10 years. And if the Trump administration really wants a new deal to benefit African Americans, they should look to our assistant leader Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 antipoverty plan, which would direct at least 10 percent of funds in designated accounts to spent in communities experiencing persistent poverty--those with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent over the last 30 years.  These are just a few of the proposals that we have to address poverty and lift up our communities. What we won't do is allow President Trump to roll back progress or push more families over the edge into poverty.  We should be identifying the root causes of poverty and developing policies to lift Americans up. Instead, President Trump has shown he would rather line the pockets of billionaires and advance those failed trickle-down economics.  In President Trump's new deal for African Americans let me just read you very quickly what he said with regard to illegal immigration. He said: ``We will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration.''  Our response is that the CBC will not buy into the divisive rhetoric that blames immigration for the social and economic problems in African American communities. Our members support comprehensive immigration reform. President Trump will not roll back the clock on our progress or doom another generation to the crippling effects of poverty.  Let me be clear: this 10-point plan really is a slap in the face to African Americans everywhere. As co-chair of the CBC's Working Group on Poverty and the Economy, along with Congressman Cleaver and chair of the Democratic Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality and Opportunity, we will continue to work to make sure that the vital resources for low-income Americans, African Americans, and those struggling to make ends meet are there.  We will make sure that the country understands that the Congressional Black Caucus continues to fight for a real deal for the African American community, for our entire Nation, and that means lifting people out of poverty, creating good-paying jobs, and moving forward on the progress that has been made.

10846,topic-id,660,"Mr.President, I rise today, as I have risen so many times, basically for all of us to understand that we have the greatest country on Earth, a superpower of the world.  If you want to know the backbone of the United States of America, look up in the stands. These are the United Mine Workers of America, who made us the country we are today. They gave us the life we have and our freedom, and for people not to understand that makes no sense to me at all.  All I am asking is for my colleagues to understand that the miners protection simply is this: Keep your promise, the promise that we made basically to all the miners who have given their lives. They have given everything they have--their blood, sweat, and tears basically for us to have energy for this country of ours. Now all they are asking is: Can't we at least keep our healthcare? Can't we at least keep our pensions? We have worked for that. We have negotiated for that. Every contract they negotiated basically was a give-and-take proposition so that they would be able to continue to have this after they retire.  For a lot of our colleagues and comrades who have passed away, the widows and families they leave behind are still dependent on this healthcare.  We have been fighting for this. On April 28, we are going to lose it again--April 28. I know the way things work around here. Someone will come down and say: Well, we have negotiated a little extension.  I want to make sure everyone is on notice: We will use every vehicle we can, absolutely every pathway that we can to make sure we will not leave here until we have our miners protected. Our miners will be protected with their healthcare and their pensions.  All 48 Democrats are united. Many of our colleagues on the Republican side have joined us or are willing to join us. All we are asking for is that vote.  I want to make it very clear: We will do anything and everything that we must. We have been very patient, but I am not going to have another notice sent out to our retired miners, to their families, to their widows saying: Well, we have given you another 90-day or 120-day extension. That is not going to happen this time. That is my commitment to them and their families. That is my commitment, basically, to the people who have depended on them.  Really, each and every one of us in this great country of ours should say thank you to them for the job that they have done.  We will fight this and we will continue to fight this onslaught, and I can't figure out why.  In October, 16,300 of our Nation's coal miners and their families were told that they would lose their healthcare on December 31. Then we extended it.  Can you imagine an elderly person receiving a notice the first of February, the end of January that says: Guess what, in 90 days, you are going to lose it again because we gave an extension until April of this year.  I can't understand it at all. I don't know how anybody could be that inhumane.  The cosponsors are working with us. We have held firm. The White House knows that we are serious about this.

10827,topic-id,1928,"Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  Let me begin by making clear my view that the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia was President Obama's to fill. In an act of unprecedented obstructionism that makes a filibuster pale in comparison, Senate Republicans broke with longstanding Senate tradition and refused to hold a vote or even a hearing on President Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick  As we now consider President Trump's nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, we cannot ignore or forget this hyperpartisan action. We also cannot ignore how President Trump came to nominate Judge President Trump went to two of the most partisan, conservative organizations he could find--the Koch brothers-supported Heritage Foundation and the rightwing Federalist Society--and said to them: Who do you want on the Supreme Court? They compiled their dream team of 21 ultraconservative candidates. President Trump looked at the names on that list and asked himself which judge could pass the rightwing litmus tests he had articulated during the campaign. His choice was Judge Neil  On the campaign trail, Candidate Donald Trump made clear that he was pro-life and would appoint pro-life judges to the Supreme In one interview, he was asked about his pro-life position as follows:       So, how important is that issue to you now? When President      Trump picks Supreme Court justices, would there be a litmus      test?  Trump responded:       It is. It is.  During the second Presidential debate, Candidate Trump doubled down on this issue. He was asked specifically about Roe v. Wade, the longstanding Supreme Court precedent establishing a woman's right to choose. The question to Candidate Trump was ``Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade?''  Trump responded that he would ``be appointing pro-life judges,'' adding, ``Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on . . . that will happen,'' meaning Roe v. Wade will be overturned.  We know from Donald Trump's own words that he had a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees on a woman's right to choose. That litmus test is that he will appoint only pro-life Justices who are committed to overturning Roe v.  What about a litmus test on guns? During the Presidential campaign, Candidate Trump repeatedly emphasized his pro-gun views, which are in lockstep with the National Rifle He was asked about a litmus test for the Second Amendment--specifically, the precedent established in the 2008 Supreme Court case of District of Columbia v. In Heller, the Justices ruled 5 to 4 that a commonsense Washington, DC, law banning handguns and requiring other firearms to be stored unloaded or locked violated the Second  Candidate Trump was asked: ``Will you make upholding the Heller decision a litmus test in Supreme Court nominees?''  Trump answered: ``Yes, I would.''  The followup question: ``So you won't nominate somebody to the Supreme[[Page S2313]]Court unless they agree with Scalia on the Heller decision?''  Trump responded: ``Correct.''  We know from Donald Trump's own words that he had a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees on guns--his judges must support the National Rifle Association's agenda and its unreasonable and dangerously broad view of the Second  From that list of 21 names provided to him by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, President Trump chose Judge Neil Gorsuch, apparently convinced that he was the man who would pass these litmus tests.  The Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings on Judge Gorsuch were an opportunity for him to dispel doubts about his independence that President Trump's selection process had raised. Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch did nothing to address these concerns. In fact, his appearance before the Judiciary Committee raised more questions than it answered because Judge Gorsuch was positively sphinx-like before the Senators questioning him.  For example, when repeatedly asked about something as elementary as his judicial philosophy, Judge Gorsuch refused to answer. He declined to say whether he agreed with the Roe v. Wade decision, the District of Columbia v. Heller decision, or other controversial decisions, such as Citizens United, which opened the floodgates to unrestricted, secret money in electoral campaigns, or even the decision in Bush v. Gore, which decided the 2000 Presidential election.  Judge Gorsuch also refused to respond whether he agreed with other Supreme Court precedents on the right to privacy, the right to counsel in criminal proceedings, voting rights, or same-sex marriage. Contrast that to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who during her confirmation hearing explained that she fully understood the individual right to bear arms that the Supreme Court recognized in the Heller decision. Contrast that with Justice Anthony Kennedy, who during his hearing praised the Supreme Court's landmark 1963 decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, which established the right to counsel in criminal cases. Even contrast Judge Gorsuch with Chief Justice John Roberts, who at his hearing affirmed that privacy is part of the liberty interest protected by the due process clause. Instead, at his hearing, Judge Gorsuch repeatedly parroted that critical Supreme Court decisions were precedents of the Court ``that he would follow unless and until they are overturned.'' He shed no light on what he felt about those precedents or whether he would be inclined or disinclined to vote to overturn them.  Only after considerable prodding did Judge Gorsuch eventually agree that the decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which did away with the doctrine of separate but equal and desegregated schools across our Nation, was correct. Having to pry out of Judge Gorsuch that concession does not inspire confidence in him.  His performance at the hearings left us with many troubling things that we don't know about Judge Gorsuch, but equally troubling about Judge Gorsuch are the things we do know about him.  We do know that Judge Gorsuch authored the Hobby Lobby decision in which he ruled that corporations are people whose religious beliefs are more important than the reproductive rights and health of women.  We do know that Judge Gorsuch has questioned the judicial doctrine of what is known as Chevron deference. That is the rule from the Supreme Court case of Chevron v. The Natural Resources Defense Council under which judges must generally defer to expert administrative agency interpretations of laws they are charged with administering. In a speech last year, Judge Gorsuch attacked the modern administrative state that has developed under Chevron, saying that it ``poses a grave threat to our values of personal liberty.''  What Judge Gorsuch is saying is not some abstract legal theorizing; he is attacking the fundamental rules that protect the health, safety, and welfare of all Americans that are put in place by agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Securities and Exchange In the decades since Chevron was decided, it has been instrumental in courts upholding these agency rules that ensure that our air and drinking water are clean; rules that ensure that drugs and medicines are safe and effective; rules that ensure that our automobiles, workplaces, food, medicine, and children's toys are not dangerous; and rules that ensure our financial markets are fair and offer investors a level playing field.  Even Justice Scalia supported Chevron deference. But Judge Gorsuch has signaled that he would overturn it and instead allow pro-corporate judges to substitute their policy views for those of the agency experts. If threatening the destruction of the regulations that protect the health, safety, and welfare of Americans sounds familiar, it should. It is straight out of the alt-right, Steve Bannon playbook. And it is a fringe position that is not worthy of representation on our Nation's highest  We also know that the Supreme Court just rejected Judge Gorsuch's harsh reasoning in a disabilities rights case. A few years ago, Judge Gorsuch wrote an opinion for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in a case under the Individuals with Disabilities Education That opinion held that schools across the country must provide educational benefits to students with disabilities that must be ``merely more than de minimis.'' But just last week, in an IDEA case, all eight Supreme Court Justices disagreed with Judge Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the IDEA--the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--is ``markedly more demanding than the `merely more than de minimis' test applied by the Tenth Circuit,'' and added that Judge Gorsuch's approach would effectively strip many disabled students of their right to an education.  We also know that Judge Gorsuch has consistently ruled against employees in cases involving claims of unsafe workplaces and sex discrimination, and he has repeatedly sided with insurance companies that sought to deny disability benefits to employees.  Here is something else we know. If the first 75 days of the Trump administration are a preview of coming attractions, one thing could not be more clear: The U.Supreme Court's rule defending the Constitution will be tested as never before: conflicts of interest, emoluments, Muslim bans, rescinding LGBTQ protections. The list of constitutional rights the Trump administration is violating gets longer every single day.  Now more than ever, we need a Supreme Court Justice who is independent and not beholden to ideology. Now more than ever, we need a Justice who will stand up for the rights of all Americans against big corporate interests. A Justice who would be to the right of Antonin Scalia on the issue of Chevron deference is not a mainstream A Justice who would be to the right of Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas by a substantial margin--as professors from Michigan State University and the University of Wisconsin concluded after examining Judge Gorsuch's opinions on the Tenth Circuit, and the Supreme Court's decisions reviewing them--is not someone within the mainstream of American jurisprudence.  Everything we have seen so far--from Donald Trump's judicial litmus tests, to the visible hand of rightwing interest groups in the selection process, to Judge Gorsuch's reticence before the Judiciary Committee, to his pro-corporate bias in cases he has decided--leads me to the conclusion that he will be neither a Justice for all Americans, nor one on whom we can count to stand up to President  We cannot let Judge Neil Gorsuch become the crucial ninth vote on the Supreme One Justice matters. The list of recent 5-to-4 decisions coming out of the Supreme Court shows that one judge's vote can forever alter history. Just remember that Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, District of Columbia v. Heller, and the Affordable Care Act, were all decided by 5-to-4 votes.  I will, therefore, oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court and support the filibuster, and I urge my colleagues to do so, as well. If Judge Gorsuch cannot muster 60 votes, the problem is not with the process, it is with the nominee. If Judge Gorsuch cannot get to the 60 votes historically required for confirmation to the Nation's highest Court, I urge President Trump to withdraw his nomination and[[Page S2314]]consult with a wide range of Senators--legal scholars and others who past Presidents have sought out before making a Supreme Court nomination--and put before us someone in the mold of Merrick Garland, who can enjoy bipartisan support and be within the broad mainstream of American jurisprudential history.

I am feeling a little confused and perplexed as to how this would work. I fear that this is part of kind of the double speak or alternative facts about the roots of and the solutions to poverty.  As the gentleman now serves on the Committee on Small Business here in the House, and he has been an appropriator, I am wondering, number one, if converting funds from, say, the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Act, which is comprised of mostly poor women and children or Social Security disability insurance, which is set aside for those folks with significant disabilities, or perhaps SNAP and food stamps, those people who are temporarily out of the workforce waiting to go back, find another job, but need to sort of eat that month--I am wondering how, in his experience, converting programs set aside for poor people would a poor person use a microloan.  I have two questions. I want the gentleman to sort of respond to what poor people would do. Presumably they would create their own jobs with these microloans. How big, perhaps, would these microloans have to be in order for them to establish their own businesses so that they would be off welfare?  In fact, on any given day, there are 3 million children who live in extreme poverty, off of less than $3 a day. So I guess I would wonder how converting those funds--what those children who are not capable and eligible to work would do with such a proposal.  I yield to the gentleman from  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH599.txt,1676,"DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE GENERAL",2017.0,23.0,February
10757,topic-id,464,"I thank the gentleman for that because I thought maybe it was just me who thought that. Here we are, we live in a country with the largest economy, with arguably the strongest, greatest technological economy, and I wonder what these poor women who are on welfare would do?  He says he wants to get them off of welfare. Would they sell fruit on the street? How would that work in Detroit or Milwaukee?  We are not talking about women who live in countries where microloans may work very well in those limited economies.                              {time}  2100  I am also wondering how those people who are structurally unemployed would benefit from these microloans.  What this does, Madam Chairperson of this initiative, is that what this really is saying is that this is really perpetuating the persistent myth of people who are poor as the shiftless, lazy welfare queens of poverty pimps, and that the solution is to take away the safety net and force them to do some kind of work, whether that work is sustainable enough for them.  And so I would say, as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, that we ought to have welfare reform that really honors our commitment as Americans to make sure that we provide some kind of safety net for the majority of the poor who are, in fact, children. There are, in fact, people who are not capable, or should not be responsible, for providing for themselves through our very sophisticated economy.  I would say, Mr.Speaker, that if we really want to help get people off welfare, we should not start the debate by taking away reproductive freedom from women. One of the major reasons that women fall into poverty is the lack of access to birth control, health care, that would enable them to plan their families, plan their pregnancies. And to say that you are going to help people get off welfare and to snatch away funds from Planned Parenthood or their ability to control their reproduction is a nonstarter in truly helping the truly poor.  I think that President Trump's quest to help those who are truly poor will only come if the President and his team will actually listen to the voices of the poor, actually listen to solutions that have been tried and tested, like providing educational opportunity and upward mobility to poor people; by respecting women's reproductive rights to choose; by really creating a sense of Congress that any goal of welfare reform ought to be to protect children; that any welfare reform ought to make sure that women are free from domestic violence, sex trafficking, and human trafficking, and that they be protected; and that during these periods they not be cut off from public support.

11052,topic-id,2076,"Mr.President, Ladd Seaberg, a Kansas resident whose home was in Atchison, KS, passed away on Kansas' 156th birthday. My State lost an individual who epitomizes all that it means to be a  Throughout his life, Ladd was dedicated to serving his family, his friends, his colleagues, and his hometown of Atchison.[[Page S1174]]  Atchison is along the Missouri River, the Kansas River, and right on the border with the neighboring They have a long history in that community, and he and his family have had a long opportunity, which they have taken advantage of, to benefit the citizens of that community. He fought a courageous fight with a terrible, progressive neurodegenerative disease, and he was laid to rest last week.  As a stalwart figure of Northeast Kansas who worked at MGP Ingredients for 40 years, he will long be remembered for his character and his leadership. Most everything good in Atchison involved Ladd and his family.  Ladd was not born a He was born in West Texas and graduated from Texas Tech University, where he met his wife Karen Cray during a national science fair put on by the U.Air Naturally, they both won first place awards at the fair, and later moved to Karen's hometown of Atchison, where they made their life and raised their family.  With a degree in chemical engineering and the mind of a true engineer, he had a passion for understanding the way things work on a mechanical level. His love of tinkering led him to a longtime hobby as an avid amateur radio operator.  Upon moving to Atchison, he began working at MGP as a distillery production manager. During his first 11 years there, Ladd rose to become the company's president and later CEO and, then, chairman of the board. He had an integral role in bringing the company public, when it became listed on Nasdaq's exchange.  Ladd and his beloved wife Karen, who now serves as MGP's board chairwoman, were blessed with two daughters and six grandchildren, who still live in Kansas today.  Beyond his leadership at the company MGP, where his intelligence and encouraging management style will long be remembered, Ladd contributed on numerous boards and to even more organizations that improve the lives of those who live in the community and around the To name but just a few, he was a founding member of the International Wheat Gluten Association, separately represented the U.grain community at the World Trade Organization meetings, and was a board member of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce and  He was also one of the original founders of the Atchison Area Economic Development Council, a longtime member of the Historical Society, and a former chairman of the Atchison Area Chamber of Commerce board.  Ladd's leadership was indispensable on the Amelia Earhart Memorial Bridge committee to construct a new bridge in 2012 across the Missouri River named for a fellow pilot and fellow Kansan, Amelia Earhart, one of our State's proudest daughters.  He cared deeply about education in his community, as evidenced by the recognition he and his wife received from Benedictine College, the Cross of the Order of Benedict, the institution's highest honor. His faith also played a significant role in his life, having served as an elder and deacon of the First Presbyterian Church of  One can hardly overstate what he meant to northeast Kansas, as Ladd always sought opportunities to serve his fellow He was a mentor to many and gave of himself to all who were fortunate enough to pass his way.  I appreciate his contributions to our State, and my prayers have been with his wife and family, father and grandfather. It is sad that Ladd was laid to rest, but may he rest in peace.                         Appropriations Process  Mr.President, there is a lot going on in the Senate, and I am grateful for that. I hope we can resolve our differences and begin to work on policy. Personnel do matter. But what I want to highlight, as we look at the agenda for the Senate, when we look at an agenda for this Congress and the Federal Government, is the appropriations process.  One of my goals as a Member of the Senate--I didn't expect this when I was elected; I didn't expect there to be a problem--what I want to see is the Senate function. All 100 U.Senators, whether they are Republican or Democratic, ought to take a great deal of responsibility for seeing that this place, the U.Senate, gives each Senator the opportunity to present his or her ideas, to represent his or her constituents, and to make a difference on their behalf. One of the ways we can do this is in the way that we appropriate money.  The appropriations process is important. At the moment, we are operating under a continuing resolution that expires in a few months. We have had lots of conversations about the first 200 days of this Congress, the first 100 or 200 days of the administration. We have talked about the importance of confirming Executive nominations. We have talked about the importance of dealing with the consequences of the Affordable Care We have talked about the need and the desire to repeal regulations that are onerous and damaging to our ability to create jobs. We certainly have talked about the need to do an overhaul in a comprehensive way of the U.Tax  I want to raise to my colleagues' attention and hopefully generate awareness about one of the things that seem to be missing in that discussion about what our agenda is or should be, which is the necessity of doing appropriations bills.  The way this place is supposed to work is that by law, by April 15, we are to have passed a budget, and then 12 separate appropriations bills march their way through the Appropriations Committee and come to the Senate floor, where they are available for amendment, discussion, and debate by every Member of the We ultimately pass each of those 12 appropriations bills and send them to the House or vice versa. Those 12 appropriations bills fill in the blanks.  Unfortunately, what has happened way too often is we have gotten in the habit of passing something we call a continuing resolution. Continuing resolution means that we are going to fund the Federal Government, its agencies and departments, at the same level of spending next year as we did this year. That suggests that there is no ability to prioritize how we should spend money. That is poor government. In fact, if you have had continuing resolutions year after year, the priorities of spending that were in place 2, 3, 4 years ago have become the priority of spending next year.  In my view, it would be a terrible mistake for us to reach the conclusion that we can do no better than a continuing resolution in the appropriations process this year that takes us to the end of the fiscal year. It is not just about priorities; we need to get spending under control. In fact, the appropriations process has generally done that. There is a reasonably flat line in the growth of government spending on the discretionary side, the things that the Appropriations Committee deals with, the things that we as Senators deal with on an annual basis.  In addition to determining priorities and levels of spending, another reason this is important is that it is our opportunity to influence decisions made by various agencies, departments, and bureaus of the Federal  In my view, the Constitution of the United States created the Congress--the congressional branch, the legislative branch--for reasons of trying to restrain Executive power. When we do a continuing resolution, we leave so much discretion, so much power in the executive branch. It doesn't matter whether it is a Republican President or a Democratic President, Congress is here to protect the American people from an ever-encroaching desire on any administration to garner more power and to make more influence in the Congress has the ability, if we will use that ability, to restrain Executive action. We are going through a series of Congressional Review Act procedures in which we are rejecting regulations made in the final days of the past administration.  A more effective long-term approach to dealing with the expansive nature of the bureaus, departments, and agencies is to have an appropriations process in which the agency head, the Cabinet Secretary, or the bureau chief knows that his or her relationship with Congress may determine how much money he or she has to spend within that agency. If we do a continuing resolution, there is little reason for an agency head, a Cabinet Secretary, or a bureau chief to pay attention to Congress, and that is contrary to the constitutional provisions giving us the responsibility to appropriate money, and[[Page S1175]]it continues the practice of an administration expanding their role in the lives of Americans and its businesses.  We need an appropriations process different from just a continuing resolution. We need to have the opportunity for agency heads to know that the appropriations process is going to matter to them. It causes them to have conversations and discussions with us, gives us the ability to tell an executive branch official: This doesn't work in my This is very damaging. This rule or regulation you are proposing is harmful. Can you go back and do it in a different way? Do you understand what this means in this circumstance?  Again, our leverage to have those conversations is often whether or not we are going to appropriate money and what that level of spending will be for that agency.  The other aspect of this is that in the absence of that dialogue and change of heart by that agency head, we then have the ability to say as a Congress that no money can be spent to implement this idea, this regulation, this rule.  While we focused attention--rightfully so--on the Congressional Review Act and its ability to limit and in this case repeal and reject regulations, the long-term ability to rein in any administration that exceeds its authority and operates in a way that develops regulations that lack common sense or an appreciation of how they might affect everyday Americans is through the appropriations process, and a continuing resolution will once again take away the constitutionally mandated, the constitutional responsibility we have in doing our jobs to protect the freedoms and liberties of the American people.  We have had a lot of conversations about what we are going to try to accomplish. One of the things that I want to make sure is on the agenda is, when the time comes, which is now, the conversation is--I hope the conversation is not ``Well, we have run out of time. We are just going to do another continuing resolution and fund the Federal Government for the next few months at the same level as we did last year.'' We need to exert our authorities to make sure the American people are out of harm's way from what government can do. The Constitution was created to protect Americans from an ever-expansive government, and it only works when Congress works.  The time is short. We hear that the administration is going to offer supplementals or amended requests for additional spending, especially in the defense arena. We need to get our appropriations work completed so that they have an opportunity to supplement, to make suggestions to Congress about what that appropriations bill should finally look like. We are close to failing in our responsibility to do that. Congress needs to do its work.  All 100 Members of the U.Senate can have their opportunity to have input in how money is spent. We can defend and protect the taxpayer; we can defend and protect the consumer; we can defend and protect the job creator; we can defend and protect the employee--but not if we don't do our work, not if we don't do appropriations bills and we rely once again on this technique of shrugging our shoulders, throwing our hands in the air, and saying that the best we can do is tell an agency that their spending authorities will be the same next year as they were last year.  We need to do our work. We need attention. The appropriations process should begin. And I ask my colleagues to give serious thought to helping accomplish that.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1170.txt,1507,,2017.0,15.0,January

10819,topic-id,1163,"Mr.President, before I talk about the Republican's reckless move tonight to roll back important worker protections, I do want to address the President's revised immigration Executive order that he signed just hours ago. He may have rearranged some words, but make no mistake, this is still a ban on It still flies in the face of everything this country is about and what we stand for.  Slamming the door shut on refugees and immigrants, no questions asked, is un-Just like we saw in January, people across this country are already standing up and saying once again this is wrong, and we will not tolerate broad orders that target some of the most vulnerable people in the world.  I urge the President, if you truly want to keep our country safe, work with us, but we will not sit idly by as you continue to push a hateful agenda that betrays our American values.  Mr.President, I want to turn to the vote that is going to occur shortly here on the floor. I thank all of my colleagues who will be joining me this evening. When President Trump was running for office, he claimed he was going to be a President who fought for the middle class. He made a promise that he wasn't going to do what most Republicans have done in recent years and simply work for millionaires and billionaires. He was going to be different. He would be someone workers could count on.  We are just over a month into this Presidency, and it couldn't be clearer; President Trump is breaking that promise, whether it is his Cabinet picks or billionaires and Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs or his rush to destroy our healthcare system and create chaos for families across our country or what Republicans have chosen to bring to the floor tonight: another effort that would hurt our workers, hurt the middle class, and hurt our economy.  Here is what I think we should be doing in We should be working on ways to boost economic security for more working families, and we should be helping our economy grow in the way that we know is strongest: from the middle out, not from the top down.  We have made some important progress over the last several years, but I think all of us on either side of the aisle agree there is a lot of work left to be done. That is certainly what has been clear to me as I have traveled across my home State of Washington, listening and meeting with workers and their families. Families are working hard. They are meeting their responsibilities, but far too many are still unable to get ahead.  Again, that is the topic we should be discussing tonight: how to support and empower more workers. Instead, we are here today because President Trump and my Republican colleagues either simply are not getting that message or they are too busy focusing on what is best for the folks already at the top, because today Republicans are poised to roll back a rule which helps protect our workers from wage theft, from discrimination, from unsafe workplaces, and more.  I want to take just a few minutes to make very clear what is at stake for millions of working families if Republicans roll back this rule. Each year, far too many workers are deprived of overtime wages or they are denied basic workplace protections. They have endured illegal discrimination, and they face unwarranted health or safety risks. That is unacceptable, and it has to come to an end.  Last year, Democrats, working with the previous administration, pushed to finalize what is now known as the fair pay and safe workplaces rule. For far too long, the government has awarded billions of taxpayer dollars to companies that rob workers of their paychecks and fail to maintain safe working conditions. This rule helps to right that wrong. Under this rule, when a company applies for a Federal contract, they will need to be upfront about their safety, health, and labor violations over the past 3 years. That way, government agencies can consider an employer's record of providing workers with a safe workplace and paying workers what they have earned before they grant or renew a Federal contract. To be clear, this does not prevent companies from winning Federal contracts. It does not single out companies. It does not deny companies the right to be heard. It simply improves transparency and coordination so government agencies are aware of companies' violations and can work with them to make sure they come into compliance with essential labor laws.  Again, the emphasis on this is not punishment but on helping bring more and more companies into compliance with the law and zeroing in on violations that are, and I quote from the rule: ``Serious, repeated, willful, or pervasive.'' Not only are these measures common sense, but they would have major benefits for our workers, our businesses and, by the way, our taxpayers. It would help hold the worst violators accountable.  American taxpayers should have the basic guarantee that their dollars are going to responsible contractors that will not steal from their workers or expose their workers to safety hazards. It would protect basic worker rights, and that, in turn, will help expand economic security for all working families, and it will level the playing field for businesses that do follow the law.  I think we can all agree that businesses shouldn't have to compete with bad actors that cut corners and put their workers' safety at risk or cheat their workers on their paychecks.  All of this, frankly, is pretty simple. When workers arrive on the job, they deserve to know they will be treated fairly, that they will be provided with a safe and healthy workplace, that their right to collective bargaining will be respected, and they will be paid all the wages they earned. Businesses that contract with the government should set an example when it comes to each of these concerns, and taxpayer dollars should only go to businesses that respect these fundamental worker protections.  As I said, time and again, families nationwide are sending a very clear message at marches, with phone calls and letters, online, and in their communities. They expect and are demanding that their representatives are truly committed to working for them. I, for one, am committed to standing with them. I know my colleagues are committed, and we are prepared to fight back.  Let's be clear, in rolling back these protections, President Trump and his party are yet again breaking their campaign promise to put our workers first. Workers will be hurt, wages will go down, rights will be undermined, lives will be put at risk. Tonight I am here to urge my Republican colleagues to drop this deeply harmful effort, reverse course, and stand with working families once and for all.  I yield the floor.

10841,topic-id,1143,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to express my deep concern about the Republicans' rush to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat and about President Trump's nominee for this critical position.  I believe one of the most solemn and consequential decisions we make as Senators is whether to support a nominee to the highest Court in the country. It is a responsibility I do not take lightly. And after careful consideration, I will be voting against the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, and I will be opposing a cloture motion ending debate.  I come to this conclusion weighing several things. First, a Supreme Court Justice has an enormous responsibility to uphold our Constitution and defend our democracy. The Court's decision affects every citizen in every corner of this country. At times, one Justice--perhaps this nominee--may be the only thing standing between someone's rights and an executive branch that operates as though it is above the law.  That is a real concern--one I have heard over and over from people in my home State of Washington who are frightened about the direction President Trump is trying to take our country.  Since taking office about two months ago, he has demonstrated complete disregard for the law, the Constitution, and American families. He has tried to force through un-American bans on Muslim refugees and immigrants. He fired Sally Yates, an Acting Attorney General who dared to stand up to him.  It is clear this President doesn't just think he is above the law. He has, at times, shown a true disdain for it, repeatedly insulting the men and women on the bench, even telling a crowd that perhaps the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--a court that didn't rule in his favor--should be broken up.  Now, we need an independent judiciary that can safeguard the rights of citizens against this executive branch, but with so much chaos created by this President, coupled with the cloud of an FBI investigation into him and his associates, I have no reason to trust that he or his administration are acting in the best interests of our country or our democracy, and I cannot support moving forward with his choice for the  On top of that, I am concerned about the unprecedented pace of the Judiciary Committee process, which would rush through this nominee on the fastest time line in recent history. That is pretty striking because this same committee failed to hold a single hearing on this vacancy for 12 months following Justice Scalia's passing. It refused President Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, any opportunity to be heard, which brings me to my serious concerns about this particular nominee.  I wish to start with women's access to healthcare. President Trump campaigned on promises to overturn women's constitutionally protected rights to make their own healthcare decisions, secured by the historic ruling in Roe v. This President has broken almost every promise he has made, but one he appears to be keeping, especially in selecting Judge Gorsuch, is his promise to undermine women's health and rights.  Judge Gorsuch would have taken the ruling in Hobby Lobby to allow women's bosses to decide whether or not they get birth control to an even more extreme result. His deeply conservative record suggests he can't be trusted to stand for women's constitutionally protected healthcare rights or access to care. In fact, it seems clear he will[[Page S2319]]work to weaken those rights at every opportunity.  Since day one of this Presidency, women nationwide have made it absolutely clear they do not want to go backwards, and that is something I am going to continue to fight for.  I am also going to keep fighting for our workers, and I am troubled that as a Federal judge on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has a clear record of siding against workers and with corporations and big businesses.  The Associated Press said his opinions were ``coldly pragmatic and they're usually in the employers' favor.''  His history of dismissing workers' safety concerns and hostility toward upholding disability rights greatly concerns me and strongly suggests that he would join conservative Justices to undermine workers' rights.  We need a Justice on the Supreme Court who will uphold workers' protections and safety and the right to organize.  I am also deeply concerned about the potential effect on children and students with disabilities.  In a number of cases, Judge Gorsuch ruled in ways that made it more difficult for them to receive the support and services they not only deserve but are entitled to under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act--our Nation's special education law. I strongly believe in this law, and I believe we should be doing everything to ensure individuals with disabilities can obtain their full potential by accessing meaningful, quality public education--certainly not the bare minimum.  It is notable that while Judge Gorsuch was testifying--actually, while he was testifying before the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago--the Supreme Court unanimously rejected his prior ruling in a case involving the rights of a student with disabilities to receive a meaningful education. It is highly troubling that when it comes to policies concerning torture, Gorsuch--as a member of President George Bush's Justice Department--advocated that the President has broad powers to basically ignore parts of the legal ban on torture.  This deference to Executive power is concerning, to say the least, but it also makes a whole lot more sense as to why Judge Gorsuch would be Donald Trump's 1 choice.  His testimony before the Judiciary Committee regarding Citizens United, in which he incorrectly stated that the Court left Congress the ability to enact commonsense campaign spending limits, strengthens my decision to vote no.  So if you believe in transparency in our elections and upholding the integrity of our democracy or you believe we need a Justice who will protect the rights of all Americans and stand with them and not with President Trump and millionaires and billionaires, this choice is clear.  As I have urged my colleagues for weeks, with so much chaos in the administration and so many questions now surrounding this President's commitment to the rule of law: Slow down. Stop playing political games. Respect the families we represent. Respect the separation of power, and stop trying to jam this nominee through.  Whatever you do, do not blow up the Senate rules for Supreme Court nominees. Invoking the nuclear option is a dangerous path to go down.  I have been in the majority and I have been in the minority. Either way, I believe when it comes to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, the Senate must adhere to a higher standard and the 60-vote threshold. If you can't get that many votes for a Supreme Court nominee, you don't need to change the rules, you need to change the nominee.  I yield the floor.

One could say that Mr.Petersen got in on the ground floor at PNNL when its scientists were providing critical support to win the cold war.  While at Battelle, Mr.Petersen worked in communications and was the manager of the news service. One of his chief responsibilities was to give tours of the Hanford site to new employees, elected officials and dignitaries, and later, foreign visitors. Congresswoman Catherine May, the first woman elected to Congress from Washington State, was the first Member of Congress Mr.Petersen gave a tour to, but she was certainly not the last. Senator Warren Magnuson, Speaker Tom Foley, and I, to name a few others, have all crisscrossed the Hanford site with Mr.He even helped with President Richard Nixon's visit. By now, Mr.Petersen has probably given thousands of tours of Hanford, and many, including myself, have heard the stories from years past, from bumping into the woman who he would later marry during a tour, to the alligators, to bringing moon rocks from the Apollo 11 mission to Hanford for public display.  Mr.Petersen's work with nuclear management began in 1974 for Westinghouse on the construction, start-up, and operation of the Fast Flux Test Reactor and then the Washington Public Power Supply System, which is now Energy After spending some time on the International Nuclear Safety Program through the U.Departments of Energy and State, Mr.Petersen returned to Battelle as the director of communications and administration at PNNL in the late 1980s.  When he retired from Battelle in 2002, Mr.Petersen was quickly recruited by Sam Volpentest to help him at the Tri-Cities Washington Economic Development Council in a part-time, volunteer capacity to travel to Washington, DC, to secure funding to support Hanford and This part-time job quickly became a full-time job, and Mr.Petersen has been advocating on behalf of the Tri-Cities ever since. Since my first days in the Senate, I have worked with Mr.Petersen, and he has been a key ally during many a funding battle. He knows the budget as well as any staff member on the Appropriations Committee, and this isn't just limited to nuclear waste cleanup, but also includes research and development capabilities that support the PNNL mission, transportation, agriculture, and so much more.  It is clear to me that Washington State has benefited greatly from Mr.Petersen's vision and passion for sharing what the Tri-Cities community, its workforce, the Hanford site, and PNNL have to offer. I have seen this firsthand at home and here in the other His work is evident in the progress that has been made on environmental cleanup at Hanford, to charting out a future vision for the Tri-Cities that looks past cleanup operations to preserving history through designating the B Reactor as a National Historic Landmark and the Manhattan Project National Historical Park, to growing the workforce safety mission at the Volpentest Hazardous Materials Management and Emergency Response Federal Training Center, and to seeking out new, emerging opportunities like small modular reactors. Through it all, he has remained as committed as they come. Last October, when I had the good fortune to get one more tour with Mr.Petersen at the Hanford site, I saw that he still carried the same enthusiasm and pride for his work as what I had seen in him on my very first tour years ago.  Mr.Petersen has been critical to my work in the Senate and has made a tremendous impact on the Tri-Cities community, Washington State, and our Today I join with others throughout the State of Washington in thanking him for his many years of service. I congratulate Mr.Petersen on his retirement and wish him and his wife, Margaret, the best of luck as they write their next chapter.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1393.txt,1409,1730,2017.0,16.0,March
10789,topic-id,404,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.387, the Email Privacy I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which will provide a critical update to the privacy laws governing electronic communications.  The Electronic Communications Privacy Act, or ECPA as it is known, was enacted in 1986. It was an attempt to reestablish a balance between privacy and law enforcement needs at a time when personal and business computing was becoming more commonplace. Over the last 30 years, however, we have seen a revolution in communications technology, and what might have made sense in 1986 is vastly out of date today.  New technologies, including cloud computing, social networking, and location-based services, have rendered many of the law's provisions outdated, vague, or inapplicable to emerging innovations. For example, even a single email is potentially subject to multiple different legal standards under current law.  In 2009 and 2010, when I was the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, we held multiple hearings to consider reforms to our Nation's electronic and privacy laws. This work culminated in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act Modernization Act of 2012, a bill I introduced along with Ranking Member Conyers requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant based on probable cause before searching emails. That approach, now embodied in the Yoder-Polis Email Privacy Act, is what we are here today to consider.  In an era in which government access to an individual's private information held by third-party providers has become far too easy, this legislation will finally update our laws to reflect our new understanding of what it means, in the words of the Fourth Amendment, for ``people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.''  Clarifying the laws will also help industry stakeholders who currently struggle to apply the existing, outdated categories of information to their products and services, and it will provide a clear standard for law enforcement.  This bill is not perfect and, clearly, there is more to be done. In particular, we must keep working to require a probable cause warrant for location information. However, this bill is an important step forward toward ensuring that our laws strike the right balance between the interests and needs of law enforcement and the privacy rights of the American people. I urge my colleagues to support it.  I congratulate all those involved in its development.  ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt1-PgH988.txt,850,1730,2017.0,6.0,January

Mr.President, deciding whether to confirm a President's nominee for the highest Court in the land is a responsibility I take very seriously. Over the past few weeks, I have met with Judge Gorsuch, listened to the Judiciary Committee's hearings, and reviewed his record with an open mind. I have real concerns with his thinking on protecting the right to vote and allowing unlimited money in political campaigns. In addition, I am concerned that the judge will not protect the rights of the everyday average citizen when they come up against large corporate interests. Judge Gorsuch has consistently sided with corporations over employees, as in the case of a freezing truck driver who, contrary to common sense, Judge Gorsuch would have allowed to be fired for abandoning his disabled rig during extreme weather conditions.

11043,topic-id,1872,"Mr.President, we are moving forward now on the consideration of Congressman Mick Mulvaney, the President's nominee to head the Office of Management and Budget, which is an enormous responsibility and which often directs the traffic of what is going to happen in all of the agencies and directs traffic as to what legislation the White House is going to be working on and working with the Congress on. This is an enormous responsibility and a very powerful position.  When looking for someone to lead this agency, we have to carefully consider the person's record. The Presiding Officer is someone who is practical, who is a military officer, and who understands a lot about human nature, as I hope this Senator from Florida does, and what I suspect that both of us have found is that you can often tell where a fellow is going by where he has been.  Let's look at Congressman Mulvaney's record on everything from things like Social Security and Let's look at what his record is on climate change and sea level rise, and, oh, by the way, of particular note to the gentleman presiding in the Chair, what is his record on defense spending. Office of Management and Budget is going to have a great deal to say about what is in the budget with regard to any kind of spending, but let's see what he has said with regard to defense spending.  Congressman Mulvaney has advocated for raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70. He has also said he wants to raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, both of which would require senior citizens to work longer, even though they have worked a long time and have paid into these programs in good faith.  Take, for example, People have tried to provide for health insurance, if they have enough money, or otherwise through the ACA, getting subsidies to afford health insurance or, if they don't have enough money, having Medicaid, and they are waiting for the day they turn 65 to be eligible for  It is the same thing with Social Social Security over time has been raised from 65 to 67, but Congressman Mulvaney has talked about raising the eligibility for Social Security to age 70. I don't think this is going to go over too well with a population of senior citizens who have paid into Social Security, who have paid in to finance Medicare and now are being told they are going to have to wait until later.  I know how you can dress it up. You can say: Oh, it is not going to affect anybody who is currently eligible, but what about all the young people who are paying in? Well, time flies, and suddenly they find they are approaching that age in their midsixties. I don't think people are going to take very well to Congressman Mulvaney's position.  Let's see what else he has said. He called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He further has said he supports turning Medicare into a voucher system. That, under any independent economist's examination, would lead to big cuts for seniors, many of our senior citizens who have no other options for health coverage.  When the President was running for office--remember, he said exactly the opposite. Then-Candidate Trump said he promised there would be no cuts to Medicare and Social Yet the White House has nominated somebody who has taken positions contrary to that because it is clear from Congressman Mulvaney's past positions, that we can't rely on him to keep this promise that the President made.  Again, I remind our listeners that the head of the OMB is like a chief air traffic controller. He is directing a lot of the traffic of what the White House will bless, and it is a position--need I remind you--that is also considered a member of the President's Well, the positions Mulvaney has taken are opposite to those stated by Candidate  Let's look at something else. You know the Nation has debt. In fact, U.bonds are the strongest investment in the world because they are backed up by the full faith and credit of the U.Government, the strongest government in the world. So any kind of U.debt, backed by the full faith and credit, is the strongest investment in the world, but Congressman Mulvaney has taken an alarming position on our Nation's debt, advocating for shutting down the government and defaulting on the debt--all a part of a political game to gain leverage in budget battles.  Anybody who takes a position that you want our government to go into default on its financial obligations--that is a pretty extreme position. So this Senator would merely say we can't have somebody in charge of our budget as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget who is willing to risk a default on our government to meet a personal ideological agenda.  Let's look at something else. The Presiding Officer is in one area of the United States outside of the continental United States, and yours truly is in another part of the United One is near the Arctic, and the other is near southern climes. Our State, and specifically South Florida, is ground zero for sea level rise.  I think most people are familiar with the photographs on television showing seawater washing through the streets during the seasonal high tides of Miami Most people have heard that in some of the coastal cities they had to relocate well fields further west because of sea level rise and the intrusion of salt water, which is heavier than freshwater, into the interior. Florida sits on top of a honeycomb of limestone that is filled with water. That is what is happening in the southern part of the United  A NASA scientist testified to the Commerce Committee that--these are measurements, not forecasts or projections but measurements over the last 4 years--the sea has risen in South Florida 5 to 8 inches. Of course, we have heard the projections. This is something we are getting ready for. The city of Miami Beach is spending millions of dollars on very expensive pumps. Other governments in South Florida are planning to do the same. It is not a forecast. It is happening.  Three-quarters of our State's population in Florida lives on the coast. Look at the population in the United A lot of people live on the coast, and those populations are going to bear the brunt of sea level rise from the flooded streets to tainted drinking water. But during his confirmation hearing, the fellow being considered to be head of the OMB, Congressman Mulvaney, questioned the scientific fact of climate change.  We can't muzzle scientists. We can't muzzle science. It is not going to go away. You can attempt to muzzle the scientists as some Governors in the South have done, and alarmingly, as I have found in the last few weeks, some agencies of government are having implied threats that they stop using the words ``climate change.'' You can't muzzle this when the effects of scientifically proven climate change are[[Page S1172]]posing a real threat to a lot of our people.  I specifically made it a point to question the fellow whom we will vote on next week--a really good person, Wilbur Ross, who is going to be the Secretary of He came out of our Commerce Committee with an overwhelming vote. I specifically said, and it is on the record: What do you think about climate change science?  I said: Mr.Ross, Wilbur Ross, do you know you have three Nobel laureates as scientists who are employed in the Department of Commerce? Do you know that you have not only NOAA and all the intricate measurements that are so important for us to protect ourselves, to read in-bound hurricanes, tornadoes, the amount of rain that is going to fall for our agriculture industry, all the rest, but also we have scientists over there in the Department of Commerce, I reminded him, who are doing the delicate measurements of science, of standards and technology that are kneading science to sniff the atmosphere for nuclear explosions by potential enemies. We don't want to muzzle these scientists. We want them to bring forth the best that they can come up with in modern-day techniques.  I would ask the Presiding Officer to look at the bill we have filed with a number of our fellow Members of the Commerce Committee, the Scientific Integrity Act, which would ensure that Federal scientists can freely communicate their findings with the public and with It requires Federal agencies to implement and enforce scientific integrity policies and to ensure that adequate procedures are in place to report when those integrity policies are violated. That ought to be common sense. That ought to be the normal course of business around here. Let people speak their minds, speak their expertise. That is what we want. That bill requires Federal agencies to implement and enforce those policies.  Let's get to defense spending. The nominee for Office of Management and Budget--Congressman Mulvaney's--record on military spending is concerning. In 2011, in an interview on ABC's ``Top Line,'' Congressman Mulvaney said:       Defense has to be cut--it has to be on the table, no      question. There is a group of Republicans--myself included--     who think that we should be cutting defense. There's a large      portion of folks in our own party who know that you can cut      defense and not impact the ability of our troops in the field      to be defending us.  Why don't we ask the people in Ukraine who are fighting for their lives against the projected arm of Vladimir Putin trying to take over their territory, just like he already did in taking over Crimea? Why don't we ask our NATO allies? Why don't we ask our troops in the hot, sandy regions of Iraq and Syria right now? Yes, our U.troops are in Syria--the Special Operations forces advising the combined forces over there fighting Why don't we ask them if they want defense cuts? As we see the continuous projection of the ability of Russia to move on to three Baltic States which are our NATO partners, why don't we ask them if they would like our defense budget cut? Why don't we ask our allies in the Pacific region that are so concerned about the testing of these increasingly longer range, intermediate range ballistic missiles by North Korea--why don't we ask them if they want us to cut back on the assets that we have in the region to be able to protect them from the North Koreans if that child dictator suddenly goes off on some crazy tangent and pushes the button?  So I will just summarize and state that Congressman Mulvaney has repeatedly demonstrated an unwillingness to face domestic and global realities, and for this Senator, that raises serious concerns as to whether he can be trusted to responsibly oversee our Nation's budget process. For these reasons and others, I will be voting no on Congressman Mulvaney's nomination.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

In October of 2015, the DHS inspector general released a scathing report of the Federal Protective Service's management of their vehicle fleet, a report that reads like a laundry list of poor management decisions. The IG found that the FPS had more vehicles than officers, and officers were authorized to drive from home to work with government-owned vehicles and, actually, put more miles on the vehicles in driving from home and back to work than they did on the job, among many other things. Additionally, the report stated that the FPS was not in compliance with Federal and departmental compliance, which is why I introduced the DHS SAVE  This bill improves the management of DHS' vehicle fleets by authorizing the Under Secretary for Management at the headquarters level to oversee the components' vehicle fleets, requires the components to evaluate their fleets on an ongoing basis, includes penalties for the mismanagement of component fleets, and requires the DHS to identify alternative methods for the management of component fleets. With the second largest civilian vehicle fleet in the Federal Government, the DHS simply must have stricter controls in place at the headquarters level in order to rein in rogue components.  As the new administration scrutinizes the DHS' operations, this bill will provide important authorities to root out waste, fraud, and abuse from the  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.

10861,topic-id,1011,"Mr.President, the U.Supreme Court is a pillar of our Nation's democracy, and I take very seriously the Senate's responsibility to advise and consent on nominees to serve in this revered institution. Our constitutional democracy is a system of checks and balances with three coequal branches of government. Each branch is intended to serve as a check on the other two.  If congressional Republicans are unwilling or unable to check President Trump, this leaves our courts as the last line of defense against an administration that is committed to expanding the already vast power that is provided to the  We have seen this play out over the past 2 months as President Trump has twice rolled out unconstitutional travel bans only to have Federal courts stop their implementation. The President's reaction was telling. He lashed out at the ``so-called `judge' '' and urged his Twitter followers to blame not only the judge who stayed a travel ban but the entire Federal court system should an attack occur.  Judge Gorsuch wants us all to know that he found these attacks on the judiciary ``disheartening.'' He told me as much when we met. He made a point to use the same language when in meetings with a number of my colleagues. Personally, I would say that these attacks on the judicial branch are more than disheartening--they are appalling, and I would say they are dangerous.  Judge Gorsuch is, by all accounts--and in my opinion--a good man, but as I have reviewed Judge Gorsuch's record and previous rulings, I have to say that I find them disheartening.  I find it disheartening that he has regularly sided against everyday Americans' rights, including women's reproductive rights, workers' rights, and civil rights. I find it disheartening that, instead of allowing women access to basic healthcare, Judge Gorsuch authored a concurring decision that argued that corporations have religious beliefs.  Yes, we all know that corporate law creates a legal fiction of personhood, but let's be real. Corporations are not people. They are not humans, and I have never sat next to a corporation at church. Corporations do not have religious beliefs. To say otherwise defies common sense.  Judge Gorsuch's ruling and the subsequent Supreme Court decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., is a dangerous step backward for women's health. This ruling puts corporations before people and could leave women in Michigan and across the country without access to essential healthcare services. This decision is a step backward for women. It is, instead, a step forward for the growing power that corporations have in this country. Courts not only serve as a check against a powerful executive branch, but they are supposed to put individuals on a level playing field against large, powerful corporations.  I am disheartened that Judge Gorsuch was the only Tenth Circuit judge to rule against a Detroit truckdriver who was unfairly fired for not staying in his disabled trailer after waiting for hours in dangerously cold weather. In a 2-to-1 decision in TransAm Trucking v. DOL, Judge Gorsuch ruled that TransAm Trucking[[Page S2335]]was in the right when it fired Alphonse Maddin for walking away from his disabled semi instead of risking death by hypothermia.  I am also disheartened by Judge Gorsuch's ruling on accommodations for disabled students. In Thompson R2-J School District v. Luke P., Judge Gorsuch ruled that schools only need to provide meager accommodations to satisfy the Individuals with Disabilities Education  During Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearing, the Supreme Court handed down a decision that ruled unanimously against his position. Even the most conservative judges on the Court overruled him.  Chief Justice John Roberts powerfully wrote:       When all is said and done, a student offered an educational      program providing ``merely more than de minimis'' progress      from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an      education at all.  Whether it is ruling against children who want an equal opportunity to get a quality education or women who want access to healthcare or a truckdriver who simply wants to make it home safely at the end of his shift, I am disheartened that Judge Gorsuch often fails to take into account the human face behind each case.  The U.Supreme Court is often the last line of defense for everyday Americans, and Judge Gorsuch's previous rulings indicate he believes that corporations have greater rights than individuals. As millions have been spent by the corporate elite in support of his nomination to the Supreme Court, the judge has failed to acknowledge how deeply the Citizens United decision has corrupted our government by opening the floodgates for special interest money to pour into our elections.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will tell you that Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream judge. I would argue that most Michiganders do not consider the Koch brothers or the Heritage Foundation to be mainstream. Mainstream Michiganders would tell you that our winters can be bitter cold and that you cannot sit in a stalled vehicle for hours without risking life and limb. They would tell you that corporations are not people and, therefore, do not have religious beliefs. They would tell you that all children deserve a chance at a quality education.  A lot of my colleagues will be discussing Senate procedures and rules and precedent in the coming days, and I will simply say this: Michiganders and all Americans deserve a true mainstream, consensus Supreme Court Justice who can earn broad bipartisan support and not merely squeak by.  Now, more than ever, we need the Supreme Court to be our Nation's North Star, not a weathervane that responds to rapidly shifting political winds.  Serving on the Supreme Court requires more than education, more than experience, and more than a pleasant demeanor. A Supreme Court Justice must have sound judicial philosophy and the ability to interpret the law as intended by the Constitution and by the  I am extremely concerned that Judge Gorsuch's judicial approach is out of step with mainstream Michigan values, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his nomination.

Mr.Speaker, we are here tonight as Representatives of America's minority communities to respond directly to President Trump's inaugural address, and specifically to his new deal for African  During President Trump's campaign, he promised to address issues confronting African Americans, and he gave a 10-point plan outlining that. We have studiously reviewed the issues outlined in the plan and have concrete suggestions for him in accomplishing those goals.  While I acknowledge President Trump's willingness to confront these issues, I find the points in his new deal do not go far enough in substance to adequately address the needs of African American communities and rely heavily on assumptions that African American communities are primarily in the inner cities.

African Americans live in the Rust They live in rural areas across this country, in suburbs, and they live in territories.

Mr.Speaker, we are here this evening, in large part, to send a message, suggestions, thoughts, ideas, and support to President Trump that, if he is serious about addressing the issues in disadvantaged communities, it would be wise to tap into the decades of experience held by the members of this caucus. The answers to those 10 points are very nuanced, and we have been working on them for decades, and we are happy to support positive improvements in our underserved communities.  For almost a half century, this caucus has advocated to improve the lives of millions of Americans in both rural and urban communities--African Americans and all The 49 members of this caucus who sit in both Houses of Congress and the members before us tonight have offered policy solutions for decades that would help not only those African American communities, but underserved areas nationwide.                              {time}  2030  We will continue to lead by offering solutions to improve the lives of all Americans in search of a better opportunity.

10793,topic-id,644,"Mr.Speaker, the passage of the Email Privacy Act is long overdue. The fact that the law that governs the government access to emails dates from 1986, before email was really a mass phenomena, is a glaring loophole in our privacy protection laws.  1986 was a time when we used floppy disks to store our information, when, if any internet existed at all, it was just a few people at research universities communicating with another. It was far from a mass phenomena.  Today, this bill catches up with the reasonable expectation that consumers already have that their emails are private. Just as Americans view their phone conversations as private, their physical letters through the mail private, Americans view their emails the same way. Yet, until we close this loophole, the government maintains access, without a warrant, to emails that are older than 6 months in a way that they do not allow access to your old personal letters filed away in a filing cabinet in your office. They don't allow access to old voice mails, and emails are, frankly, no different.  The Email Privacy Act requires that Americans have the same legal protection for our emails as we do for paper letters, faxes, and other types of communication that may remain sitting around. Updating this law simply aligns the law to the digital and physical world. It has taken too long already. Today is a major step forward.  I would like to highlight the House has already passed this bill unanimously last session. How rare it is not just Democrats and Republicans coming together, not just Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers, but every single Democrat and Republican coming together, Mr.That is rare, and yet this body has spoken overwhelmingly last session and I hope will speak overwhelmingly again today to encourage the Senate to promptly bring up this bill and pass it into law.  This bill is a strong victory for bipartisanship. This bill has been one of the most popular bills in the entire I am proud to say, as the lead Democrat, this bill had 314 cosponsors last Congress and passed unanimously.  Back when Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in 1986, it is fair to say that electronic communications meant something different than it means today. Thirty years ago, modern email simply didn't exist. And today, with 24/7 accessibility, accessibility on our smart devices, in our homes, everywhere else, it has been estimated that there were 205 billion emails sent each day by Those emails contain private communications for millions of us, and they deserve the same right of privacy as the letters in your file cabinet or your desk.  You often hear Members talk about commonsense bills. Well, this bill really defines common sense. When you read our bill, there is nothing more common sense than the Email Privacy Act, which is why the bill passed 419-0 last Unfortunately, the bill didn't make it to a Senate Judiciary Committee vote, which is why I am so thrilled that Chairman Goodlatte and Mr.Conyers have succeeded in having Mr.McCarthy and Speaker Ryan bring this bill forward so early this session, giving the Senate a chance to act.

10805,topic-id,3418,"Madam President, this is the 32nd time I have come to the[[Page S1594]]floor in the last year to talk about an issue that unfortunately is getting worse--not better--and that is the epidemic of opioids; that would be heroin, prescription drugs, and now, more recently, synthetic heroin, also known as fentanyl or U-4 or carfentanil.  Every single day we are now losing 144 Americans to drug overdoses. Think about that, every single day, 144 people. By the way, that means, during the time it takes to give these remarks, which will be about 12 minutes, on average, we are losing another American to this opioid epidemic.  It is an issue that is now so serious that it has overtaken car accidents or even homicides from gun violence as the 1 accidental cause of death in our country.  It is easy to get discouraged because we see these statistics. We hear about the overdoses. We hear about the deaths. We hear about the difficulty for people to get out of the grips of this addiction. The relapse rate is high. It is an issue that is affecting every single community in this By the way, it is affecting our inner cities, it is affecting our suburbs, it is affecting our rural areas and every group of Americans out there. No one is immune from this, and it knows no ZIP  Yet today I want to talk a little about some of the reasons for hope and some of the models of success out there because this Congress, to its credit in the last year, has actually gotten much more serious about this issue. We passed two pieces of legislation to help; particularly, to provide better prevention and education to keep people from getting into the funnel of addiction and then, second, to help in terms of providing the resources: the treatment, the recovery. The longer term recovery, in particular, it is the first time Congress has stepped up on that.  We also need to do a better job ensuring that our law enforcement and our other first responders have what they need to save lives and to be able to reverse the effects of overdoses through this miracle drug called naloxone or It is part of the legislation that has not just been passed but is beginning to be implemented.  Fortunately, in my own State of Ohio--although we have one of the worst addiction problems in the country--we also have a lot of really compassionate people who have stepped forward and are taking advantage of these resources, including not only resources from Washington now but also from State and local governments and from so many nonprofits out there. They are taking advantage of that to provide better treatment, better recovery, and better prevention. As a result, they are saving lives.  On Saturday, I visited a group called Clean Acres in Wilmington, It is a farm that provides recovery housing for men. These are men who are struggling with addiction. They work on the farm. They provide each other support, and it has been very successful for a lot of them.  I met a guy named Dan, who told me how Clean Acres is helping him get his life back. For over a decade, he was a heroin addict. He shot up every morning until one day, he was actually at work, and he passed out. He was digging a ditch, and he passed out.  He was rushed to the hospital. The doctors discovered he had a very serious infection related to his intravenous drug use. He required emergency, lifesaving surgery right then.  The doctors told him he might not wake up. He did wake up after that surgery, and there before him were his three kids. He hadn't seen them in 5 years because--in so many cases you hear this and as Dan said this--the drugs became everything. He said, not his family, not his relationships, not his friends, not his work--the drugs became everything. These three kids had come to his bedside because they thought it might have been his deathbed, he said.  He saw these three kids, whom he hadn't seen in 5 years. He said that even after having experienced this near-death operation and having his three kids there, the first thought that came to his mind was: Where can I get another hit? Where can I get another hit? But then, in the situation he was in, he prayed, and he said his prayer was: ``Lord, help me get out of here.'' ``Help me get out of here,'' meaning, ``help me get out of this situation.''  He made a decision. He was going to try treatment again. He had tried treatment before. So many recovering addicts and addicts I talk to around my State have been in and out of treatment programs, detox treatment. It hasn't worked.  He decided this time he was not just going to get into treatment, but he was going to try something different, which was not to go back to the old neighborhood, not to go back to his old friends, but instead to try longer term recovery. That is how he ended up at Clean That is this farm where he and other men live together. They work, but they support each other to try to keep their lives on track after their treatment is over. It doesn't provide the treatment, but it does provide them with the meetings they need to be able to have that support around them in order to keep clean.  As one of the men at Clean Acres told me, it is hard to go through treatment. It is much harder to stay clean after treatment.  So Dan is healing himself. He is working at the farm. He plans to go into construction. He has big plans now. That is the hope. That is the opportunity for people to get their lives back on track whom I see every day when I talk to the people in my home State of  Last week, I was also at Racing for Recovery, outside of Toledo, I met with Todd He has been in recovery from addiction for about 20 years. He is now giving back in a huge way.  I met with parents who had lost children to addiction. They come to Todd's organization, Racing for They find support there, and they help other parents to work through this.  I met law enforcement officers there who are working with this recovery facility to try to ensure that the people whom they are locking up aren't going to just get right back into the revolving door again, back in and out of prison, back committing crimes. The 1 cause of crime in the State of Ohio is this addiction; people who, again, put the drug first ahead of everything, including their own sense and their own conscience, their own sense of what is moral and right, and instead they are committing burglaries and fraud and shoplifting--anything they can do to get the funds they need to continue their addiction.  I met Jessica at Racing for She has been clean for 9 months. Before she sought help, she overdosed for 3 days in a row. She said her life was saved by the police; specifically, a program by the Lucas County Police Department called the Drug Abuse Response Team, I am really impressed with DART and what they are doing. It is now being copied in other communities around Ohio and around the country. DART is being proactive. They got her engaged in treatment and recovery. She is now in sober housing. Todd, Jessica, and others there told me this: Look, you have to have this longer term recovery because that is what works.  A couple of weeks ago, during the State work period, I held a roundtable discussion in Fremont, OH, where I met Matt Matt is an amazing guy--a charismatic, young guy. He said that for him the gateway drug was marijuana and alcohol in high school. He ended up overdosing on heroin three times. He was convicted of 13 felonies, and he went to detox 28 times. Now he is clean and preventing new addictions from taking place by working nonstop to raise public awareness about the dangers of drug use. He goes around to the schools, and he doesn't just talk to kids who are juniors and seniors. He talks to middle schoolers because he knows he has to go younger and younger to get kids to think about their own futures, about the fact that addiction can happen in one use sometimes, and it is something that can ruin their lives. Thank God for Todd and thank God for Matt, because guys like that are out there every day giving back and they are saving lives.  So I want to thank all these compassionate people I have met--Clean Acres, Racing for Recovery, the Lucas County DART team, and Team They are doing the hard work. They are in the trenches trying to actually turn the tide on this growing addiction problem we have. Again, I want to tell them that help is on the way.  Last year Congress did pass the 21st Century Cures Act and authorized[[Page S1595]]funding for States--$500 million this year and $500 million for next year--to fight this epidemic. Another step we took, which I think was probably the biggest step we have taken in a couple of decades in this area, was the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or the CARA Those who know about CARA know that it is a new approach on treatment, recovery, and prevention. If you don't know about it, look it up and check it out. Be sure that the groups in your town, wherever you live, know about the fact that they can apply for grant money to be able to help on these recovery services that I am talking about, many of which do not have the funding to be able to be successful without the increases in rehab. Be sure they know about the fact that if you have a fire department in your community that is strapped for cash and cannot afford the Narcan to provide the Narcan treatments, there is an opportunity to apply for grants there, too, to be able to save lives from overdoses. Narcan is not the answer. The answer is to get into treatment. But Narcan is saving lives, and, therefore, it is necessary today. So let people know that is around and is available now.  Sadly, the situation is not getting better, even with these new efforts that are finally being implemented by the new administration. They started at the end of the Obama administration with a couple of programs, and now we have a couple more programs coming on line. Within the next few months, we expect the rest of the programs to be fully implemented. They are absolutely necessary, but they are pushing up against something new, which is, I hate to say, even more dangerous than heroin, and that is this synthetic heroin that is coming into our communities. It is like a poison coming into our communities by the U.mail system, if you can believe it.  The experts tell us that most of this fentanyl or carfentanil is being made in laboratories overseas, mostly in China, and it has been coming through the mail system. Why? Because the traffickers don't want to use other private carriers--UPS or FedEx or others--because they require that there be advanced digital information on where the package is from, what is in it, and where it is going. Guess what. We don't require that in the mail system. So the bad guys choose to send it through the mail system instead. That certainly is something the Federal Government should address.  So we have introduced legislation called the STOP It is very simple. It says that if you want to send something to the United States of America, it has to say where it is from--what place in China--what is in the package, where it is going, and it can only go to the place they say it is going. That gives our law enforcement a new tool they are desperate to have because they are not able to look at millions of packages. But they can look at hundreds and this helps them to ferret out those packages that look most suspicious.  By the way, this new stuff, fentanyl and carfentanil, is incredibly powerful and incredibly dangerous. It is believed to be 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Think about that. I was in Dayton, OH, a week before last and was meeting with the law enforcement task force there. They told me the sad story about a little girl, 14 years old, who was told by her friends: You ought to snort this stuff; it is called heroin. She did. It was fentanyl, and she dropped dead. She overdosed and died immediately because it was so powerful. Even a few flakes of it, they say, can kill you.  According to the Cleveland medical examiner of Cleveland, OH, this past month of February, which is the shortest month in the year, was also the deadliest month in Northeast Ohio for fentanyl and heroin. In other words, what they are seeing is not just more overdoses but more deaths because of fentanyl being mixed with heroin or sometimes fentanyl in its pure form. In just 28 days this February, 60 Clevelanders died from overdoses in one month. This is one city in There are another seven cases that are undergoing tests, but they are suspected to be the result of heroin and fentanyl overdoses.  What is driving the growth of this epidemic is the increasing use of fentanyl. Drug traffickers are lacing other drugs with it. I was told by the DART task force in Toledo that they are actually putting fentanyl in marijuana now, and people are showing up in the emergency room and overdosing on marijuana because it is sprinkled with fentanyl. It is more addictive. So the traffickers like it. It is more deadly. So we need to fight back. The Drug Enforcement Administration says it takes 2 milligrams of fentanyl to kill you. That is about the same as a pinch of salt. Many heroin users don't realize that the heroin they buy on the street may contain these new incredibly powerful synthetic drugs. So part of the message has to be what one father told me, which is: You are playing Russian roulette every time you use these drugs because you don't know what is in it. If there is fentanyl in it, there is a good chance you won't just overdose, but you will end up as one of these statistics we talked about earlier.  In Lorain, OH, last Monday, a 29-year-old man drove off the road and nearly hit a tree. When police arrived they found him unconscious from an overdose, with a baby in the backseat--a baby in the backseat. It took several doses of this Narcan and naloxone to reverse the effects of the overdose. Ordinarily, it would take only one dose, but with fentanyl-laced heroin it takes more. When police went to his home, a child answered the door and said: Mommy is sleeping, and we can't wake her up. Again, this is the guy that overdosed in the car. They take the kid home and another kid says: Mommy won't wake up. They find out the mother is also unconscious from a heroin overdose that she had in front of her four children. According to police, the couple thought they were using heroin, but tests confirm that it was laced with fentanyl.  This is an opportunity for us in the Congress to pass legislation that will help to be able to stop some of this poison from coming into our communities. At a minimum, it will raise the price, because some of this fentanyl, I am told, is less expensive than even the things that are less powerful, like heroin.  Fentanyl took the life of Erin Jarvis of Troy, Erin was a prom queen. Erin was very popular. She was active in student government. She was captain of her soccer team. She got good grades. She got into Ohio University, a great school.  She had multiple knee injuries from playing soccer, which required surgery. She was prescribed She became addicted. At Ohio University, her friend introduced her to a drug that was stronger and cheaper and easier to get. Of course, that was heroin. This story I have heard so many times. There is the overprescribing, sometimes because of an accident and an injury, and, then, somebody becomes addicted and turns to heroin because it is cheaper and easier to get. Erin began disappearing for days at a time, stealing from her family. Her mom Kelly started missing jewelry, credit cards, and even a TV set. When her sister got her wisdom teeth taken out, she stole her sister's By the way, she never should have gotten Percocet for her wisdom teeth, in my view.  Erin finally got help. She went to rehab. She decided she wanted to become a nurse and help others struggling with addiction. After receiving treatment, she moved back in with her mom. But she relapsed, and she died. She died at the age of 24 with this promising life ahead of her. Her last words to her mom were these: I love you. The next day Kelly watched her daughter get taken out of their home in a body bag.  Tests showed that Erin died of an overdose of heroin laced with fentanyl. According to the coroner, she hadn't used the full injection. There was a lot left in the needle. He said: I suspect that what was in that syringe was not what she thought it was--exactly.  Families who have loved ones struggling with addiction are worried about the poison pouring into the streets, and you can see why. As deadly as heroin is, this stuff is even worse.  To keep this poison off the streets, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Rubio, Senator Hassan, and I have introduced bipartisan legislation, the Synthetic Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, or the STOP Act, which would require the Postal Service to require this simple information that would give our law enforcement the ability to target these packages of fentanyl.[[Page S1596]]  Based on expert testimony in hearings we have had hearings before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, it would make it easier for them to detect those packages. That is what law enforcement is asking for. We should provide it to them. There is a bill in the House that is identical to ours, introduced by Congressman Pat Tiberi of Ohio and Congressman Richard Neal of  This is not the silver bullet, as I said. It is not the solution. No one has that silver bullet, but it would take away a key tool of drug traffickers and restrict the supply of these drugs, raising their price and making it harder to get. With the threat of this synthetic heroin and this poison coming into our communities every day, we need to act and act now.  So I would urge my colleagues to let their constituents know about the help that is on the way. Tell them about what is going on with the Cures Act and CARA legislation. Put it on your website so they know they can get help with treatment and recovery that was not previously out there. Our law enforcement, first responders, and firefighters can get the help they need to be able to get the training and have the funds for Narcan to save lives. We can do much better in terms of prevention and education. Some of this grant money is directed toward letting people know the connection between prescription drugs and heroin and between fentanyl and heroin.  Finally, to my colleagues, please join us in pushing back against these new poisons coming into our communities by cosponsoring the STOP Act and by requiring that this basic information be provided. With more cosponsors, I think our leadership will be much more likely to take this to the floor. Once it gets to the floor, it can be passed because people know that in their communities all over this country this epidemic must be stopped.  Thank you, Madam  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-03-06-pt1-PgS1591-5.txt,924,TESTED ABILITY TO LEVERAGE EXCEPTIONAL NATIONAL TALENT ACT OF 2017,2017.0,6.0,April
10877,topic-id,5590,"Mr.President, I spoke on the Neil Gorsuch nomination[[Page S2349]]last week, and I intend to speak on it again tomorrow. Let me just say that I support Neil Gorsuch as the nominee to the Supreme He is a good man. He is a mainstream jurist, incredibly qualified. I am happy to strongly support him for the                            Opioid Epidemic  Tonight, Mr.President, I want to talk about another issue, one that I hope can continue to bring us together here in this body and also bring our country together. I rise today to talk about what a lot of experts say is the worst drug crisis in the history of our great country--the worst. It is the opioid epidemic. This is the addiction to heroin, prescription drugs, synthetic heroins like fentanyl. The newest threat, this synthetic fentanyl, is coming into our communities from other countries, particularly  There are laboratories in China where evil scientists are putting together these concoctions and sending them through the U.mail system into our communities.  China is doing it on a scale that is devastating to our communities. As a result, I have urged President Trump to prioritize this issue in his meeting with President Xi in Florida later this week. China has banned one synthetic form of heroin, carfentanil, recently, but there is a lot more to do. I am urging President Trump to make it clear to President Xi that we will do everything we need to do to keep this poison out of our communities.  This epidemic is affecting every single one of the States represented here in this body. I know the Presiding Officer knows that because I know he has been involved in his own It is affecting your home town, whoever you are and wherever you are in the United Unfortunately, it is affecting people you probably know.  Every day we are now losing 144 Americans to drug overdoses, most of which are from overdoses of opioids. That is one American life lost every 12 minutes. That will be about the length of this speech. Look at your watch. In the next hour, five Americans will die of a drug overdose.  I have been working on this issue for a long time. I first got involved over 20 years ago when I was in the House of Representatives and a constituent came to me because her son had died of a combination of smoking dope and huffing gasoline. She came to me and said: What are you doing about it?  I was ready. I talked to her about the fact that we had $15 billion devoted to interdicting drugs and incarcerating people and so on.  She said: What are you doing to help me and my community? I have gone to my church. They are in denial. I have gone to the school, and they say it is not a problem here. I have gone to my neighbors, and they won't come together and talk about it.  So we got involved in this issue, and I set up our own community coalition back in my home town of Cincinnati and chaired that for 9 years. I am still very involved with that group, but I also got involved with legislation to try to do things to actually reduce the demand for drugs, because that is so important.  Here we are again. The crisis we had then was mostly crack cocaine, marijuana. Then it was methamphetamines, bath salts. But I have never seen anything like this. This is the worst. If you don't think it is the worst drug crisis we have ever faced, then think about this. Look at this chart of drug overdose deaths in  Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death--the leading cause--in my home State of Ohio, and probably in your State and in our country. This is from 2015, the most recent year for which we have complete data. Nearly two-thirds of the deaths were because of the prescription painkiller heroin-fentanyl issue, or synthetic forms of heroin.  Drug overdoses are not now just the leading cause of death. Overdoses kill more Americans than guns do. This next chart will show that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more Americans died from drug overdoses in 2015 than died from HIV/AIDS at the height of that epidemic. The peak of the AIDS epidemic was 1995. This is 2015 with regard to drug overdoses.  According to an article in the New York Times, more than four times as many people are dying every day from this epidemic than were dying at the peak of the crack epidemic. In the last 3 years, more Americans have died of drug overdoses than died in the Vietnam war.  Unfortunately, we have reasons to believe that this crisis is getting worse, not better. According to recent figures, fatal overdoses due to prescription painkillers, heroin, or synthetic heroin in 2016 alone went up 26 percent in Connecticut, 35 percent in Delaware, and 39 percent in During the first three quarters of 2016, deaths from overdoses in Maryland increased 62 percent. In Ohio they increased 20 percent the last 2 years in a row.  So we have seen this huge spike here in deaths from overdoses, starting in about 2010 and going up. This is with regard to heroin. This is with regard to non-methadone synthetic opioids--in other words, fentanyl, carfentanil, U4, and other synthetic heroins.  This is a crisis. It is one that, unfortunately, is affecting every single community--whether you are in an urban, suburban, or rural community, whether you are young or old, regardless of your walk in life.  The issue, of course, is much bigger than just the tragedy of overdose deaths. It is also about people whose lives have gotten off track because of these drugs and because of the addiction. There are 200,000 people in Ohio alone who are living with an addiction to these drugs. By the way, if you are addicted, you are much more likely to be committing crimes, fraud, and theft to pay for that habit.  In my State of Ohio--and I will bet in your State--the 1 cause of crime is opioids. A lot of these people have lost a job or can't get a job. I talked to some business folks over the weekend in Ohio who talked about regulations and taxes. They said: You know, this drug issue is affecting every single one of us. We can't get people to pass a drug test. We have employees who are now addicted to prescription drugs or heroin and their absenteeism and inability to come to work is affecting our economy.  So this is something that is affecting all of us. Of course, many have broken relationships with their families and their loved ones. I cannot tell you the number of people who have told me, and I have probably met with 1,000 addicts or recovering addicts over the last few years. I can't tell you how many people have told me: Drugs became everything, and I pushed my family out, and pushed my friends out, and pushed my job away, and it left me in a situation where I was broken.  But living without hope is something that we can deal with, because there are ways for us to get people into treatment and to get people into recovery to help them. We are in a crisis. Some have asked me: Well, how did we get here? That is usually a good start to this: How do we get out of it? How did we get here is complicated. But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions, those who are addicted to prescription painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.  Let me look at this a different way. Four out of five heroin addicts started with prescription drugs. So this issue of prescription drugs, overprescribing, is a huge part of how this happened in the first place. Increasingly, what we have seen in all of our States is addiction starting with these drugs and then switching to cheaper and more accessible heroin, and then switching again to sometimes more powerful forms of heroin like carfentanil, maybe 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. That is what is taking so many lives at such an alarming pace. The epidemic started with overprescribing. The United States uses more prescription pain killers than any other country in the world. It is not even close. Look at these numbers here. This is the daily opioid dose for over a million people. Look at the United States as compared to every other country in the world.  This is using 2014 data, and the numbers may have gotten better because of the work being done to cut back on painkillers. But according to the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, we consume nearly 70 percent in this country--5 percent of the world's population and nearly 70 percent of the world's painkillers.  In 2012, that number was 75 percent. It is still not even close on a per-person basis. For every American, there are 50[[Page S2350]]pain pills in this country, and second place is Canada with 30 pain pills.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, painkiller prescription sales nearly quadrupled from just 1999 to 2014. That number finally peaked in 2012, by the way, and since then has come down slightly. In 2012, there were more prescriptions for painkillers in Ohio than there were people in There were more prescriptions for painkillers--not pills, prescriptions--than there were people in By the way, that was also true in 11 other  Fortunately in Ohio, we have made some progress under the leadership of Governor Kasich, Lieutenant Governor Taylor, Attorney General DeWine, and the State legislature. They have taken some important steps to cut back on painkiller prescriptions. We have cut them back by about one-fifth, about 20 percent since they peaked in 2012, but that number is still way too high. According to the Ohio Board of Pharmacy, 631 million pain pills were prescribed to Ohioans last year. We are also still dealing with the consequences of a lot of the addictions that got started in 2011, 2010, or before.  The number of prescriptions has risen, just as the addiction to opioids has risen. Drug cartels have followed this prescription drug epidemic, bringing in heroin. Those drug cartels flooded my State and probably a lot flooded a lot of your States with this cheaper, more accessible heroin, now synthetic heroin.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Mexican heroin production alone increased sixfold in just 4 years--from eight metric tons in 2005 to 50 metric tons in 2009. That number is now 70 metric tons, and it just keeps rising.  According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, here in this country, Mexican opium poppy planting increased by 64 percent just from 2014 to 2015. So it is getting worse, not better.  According to the Congressional Research Service, virtually all of the heroin produced in Mexico is consumed here in the United States of  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heroin use among young people has doubled in the last decade, among young people 18 to 25 years old.  This affects all of us. It knows no ZIP It certainly knows no walk of life.  Since 2010, heroin overdose deaths have doubled among Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Native Americans, and  A lot of the people who are addicted to prescription drugs have switched to heroin instead. Now we are seeing that heroin addicts are switching also, even if they don't know they are doing it. They are switching to fentanyl and carfentanil. Again, it could be up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Sometimes they don't know it because the traffickers are sprinkling the fentanyl in other drugs--heroin, of course, but also, we know now, cocaine. They are mixing it with marijuana, mixing it with other drugs, and not letting people know.  We had a 14-year-old girl recently die in Dayton, She was with her friends, snorting what she was told was heroin. She had done it before. But this was fentanyl, and it killed her instantly.  More than 1,000 Ohioans were killed by fentanyl in 2015--more than double the previous year and more than 10 times the number in 2013. In Cleveland, for example, there have been more overdoses from fentanyl in the past 10 months than there had been in the past 10 years. In Columbus, there have already been half as many fentanyl overdoses in the first 3 months of this year as there were all of last year. This is why I say fentanyl is the new risk, the new danger.  As one father who lost his son to an overdose told me: Every time you engage in taking drugs, you are playing Russian roulette because you don't know what is in it.  In my hometown of Cincinnati, fentanyl deaths now surpass heroin deaths. Drug overdose deaths in Cincinnati increased by 40 percent from 2014 to 2015. Over that same timeframe, in just 1 year, heroin overdoses increased 12 percent, while fentanyl overdose deaths increased 153 percent. These numbers are very disturbing. They are discouraging, too, because it seems like we just can't turn the tide. It is easy to feel as though we just can't do anything, that we are paralyzed, but there is actually a lot we can do to help, and we can and should.  Here in the Senate, we have already taken some very important steps in the last year. About 9 months ago, we passed legislation called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, Last year, we passed the 21st Century Cures Those two together provide much more funding for this issue. The Cures Act alone is $500 million more this year going back to the States to provide funding primarily for treatment for this increase in overdose deaths. There will be $500 million authorized again next year. We have to be sure that gets into the appropriations bill.  We also have seen, I think much more importantly in a way, through the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--separate legislation--that we are beginning to fund directly programs that work. We spent 3 years looking around the country and had five conferences here in Washington, We brought experts in from all over the country who told us what the best practices were. What is the best prevention technique that is working? How do we get kids not to make these decisions? What is the best thing that is happening in terms of treatment, and then longer term recovery, what works and what doesn't work. Is medication-assisted treatment better? Is it better? Does it rely more on longer term recovery? Have they had more success there?  All of this has led us to put together this legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, that actually funds programs like drug courts that are working around the country. They take people, diverting them from prison, and say: As long as you stay clean, you can stay out of jail, because you are a user, you are not a pusher. But you have to stay clean.  Then they provide them alternatives, including using drugs that reduce the cravings. If you reduce the craving for opioids, that is proving to be very, very successful in some cases. Dimitrol is the drug they use mostly in Ohio to do that. There are some great examples of people who have gone through the drug court process who have now been clean for a few years. They are back to work. They are back with their families. They are back as contributing members of society. So there is hope. We have seen how it can work.  CARA is the first legislation Congress ever passed to promote long-term recovery. Why? Because we have looked around the country and had experts here. We figured out that the treatment programs are important, and before that, the detox program is important. But what is leading to more success is longer term recovery programs.  As an example, think about being in detox for a week and then maybe a couple weeks in a treatment program and then going into a sober housing arrangement where you have regular meetings, where you are getting support from fellow recovering addicts. That seems to work longer. You are there. It seems to work better for most  Unfortunately, we do not have all of CARA's legislation fully implemented yet. Only three of its eight programs have been implemented. It has been a while. It has been about 9 months. It is time to push all of those programs.  I pushed the Obama administration on this. I am now pushing the Trump administration. Last week, I was delighted that the Trump administration announced the creation of a commission on the opioid epidemic, led by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has a real passion for this issue. I commend the President and Governor Christie for their commitment to making progress on the issue. Their leadership and their partnership with Congress will make a difference.  Today I talked to General Kelly, the new Secretary of Homeland He is going to be on the commission. He said they are going to report about the problem within 90 days. We know a lot about the problem. We also have to be sure we are seeing some action.  What I would suggest today is that the administration work hard to implement the remaining five CARA grant programs that are not yet up and running. For example, it has been 8 months, almost 9 months, since CARA[[Page S2351]]was signed into law. Yet we still don't have the grant for naloxone up and running. Our States and local communities need this Narcan on the street to save people's lives, because this is a miracle drug that reverses the effects of an overdose, but we also need to get more training for some of our first responders so they can administer it more effectively, which is particularly more important right now with this new drug, the fentanyl, the synthetic drug coming in, because synthetic heroin requires sometimes not one, not two but four or five uses of Narcan--maybe more--to save someone's life. So our first responders are asking for this help.  We still don't have the grant for medication-assisted treatment up and running. We still don't have the grant for pregnant and postpartum women's treatment providers up and running. This will help to ensure we have fewer babies who are born with this addiction. Let's get going on these.  For all of us here in Congress, let's be sure that we fully fund It is $182 million a year, every year, in addition to what we were spending on opioids. We need to be sure that funding is there, that these programs are working, and that our communities begin to get more of the help they need. These evidence-based programs that work are what we ought to be supporting, and that is exactly what the legislation does.  I thank Vice President Pence, who was in Ohio on It was a meeting about the economic issues we faced as a country. He talked about tax reform and regulations and skills training, but he also talked about this issue. I think it is important that we are all talking about this issue back home and raising awareness hopefully to save lives, to keep people from going down this path but also to ensure that our fellow citizens know the importance of Congress and State legislatures and local communities getting engaged with it all. Everyone must get involved.  I was in Youngstown, OH, on Friday, and I held a roundtable at the Neil Kennedy Recovery This is one of the first programs of its kind in the country. It started in the late 1940s. It focused more at that time on alcoholism. Executive Director Carolyn Givens was there with her staff. They are incredibly compassionate people. She told me a lot of stories.  I was able to meet with some of the recovering addicts at the center. One told me his name was He told me that center saved his life. It saved his life. This is a guy who worked for years at utility companies. He is a skilled worker. He got involved with prescription drugs because of an accident or an injury, and then he ended up moving to heroin, which was cheaper and more accessible. Then he found his life spinning out of control. Now he is there, and he is getting back on track.  Everybody, by the way, at the roundtable who was there--the staff and community leaders who were involved--they all said: Get this legislation implemented. We need it.  On Friday afternoon, I went to Cleveland and toured the Vincent Charity Medical Center with addiction specialist Ted What an amazing guy he is. This is in a hospital setting where they have a detox unit and a treatment center, which is very unusual. I think it is the only one of its kind in Cleveland, and it is one of a few in the country where, within a hospital setting, these people are getting everything they need. It is a very comprehensive approach. They deal with mental health issues, of course, but also other physical issues people have, and it is helpful to have it all together there at that center. I thank the sisters for what they are doing because they are supporting this, and sometimes it is quite expensive to have a treatment program. At Vincent's, they are doing an awesome job.  Everyone there told me the same thing that I hear across Ohio--that their services have, unfortunately, never been in greater demand. They have a waiting list. They say the situation is getting worse, not better. I think that is true in your State, too, because according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, SAMHSA, 9 out of 10 of the 22 million Americans who are suffering from addiction are not getting the treatment they need--9 out of 10. CARA and the Cures Act will help change that.  People need to change that in their own hearts. They need to step forward and seek the treatment they need. We need to take away the stigma of addiction because it is an illness. We need to treat it as an illness because that would help people come forward, admit they have a problem, and get the treatment they need. Their families and their communities are desperate for that to happen. CARA and Cures will help change all that.  I applaud my colleagues here, Republican and Democrat alike, for moving forward on this legislation over the last year, but there is a lot more work to do. We should continue to address the underlying issue of overprescribing. It started this epidemic in the first place. We talked about the number of prescriptions that are still out there.  Last week, I joined with my colleague Senator Amy Klobuchar to introduce bipartisan legislation called the Prescription Drug Monitoring Act to keep better track of prescription painkillers, keep them out of the wrong hands, and identify an addiction as early as possible so that it can be treated.  This goes to the pharmacist. You will have to report when someone gets a pain pill prescription. They have to put it on the Prescription Drug Monitoring  It goes to doctors. They have to be sure that when they are prescribing medication, that that is part of the drug monitoring program. They have to access the drug monitoring program before they give a prescription to be sure the person isn't filling the prescription with them that they have already filled somewhere else. Unfortunately, there is a lot of that abuse still out there. Sometimes it is across State lines, which is why Federal legislation is required. Our legislation requires that States work better together to ensure that the Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs are talking to each other.  By the way, if people don't do this under our legislation--the pharmacists, the doctors, and the States--then they have their Federal funding pulled back that we talked about earlier on the CARA legislation.  If you see a sign of addiction starting, our legislation requires that you let the patient's doctor know that so we can begin to identify the people who have an addiction and get them the treatment they need.  I think this is going to be a good bill because it will lead to a smarter and more effective use of taxpayer dollars, and more importantly, of course, it is going to prevent a lot of new addictions from starting in the first place. That, of course, would save lives.  Congress can also do something else that is really important, and that is to give law enforcement better tools to be able to keep some of this poison out of our communities. So the prevention and the treatment and the recovery and Narcan for our first responders--they are all very important, but let's also keep some of this out. Let's do a better job of stopping the heroin at the southern border. Let's do a better job of stopping the fentanyl, which is this new synthetic heroin we are talking about that is causing so many overdoses and deaths. Let's do a better job of keeping that out.  This should be a no-brainer, in my view, because it is coming in through the U.mail system. We know this. All the studies show this. Most of these synthetic drugs are being made in labs in China, and they are shipped by mail to traffickers in the United States, sometimes to Mexico as well. Typically that is done through the Postal Why? Because the private carriers like UPS or FedEx or DHL and others require, when you ship something, that you have advance information provided to the Customs and Border Protection and to others as to where the package is from, what is in it, where it is going. The post office doesn't require that. Is it any wonder that traffickers are using the Postal Service rather than one of these private carriers?  Law enforcement came to us and told us that they could use this data--it is electronic data provided up front--because that would enable them to determine the suspect packages. Of the millions of packages that come into our country, they have to know how to find that needle in the haystack. That is why they want the ability to find these[[Page S2352]]packages, to scan these packages, and to be able to stop some of this poison that is coming into our communities.  The legislation we have with regard to this issue is called the STOP I recently introduced it again this year with Senator Klobuchar, Senator Rubio, Senator Hassan, and many others here in the It is a bipartisan bill, called the Synthetic Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, or the STOP It closes this loophole we talked about within the Postal Service and requires the post office to obtain advanced electronic data on packages before they cross our borders, just like the private carriers have to do.  It is not a new idea, by the way. In 2002, Congress placed this requirement on private carriers. That is when it started. It also required that the post office review this and look into this. So, in 2002, this Congress was smart enough to say: This seems to make sense. Let's require the post office to look into it. We have seen the results. The results are that traffickers stay away from the private carriers because they know they can use the Postal Service and get away with it.  Traffickers are lacing the heroin on the streets of America with these synthetic drugs to make them stronger and more addictive. They are getting more people addicted. Fentanyl is also so powerful that it only takes a couple of milligrams--the equivalent of a pinch of salt--to kill you. They say that three flakes can kill you. The fact that heroin is now being laced with fentanyl, of course, makes it much more likely for you not only to have an overdose, because of the strength of this synthetic heroin, but also that you will die from that overdose. Again, it is much harder to use Narcan and to begin to save lives by using that and to reverse the effects of the overdose.  So the STOP Act, to me, again, is something that we definitely ought to do in this It would restrict the supply of these dangerous drugs, raise the prices of these drugs, and would make them harder to get. That is going to save lives.  Support for the STOP Act is growing. Our bill has now been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police and by the Major County Sheriffs of They are convinced that this tool will work. Last Friday, I was in Columbus, I met with Franklin County deputy sheriff Rick Minerd, also the deputy chief of the Columbus Police, Mike We had the Cincinnati and Columbus directors of the Customs and Border Patrol--the chiefs--there to talk about it, and we had the Drug Enforcement Agency's special agents in charge there with us. We also had people who were on the investigative side of the Customs and Border The deputy attorney general of Ohio was there, Steve Schumaker, and others. All of these law enforcement people said: Give us this legislation. It is a tool that we need.  We had a hearing today on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and General Kelly was there. He is the new Secretary of Homeland He agreed with me that the STOP Act would ``help [Customs] officers target illegal shipments . . . reduce the ability for the post office to be used for the illicit shopping of all kinds of contraband . . . [and] be helpful to be able to identify packages'' of synthetic drugs. He is right. We need the administration's help and push for this legislation as well. Let's get this done.  President Trump, by the way, endorsed this idea last year when he said during the campaign:       We will close the shipping loopholes to China that others      are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders and      into the hands of our own Postal These traffickers      use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and      other drugs to users and dealers in the United [The]      Trump administration will crack down on this abuse and give      law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this      mission.  Let's get it done.  Again, I have asked President Trump to raise this issue with President Xi Jinping because China can do a lot more to try to shut down these laboratories in China, to try to stop some of the materials that are coming into the laboratories that make up this fentanyl. By the way, it is in China's interest to do so.  I have received information recently that there is leakage. What does that mean? That means that some of this fentanyl is going out to the countryside, to the suburbs of China, and to the cities of China, and it is affecting their population.  This legislation already has a companion bill in the So this is not an issue in which the Senate can act and then we cannot get it through the process because we cannot get it through the House and the Pat Tiberi and Richard Neal have introduced companion legislation--Tiberi, a Republican from Ohio, and Neal, a Democrat from It is bipartisan. It is the kind of legislation that should draw bipartisan support, and we should get it done.  Is it a silver bullet? No, we do not have a silver bullet. There is not one silver bullet. There is a comprehensive approach here, and these two bills that I have talked about are new steps that we should take.  I urge my colleagues to continue to support the CARA legislation. Let's provide full funding. Let's support the Cures legislation in the upcoming appropriations process. Let's continue to engage the good folks back home who are trying, at the tip of the spear, to do all that they can in terms of providing better treatment opportunities and longer term recoveries and who are going into our schools and talking about prevention so as to do all we can to keep people from going into that funnel of addiction.  Let's pass this legislation. Join us in keeping better track of painkiller prescriptions so that potentially addictive drugs do not end up in the wrong hands and so that addictions get treated early. That legislation is important.  Join me and join the 10 other Senators in pushing back against poisonous synthetic heroin, which is coming into our communities, by supporting the STOP Act as a cosponsor so that we can get this bill to the floor and get it to the President for his signature.  I believe these two pieces of legislation, if allowed on the floor, will pass overwhelmingly. I believe the President would sign them. Most importantly, I believe they would begin to save lives in the communities we all represent.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

10911,topic-id,484,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.612, the United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017.  I was grateful for the opportunity to work closely with my colleague, Mr.Langevin from Rhode Island, on this vitally important legislation that will build upon the existing collaboration between the United States and the State of Israel on critical cybersecurity issues.  Following our successful congressional delegation to Israel in May of last year to discuss homeland security and cybersecurity issues, Mr.Langevin and I worked closely to champion two important pieces of legislation.  Last year, I introduced H.5877, the United States-Israeli Advanced Partnership Act of 2016, which was signed into law on December 16 with Mr.Langevin's help and support. That legislation expanded a current cooperative research program between the two countries by adding cybersecurity to a program that had previously focused only on border security, explosives detection, and emergency services.  Today, Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to have H.612, the United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017 come before the This bill would expand the memorandum of agreement already in place between our Department of Homeland Security and the State of Israel by authorizing the Secretary to carry out a grant program at DHS to support cybersecurity research and development as well as the demonstration and commercialization of cybersecurity technologies.  During our congressional delegation, Mr.Langevin and I were able to meet with top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to discuss how the United States and Israel can better cooperate in these vital areas. We also had the opportunity to meet with many of Israel's cybersecurity companies and technology startups.  Over the past several years, Israel has become a leader in cybersecurity and has developed a deep and talented cyber workforce, something we need greater focus on here in the United To that end, much of our discussion with Israeli officials and private companies revolved around how the United States and Israel can work more closely together and learn from each other as we combat growing cybersecurity threats. This legislation is a product of those successful discussions.  Mr.Speaker, the United States and Israel are both under constant threat from nation-state and other actors that wish to do our countries harm, so it is vitally important that the United States and Israel work hand-in-hand to build our cyber defenses to combat these cyber threats together.  Mr.Speaker, it is also vital that in the House both parties work hand-in-hand on America's national security vulnerabilities. Given the current political environment, I would like to commend and thank my colleague, Mr.Langevin, for his willingness to do just that, as demonstrated by his partnership on this issue.

10858,topic-id,3328,"Mr.President, there are few moments in the life of a nation when the people are presented with a single choice that directly affects what equality before the law will mean for the next generation. The opportunity to grant a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States is[[Page S2331]]one of those moments. The next Supreme Court Justice will break the 4-to-4 deadlock that has constrained the Court since the passing of Justice Scalia and this body's unprecedented refusal to act on Chief Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to fill that vacancy during the final year of President Obama's second term.  Before discussing the pending nominee's merits, we must consider this nomination in its historical context. Chief Judge Garland, I believe, was one of the most qualified nominees for the Supreme Court in generations. After meeting with him and reviewing his record, I had no doubt that he easily would have earned bipartisan support and cleared the 60-vote threshold, as did each of President Obama's prior nominees to the Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refused even to meet with him. His treatment was disgraceful.  Rejecting the treatment Chief Judge Garland received, I met with Judge Neil Gorsuch and shared a thoughtful conversation. I found him to be intelligent and articulate but at the same time, he was not particularly forthcoming about his judicial record, which contains many distressing examples of inconsistency and ideological rigidity. Nothing in our conversation or his testimony before the Judiciary Committee convinced me that he plans to moderate his positions to dispense equal justice under the law. I am deeply concerned that granting him a lifetime appointment to be a final authority on the meaning of the Constitution would further tip the scales of justice in favor of corporations and the powerful at the expense of working people and the powerless. Therefore, I cannot support Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court of the United  This is a pivotal time for our Nation, when the people's trust in the judiciary is in decline, attributed by many to the streak of 5-to-4 decisions of the Roberts Court that have consolidated corporate power. Given how radically the Court has changed many of our institutions over just the past decade, it is difficult to overstate the importance of understanding a nominee's judicial values and the human element the nominee will bring to the  I have applied the same, simple test to each Supreme Court nominee throughout my time in this body. It is not enough for a nominee to display intellectual gifts or to possess a textbook understanding of American history and jurisprudence. Judicial decision making at the Supreme Court is not an assembly line where mechanical application of the law will resolve every dispute.  Rather, the nominee must demonstrate that she or he will use judicial discretion to give meaning to the text and spirit of the  Justice Harlan Fiske Stone laid the foundation for this model of judicial review in United States v. Carolene Products He wrote that judges must enforce the specific text of the Constitution, but he went further than that, urging judges to apply stricter scrutiny to laws that impede the effective operation of government and channels of political participation. Judges should likewise demand the most compelling justifications for laws that single out powerless, discrete, and insular minorities. These principles deeply influenced future scholars and judges and laid the groundwork for modern constitutional law as we have understood it since the Warren  These are the decisions that struck down race and gender segregation, proclaimed the rule of ``one person, one vote,'' enshrined the right to remain silent and to counsel in police custody, and recognized the fundamental right of a person to marry for love, regardless of race or gender.  This tradition stands in stark contrast to the new wave of hyper-partisan legal activism we have seen manifested in our courts in recent years. This judicial activism attempts to disguise judges' personal political agenda by arguing that they are merely applying pure, indisputable, mechanical logic. This philosophy goes by varied names: textualism, originalism, strict constructionism, and so forth. But in the main, it is an ideological prism to disguise traditional judicial discretion, expand the law without limits to benefit politically powerful majority groups and corporations, and constrict the law for the minorities, workers, and the politically powerless.  We know too well the devastating effects of this line of thinking as it has manifested itself in the Roberts In the case of Shelby County, the Court disregarded congressional intent and ruled 5 to 4 that the preclearance formula that helped millions of African Americans secure the vote in States with a history of discrimination was no longer necessary. This freed several States to enact severely restrictive election laws that clearly benefit one party and racial group at the expense of another, and courts are still working to resolve these imbalances.  In Hobby Lobby, with an intellectual framework formed in part by Judge Gorsuch, the Court ruled 5 to 4 to give for-profit corporations religious rights to opt out of providing comprehensive health coverage for their employees. This has opened the door for corporate religious challenges to an untold number of duly enacted restraints on corporate excess, from child labor laws to basic protections against employment discrimination.  In Citizens United, as we all too well know, the Court broke with decades of precedent, the facts of the case, and common sense to create a constitutional right for corporations to spend unlimited money on our elections. Indeed, our political system is still reeling from billions of dollars in anonymous political expenditures, and we are only now beginning to recognize the national security concerns that have resulted, with hostile powers, such as Russia, seeking to influence our democracy. In order to satisfy partisan, ideological ends, the Court has left us powerless to limit the purchase of political influence or even to know who is spending all this money on our politics.  Judge Gorsuch's record strongly suggests that he would contribute to the Roberts Court's partisan, pro-corporate orientation. Indeed, the very same business groups that spent $7 million in dark money to block Chief Judge Garland's nomination to this seat also spent $10 million on ads and lobbying efforts to support Judge Gorsuch's nomination. It stands to reason that these groups believe that Judge Gorsuch shares their right-wing beliefs and will benefit their interests.  The Judiciary is supposed to be above politics. Judges write opinions to satisfy due process and establish precedents that will guide future decisions. The opinion-writing process is not intended to be an arena for judges to pursue self-serving or ideological ends. That is why I am deeply concerned with Judge Gorsuch's clear willingness on the Tenth Circuit to go beyond precedent and the facts of a case before him to advance arguments designed to bend the law to his ideology.  In Riddle v. Hickenlooper, Judge Gorsuch joined a panel decision that struck down uneven contribution limits in Colorado election laws. He then wrote separately to advocate that all campaign finance laws should be subject to greater constitutional questioning. This was both unnecessary to decide the case, and a clear signal by Judge Gorsuch that he would work to abolish what remains of laws limiting the flow of anonymous corporate money into our elections.  Judge Gorsuch has reached furthest beyond precedent when doing so would deconstruct Federal agencies that constrain corporations, and protect workers, consumers, and the environment. This confirmation process has introduced many to a relatively obscure doctrine of administrative law called Chevron deference. The Chevron case stands for the essentially uncontested proposition that, when someone sues a Federal agency and a reasonable person could read the statute at issue more than one way, the court should defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation of the law it is charged with enforcing. This case has long been a target for attacks by corporations and their advocates because it levels the playing field in cases between massively well-funded corporate lawyers who want no regulations, and agencies charged with bringing big business into compliance with the law. Judge Gorsuch has written strongly against this principle, but even Justice Scalia acknowledged the sound reasoning behind the Chevron case.  Judge Gorsuch would seemingly return us to the old days when powerful[[Page S2332]]companies could pollute the environment, scam their customers, and discriminate against their employees as long as they could pay enough lawyers and get the right judge when the Federal agency sues. In the case of Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, he took the very unusual step of writing a concurrence to his own majority opinion in order to attack Federal agencies and make the case that decades of Chevron precedent should be overturned. It is highly unusual, after you have written the majority opinion at the circuit level deciding the case, that you would then step aside and write a separate epistle advancing your ideas.  He wrote in language that is familiar to those of us in the political branches of government, but out of the ordinary for a Federal judge. He compared Federal agencies to a ``tyrannical king'' and a ``behemoth'' and a ``colossus'' and laid out his constitutional theory for challenging Chevron in the Supreme None of this analysis was necessary to the case before Judge Yet in writing this and similar opinions, Judge Gorsuch signaled his willingness to break from precedent and contort the law to fit his ideological vision of how the system should work to benefit the powerful and his preferred interests.  My colleagues on the Judiciary Committee spent a great deal of time and effort questioning Judge Gorsuch and trying to elicit responses about his basic judicial philosophy. Unfortunately, his answers were largely nonresponsive and failed to address many of our concerns about his record.  Judge Gorsuch's record and writings shows he believes judges should always interpret the Constitution and other laws from the perspective of those who first drafted the law, regardless of how the world looks today.  The Founders and Framers, however, did not leave us a blueprint to answer every new question of law. Nor did the delegates to the Constitutional Convention demand that all future judges be ``originalists.'' The laws and values of 1789 would shock and alienate--as they should--many Americans today, particularly women and racial and other minority groups. Worse yet, a judge attempting to resolve a case as if it were the 18th, 19th, or even 20th centuries may wittingly or unwittingly use that construct to inject into the case the judge's own view of how the government ought to work.  The Hobby Lobby case is a key example of this ideological inconsistency at work to the detriment of less powerful This case concerned, as I noted earlier, whether a for-profit corporation could refuse to comply with the Affordable Care Act's mandate that employers provide health coverage, including contraceptives, to over 23,000 employees on the ground that doing so would conflict with the corporation's purported religious rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or  The text of RFRA provides that the ``government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.'' The legislative history of RFRA is both recent and clear. In the case of Employment Division v. Smith, decided in 1990, the Supreme Court rejected two peyote users' claim of a religious right to consume the drug on grounds that the Constitution permits some burdens on religion if the aim of the law is secular and generally applicable. When Congress debated RFRA in 1993, the House and Senate reports showed explicitly that Congress's aim was ``only to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in Smith'' and to require courts considering RFRA cases to ``look to free exercise cases decided prior to Smith for guidance.''  No Supreme Court case prior to this time had ever granted corporations religious rights and nothing in RFRA's legislative history suggested that Congress's intent was to do so. Notwithstanding these facts, Judge Gorsuch joined his colleagues to hold that a for-profit corporation's religious beliefs may overcome its employees own consciences and rights to comprehensive health coverage. He relied on an 1871 law called the Dictionary Act, which provided that in certain circumstances, Congress's use of the term ``person'' can also mean businesses, ``unless the context indicates otherwise.'' This reference to context means that Judge Gorsuch had discretion to use history and common sense to reach the conclusion that corporations don't have religious views, but people do, and RFRA was enacted to protect real people's rights. But instead, he took this opportunity to endow corporate entities with religious rights that could help them escape the law in untold circumstances.  Let's explore for a moment Judge Gorsuch's belief that judges should always give meaning to the original intent of a law's draftsmen. In this case, what is a corporation and how does it operate? In 1787, there were roughly six non-bank corporations in America, and their powers were severely restricted in the wake of colonists' experiences with the abusive practices of the Crown and royal English corporations. Around the time that Congress passed the Dictionary Act, corporations were harshly regulated by law to achieve specific commercial ends and nothing more. There were legal limits on the capital they could raise. Many could not operate outside their state of incorporation. They were often prohibited from owning property that was not necessary for specific commercial activities. Most were even forbidden to engage in any activity that was not explicitly enumerated in their corporate charters, and a real person could sue to render a corporation's action a legal nullity if it were not expressly in furtherance of the corporation's business mission. The idea that a corporation in this context could exercise fundamental religious rights, much less that its religion should excuse it from complying with duly enacted laws that protect real people, would have been outrageous to the Framers and the Congress that passed the Dictionary  Judge Gorsuch knew or should have known the ahistorical nature of his decisions. We have yet to see the full scope and consequences of his vision of a near-unlimited right of corporations to opt out of our laws, but we can imagine the harmful choices and difficult litigation on this point that may lie ahead. I, for one, have deep concerns about any judicial philosophy that bends so far in the direction of corporate interests and completely ignores tens of thousands of real people in the process.  For as much as Judge Gorsuch's record shows that he is willing to entertain new or arcane legal theories to reach a better outcome for corporations and the powerful, it is also clear that he will go to no such length to vindicate the rights of minorities, the disabled or workers.  One example highlighted during Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearing is his record on lawsuits under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or The purpose of IDEA is to ensure that students with disabilities receive a public education that is tailored to their special individual needs. In the 2008 case popularly referred to as the Luke case, however, Judge Gorsuch ruled against the parents of a severely autistic child who sought reimbursement for the cost of a specialized school because their son was not making appropriate progress in the public school. In denying the parents relief, Gorsuch reinterpreted IDEA to require that public schools need only provide de minimis, or nonzero educational progress to children with disabilities. Not only did Judge Gorsuch go beyond the facts of the case to close any path to relief for the family, but in this and similar cases, he attempted to set a legal precedent for future cases that effectively eviscerated the meaning and protections of  Fortunately, the Supreme Court intervened. In a rare unanimous decision released, ironically, on the second day of Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearing, the Court rejected Judge Gorsuch's narrow reading of the law. In fact, the Chief Justice did not mince words when it came to Judge Gorsuch's lower bar for schools. He said Judge Gorsuch's model would hardly provide ``an education at all'' for children with disabilities, and that ``receiving instruction that aims so low would be tantamount to `sitting idly . . . awaiting the time when they were old enough to drop out.' '' This stark, unanimous rebuke of Judge Gorsuch's view of the law in the middle of his confirmation hearing was yet another reminder that this nominee is outside of the judicial mainstream.[[Page S2333]]  But Judge Gorsuch has not just restricted his reading of the law in the educational context. In TransAm Trucking, v. Administrative Review Board, a majority of the Tenth Circuit held that a truck driver was wrongfully fired when he drove away from his trailer to find help after being stranded for hours in subzero temperatures in a vehicle with no heat and a rig with failed brakes. Judge Gorsuch disagreed so sharply that he penned a dissent. Under his strict textualist view of the law, the driver was protected from firing for ``refusing'' to operate in dangerous conditions, but the word ``refusing'' could not be interpreted to include driving away to get potentially lifesaving help, rather than freezing to death. Again and again, Judge Gorsuch's record shows he is capable, but either unwilling or unable to give the same benefit of the doubt to average working people as he does to their employers, their landlords and the most powerful among us.  Mr.President, Constitutional law is not concerned with easy cases or simple answers. We have constitutional guarantees to inalienable rights because we know that majority rule sometimes gets it wrong, particularly when it comes to the rights of the minority. That is what makes the qualifications for a seat on the Supreme Court fundamentally different from any other Federal or State court in the A judge's job is to apply precedent, be faithful to the law, and exercise measures of empathy and common sense to dispense justice. A Supreme Court Justice's job is to decide when the law is wrong and must be changed in order to fulfill the promise of the The Supreme Court cannot perform this function unless the individual Justices bring to it the values and willingness to be the last resort for the powerless when the system fails. They must be able to make unpopular decisions and side against political and cultural majorities. They must be able to reject precedent when the established way of doing things no longer safeguards the fundamental protections to which every American is entitled. They must do this for the least and most derided among us, because if they do not, there is nowhere else to turn. They have the final word on the meaning of the law.  I take Judge Gorsuch at his word that he respects the law and approaches this nomination with seriousness and a sense of responsibility. A thoughtful reading of his work as an advocate and a judge reveals that he has a consistent predisposition to favor corporations and the powerful over human beings and the powerless. To be sure, there is nothing inherently wrong when a corporation, or a landlord, or an employer or a President of the United States wins a case in a court of law. The system often works as it should even when it hands new victories to those who seldom lose at anything. But at this moment in the life of our Nation, it is vital that the next Justice of the Supreme Court be willing and able to elevate the rights of the people above the prevailing political view of the wealthiest and most powerful when the two are in conflict. I cannot conclude that Judge Gorsuch meets this standard. Therefore, I will oppose his nomination and I would urge my colleagues to do the same.  With that, I yield the floor.

10746,topic-id,866,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman  Mr.Speaker, the CBC has led the charge in proposing solutions for the underserved and disadvantaged communities throughout this country.  In his first remarks as President, Donald Trump claimed to champion this cause in his remarks, which proved to be petty and beneath the Office of President of the United On day one, in his first official acts in the office, one of his first official acts was to remove from the whitehouse.gov Web site a page detailing a broad set of civil rights commitments and accomplishments under President  It is fitting that President Trump, as one of his very first actions in office, would take down the public pledge to defend the civil rights of all This is a continuation of the divisiveness that defined his campaign where he proposed a Muslim ban, mass deportation, and a nationwide stop-and-frisk program. This is consistent with a President who would nominate Jeff Sessions, a man unanimously opposed by the civil rights community, as Attorney  President Trump didn't stop with changing the Web site. It has been reported that the Department of Justice is seeking to delay a hearing meant to focus on the relief required for Texas' discriminatory voter identification law. The U.Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled last year that the law had a discriminatory effect and that provisions must be made to allow those who lack the specific ID that the law requires be able to cast a vote. Every judge who has considered the Texas law found it discriminatory, but it still has been used in elections there.  Unfortunately, President Trump has given no indication that he is willing to stand up to protect the voting rights of all Since being elected, he has ignored proven instances of intentional voter suppression and chosen instead to spread alternative facts about voter fraud.  As one of its first substantive acts, the Trump administration suspended a mortgage insurance rate cut put in place by the Obama administration to give relief to homeowners. According to the Federal Housing Administration, the cut would have saved the average homeowner $500 this year. This reversal will make it more difficult for middle class Americans trying to purchase a home and eliminate relief for homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments.  According to the National Association of Realtors, this will prevent 30,000 to 40,000 new home buyers from purchasing homes in 2017. This move will disproportionately affect African American homeowners who are more likely than White homeowners to rely on FHA mortgage insurance.  Mr.Speaker, we know exactly who Donald Trump is and have an inkling about what he intends to do, but what we plan on doing is educating the President about the needs of underserved communities. So I will just take a moment to address a few of his points in his new deal for the African American community, which is truly a bad deal in terms of economic equality. It is a raw deal in terms of public education, and it is a hollow deal in terms of voting and civil rights.  On behalf of the caucus, the CBC, the Congressional Black Caucus, I would like to inform him that 39 percent of African Americans actually live in suburbs compared to 36 percent who live in inner cities. The remaining 25 percent live in small metropolitan areas or rural communities.  For more than 45 years, the Congressional Black Caucus has worked to improve conditions for African Americans from all walks of life. Collectively, our members represent 78 million Americans, 17 million of whom are African Our districts are rural as well as urban. Some of our members represent majority minority districts, while others do not.  Mr.Speaker, tonight you will hear from several members of the Congressional Black Caucus who will point to specific pieces of legislation that we have championed and that we have authored that would address many of the issues facing inner-city communities, facing poor communities, and facing communities all across this country no matter the race or makeup of those communities.  What I would like to reiterate and stress is the fact that we don't just talk about a problem, but we offer solutions. We have sent to you, Mr.[[Page H600]]President, a letter outlining all of the 10 points in your new deal with concrete solutions and legislation that we have authored that we think will go further and is a more comprehensive way of approaching the problems in those communities.  We also sent you another document that details more than your 10 issues, but highlights issues that are faced by American families all across this country and our policy proposals that will solve them. We would just encourage you to step out of the White House and to listen to people who have done this for a long time and who live in those communities and who have offered viable solutions.  So I would just say that we don't need more talk or more rhetoric. What we need is action, and we need action from 1600 We need action from the White House, and we would urge you to look at the proposals that we have that offer a better solution.

11013,topic-id,1044,"Mr.Speaker, I rise here tonight to raise a very serious and consequential issue that is taking place in our Nation's capital. Washington, D.C., our Federal city, the second hometown of every American, is just weeks away from implementing a deadly assisted suicide program.  The D.City Council recently passed a so-called Death With Dignity Act, which would allow adults who have been diagnosed with a terminal disease and who have been told they have 6 months or less to live to receive a prescription from their doctor to end their life. Six States, including California, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Montana, and Colorado, have already headed down this dangerous path.  I raise this issue tonight, Mr.Speaker, because our Founders gave Congress the power in the Constitution to ``exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever over such District'' that would become the seat of the Government of the United  As a result, this Congress has the opportunity to stop this law. I am grateful that my colleagues are here tonight to join me: Wenstrup, Mr.Jody Hice of Georgia, Harris, Hartzler, They are joining me tonight to speak in defense of patients who deserve protection, especially when dealing with the unimaginable difficulty of a terminal disease.  Like me, they are deeply troubled that in Washington, D.C., an alabaster city that gleams as a beacon for the principles on which we were founded, this policy is about to be put in place, jeopardizing the lives of the most vulnerable among us.  Mr.Speaker, Washington, D.C., is, indeed, a remarkable city. I still remember coming to this special place as a 10-year-old child with my parents, coming down the George Washington Parkway in Virginia, as millions of other tourists have, with excitement to see our national monuments and the Capitol in which I now speak.  We Americans approach this city with awe, as we know how Washington is intertwined with our Nation's history and that this city both guards our Nation's founding documents--the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution--and hosts the very government that our Constitution envisioned. Those founding documents frame a Republic grounded in the principles of sovereignty in the people, subject to the protection of God-given inalienable rights, among them the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Nowhere, Mr.Speaker, in my opinion, is the view of this city more beautiful than from the hills of Arlington Cemetery in Virginia and, specifically, the resting place of our 35th President, John One cannot think of President Kennedy without thinking also of his inaugural address, which is a call to action for a new generation of That call was grounded in the exceptional nature of our land.                              {time}  1930  ``And yet,'' President Kennedy said, ``the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.''  D.C.'s assisted suicide law, Mr.Speaker, threatens the inalienable rights of vulnerable citizens. Not only does the new D.statute tear at the tapestry of our Nation's founding, it directly contradicts the Hippocratic oath every physician takes, to do no harm.  I shudder to think of the lives that will be lost because our society tells the weak, the despairing, the suffering, or the hopeless that suicide is the best option for them. Laws similar to the D.Death with Dignity Act in the U.and Europe have resulted in individuals being pressured to end their lives, and insurance companies covering the reimbursements for suicide treatment but not for other care.  If patients find themselves unable to pay for expensive treatments out-of-pocket, they may find their options severely limited when facing a new diagnosis, facing a disability, or struggling with mental illness. In some cases, death may become the only affordable option.  Proponents of physician-assisted suicide point to real and tragic stories of suffering individuals at the end of their lives. However, according to a report by the National Institutes of Health, pain is not the primary factor motivating patients to seek a lethal dose of medication. More commonly cited motivations include depression, hopelessness, and the loss of control or autonomy. Allowing physicians to prescribe lethal medications to these patients would mean we are abandoning our Nation's most vulnerable citizens and, instead, succumbing to a culture that is worse than the disease.  Instead of death and despair that are the underlying principles of assisted suicide, our laws should reflect a culture that promotes life and hope, even in our suffering, even in our illness, and even in our weakness.  Jeanette Hall of Oregon was diagnosed with cancer in the year 2000. She was a supporter of her State's assisted suicide program, and she even voted for it. She considered taking her own life with the help of her physician when she learned she only had 6 months to live. Thankfully, she had a life-affirming doctor who simply asked her how her son, who was attending the police academy at the time, would feel about it. This made her stop and think.  His question inspired her to opt for radiation and chemotherapy, instead of suicide, and, over a decade later, she is still sharing her testimony. She is extremely happy to still be alive.  I have no doubt that Americans like Jeanette with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or struggling with mental illness will be exploited under this law, and perhaps even encouraged to pursue suicide rather than continue living until natural death. This dangerous trend is already taking shape in the six States that have legalized physician-assisted suicide. Precious lives have already met a premature end.  Mr.Speaker, there is dignity in all human life, and the root meaning of dignity is worth. Nothing--not illness, not weakness, or despair--can decrease the worth of a human life. I cannot stand idly by and watch our laws corrupt our culture.  I am thankful to be joined by several of my colleagues who refuse to let this dark policy move forward unchecked. With that, I would like to yield to my colleague from Ohio (Mr.Wenstrup). Wenstrup is a physician.

I am tremendously excited to have him on the bench. Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has proven time and again that he is exceptionally qualified to serve on the Supreme He has been praised and endorsed by members on both sides of the political spectrum, the left and the right.  As a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006, after being unanimously confirmed by this body, Judge Gorsuch has proven he is as mainstream as they come. In fact, of the 800-plus opinions that he has written for the Tenth Circuit, less than 2 percent, or 14 opinions, have drawn dissents from his colleagues. In other words, 98 percent of his opinions have been unanimous. That is even more remarkable when you look at the makeup of the Tenth Circuit--12 of the judges were appointed by Democratic Presidents, while only 5 were appointed by It does not get much more mainstream than that.  During his confirmation hearings last month, Judge Gorsuch again proved that he is eminently qualified to serve on the bench of our Nation's highest Let me share some of his quotes from his hearing:  ``The Constitution doesn't change. The world around us changes.''  ``I don't believe in litmus tests for judges.''  ``If I'm confirmed, I will do all my powers permit, to be a faithful servant to the Constitution and laws of this great nation.''  One last quote:       As a judge now for more than a decade, I've watched my      colleagues spend long days worrying over cases. Sometimes the      answers we reach aren't the ones we personally prefer.      Sometimes the answers follow us home at night and keep us up.      But the answers we reach are always the ones we believe the      law requires. And for all its imperfections, I believe that      the rule of law in this nation truly is a wonder. And that      it's no wonder that it's the envy of the world.  It is clear that Judge Gorsuch is qualified to serve on the Supreme Court and that he understands the role of a judge: to interpret the law, not to make the law.  To that end, I would also like to highlight Judge Gorsuch's in-depth understanding of the separation of powers doctrine, and I am optimistic that Judge Gorsuch will carefully scrutinize cases and controversies that involve executive overreach.  The past 8 years have seen an unprecedented expansion of the administrative state. This has come at the expense of both the legislative branch, whose purpose is to make laws, and the judicial branch, whose purpose is to interpret the law and decide on a specific law's constitutionality. But more concerning than that, it has also come at the expense of American citizens.  Overreach by executive agencies has led to regulatory expansion that results in the Federal Government involving itself in nearly every facet of our lives on a daily basis. This expansion has been permitted, in part, to U.courts relying on the flawed Chevron doctrine to show great deference to agency interpretation of the laws passed by As a result, agencies have been able to broadly interpret laws in a way that has allowed them to expand their regulatory authority far beyond what Congress ever intended.  Fortunately, U.judges are beginning to question the Chevron doctrine and its impact on the separation of powers doctrine relied on by our Founding Fathers and affirmed in the U.Judge Gorsuch is one of those judges. Regarding Chevron, Judge Gorsuch has written that Chevron seems to be no less than a judge-made doctrine for the abdication of the judicial duty that prevents American courts from fulfilling their constitutionally delegated duty--interpreting what the law actually intends.  Careful judicial scrutiny and interpretation of the law will allow courts to rein in agency actions that are inconsistent with the law and beyond the bounds of what Congress intended.  In his concurrence in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, Gorsuch argues that the Administrative Procedure Act vests in the courts the responsibility to ``interpret statutory provisions and overturn agency action inconsistent with those provisions'' and questions the idea that Congress ``intended to delegate away its legislative power to executive agencies.''  Judge Gorsuch takes his duty as a judge with the utmost seriousness. He seeks to interpret the law the way Congress intended, not in the way an executive agency wants it to be.  His careful and academic approach to judicial review is well-suited for our Nation's highest I am confident that Judge Gorsuch will respect and enforce the constitutionally affirmed separation of powers doctrine that in recent years has been diluted by executive agencies broadly interpreting laws, resulting in regulatory overreach. This has minimized the role of Congress in the legislative process. As a result, the voices of American citizens have also been minimized and replaced with unelected Washington bureaucrats who think they know what is best for all  Judge Gorsuch is one of the finest judges our Nation has to offer. The knowledge and careful deliberation he will bring to the Court will result in rulings that reflect justice, fairness, and an interpretation of what the law is and what Congress intended it to be, not what administrative agencies want it to be.  Despite impeccable credentials, we are in a situation today because of a precedent set in November 2013 by then-Majority Leader Harry Reid and his conference. Former Leader Reid's use of a so-called nuclear option in 2013 meant the Senate could reinterpret its rules via simple-majority vote. Former[[Page S2317]]Leader Reid accomplished this by challenging a ruling of the Chair with regard to the number of votes needed to end debate on certain nominations.  The Standing Rules of the Senate require the support of a supermajority, or 67 percent of Senators, to change the rules. To challenge the ruling of the Chair, Reid only needed a majority vote to overturn the Presiding Officer's correct interpretation of the written rule. In other words, Former Leader Reid broke the rules to change the rules and, by default, broke precedent to change the precedent moving forward as well.  Based on this new precedent set by Former Leader Reid, the Senate is likely to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court by a simple-majority vote. Because the Senate has always operated on precedent, we will likely follow this new precedent to approve Judge Gorsuch's nomination later this week.  When he is confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will make a tremendous addition to the Supreme His lifetime of defending the Constitution and applying the law as it was written provides clear evidence that he has the aptitude for this lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

10987,topic-id,970,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ObamaCare, on its seventh anniversary of being signed into law by our previous President, Barack  Looking back at what has happened to healthcare over the past 7 years, there isn't a whole lot of good news to report. Since that time, Americans have been hit with hundreds of billions in new taxes, healthcare costs have risen exponentially, and families have struggled with fewer options and reduced access to healthcare services.  Just in the last year, healthcare premiums have gone up 25 percent for the typical ObamaCare plan. That number is even higher in my home State of South Dakota where premiums have increased 37 percent. ObamaCare has also driven health insurance companies to completely leave the marketplace, leaving Americans with fewer insurance options. Again, I will use my own State as an example. Under ObamaCare, the number of companies offering insurance in the individual market in South Dakota has dropped from 13 to a mere 2 today. While this is unfortunate, we are better off than folks in Alaska, Alabama, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming, all of whom have no options at all, as only one insurer offers plans in those exchanges. This is also the case for more than 1,000 counties across the Nation, basically one-third of all the counties in total.  As a result of these skyrocketing costs and reduced options, the number of Americans enrolling in ObamaCare continues to drop dramatically. Projections continue to be millions fewer than predicted. Between 2016 and 2017, nearly a half-million fewer Americans signed up for the exchange. All of this has barely moved the number of uninsured South Dakotans between 2010, when ObamaCare was enacted, and today. So the health insurance market was crippled, premiums have skyrocketed for hard-working families, and our economy has suffered tremendously under the ACA, only to have the same number of insured and uninsured individuals in my home State as before we started.  Nationwide, Americans are rejecting ObamaCare in record numbers. We saw this rejection of ObamaCare repeatedly over the past 7 years, when the American people elected into office candidates who at least in part ran on the platform of repealing ObamaCare's higher taxes, fees, and penalties on businesses and investors have also taken a toll. Meanwhile, consumers who are facing higher premiums and deductibles have less to spend on goods and services. With one-sixth of our economy tied to healthcare, this has been detrimental to growth and to opportunity. It has also been easy to see how the healthcare industry has rejected ObamaCare over the past 7 years, with many insurers pulling out of the market and in other places the markets collapsing altogether. This limits competition and leaves little room in the healthcare industry, which is why ObamaCare is failing to control the cost of healthcare in our country. Cost control is a crucial component in providing truly affordable healthcare, and that begins with the elimination of ObamaCare's added bureaucracy and paperwork. We must get government out of the way and allow competitive markets to work once again, and that is what we are seeking to do with ObamaCare's replacement, which is expected to receive a vote in the House later today.  Since we started the process of repealing and replacing ObamaCare, my office has received a number of calls and emails from South Dakotans who have expressed concerns. I want to make it clear to them and to all Americans that during the period in which we transition away from ObamaCare and toward a more affordable, competitive system, we understand that the continuation of coverage is an essential component. We plan to include a number of items that are very important to the American public: guaranteed renewal of coverage, portability of coverage for those who change jobs or leave the workforce by retiring, and a ban on lifetime limits, because if you bought insurance, you shouldn't run out of insurance.  The provisions of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act which were included in ObamaCare should be included in our plans. There should be no exclusions on preexisting conditions if one maintains insurance from policy to policy, without lapses, and we should include provisions to allow children to remain on their families' plans until they are at least the age of 26.  We understand that there is a way to retain all of these positive provisions[[Page S1959]]which are vital to ensuring continued health insurance coverage for all American families who want it, while also providing a fair and open marketplace that provides a strong, healthy, competitive market. This, in turn, will bring affordable, efficient health insurance with innovative products that will actually help to control the cost of care. That is what the GOP alternative, while still far from perfect, is seeking to do. One thing we do know is that the end result will be better than  As a father and a grandfather, I understand how important it is to have access to affordable healthcare. No one should be priced out of healthcare coverage for one's family. But our current system is simply not working. After 7 years of ObamaCare, the American people are dealing with higher healthcare premiums, fewer options, more taxes, and reduced access to care. Health providers are struggling with more bureaucracy, with more time spent filling out paperwork instead of caring for patients, and being frustrated by ObamaCare's crippling new regulations.  As I have said from time to time, ObamaCare is a rapidly sinking ship, and there is simply no hope for a recovery. On its seventh anniversary, it is hurting more people than it is helping, and it must be repealed and replaced before it totally crumbles under its own weight.  I yield the floor.

11048,topic-id,529,"Mr.President, I rise today to commemorate the life and legacy of Clint Roberts, who passed away in the early morning hours of February 13 at the age of 82.  Clint is a former Member of the U.House of Representatives, the South Dakota State Senate, and a former South Dakota secretary of agriculture. He helped give birth to the Conservation Reserve and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, which have been extremely beneficial to farmers, ranchers, and landowners, not only in South Dakota but across the country. These programs helped increase farm and ranch family incomes at a time of great economic turmoil.  But more importantly, Clint was a mentor and a hero to me and to many others and, I am proud to say, a lifelong friend to me and I have always looked up to Clint and sought him out for advice.  I first met Clint when I was an intern in the South Dakota State Senate in 1976. He was serving in a leadership position. He taught me many valuable lessons over the years about politics, policy, family, and public service, just to name a few. He also is credited with introducing me to that exquisite combination of water and Scotch over 40 years ago at the Kings Inn in  Clint grew up on a ranch near Presho, SD, in Lyman County, and never let go of his cowboy roots, his hat, or his boots. He was an iconic symbol of a cowboy and of the Wild West, so much so that he was one of the finalists to be the ``Marlboro Man'' in the mid-1970s. He also appeared in minor roles in films and even in a Super Bowl commercial.  But even off camera, he was a cowboy through and through. He was down to earth, a straight shooter, and a practical conservative who believed in freedom and helping those in need. He was also a problem-solver who fixed what was wrong instead of just talking about it.  He was one of the true conservationists in South Dakota, promoting wildlife and conservation on his operating farm and ranch. He taught many the importance of the CRP, or the Conservation Reserve Program, and preserving our natural resources. During pheasant hunting season, he always opened his ranch to hunters, and loved making his secret recipe for chili for all to enjoy. But most of all, he understood the importance of family. He was a great husband to Bev, a father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, and he was a great friend to all who knew him. He had a tremendously positive impact on the many thousands of people whom he met and touched with his kindness, selflessness, and generosity. South Dakota is truly a better State, and we are a better people because of his hard work and dedication to making things better.  With this, I welcome the opportunity to recognize and commemorate the life of this public servant and my friend, Clint We will treasure his legacy for years to come.  I yield the floor.

10808,topic-id,630,"Mr.President, yesterday the New York Times published a story about the nearly 100 Federal protections this administration has attacked. The article highlighted a few of the outcomes of these attacks. For example, telecommunication companies are no longer required to take reasonable measures to protect the Social Security numbers of their customers, and people with severe, disabling mental health issues are now able to buy guns--but do not worry because refugees from war-torn countries like Sudan won't be coming into our country anytime soon. Today, in about an hour, Republicans are going after yet another protection. This time, it is one that protects Americans who work for Federal contractors.  Up until a few years ago, companies that cut corners and saved money by treating their employees badly held a competitive advantage over law-abiding companies in competing for Federal contracts, so President Obama put a policy in place to take away that advantage. In 2015, he put a new protection in place so that the companies that had histories of unsafe working conditions would have to report those histories when they applied for Federal contracts. The idea here is pretty simple: If you want to work for the Federal Government, you need to follow the law, and if you do not, the government has a right to know so that the companies that cut corners do not have a competitive advantage by being able to bid more cheaply over those who play by the rules.  Republicans often claim to be in favor of leveling the playing field for businesses. After all, that was the rationale that was used last month when they voted so that coal companies were no longer responsible for cleaning up their own messes and oil companies could hide payments to foreign governments. Both of those actions were taken in the supposed spirit of caring about the ability of companies to compete. Business competition was placed above the rights of communities to clean air and clean water or the right of American consumers to know they are not supporting a dictator when they fill up at the fuel tank.  But now, when it comes to safe workplaces and pay discrimination, suddenly, having companies compete on a level playing field is not the priority. This just does not make sense to me. This policy was good for workers, good for taxpayers, and good for companies that play by the rules. We should all agree that companies that have good safety and wage records should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage, but the Republicans are giving Federal contractors a green light for pay discrimination and unsafe working conditions. That is the only signal we send by taking away this policy from the previous administration. This is yet another example of the empty words of an administration that claims to care about empowering women in the workplace.  Last week, the President signed two Executive orders that were designed to appear to promote women in the workplace, but when you look beyond the photo-op and the actual orders, they do not do a thing for women in the workplace. They do not put one Federal dollar toward advancing gender equality and gender equity. Now the Republicans are putting a bill on the floor and eventually on the President's desk that will make it easier for companies that discriminate against women in the workplace to get Federal dollars.  If this administration and if this Congress really care about making sure women do not face bias and discrimination, if they really care about businesses being able to compete on a level playing field, then why attack this protection?  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and vote to keep the fair pay and safe workplaces protection in place.  I yield the floor.

10826,topic-id,1585,"Madam President, when our country was founded, corporations were on the minds of no one. They are not mentioned in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, and when the topic finally came up to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Marshall called corporations a ``mere creature of the law.''  People have certain unalienable rights. Corporations do not. We established corporate personhood so that companies could raise capital and enter into contracts, but nobody ever thought that this term that was used--``personhood''--actually meant that corporations were people. They are not. It is not complicated. Corporations do not eat. They do not sleep. They do not worry about their children or their elderly parents. They do not get sick. They do not retire, and they do not have complex motivations. In fact, under the law, they have only one motivation, which is to maximize profits.  Any logical person knows that corporations are not people, but in Judge Gorsuch's America, they are.  There is no doubt that he is a very smart person, but he, actually, had a hand in creating this theory that corporations have the same rights as human beings--that they are, in fact, people. We are supposed to pretend that this premise is not insane, but it is crazy, and it is hurting our democracy. For the past several decades, we have increasingly limited people's rights in favor of corporate rights.  Now Republicans want us to confirm a judge who says that corporations have religious rights. Judge Gorsuch was a part of the Hobby Lobby decision that went before the Supreme Court, in which the Tenth Circuit decided that corporate personhood extends to First Amendment religious rights, and because the corporation itself--not just the people who own it--has been granted those rights by judges like Neil Gorsuch, the rights of corporations now usurp the health and the rights of American citizens. That is the problem with Judge Gorsuch's worldview.  It is not just that he is a conservative; it is that he actually thinks that corporate entities have the very same rights as American citizens--rights, by the way, that do not come with the same responsibilities that we all have as American citizens. Yet this judge wants to confer more rights onto corporations when we are already past the tipping point as a society when corporations have more power than people.  We are in the absurd position of asking: How far are these corporate rights going to extend? They have been given First Amendment rights. They have been given Fourth Amendment rights. Do they get the right to vote next? Do they get the right to keep and bear arms? How many more constitutional rights are we going to give to corporations before we say that enough is enough? We are already well beyond the point at which corporate interests beat out the individual, whether it is at the polls or in the workplace.  There are a lot of other things about Judge Gorsuch's worldview that I object to, but, at my core, I think I might be able to get around some of those things in knowing that the Constitution requires the Senate to advise and consent, not agree with. Yet his worldview regarding corporations as people embodies everything that is going wrong with our country and with the By the way, it is probably fair to say that almost every nominee whom we have seen this year embodies this worldview.  Time and again, Democrats in the Senate have raised the alarm about this administration's nominees, and we have been overruled. What is the result? You have Cabinet Secretaries destroying American diplomacy. You have Secretaries trying to ban Muslims from entering the United You have an EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, leaving a dangerous product on the market that has been proven by his own scientists to hurt children. Why? Because they prioritize corporate rights over people's rights.  The problem is this: Cabinet Secretaries come and go; Supreme Court[[Page S2312]]Justices do not. Let me put it this way: This administration's Cabinet is like a date. It is a really bad date, but at least it comes to an end. A Supreme Court Justice on the other hand is not a bad date; it is a marriage. It is a lifetime appointment that will have an impact on generations of  The fact that he is out of the mainstream is absolutely essential for us to consider. The fact that he thinks corporations are people is, in my mind, disqualifying--so disqualifying that I will vote no on cloture, and I will vote no on final confirmation if it comes to that, which brings me to the question of cloture.  When the Senate votes on cloture, the question before the Senate is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate should be brought to a close?  For the Supreme Court nominee, we have rules, and those rules say that you need 60 Senators to end debate--not 59, not 51, not 57. There are 59 Senators who do not get to decide when to end debate; 60 do. If you cannot get 60 votes to end debate, you do not have cloture.  After 2013, there is only one position--one appointed position that retains that 60-vote threshold, and that is the U.Supreme That is for a very straightforward reason. It is that we have decided as a body that the Supreme Court needs to have bipartisan support; that if a person cannot get 60 votes, you change the nominee, you do not change the rules.  We have decided that this position--this institution, the Court itself, the highest Court in the land--should be beyond our partisan disputes and differences. That is the foundation of the U.It is the way this place works. Without this rule, the reality will be grim. Without this rule, if you are a Member of the minority party, the President's nominees don't have to listen to you, meet with you, think about you. Without this rule, advice and consent is rendered meaningless for whichever party is out of power.  I have been here now 5 years, about 4\1/2\ years. Even in my short time here, the door swings both ways in Remember that today, this week, for the Republicans it might feel satisfying to use power maximally, to use the greatest authority possible under the U.Constitution, but without this rule, the Senate itself will be undermined by its own I have never seen any legislative body endeavor to diminish its own authority, and that is what is going to happen this week.  We can argue about how we got here. Was it in 1987 when the Senate rejected Robert Bork? Was it in 2013 when Leader Reid responded to historic obstructionism by eliminating most filibusters on nominees? Was it last year when Merrick Garland was not even given a hearing? We all have our talking points. At the end of the day, both sides own some of this mess. I am a I think it is 80/20. Republicans will think it is 80/20 on the other side. The general public may think it is 60/40 or 50/50. I am not sure that matters anymore. The question of who is at fault is not the most important question. The question is, What do we do next? Will the Senate undermine its own authority and strengthen the power of partisanship?  I would say this to my Republican colleagues: Think about what you are going to do next. Think about what this is going to mean the next time you are in the minority party, because it will not be Senators Duckworth and Cortez Masto who can't even get a meeting with a Supreme Court nominee, it will be you.  This is about the future of the Senate and the Supreme The nuclear option will mean nominees for the Supreme Court will not have to meet with or consider minority opinions. It will mean that the Senate's habit of being slow--sometimes maddeningly so, but we know it is in the best interests of the country--will go away for this appointment. That tradition allows the center to hold, and it will be undermined.  To my Republican colleagues, I am not asking you not to do this. I am asking you to take your time. In the world's greatest deliberative body, there is no reason to rush this decision. I am asking you to wait. I am asking you to take a few weeks before you decide to change the Senate forever. Take your time. This is probably one of the most consequential decisions you are going to make in the U.Senate because it is about the Senate itself. This is worth talking about. This is worth deliberating over. It is worth thinking over. Go home. Talk to your constituents. If you want to do this, you can do this anytime you want. You can do this the Monday we get back from our spring work period. For goodness' sake, there is no reason not to think about it for a little bit longer.  All we need are three Members of the Republican Party to go to their leader, publicly or privately, and say: We are not with you on nuclear yet; give us some time to try to save this important aspect of the Otherwise, you will make both the Supreme Court and the world's greatest deliberative body more extreme and more divided, and I believe you will regret it.

One of the most deeply disappointing realities in Washington today is that this support is becoming characterized as increasingly partisan. That is because--what happened was Republicans came out against one of President Obama's signature foreign policy achievements, the Iran nuclear deal.  That opposition came in the face of consensus among national security experts across the political spectrum, both here and in Israel, that this deal was good for the security of Ultimately, what happened is, it politicized our foreign policy in the Middle East to the point that what would have otherwise been a bipartisan vote for a bipartisan consensus Ambassador to the country of Israel from the United States, will now be confirmed along mostly party lines.

I support every penny that goes to I think it is critical that the country maintains its qualitative military edge in the region, and I take a backseat to no one in my personal or professional passion for the United States-Israel relationship.  That is why I cannot support Mr.Friedman's nomination to be the U.Ambassador to He has radical views. He has made outrageous and offensive statements on a wide range of issues.  Here is a sampling of his past comments. Mr.Friedman has said that the State Department is anti-He has said that President Obama is an anti-He has said that the two-state solution solves a ``nonexistent problem.'' Mr.Friedman has called for Israeli citizens who are Arabs to be stripped of their civil rights. He has lobbed one of the worst words in Jewish history at large parts of the American Jewish community, calling them ``kapos,'' which is a term for the Jews who worked for the Nazis in concentration camps. These are more than just provocative statements by Mr.Friedman; they are lies.  For decades, the United States has stood firm as an honest broker of peace. We have said to both sides that they can trust us to help end this conflict, and that is based on the principle that the United States is passionate about peace in Israel but dispassionate about how we get there. Mr.Friedman is not objective about how we get there. On the contrary, he is very passionately for settlements, and he is very passionately against the two-state solution, which means he is basically against decades of bipartisan U.foreign policy.  Just a few months ago, the organization he led advertised that they have a new program that will train students to ``successfully delegitimize the notion of a two-state solution.'' This group is actively working to take the two-state solution off the table.  I understand that the Senate is not fully aligned on U.foreign policy when it comes to I understand we have our disagreements. We may disagree on whether a two-state solution is best, on where our Embassy should be located, and on how to approach the peace process, but there are some things we ought to be able to agree upon: that our Ambassador to Israel should not be more involved in Israel's politics than our own, that our Ambassador to Israel should not be so provocative that they wouldn't even be welcome at the negotiating table, and that our Ambassador should not be the kind of person who uses language to fuel violence, hate, and instability. That means we should be able to agree that our Ambassador to Israel cannot be Mr.Friedman.[[Page S1956]]  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no to support U.S.-Israel relations and reject Mr.Friedman's confirmation.

10820,topic-id,601,"Mr.President, first, I thank my colleague from Washington State who has been such a leader on issues like this, throughout this session of Congress and throughout her entire career.  I want to add a few comments on H.37, which I strongly oppose. More[[Page S1601]]than one in five Americans is employed by a company that has at least one Federal contract. Unfortunately, every year tens of thousands of workers are denied overtime wages, not paid fairly because of their gender or age, or have health and safety put at risk by corner-cutting contractors. Those contractors who obey the rules are put at a disadvantage by those who cut corners, and that is what this proposal that President Obama put into effect was supposed to curb. That was the rule.  What do we find President Trump and our Republican colleagues doing? Once again, favoring the special interests, Big Business, over the working people. As my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Warren, just said: ``This is a debate about whom Congress actually works for.'' The President tries to present himself as a populist favoring working people. That is in his speeches, but in all of his actions, just about every single one, when there is a special interest, a business interest at stake versus a worker interest, he sides with the special Big Business interests.  The President promised to be a champion for working people in his inaugural address. An hour later, he signed an Executive order making it harder for working people to get a mortgage. Last week, the President made a whole host of claims about what his government would do only 24 hours after releasing a budget blueprint that would take a meat ax to the Federal agencies he was talking about. He had this beautifully sympathetic moment about medical research, and his budget is going to slash it. He talked about education as a major issue in His budget will slash that.  Again, less than a week after another populist speech to Congress, the President is doing exactly the opposite of what he said he was going to do--stick up for working men and women--by signing this resolution. President Trump promised: I will deliver better wages for the working class. Well, President Trump, more than 300,000 workers have been victims of wage-related labor violations while working under Federal contracts during the last decade. Are you now going to sign a bill, President Trump, that would make it easier for recidivist Federal contractors to skirt wage standards and hurt their workers? It sounds like it to me. This administration's hypocrisy knows no end. It is not populist. It is not for the working people, not in what they do.  In his joint address to Congress, the President said, he would ``ensure new parents have paid family leave.'' Now is he going to sign a bill that makes it easier for companies that violate family leave laws to win contracts from the Federal Government? If the President was true to his populist rhetoric, he would say this resolution is dead on arrival because it hurts the working people. But if past is prologue, he will not. He will think that his tough talk about standing up for the working class is enough to cloak a hard-right, pro-corporate, pro-elite agenda.  So I challenge the President: If Republicans pass this resolution, show some courage and veto it because you are not going to get away with constantly, constantly saying that you are in favor of working people and signing legislation that hurts them.

First, he has instinctively favored corporate interests over average[[Page S2326]]Second, he hasn't shown a scintilla of independence from President And third, Judge Gorsuch, based on his record and history, has a deeply held, far-right special interest judicial philosophy that is far out of the mainstream.

If that philosophy becomes the majority view on the Supreme Court, average Americans are in big, big trouble.  The prospect concerns almost every Democrat here in this body, enough to prevent cloture on Judge Gorsuch's nomination tomorrow.  This leaves the majority leader and my Republican friends with a choice: Break the rules of the Senate or sit down with us Democrats and the President to come up with a mainstream nominee who can earn enough bipartisan support to pass the  We Democrats believe the answer isn't to change the rules; it is to change the nominee, as Presidents of both parties have done when a nominee fails to earn confirmation.

We believe they are more in the wrong. They believe we are more in the wrong. The game of pointing fingers and ``they started it'' can go back and back and back to the very founding of the  If my Republican friends think that they have to change the rules because this blame game has gotten so far out of hand that Democrats will never pass a Republican-nominated Supreme Court Justice, I would remind them of Justices Alito and Roberts, two conservatives who, nonetheless, passed the Senate, having met a 60-vote bar. That was during a pretty contentious time as well.  If my Republican friends think that what we Democrats did in 2013 was so wrong and that is the reason to break the rules, I would remind them that the only reason we changed the rules was because the Republican minority in the Senate had forced cloture petitions to be filed on more nominees under President Obama's first 5 years than in all the 225 years before him combined. They forced the majority leader to file more cloture petitions for President Obama's nominees than all the cloture petitions filed from George Washington through George  When we Democrats changed the rules, however, we purposefully left the 60-vote bar for the Supreme Court intact because we knew, as the Republicans know, that the Supreme Court is different. Justices on the Supreme Court don't simply apply the precedents of a higher court. They set the precedents. That is why Justices should be mainstream enough to garner substantial bipartisan support.  If the majority leader breaks the rules tomorrow--that is his choice--he would be forever unwinding that important principle, erasing the last shred of bipartisanship in the Senate confirmation process.  If my Republican friends think a filibuster on Judge Gorsuch is so wrong that they have cause to break the rules, I would remind them that almost every one of them lined up behind the majority leader when he vowed mere hours after the death of Justice Scalia that President Obama would not get to fill a Supreme Court seat, despite 11 months left in his That was much worse than a filibuster. Even my friend, the Republican Senator from Tennessee, called it ``audacious.'' But I think Representative Adam Schiff of California said it best: ``When McConnell deprived President Obama of a vote on Garland, it was a nuclear option. The rest is fallout.''  The fact is, the Republicans blocked Merrick Garland using the most unprecedented of maneuvers. Now we are likely to block Judge Gorsuch because we are insisting on a bar of 60 votes.  We think a 60-vote bar is far more in keeping with tradition than what the Republicans did to Merrick The majority leader himself has stipulated--this is Mitch McConnell's quote: ``In the Senate . . . it takes 60 votes on controversial matters.'' On the other hand, there is absolutely no precedent, rule, tradition, or custom that can justify what the Republicans did to Merrick Garland, none.  The two are not equivalent. Over the long history of partisan combat over judicial nominations, of course there is blame on both sides. We don't believe the blame should be equally shared between Republicans and  The Republican Party has been far more aggressive in employing new tactics and escalating old ones to fight the nominees of a President of the opposing party. The Republican Party has been far more aggressive in their selection of judicial candidates, picking judges who have an ideology closer to the conservative extremes of American politics, while Democrats have tended to select candidates closer to the center.  Keep this in mind: The last time a Republican-controlled Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic President was 1895.  Let me repeat that amazing fact. The last time a Republican-controlled Senate confirmed the Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic President was 1895.  So we can argue endlessly about where and with whom this all started. Was it the Bork nomination, which received a vote in a Democratic Senate, by the way? Or was it the obstruction of judges under President Clinton? Was it when Democrats blocked a few judges under President Bush or when Republicans forced Democrats to file more cloture petitions in 5 years of President Obama's Presidency than during all other Presidencies combined? Was it Judge Garland or Judge Gorsuch?  Wherever we place the starting point of this long, twilight battle over the judiciary, we are now approaching its end point. We are nearing the final hour, and the stakes are considerable.  After the cloture vote on Judge Gorsuch, Democrats will have been denied Merrick Garland due to tactics we felt were unfair and Republicans will have been denied Judge Gorsuch because of tactics they think are unfair. Our two parties have traded bitter blows. In the tortured history of the Scalia vacancy, the debate has been saturated with contradiction. But in a very real sense, even though each side thinks their side is more right than the other, neither side is happy with how we got here.  Now we are standing on the brink of an irrevocable change to the way this body conducts business. As the majority leader once said: Changing the rules is a bell that is very hard to unring.  As the clock ticks steadily toward tomorrow, what are we going to do? I, for one, would like to see us step back from the brink. As the Democratic leader, I still hope that I can sit down with the Republican leader and find a way out of this pernicious cycle. I believe that as leaders of our respective caucuses, it is at least up to us to try for the sake of the The Republican leader and I disagree on a great many things, but we agree upon the importance of the Senate in American life. We can decide today to commit to solving this problem. Each side can stop pointing fingers. Each side can lay down their arms. Each side can put aside the resentments built up after years of trench warfare on nominees. We can decide today to talk about a way out of this impasse instead of changing the rules.  We both lost Supreme Court nominees. We shouldn't also lose a longstanding rule of the Senate that encourages our two parties to work together to fulfill one of the Senate's most important functions.  So the option to sit down with us Democrats and talk about a new nominee who can gain sufficient bipartisan[[Page S2327]]support remains on the table right now. I hope my friend the Republican leader thinks about where we are headed and takes a moment to let reason and prudence prevail over rancor and haste.  Just as the majority leader holds the power to exercise the nuclear option, he also has the power to avoid it. If the majority leader is willing to cooperate in a bipartisan way, if he is willing to sit down with us in good faith and try to find a way out, he will find an open door and an open mind, and maybe, maybe we can for the moment avoid an outcome that no Senator from either side wants to see.

10853,topic-id,1009,"Mr.President, we heard famously that elections have consequences, and over the next few days we will have an experiment in what I call ``the physics of politics.''  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the Democrats use for the first time a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, we will have an equal and opposite reaction. An unprecedented action is going to evoke an unprecedented reaction.  Neil Gorsuch deserves to be confirmed, and I want to share for the next few minutes why. For more than 2 months since the nomination was first announced, we have seen that Judge Neil Gorsuch possesses the qualifications and the temperament to serve as our next Supreme Court  While all nominations carry enormous responsibility, this is arguably the most important position we are tasked with filling. We need someone who is extraordinarily qualified, someone who will respect the foundation of our country, someone who has the mental resilience to stay above the political fray. Some of my friends on the left have called Judge Gorsuch unqualified, too conservative, and someone who is simply not in the judicial mainstream.  Judge Gorsuch started his legal career by earning degrees from not one, but two Ivy League schools--Columbia University for his undergrad, Harvard Law for his juris doctor, graduating cum laude. Even as a Marshall Scholar, he earned a doctorate degree from When one takes into account these extraordinary educational achievements, it would be simply incomprehensible that anyone would consider him unqualified.  His record on the bench is just as impressive. We have heard these numbers so many times that we sometimes just gloss or glaze over these numbers, but these numbers are powerful indicators of how successful he has been as a judge. Out of nearly 2,700 cases, Judge Gorsuch has been overruled only twice--98 percent of his opinions were unanimous, further proving that he falls exactly square in the judicial mainstream. He has received ``well qualified,'' as my Senator from Arkansas just stated a few minutes ago, from the American Bar Association, the highest rating available for a Supreme Court  Judge Gorsuch is also not new to the nomination process. Just a few years ago, in 2006, Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed by the U.Senate to the Tenth  Let me say that one more time because so seldom do we see the Senate acting in a unanimous fashion. This, perhaps, is a moment of reflection that Judge Gorsuch, in just 2006, received a unanimous vote for the Tenth Every single Democrat who was serving in the Senate at that time voted in support of Neil Gorsuch, including 12 Members who are still serving in this Chamber today. His bipartisan support has not stopped there.  Senator Bennet from Colorado says that Judge Gorsuch represents the best qualities of Colorado and that we need to fulfill our responsibility to this nominee.  Senator Donnelly, from Indiana, has said: ``I believe he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well respected among his peers.''  From West Virginia, Senator Manchin acknowledged that, while he may not agree with future decisions that will be made by Judge Gorsuch, he also said, without question, that he has ``not found any reason why this jurist should not be a Supreme Court Justice.''  Senator Heitkamp, from North Dakota, said, during her meeting with our Supreme Court nominee, that Judge Gorsuch reinforced the importance of a judiciary that remains independent from the executive and the legislative branches of government.  Neal Katyal, the former Acting Solicitor General under President Obama, said of Gorsuch that he is a first-rate intellect and a fair and decent man. The judge's work reflects his dedication to the rule of law.  Last month, throughout his 3-day confirmation hearing, Judge Gorsuch provided detailed and thoughtful responses that should have answered every concern from committee members. As I watched, I was incredibly impressed with his depth of knowledge, his genuine demeanor, and his obvious respect for the rule of law. He understands that his job is not to make the law. Let me repeat that because this seems to be an unusual experience--at least it has been for me--to hear that a judge understands and appreciates that his job is not to make the law, that his job is not to alter the law but, as he expressed time and again, that he is committed to interpreting the law as it is written.  One of his most memorable comments from his hearing has left a lasting impression on me, and I hope it does on you as well.  He said:       A judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a      bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those      the law compels.  In one sentence, Judge Gorsuch eloquently summarized what we should expect from our Supreme Court Justices, and it also gives insight into how he intends to serve once confirmed.  After his extensive and exhaustive hearing, we clearly see, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this man is more than qualified for the appointment. Any argument to the contrary is based purely on political opposition.  Today, the Senate stands on the verge of breaking historical precedence. We have let political disagreements get in the way of a judicial seat--a nomination that should stand far above political rancor.  A year ago, Judge Gorsuch was serving on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth He had no idea that he would find himself in the midst of a partisan battle. There is no question that this man has led an exemplary life and deserves a fair vote.  We are, simply, asking for a fair vote--a vote. Let us move past these political games and confirm a man who has earned this position, with a nearly flawless record, as one of the brightest judicial minds our country has to offer.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

11070,topic-id,421,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We have at least two different sides up here, and people are entitled to believe whatever they want to believe. I am entitled to the same opinion of myself, also.  There are also a set of answers and facts that need to be given, evidently, and that is, in fact, we do make changes in the bill to We do.  Mr.Speaker, the law, the way it was written, we have virtually few 30-year-olds to 45-year-olds that actually pay for ObamaCare, the people we were told who needed it the most. The reason why is because it was dictated from Washington how to rate the coverage. In rating that coverage, it became so illogically expensive for a young person to pay an astronomical amount for their insurance, and even many times a higher value for their deductible, to where 30-year-olds, 35-year-olds, 36-year-olds, 37-year-olds chose simply not to take the policy offered.  So what do Republicans do? It is real simple. Here is what Republicans do: They allow the States the flexibility to determine what might be called a rating.  And it is true that, now, people will be rated based upon their own actuarial experience of where they are in life, their age. Mr.Speaker, it is true that a 25-year-old, 30-year-old, 35-year-old needs less necessary intricate and expensive health care. And it is actuarially true that the older that we get--I celebrated my birthday yesterday. I get it. I am getting older, and I probably am a little more expensive at the doctor in things that I need, especially into my future.  So what we did is we said where you have that rating system, we will allow more money through the tax credit system to adjust that so that a 50- to 64-year-old will not be at a disadvantage because those, too, are the people we want in the healthcare plan.  So we are actually going to add, by making it actuarially sound and attractive, a whole bunch of younger people; and we are going to recognize this balance, and we are going to provide more of an incentive to balance out for those who are older. That makes sense.  It is also reality based, Mr.But to say that someone is going to be paying more without us recognizing that and doing something about it would not be a fair argument.

Mr.Speaker, even the American people cannot be fooled. The American people saw ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, waste billions of dollars simply to try and put together a computer system.  Mr.Speaker, the American people understand it was a tax bill. It is about using the IRS, and they were going to add 17,000 employees, literally, to beat the brains out of the American people to force them into having health care from  Mr.Speaker, no wonder Republicans won the majority several years ago. No wonder Republicans have saved the American people not only from the IRS, but from the massive taxes that were embedded within this huge government takeover of our healthcare system.

They have not yet built and grown these massive government organizations to the tune that they want to force the American people to do things.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, since the ACA was enacted, California's uninsured rate has dropped by 54 percent. Over 263,000 people have gained coverage in the three counties in my district. But now my Republican colleagues want us to pass a replacement bill that will strip away health care for 24 million  TrumpCare guts the Medicare program and creates a new, pre-broken system that rations health care for more than 76 million In my district alone, more than 64,000 people will lose coverage because of the provisions of the Republican replacement bill. It will take money away from our hospitals and eliminate 4,000 jobs in San Joaquin County alone. Working and middle class families will be forced to pay more for less. This will increase healthcare costs and decrease the quality of coverage available. Americans deserve access to quality healthcare coverage and health care that they can afford.

We debated aggressively, and, in fact, I see one of my colleagues from We spent 27\1/2\ hours dealing with our committee of jurisdiction's markup of the bill.  It has been a long time since ObamaCare was passed, 7 years, and those of us on our side said: Well, we didn't keep the insurance plan they said we were able to keep, we didn't get to keep the doctor that they promised we could have, we didn't save the $2,500 a month that was promised would be the savings if we passed  So I would argue, we have been very patient--7 years--and I think the public has been very patient.

Out of the 23 ObamaCare CO-OPs--I love co-ops. I am from rural We believe in co-ops. They are not-for-profits. Out of the 23 ObamaCare CO-OPs, 18 failed. It shows you it is not working: $53 billion in new regulation costs; 176 million hours of paperwork.  So what do we do? Republicans believe in transparency. We believe in markets. We believe in competition. We believe in what we are calling cooperative federalism: returning power to the  We are seeing that in part of the Medicaid proposals, allowing the engines of our country, the States--some have been very, very successful in reforming the Medicaid programs, providing first-dollar coverage, and some[[Page H2356]]have not.

One-size-fits-all, mandatory--you have to have one of only four plans--has destroyed the individual market.  So 7 years is too long to wait. I appreciate us moving aggressively.

I have a lot of respect for my colleague from Illinois, but let me just say to him that the Republican plan is not a rescue mission. It is a full-fledged attack on the middle class--a rescue plan for the rich, maybe, slamming the middle class with a tax hike.  Ripping away coverage and undermining Medicare is not a rescue mission, I assure you. I have seen the townhalls around the country. They want nothing to do with your rescue plan.  Rescuing something you sabotaged, offering Americans a plan that costs more and covers less, going after essential services--please, that is not what the American people want.  To my colleague from Texas, the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, he is assuring us that Republicans are huddled somewhere. Well, I have got news for him. I have been reading press reports that Republicans have canceled their 9 a.m. Conference meeting. As I understand it, one Republican Member told the reporter that that move ``tells me it's panic time.''                              {time}  0945  Another Republican source is quoted as saying: This is such a disaster. Representative Massie said: Frankly, it is not very well thought out.  So I don't think people are huddling. I think people are dispersed, and so it makes me even more wary about what we are going to see later today.  By the way, all we are asking is that we actually see the bill. We had a Rules Committee hearing yesterday on a bill that, quite frankly, will not be the bill we are going to consider later today or tomorrow or Saturday or Sunday or  We are talking about health care that affects millions and millions of people, and nobody in this Chamber has seen what we are going to vote on. This is ludicrous. How can this be? What are you thinking? Do this right. There is no rush. You don't get extra points for being fast.  When we read about some of the compromises that are being talked about--going after essential services that basically help the most vulnerable in this country, services like mental health treatment, treatments for opiate addiction, maternity care--essential benefits are being compromised or being taken away. So what will end up happening is you will get up and say: Yeah, we will sell you insurance. It will be cheap, but you get no coverage. Nothing is covered.  That is not what the American people want.

10868,topic-id,2262,"Mr.President, I, too, wish to spend some time talking about the confirmation and upcoming vote on Judge Neil As many of my colleagues have noted, this is certainly one of the most important responsibilities we have in this body--to confirm the next Supreme Court  As the Presiding Officer noted in remarks made a few days ago about Judge Gorsuch, he is an exceptionally well-qualified candidate for the U.Supreme I will go briefly into his bio.  First of all, he has a sterling academic reputation and credentials. He graduated from Columbia, Harvard, and He clerked for two Supreme Court He worked at the Justice Very importantly--and we are not hearing a lot about it from our colleagues on the other side--he was unanimously confirmed for a U.court of appeals job for the Tenth Circuit in 2006. Senators such as Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden all voted for him, as well as many of my colleagues in this body on the other side of the aisle who are still serving.  He is a westerner. We know that right now the U.Supreme Court, with the possible exception of Justice Kennedy, has no westerners. Geographical diversity on the Court is very important. This morning, my colleague Senator Murkowski talked about how the current Supreme Court is occupied by Justices who have spent almost their entire lives in the Boston, New York, DC corridor. That is not That doesn't represent the whole country. Judges in Western States focus on issues like Native-American law, lands issues, oil and gas issues. It is very important, certainly for my State of Alaska, to have a judge with that kind of background.  But it is more than facts on a page that make Judge Gorsuch such a strong candidate for the High During Senate Judiciary Committee hearings last week, his temperament was also tested and his judicial philosophy was articulated. It was clear during those hearings that Judge Gorsuch will bring a commitment to following the rule of law and that he believes no one, including the President of the United States, should be above the law. He reveres the separation of powers and the fundamental principle that it is the Congress of the United States, not the judiciary, that makes our laws.  He performed exceptionally well. He answered question after question with consistency and displayed a legal philosophy well within the mainstream of judicial thought within the United  As the Presiding Officer knows, it is not just Members of this body who are talking about Judge Gorsuch and how well qualified he is; commentators across the country have focused on how qualified Judge Gorsuch is to be our next Supreme Court Let me highlight just a few of their quotes.  This is from an editorial from the Chicago Tribune:       Here is a judge who knows the law and knows the role of the      judiciary: He isn't on the bench to make law, he's there to      interpret it faithfully.       Neil Gorsuch should be confirmed.  The Detroit News:       After two days of often hostile hearings, Supreme Court      nominee Neil Gorsuch is proving himself an even-tempered,      deeply knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the      United States  The Denver Post said:       [Judge Gorsuch] possesses the fairness, independence and      open-mindedness necessary to make him a marvelous addition to      the Supreme  USA TODAY's editorial board declared: Gorsuch merits confirmation. This Supreme Court nominee is qualified within the broad judicial mainstream of  In fact, we looked to see if there was any major paper across the country or commentator who is opposed to Judge Gorsuch's nomination. It was hard to find any. It was hard to find any in any part of the country. Two former chief justices of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals--both appointed by different Presidents of different parties--stated that Judge Gorsuch ``represents the best of the judicial tradition in our country.''  Even one board member of the liberal American Constitutional Society who said he supports Democratic candidates and progressive causes declared: ``There is no principled reason to vote no on Judge Gorsuch's confirmation.''  He received the highest rating from the American Bar And it is not just the ABA, there is a long list of different groups across the country, many representing minority groups in America, who have supported Judge Gorsuch--the National Congress of American Indians, the Native American Rights Fund, the Hispanic Leadership Fund, the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Tribes in The list goes on and on and on.  Given the broad-based support--from the left, from the right, from the center--why would my colleagues on the other side of the aisle threaten the traditions of this institution and not even allow an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch? Well, I have been listening. I have been listening to the speeches to see what they are saying. It seems that some of my colleagues are focused on this vague notion of vagueness--literally, vagueness. If we listen to their comments, they talk about Judge Gorsuch's supposed ambiguity, his vagueness, his evasiveness, that he won't answer questions on how he would rule on specific cases, so they are going to oppose him because of this. Well, these are curious and, to be frank, unconvincing reasons to oppose Judge  First, as we know, a nominee is typically not expected to say how he or she would rule on future cases. Judicial nominees, whether appointed by Democratic or Republican Presidents, have said this repeatedly. I will provide a quote from a prior nomination hearing by one of our current Supreme Court She stated:       Because I am and hope to continue to be a judge, it would      be wrong for me to say or to preview in this legislative      chamber how I would cast my vote on questions the Supreme      Court may be called upon to decide. Were I to rehearse here      what I would say and how I would reason on such questions, I      would be acting injudiciously.  That was what Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1993. She continued during her confirmation hearing:       A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts,      no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the      specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain      for the entire judicial process.  Many have called this the Ginsberg standard, one that Justices have followed in front of the Judiciary Committee during their confirmation hearings and one that Judge Gorsuch also followed. Indeed, during his hearing, Judge Gorsuch stated that if the President or others had asked such a specific question on how he would rule on a particular case, ``I would have walked out'' of the room.  So my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can't have it both ways. They say they want an independent voice on the Court, but they are also opposing Judge Gorsuch because he won't tell them how he would rule on certain cases. This is a new standard and an impossible standard to meet.  The second reason the vagueness standard of many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in their opposition to Judge Gorsuch is unconvincing is that it ignores the fact that this is a judge with a record. They say: He is vague. We are not sure what his views are.  Judge Gorsuch has decided roughly 2,700 cases, over 800 of which he authored. There is nothing vague about that. In 97 percent of the time in those cases, he reached a unanimous decision with the other panelists on the Tenth These are not vague decisions. His judicial philosophy and temperament are on full display in literally[[Page S2338]]tens of thousands of pages of decisions in his own words. There is nothing vague about them.  My colleagues can challenge him on his mountain of legal opinions, but please, with all due respect, let's drop the facade of opposing him because of vagueness, and that they don't know what the issues are is not an argument that has much merit.  So despite widespread acclaim from groups across the country, representing a broad spectrum of liberals and conservatives, and despite a tenured, concrete record as a judge on the U.court of appeals, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle appear to want to engage in a partisan filibuster of Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  What exactly does this mean? The language, I admit, can be confusing--cloture, filibuster, 60-vote threshold. In plain English, what is really going on? It means that the minority leader right now wants to prevent the Senate from having an up-or-down vote on the merits of this Supreme Court nominee. In other words, no vote ever on the qualifications of Judge We will just filibuster.  I have been watching a number of my colleagues come to the floor and talk about what they are planning on doing. The minority leader has essentially been saying: We all do this. We are all guilty. Nothing new here. This is just a little bit of payback. This is how this place operates.  In many ways, these arguments are almost cavalier in what they are about to do. But we shouldn't buy that. I have been in the Senate only 2 years--a mere blink of an eye compared to others--and I missed a lot of the other nominations and debates in 2013, the Gang of 14 many years ago. But I like to read a lot of history, and here are some facts that are important to understand as we debate the Gorsuch confirmation:  First, there has never been a partisan filibuster of a new President's nominee for the Supreme Court--never.  Second, it has been the custom, always, of the U.Senate to give a new President's nominee an up-or-down vote. For example, Republicans gave this courtesy to President Clinton when he nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 and Stephen Breyer in 1994 and President Obama with his first-term nominees, Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 and Elana Kagan in 2010. They all got up-or-down votes.  Third, there has never been a 60-vote requirement for any Justice on the Supreme Court during the confirmation process in the U.Senate--never.  Let me go through the votes of the current Supreme Court Justices: Justice Kennedy, 97 to 0; Justice Thomas, 52 to 48; Justice Ginsburg, 96 to 3; Justice Breyer, 87 to 9; Chief Justice Roberts, 78 to 22; Justice Alito, 58 to 42; Justice Sotomayor, 68 to 31; Justice Kagan, 63 to 37.  Incidentally, Justice Scalia, whom Judge Gorsuch would be replacing, passed the vote in the U.Senate 98 to 0. Note that two of the current members of the Supreme Court were confirmed by fewer than 60 votes.  Bottom line: There has never been a 60-vote requirement in the U.Senate or a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee during a President's first term--never.  Here is another fact equally as relevant to Judge Gorsuch's confirmation: More than any other President, more than any other Presidential election in recent memory, the one last year was clearly about the U.Supreme Republicans in the Senate and Candidate and now President Trump told the American people: There is an open seat on the U.Supreme This is an important issue. Let the people decide.  And they did. Polls show that millions of Americans ended up voting for President Trump and against Hillary Clinton based, at least in part, on which candidate they believed should nominate our next Supreme Court Justice and whether they wanted the Court to act as a superlegislature, interpreting a living Constitution, or whether they wanted a Justice in the mold of Justice Scalia, with a more modest view of how the Court should view its station in our constitutional order.  The American people, including my constituents, spoke loudly in November on this issue of the U.Supreme Court by voting against Hillary Clinton and for Donald And to his credit, President Trump kept his word on this important issue by putting forward an extremely well-qualified candidate who will be a worthy successor to Justice  Despite all this--an extremely well-qualified nominee and a national election that focused on who should fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court--it appears that the minority leader of the Senate is going to ignore the will of the American people and set a precedent dating back to our Nation's founding by leading a filibuster against Judge Neil We shouldn't allow this to happen, and we won't.  I hope my colleagues who are contemplating this will change their minds because in going forward with this filibuster, who are they really punishing? They are punishing the American people, as well as undermining the traditions of this body--a body with rules crafted carefully over the last two centuries.  As I mentioned, we need to work together in this body. In my 2 years in the Senate, I have tried hard to work with my colleagues on bipartisan issues. I have also tried hard to show all my colleagues the respect they deserve as duly elected Senators of this important body. Whatever the outcome of this vote on Judge Gorsuch, I certainly want to make clear that we need to continue respectfully working across the aisle for the sake of our Nation, and we need to rebuild trust in the But at the same time, I believe strongly that Judge Gorsuch deserves to get an up-or-down vote. I certainly encourage my colleagues to bring that vote forward and to confirm this exceptionally well-qualified candidate to be our next Supreme Court And the American people deserve as much, as well.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt,2290,ANNOUNCEMENT BY COMMITTEE ON RULES REGARDING AMENDMENT PROCESS FOR H.R.,2017.0,4.0,January

10859,topic-id,1644,"Thank you, Mr. We have many important responsibilities as U.We often have to make very difficult decisions. Deciding to vote against cloture and confirmation for Judge Gorsuch has been a tough decision.  Since coming to the Senate, I have been a strong advocate for reforming the rules, to curb abuses to ensure the body can function, and to make sure that the President's nominees are treated fairly. I believe our constitutional duty to provide advice and consent is one of the most important of all of our responsibilities as Senators, especially for nominees to our Nation's highest Court, and I believe that withholding consent should be rare--rare but not unheard of. Sometimes circumstances will be so extraordinary that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee is necessary. The gang of 14 knew this. That was the group of 14 Senators who forged a compromise in 2005. Three of them are still in the Their agreement allowed some controversial judicial nominees to be confirmed to appellate courts, but it also allowed the Senate to avoid triggering the nuclear option, and it addressed how they would weigh future nominations.  The gang of 14 agreed to the following: ``Nominees should be filibustered only under extraordinary circumstances and each signatory must use his or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether such circumstances exist.''  I think that is a good standard, to only filibuster a nominee under extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, in my evaluation of Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court, I can't think of more extraordinary circumstances.  First, this wasn't President Trump's seat to fill. Justice Scalia died on February 13, 2016. President Obama still had nearly 1 year at that point to serve in his term. So President Obama fulfilled his constitutional duty. He nominated one of the most qualified nominees in the history of the Court, Judge Merrick Shortly before Judge Garland was nominated, Senator Hatch, one of our most respected Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, said Judge Garland would be a great pick. Senator Hatch went on to say that President Obama ``probably won't do that because this appointment is about the election.'' But President Obama did do it. Judge Garland is not just a fine jurist, he is an exceptional human being. Judge Garland's lifelong commitment to public service is well known. He deserved far better treatment by the Senate majority.  Judge Garland was denied a hearing. Many of my Republican colleagues wouldn't even give him the courtesy of a meeting, and he never got a vote, which was a disgrace. It is an injustice that needs to be remedied before I could ever consider voting for Judge  President Trump could fix this. He could make a commitment to nominate Judge Garland to the next vacant seat on the It would be the right thing to do. I have been very open that I believe the Senate has become dysfunctional, but what the majority did last year was unprecedented. Things went from bad to rock bottom.  Being senatorial used to mean something. The Republican majority has shattered that tradition for purely partisan reasons. In fact, the majority leader has publicly stated: ``One of my proudest moments was when I told Obama `you will not fill this Supreme Court vacancy.''' That is a violation of the U.Constitution's requirement that the Senate provide advice and consent.  Now, in 2017, Senator McConnell has guaranteed Judge Gorsuch's confirmation, even before he had his hearing. For him the outcome has been a foregone conclusion. So we see there is no advice and consent now, either, just the exercise of power to block a nominee from another party. But President Trump could help heal that deeply partisan wound inflicted by his party. There is still time for both sides to come together and work out an agreement with bipartisanship and fairness first, and put aside the bitter partisan fighting that has divided the Congress and our  There is also a pragmatic reason for President Trump to appoint Judge Garland to the next seat. President Trump needs to ask himself if he wants to be subject to the McConnell precedent. Is he willing to accept that he only gets to appoint Justices for 3 years? If a Supreme Court vacancy occurs in 2020, does President Trump understand that it is not his vacancy to fill? That is the absurd standard that Leader McConnell has established. If the Republican majority is dead-set on changing the rules to jam this nominee through after all that has happened, then we need to talk about this.  Perhaps the best thing to do in order to ensure the President understands the gravity of the Republicans' obstruction of his predecessor is to go ahead and put the McConnell rule in place for President Let's establish in our rule that President Trump only gets 3 years to appoint We can do this with a simple standing order. The majority leader believed President Obama should only have 3[[Page S2334]]years to appoint Justices, certainly the same standard must apply to President If the Republican majority thought that their policy in 2016 was good for President Obama, it should be good for President What is fair is fair.  I have a standing order drafted that would do that, and I hope an agreement can be reached to rectify the injustice that was done to Judge Garland, and I hope that Republicans will decide against using the nuclear option. But if that doesn't happen, I will call on the Senate to adopt this standing order so that President Trump was bound by the same restrictions as President  If we are going to change the rules tomorrow, then let's get the Republican majority on record. Are they prepared to hold President Trump to the same unjust standard as President Obama? We can find out.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the text of my standing order at the end of my remarks.  Unfortunately, Judge Garland's unacceptable treatment isn't the only concern that guides my decision to vote against Judge Like many things in the Trump administration, there is no shortage of extraordinary circumstances. Perhaps the most serious is the cloud of suspicion over his  U.intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian government interfered in the U.Presidential election and that it interfered to help Candidate There are unexplained ties between the President, his campaign staff, his associates, and Russian officials. People close to the President had meetings and telephone calls with Russian officials during the campaign and transition, and, most critically, the FBI and the Department of Justice are investigating whether the President and his associates coordinated or conspired with the Russian Government to interfere with the Presidential election. It is an investigation that began last July and is likely to continue for months.  If the President or his close advisers worked with Russia to help him win the U.election, do we really want to let him appoint a Justice to the Supreme Court, someone who could be on the Court for 30 years or more? There is no reason to rush this nomination.  Remember, Republicans had no problem letting Judge Garland's appointment languish for 293 days, and President Obama wasn't under investigation. Judge Gorsuch was nominated just 64 days ago. If Republicans had treated Judge Garland's nomination with the same expediency, he would have been confirmed last May when President Obama still had 8 months in office. The unacceptable treatment of Judge Garland and the investigation into Russia's influence in the election are reasons enough to vote against Judge  But there is one more critical issue: the nominee himself. I have met with Judge Gorsuch and followed the hearing in the Senate Judiciary I carefully studied his record, and based on all of this information, I can't support his confirmation. The Supreme Court changes people's lives. Its decisions stand for generations. It is essential that Justices understand not only how these issues impact our democracy but how they affect people's lives, and that they consider them free of ideology.  Our meeting and the Senate hearings were Judge Gorsuch's opportunity to convince me that he will be an independent mind on the He failed to answer questions that were critical for me--his position on the rights of working mothers, whether women can choose their own health care decisions, LGBTQ rights, and dark money in our elections, just to name a few. But what I found most troubling is that he failed to convince me that he would be an independent voice on the  In just the last couple of months, the President has taken constitutionally questionable actions affecting Muslim immigrants, freedom of speech, and religion. The FBI is investigating his campaign, and he faces scrutiny about whether his company is benefitting from his office. All of these issues could well come in front of and before the Supreme It is more important now than ever before that we have a neutral, clearminded Justice sitting on the bench. After carefully considering all these issues, I cannot support Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. It is not an easy decision, but I believe it is the right one for our country.

10980,topic-id,1217,"Mr.President, the Middle East poses some of the most difficult diplomatic challenges faced by our The region is troubled, unstable, sometimes dangerous. Conflicts span over centuries. Peace throughout the region seems distant and far away. And the problematic powers, like Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Russia, promote their own interests in the area, sometimes violently, and those interests are often contrary to ours.  The United States is deeply involved throughout the region. Israel is America's staunchest ally in the Middle East and one of our closest friends on the world stage. The United States has had and will continue to have a special relationship with Israel, and our country will continue to protect and aid Israel to help secure her survival.  I am a strong supporter of I believe that a qualitative military edge is necessary for the safety of Israel, and I have always voted to support military aid. I have also been a strong supporter of the two-state solution. A peaceful resolution between Israel and the Palestinian people would help heal the source of many of the insecurities facing Israel, but peace has eluded Israel and the Palestinians for decades. Mutual distrust runs deep. Tensions are high between Israel and many of its neighbors.  For all these reasons, the ambassadorship to Israel is one of the State Department's most important diplomatic posts and one of the most sensitive. Since Israel became a nation, the post has been held by 18 of some of our most experienced, skilled, and knowledgeable diplomats. The vast majority were career Foreign Service officers. Many served in both Republican and Democratic administrations. All had significant international and government experience prior to their appointment.  The Ambassador to Israel must be able to thread the needle between Israel and its neighbors. He or she needs to have the confidence, respect, and trust of powers throughout the region. He or she must be seen as an honest broker and have the temperament and finesse to defuse conflict while able to stand one's ground and have the capacity to find common interests and common ground.  However, with David Friedman, the President has put forth a nominee who has no diplomatic experience whatsoever, no government or international experience, who is known for his offensive statements toward Jewish groups and others with whom he disagrees, and who has repeatedly expressed extreme policy views--views antagonistic to any realistic peace process with the Mr.Friedman is not a seasoned diplomat; he is the President's bankruptcy lawyer. President Trump and Mr.Friedman clearly have a lot of experience with bankruptcy, but it is hard to think of a pair of personalities less suited to diplomacy in a volatile region.  Mr.Friedman has vocally opposed a two-state solution--a cornerstone of U.foreign policy for peace in the region since President Ronald He not only supports but has generously funded Israeli settlements--settlements long considered as an obstacle to peace by the United States and deemed illegal by much of the international community.  Mr.Friedman's intemperate remarks have been widely reported. He lashed out that liberal Jews ``suffer a cognitive disconnect in identifying good and evil.'' He said that the State Department has ``[a] hundred-year history of anti-Semitism'' and that President Obama is ``an anti-Semite.'' Most horrific, he said:       J-Street supporters . . . are far worse than kapos--Jews      who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps. . .      . They are just smug advocates of Israel's destruction      delivered from the comfort of their secure American sofas--     it's hard to imagine anyone worse.  Five former U.Ambassadors to Israel, serving under both Democratic and Republican administrations, called Mr.Friedman ``unqualified'' to assume the role of chief diplomat to  Twenty-nine Holocaust scholars objected to his ``kapo'' remarks. The historical record shows, they said, ``that kapos were Jews whom the Nazis forced, at the pain of death, to serve them in the concentration and extermination camps. . . . These Jews faced terrible dilemmas, but ultimately were made into unwilling tools of Nazi brutality. . . . To brand one's political opponents, members of one's own community, as kapos, merely for engaging in legitimate debate, is historically indefensible and is a deeply disturbing example of the abuse of the Holocaust and its victims for present political gain.''  A group of Holocaust survivors called his use of ``kapo''--and I quote a group of Holocaust survivors--``slanderous, insulting, irresponsible, cynical and immensely damaging to our people.''  More than 600 rabbis wrote that his remarks were ``the very antithesis of the diplomatic behavior Americans expect from their ambassadors.''  While Mr.Friedman apologized during his confirmation hearing for his abusive language, I don't believe it erases his past behavior and suddenly qualifies him for the job.  This post should be earned over time, through actions and words that demonstrate without question that the nominee has the right judgment, temperament, and skills. Mr.Friedman has not come close to demonstrating that. We should not risk confirming him to this important post. We have seen how distracting and destructive hotheadedness is at the seat of power.  During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Friedman also walked back his positions on a two-state solution and Israeli settlements, which prompted the committee chair to wryly ask him why he even wants the Ambassador position if he has to ``recant every single strong belief you've had.''  I am a strong supporter of I want to see the State of Israel prosperous and secure forever into the future. I believe in the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, to chart their own course and their destiny. I want to see peace between Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel and her neighbors. That is what the vast majority of Americans want. The United States has a strong national interest in securing this peace. The last thing we need is another active military conflict in the Middle East, which could draw in U.forces. That is why over 40 years U.policy has held that the only realistic path to peace is through a two-state solution. The Palestinians are entitled to a homeland. A two-state solution is the only viable path forward for  As Secretary Kerry said, ``If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic. It cannot be both.''  Given Mr.Friedman's past staunch support for a one-state solution and expansion of Israeli settlements, is he really ready and able to embrace and put forward opposing policy positions? Can he ever be viewed by the Palestinians and the international community as an honest broker?  I am under no illusion about how difficult it will be to achieve peace between Israel and the Many Presidents and able diplomats have tried and failed to achieve settlement. But the United States must continue to do its best to reach an accord. Above all, we should not make the current situation worse. We need a steady hand in the Middle  I am not convinced that Mr.Friedman is qualified for this job, with no diplomatic experience and a history of extreme positions and intemperate language. His contrition is too little, too late. I am worried that by ignoring these huge red flags with his nomination, we run the risk of a diplomatic incident that could needlessly increase risk of conflict in the region.

10748,topic-id,400,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands who is helping to lead tonight's Special Order hour.  I, again, want to highlight how President Trump's inaugural address served as a preview of what the African American community can expect over the next 4 years.  This past Friday, thousands of Americans from all over the country traveled to Washington, D.C., to witness the new President and what type of message he was going to deliver. Unfortunately, instead of starting his Presidency with a bold, new agenda that would benefit all Americans, what we heard was an inaugural address that reminded us that the America he wants to build will leave many of the constituents of those of us who serve as members of the Congressional Black Caucus behind.  In his speech, President Trump said that a nation exists to serve its citizens. But for far too many, a different reality exists. He also painted another grim picture of mothers and children trapped in poverty in inner cities and rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and crimes and gangs and drugs that have stolen the lives of too many and robbed the country of so much of its unrealized potential.  Those are problems that need to be addressed. I don't think that anybody will disagree with that. We need to make sure that our children have access to good public schools and good, quality education. We need to make sure that, as the nature of work changes in this country, people are ready to get those new jobs. We must make sure that we invest in our communities so that they prosper.  But yet, very little of what President Trump proposed would actually address the root cause of any of those problems. Not even his new deal for Black Americans provides real solutions for the problems that he outlined in his inaugural address. Instead, we see the same recycled, broken promises.  Since the creation of the Congressional Black Caucus, we have been fighting to uplift our communities. We have bold ideas to help transform the lives of those individuals that were mentioned and real ideas that can get going.  I thank the gentlewoman as we prepare to have other speakers from the Congressional Black Caucus share their remarks.  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH599.txt,2166,0915,2017.0,23.0,January

11094,topic-id,610,"Mr.Speaker, House Republicans are playing politics with millions of Americans' health care. Infact, if Republicans go forward with their plan to chaotically dismantle the Affordable Care Act, 30 million Americans will losehealth insurance. In New York State alone, 1.6 million of our neighbors, who gained coverage through ACA, will see their healthinsurance taken away; and 2.7 million New Yorkers who have enrolled in Medicaid could lose coverage.  But let us remember that this is not just about New In fact, the sad irony is that many of the Americans who willlose and be most devastated by repeal of this law are in red States and counties, the places that voted for President-electThose areas have high numbers of Americans on the Medicaid rolls. Already, States like Idaho, Nebraska, South Dakota, andGeorgia are putting Medicaid expansion on hold, waiting to see how action on the ACA plays out. That means half a millionAmericans will have to wait for health benefits.  But let's keep in mind that this is not just about Medicaid and it is not just about those who obtained coverage through theexchanges. What we need to remember is that all the elements of healthcare reform work together. If you start chipping away atone part of the system, you will see disasters in other parts of the market.  This is about the young person, just out of college, who can stay on their parents' insurance until they are 26, giving themtime to secure employment and coverage on their own. It is about patients with a preexisting condition who, until the ACA, werebarred[[Page H306]]from securing quality medical insurance. It is about women who have, time and again, faced gender discrimination inthe insurance market.  Just this past Saturday, New Yorkers in my district rallied together to oppose Republican plans to roll back the ACA andmake America sick again. We heard from our local hospitals and healthcare providers who talked about how they will be affectedby a dramatic surge in charity care. Nationally, healthcare providers could get stuck with $88 billion in 2019 alone and $1.1trillion from 2019 to 2028 in uncompensated care. This will strain resources and make it harder for them to provide care to alltheir patients.  And we heard from ordinary working people who have benefited from the ACA, people like Juana Alvarez, who was able, for thefirst time, to secure coverage for herself and her family through this law. We heard from Susan Maples, who told us she wouldnot have been able to start her own business without the health benefits afforded under These are the people Republicansare planning to harm with their irresponsible, chaotic, and destructive attack on our health system.  Now, let me also note this: The Republican slogan ``repeal and replace'' is a sham.  What are they going to replace the ACA with?  They have never--not once--put together a realistic, defensible plan to replace the The Republican plan is not repeal andreplace. It should be called ``repeal and displace'' because it will mean displacing millions of Americans from their healthcoverage.  So let's be clear. If you are voting to take away the ACA, you are voting to take away health care from millions. And forthose who do retain their employer-based coverage, you are voting to increase their premiums, as millions of healthy Americansare taken out of the insurance pool. This is a recipe for disaster. It is a plan to make America sick again, and it cannotstand.  I urge my colleagues to think about what you are doing. Think about going home and looking in the eyes of your constituentsand telling them you voted to take away their health coverage.

10807,topic-id,1238,"Madam President, the 115th Congress has now been in session for 2 months. Republicans control the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the White So what have they done so far with that power? Have they passed legislation to create jobs or increase wages for middle-class families? Have they proposed any plan to put Americans back to work fixing our roads, bridges, and other crumbling infrastructure? Have they done anything at all to help seniors who are struggling with high drug prices and other expenses? Not even close.  During his campaign, President Trump said over and over that he would stand up for workers. But so far, Republicans haven't voted on a single piece of legislation to help working families put food on the table, send their kids to college, or save a little money for retirement. No, they haven't helped families, but they have been busy.  With no hearings and barely any debate, Republicans have found a new tool, one that has been used successfully only once before in history, under the Congressional Review They have used it to kill basic protections for workers. No wonder they haven't wanted any headlines about the actual work they are getting done.  Senate Republicans want to repeal the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order. So instead of creating jobs or raising wages, they are trying to make it easier for companies that get big-time, taxpayer-funded government contracts to steal wages from their employees and injure their workers without admitting responsibility.  The American people spend around $500 billion every year on private companies that provide goods and services to the government. Those companies do everything from building battleships and fighter jets to serving snacks at national parks. It is big business. It is estimated that as many as one in five American workers works for a company with at least one Federal contract.  With so much taxpayer money on the line, it really matters that contractors are using it responsibly. While many contractors are good employers, others cut corners on safety or squeeze their workers on wages and benefits just to keep their corporate profits going up, and they break Federal labor laws to do so. Here are just two examples.  VT Halter Marine is a company that builds ships for the They have received $680 million in Federal contracts since 2009--taxpayer dollars that were supposed to be used to create good, safe jobs. Instead, VT Halter took a lot of shortcuts on worker safety, and now they have killed or injured multiple workers at their shipyards in  In 2012, a worker died after the lid of a 20-pound cast iron pot containing abrasive ship-cleaning liquid came loose and sheared away his face. Investigations showed that VT Halter had ignored safety requirements to show employees how to safely handle these pots.  In 2014, a crane collapsed at VT Halter, injuring five workers, including a crane operator, who lost part of his skull, is now blind, and requires 24-hour nursing care. That employee had repeatedly told his supervisors that the sensors on his crane were broken, but VT Halter kept him working, and now he is blind and needs full-time nursing care.  The list goes on and on. Each time, VT Halter ignored the law, workers got hurt or killed, and the company got a slap on the wrist and another top-dollar defense contract courtesy of the American taxpayer.  Contractors that cannot meet basic safety standards should not get a single dollar of taxpayer money, and the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order was the first step in making sure that this was the case.  Other Federal contractors have found other ways to take advantage of their workers and to boost profits. Federal contractors have been caught stealing wages from hundreds of thousands of workers. Right here in the Senate, the men and women who prepare the food in the cafeteria have had their wages stolen by the contractor that employs them. The Department of Labor just found out that hundreds of these hard-working employees together were owed more than $1 million in back wages. This case was right under our noses. There are countless more all across the country where the very companies that receive taxpayer money from the government are taking shortcuts, breaking the law, cheating their employees out of hard-earned wages, and driving working families into poverty.  Republicans in the House of Representatives have called this rule ``a solution in search of a problem,'' saying it would ``only hurt workers and small businesses,'' as if the deaths of those working for Federal contractors or the thefts of their wages was just business as usual and they didn't care. That position is parroted by the chamber of commerce, which calls the rule ``burdensome'' and ``unwarranted.''  My Republican colleagues and their buddies in the giant corporations that rely on huge Federal contracts to keep profits high want the American people to believe that by making it easier for companies that mistreat their workers to profit off of taxpayer dollars, somehow they are helping workers. That is just nuts.  Here is what the rule does: When a company wants a contract from the government that is worth more than $500,000, it has to disclose any judgments against it for violating labor laws for the preceding 3 years. The order also asks the Secretary of Labor to work with other agencies to come up with standards for assessing whether labor violations are serious, repeated, or willful.  If you are a company that does right by your workers, this rule will not affect you--not one bit. If you pay your workers fairly and keep them safe on the job, you won't even notice the new rule. It also does not stop companies from getting contracts if they have had just a few violations but have taken steps to remedy the problem, and it does not add one bit to the burden on smaller companies that bid on smaller contracts--again, not one bit.  So who gets hit by this rule? Who is it who is complaining? Who are the Republicans trying to protect? Massive corporations that repeatedly cut corners that put their employees' lives at risk or that steal their wages. This rule keeps the big corporations that are the biggest labor violators from getting the biggest contracts.[[Page S1597]]  Once again, this debate is about whom Congress actually works for. Does Washington work for the taxpayers, who want to see their hard-earned money spent responsibly? Do we work for the hard-working Americans, who want to be paid what they are promised and not have to put their lives at risk for a paycheck? Do we work for giant contractors that rake in enormous tax dollars and cannot even follow basic safety rules for American workers?  I came to Washington to stand with the men and women who go to work every day to build roads and bridges, to help communities recover from natural disasters, and to provide healthcare to our veterans. I think that is what we are here for. But the Republican majority wants to stand up for giant corporations that put workers at risk. They want to stand up against good, safe, well-paying jobs. That is their priority in the new If they succeed, it will be the American taxpayers and the American workers who quite literally pay the price.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Moran).

11014,topic-id,825,"I appreciate that, and I thank you for yielding and thank you for taking the charge on this this evening to share this message.  Mr.Speaker, first, do no harm. Do no harm. These are three short words, but, to physicians, they represent a sacred charge--three short words that now hang in the balance here in the District of Columbia after the D.Council passed the Death with Dignity Act legalizing physician-assisted suicide in the Nation's  In authorizing doctors to violate the Hippocratic oath of ``do no harm,'' physician-assisted suicide undermines a key safeguard that protects our Nation's most vulnerable citizens: the disabled, the sick, the poor--a key safeguard that helps to ensure our loved ones receive the best medical care when they need it the most.  Instead of simply providing end-of-life comfort and a potential for cure, D.C.'s new law is poised to do more harm than good. This act leaves patients unprotected, doctors unaccountable, and our most vulnerable citizens at risk of having fewer medical options at their disposal rather than having more. It is too broad. This act allows adults diagnosed with a terminal disease having less than 6 months to live to receive a prescription for medication to end their life on their own--alone.  There are concerns that the definition of ``terminal disease'' is too broad since most doctors will admit that accurately predicting life expectancy is almost impossible; and it is. There are many conditions such as diabetes or HIV--they are considered incurable or[[Page H999]]irreversible, and they are terminal if left untreated. There are many diseases that are terminal if left untreated, but curable if treated.  This bill fails to accurately protect patients from coercion or abuse. Despite the fact that depression is commonly associated with a patient seeking assisted suicide, D.C.'s legislation does not make screening for mental illness mandatory. It also has no safeguard against pressure that family members or heirs might exert on a patient to choose suicide.  It leaves doctors unaccountable. Compliance with the bill's limited safeguards is difficult to track because the bill directs doctors not to place the actual cause and manner of death on the death certificate. It doesn't say ``suicide.'' The report requirements in the bill are not subject to the Freedom of Information Perhaps most concerning of all, once the prescription for lethal medication is filled, oversight is nonexistent. There is no requirement to ensure that the prescription was used as intended.  This could limit care. Under the new law, patients may end up with fewer options, not more options. D.residents who are not able to pay for health care out of pocket may find their options limited when facing a new diagnosis, suffering from a chronic illness, facing a disability, or struggling with mental illness. For certain medical conditions, assisted suicide could become the cheapest option.  Ultimately, whatever its intentions, D.C.'s new law puts patients at risk and could limit their access to high-quality health care. It could limit their access to cures. It prioritizes cost over compassion, cost over care. We have weighed this legislation. We have looked at it seriously, and we find it very wanting. D.residents deserve better.  Twenty-two years ago, my sister was diagnosed with an incurable cancer, and she had very little time to live. She was, at one point, given the option of a bone marrow transparent, and her insurance said: It is experimental. We don't cover it.  We had to fight that, and we were going to do it anyway. It is 22 years later. She survived. She is doing well. She is married and has two children, but somebody was telling her: It is not worth it.  This affects people with disabilities. This affects the poor. This attitude reminds me of a comment from the movie, ``It's a Wonderful Life'' when Mr.Potter says to George Bailey: ``George, you're worth more dead than alive.'' That is not who we are, folks.  In this bill, there is no verification or validation that the prescription was taken as intended, for the person intended, or even taken at all. There is no witness necessary, no provider to address any complications that may occur when taking the medications, no assurance that it is not misused or used on someone else, and no actual cause of death is reported.  In this, they say: ``Actions taken in accordance with this act do not constitute suicide, assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide.'' Oh, really? Maybe they should look up the definitions of those words. The definition of homicide is the killing of one person by another whether intended or not. The definition of suicide is the act of taking one's own life voluntarily and intentionally.  This bill is bad for the people of D.This is bad for This is not who we are.

10874,topic-id,2155,"Mr.President, this is my 163rd ``Time to Wake Up'' speech. I persist in the hope that one day these little water drops will ultimately cut through the stone of fossil fuel intransigence.  Last week our new President, Donald Trump, announced an Executive order aiming to wipe out many of his predecessors' climate change measures. So I would like to take some time this evening to examine his Executive order--which is, in many respects, a sham--and show how very far away it is from the actual wishes of the American people.  So to set the scene, exactly as the big polluters wanted, the Trump Executive order purports to roll back climate protections. It seeks to change rules for how industry controls methane leaks from natural gas extraction and to lift a ban on new coal leases on our Federal lands. It signals an effort to unwind the Clean Power Plan, which has helped put us on track to sharply reduce carbon emissions over the next decade. Typical for this insider-friendly administration, it is a polluter's wish list, but terrible for the American people--sad, as the President would say.  President Trump promises that this will revitalize the coal industry, but it won't. Appalachian coal is being crushed in the market by Wyoming coal, and cheap natural gas is crushing both Appalachian coal and Wyoming coal, and ever-cheaper renewables are catching up on them all. So like so much of what this Oval Office does, this was political theatrics, not real policy.  The Clean Power Plan is going nowhere because America is not, despite Trump's best efforts, a banana republic. The administrative agencies that Trump directed to stop taking action on climate change are actually obliged to follow the law, and they will be held to the law. Under the Administrative Procedures Act, these agencies have to follow real facts, not conjure up ``alternative facts'' from the fever swamp of the Breitbart imagination. Their record and their decisions will be reviewed by courts--not ``so-called'' courts, real courts. Administrative agencies cannot make decisions that are, to use the standard of administrative law, arbitrary and capricious. This is an Oval Office that lives by being arbitrary and capricious, but administrative agencies cannot be, or their work will be thrown out in court.[[Page S2345]]  The question of carbon dioxide as a pollutant has been settled by the U.Supreme Even Administrator Pruitt seems to recognize the folly of trying to undo the EPA carbon dioxide endangerment finding. So we have, as a matter of law, a dangerous pollutant, and under the law, it must be regulated. So this performance of the Trump Show is a waste of time because ultimately lawyers and courts will give the law--the law--the final say.  Courts are actually pretty good places for addressing climate change. It is very hard for the lies that are at the heart of climate denial to withstand judicial scrutiny. Smelly conflicts of interest can be exposed, and administrators with those smelly conflicts can be removed or recused. Judges aren't supposed to be influenced by campaign contributions or political threats. The law, and real facts, not alternative facts, prevail.  In litigation like the cases in New York and Oregon, the fossil fuel industry will face discovery, testimony, and cross-examination. Lawyers and courts will ultimately force things back on track. In the meantime, this Trump show makes losers of the American people. The Clean Power Plan is a reasonable approach to confronting our carbon problem. It gives States flexibility, and it would save American families $85 a year on energy costs once fully implemented. Good luck making a better plan.  I represent Rhode Island, a downwind State prone to air pollution from out-of-State smokestacks. We are also a coastal State, where rising seas driven by climate change threaten our coastal towns. I am sure the Presiding Officer can sympathize with the risk to coastal communities as the sea levels rise.  Just this past week, our Providence Journal had a story that said there are seven water treatment plants that are in danger of inundation in a 100-year storm, which, of course, is becoming more and more likely each year. So for Rhode Island, reducing carbon pollution and other greenhouse gases is part of preserving the map of the State we love and protecting the health of our people.  We need EPA, because our State environmental agency can't regulate out-of-State pollution. That brings me to the man standing next to the President as he signed this order, EPA Administrator Scott He is a man who built his career raising money from the industry, and for years lent his badge of office to the industry-enabled legal assault on the Clean Power As you might imagine, he beamed as President Trump passed him the pen used to sign the Executive order.  Years ago, in Central and South America, fruit company puppets ruled banana republics. They wore ostentatious uniforms and enjoyed the trappings of power, but it was the fruit company backers who really called the shots. That is why banana republics are called banana republics. The fossil fuel industry is well on its way to try to turn America into a banana republic, but it won't work. It is a stain upon the Senate that Pruitt actually got through the Senate without ever having to disclose who funded his political dark money operation. That is a first. That is a first. The Republican majority would not have those questions answered because they were so eager to shove this fossil fuel operative into the Administrator's seat at Inconvenient questions like that wouldn't get answered in banana republics, either.  While fossil fuel interests have been calling the shots in Washington, the American people have been of an entirely different mind. Let me show several polls that have come out over the past few weeks documenting public concern about climate change.  The Gallup poll shown here found that 71 percent of the American people believe climate change is happening--71 percent. Seventy-one percent trust scientists that, in fact, climate change is happening; 68 percent believe that global warming is caused by human activities; 62 percent believe we are already feeling the effects of climate change in our lives; and 45 percent worry a great deal--worry a great deal--about global warming.  A recent poll indicates that climate change is the top worry for 66 percent of  Yale's program on Climate Change Communication recently launched an extensive interactive map. It was featured recently in the New York It shows that Americans all over the country overwhelmingly believe that climate change is real and support a variety of actions to address it. So let's start with what Americans believe. Seventy percent believe that global warming is happening, and 53 percent believe it is caused mostly by human activities. Most scientists think that global warming is happening--that is a near majority--and 71 percent trust scientists about global warming. That, by the way, compares to 9 percent of the Republican Senate caucus when we called a vote on the issue last So if we are looking for who is out of step here, it is the Republican Senate caucus that is very out of step with the public.  And when you go on to solutions, 82 percent of Americans want research into renewable energy sources; 75 percent want to regulate CO2 as a pollutant; and 69 percent want to set strict CO2 limits on existing coal-fired powerplants.  Actually, the Clean Power Plan was a good deal softer than strict CO2 limits, and even then, 69 percent of Americans support it, and 66 percent of Americans support requiring utilities to produce 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources.  So my colleagues from Republican States might think this data is representative of people living in their districts, that this is being biased by concern from blue Well, here is a State-by-State look. So these are all the The colors reflect the percentage of Americans who think that climate change is happening. The break point from blue to tan is the 50-percent break point. So in every single State in the Union, no matter how red, a majority of Americans understand that climate change is happening. How that 50 percent ends up being 9 percent on the Senate floor is a story that I have told in other speeches. But we will see that at 45 percent, it is just pale blue. There is not a bit of pale blue anywhere. The entire country is above 50 percent.  So the next item this allows us to look at is Americans who support funding for research into renewables. Now, the lowest color here is the kind of deep orange and that comes in at 75 percent. That is the lowest point of any State in wanting support funding for research into renewables--75 percent--and it goes all the way up into the 90s.  For renewable research in coal country, we see 82 percent support in Wyoming; 81 percent support in West Virginia; 79 percent support in Kentucky; and the same in the oil patch--79 percent of Texans support renewables. Despite this support, President Trump recently proposed massive cuts, showing once again that the Trump show is not the America show even in fossil fuel  The support for carbon dioxide limits on existing coal-fired plants is also widespread. In all 50 States--in all 435 red, blue, and purple congressional districts--there is majority support, every single place. So what did President Trump and the fossil fuel operative at EPA do in the face of this? Signed this silly Executive order purporting to undo the Clean Power  Yale's map allows us to do some interesting stuff. It is interactive, so we can zoom in. Let's take a quick zoom in Oklahoma, Administrator Pruitt's home  As we can see, in every congressional district, a majority of Oklahomans believe climate change is happening, trust climate scientists about climate change, support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and support setting strict carbon dioxide limits on existing coal-fired powerplants--even in  So who is Scott Pruitt representing? Because he is certainly not representing any State in the country, any congressional district in the country, certainly not representing Oklahoma or any congressional district in  Interestingly, not too long ago, President Trump and his children were on the same page as those majorities of Oklahomans and I have shown this before: In 2009, Donald, Ivanka, Donald Junior, and Eric Trump supported meaningful and effective measures--in an ad in the New York Times to fight climate change--calling[[Page S2346]]climate change ``scientifically irrefutable'' and warning that its consequences would be ``catastrophic and irreversible.'' So 7 years ago, the entire Trump family recognized that climate change was based on scientifically irrefutable evidence and had catastrophic irreversible consequences.  Despite the popularity of getting something done on climate change in every single congressional district in the country, we do nothing. What is up with that, if not politics--fossil fuel industry politics? The most voracious special interest in American politics, the fossil fuel industry, has captured the Trump show, installed its flunkies at the EPA, and hopes to unwind environmental and public health safeguards that the public supports.  So I have to keep asking the fossil fuel guys: How do you think this ends? Are you delusional enough to believe that you can defeat real science and ignore both the laws of nature and the will of the American people?  It is bonkers. It is political power run amuck.  We have a chance to push back a little bit. Scientists will be marching in Washington, DC, and around the country on April 22 to reject the phony-baloney alternative facts of President Please join them wherever you can. The following weekend, people from around the country are coming to DC--April 29--for the People's Climate I was in the People's Climate March in September 2014 with more than 400,000 other concerned Americans, and it was a heartening and energizing experience. So mark your calendars for April 22 and for April 29, and come to DC or to the satellite marches being held around the country.  As these maps have shown, you are not alone in seeking climate action. Every single congressional district in the country wants climate action. It is only the death grip of the fossil fuel industry on this building that prevents that from happening.  So help make these the last days of denial by this dirty industry and its rightwing climate denial fanatics. As days and months slip by, we lose precious time to address both the harm to Mother Earth of climate change and the harm to America of being made ridiculous around the world by our obeisance to the fossil fuel industry. We are supposed to be the city on the hill, not fossil fuel's banana republic.  It is time for America to begin leading again on climate. It is time to wake up.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Thank you for this opportunity to have this very important debate on a critical piece of legislation that has been a long time in the coming. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Representative Goodlatte, and Ranking Member Conyers for their work and leadership in shepherding this bill through the process and getting us to this moment on the floor today. I thank my colleague, Mr.Polis, for cosponsoring this legislation and working so tirelessly over the past few years.  I think we originally introduced this bill back in 2013, and it takes a while sometimes for a good idea to reach this point in Congress, Mr.Speaker, and this is an idea whose time has come. So I rise today to support these long overdue, bipartisan ideas in this legislation that will bring our digital privacy laws into the 21st century.  Mr.Speaker, the year was 1986. We can all try to think back where we were in 1986. I am sure Kentucky had a good basketball team back then. I know Kansas did. I was 10 years old, hoping to get a new Nintendo game console for Christmas so I could play Super Mario You could buy a ticket to see Top Gun for $2.75. In the tech world, 1986 marked the debut of the first laptop computer. It was 12 pounds. A mobile phone was the size of a small pet.  Mr.Speaker, it was also the year in which Congress passed the Electronic Communication Privacy Now, this law, at the time, there were only 10 million email users worldwide. Most of us probably didn't have email at that time. Most Americans didn't for sure. Now, today, 232 million Americans send an email at least once per month. The first text message wouldn't be sent for another 6 years, and now Americans send more than a billion texts each year.  Mr.Speaker, the times and technologies have changed, but the laws have not kept pace. Federal laws regarding how we treat and protect the privacy of digital communications have been unchanged since 1986 and, because of it, our digital content is not afforded the same Fourth Amendment protections as our paper documents on our desks in our home.  Now, the Fourth Amendment protects the ``right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.'' Yet when it comes to what is on Americans' cell phones, their home computers, what might be in the cloud, or on their business computer, whatever it is, our laws allow Federal agencies like the IRS, the SEC, or law enforcement to kick down their virtual doors and search an innocent American's private communications and data storage without a warrant, without probable cause or any type of due process.  Now, many Americans take great precautions to protect and store their digital communications on services[[Page H990]]like Dropbox, for example, or an iYet our Federal laws perversely treat that data storage as if somehow that data has been abandoned by its owner and, therefore, that data loses its constitutional protection.  Well, in 1986, Mr.Speaker, lawmakers believed within reason that individuals and families wouldn't store mass amounts of data online. They wouldn't leave their Gmail stored online. They might have their own servers, or they would delete the emails or delete the data.  Therefore, if an individual actually left information on a third-party storage, it was akin to that person leaving their documents in a garbage can at the end of their driveway, therefore, voiding its Fourth Amendment protections. Thus, that individual had no reasonable expectation of privacy in regards to that email under the Fourth  As we all know, virtually everyone now stores millions of emails and tons of gigabytes of data and other personal items on third-party servers. Those emails contain pictures and videos of our kids, our business transactions, our most sensitive information that the government shouldn't have access to without a warrant, without due process as required by the Constitution of the United  Establishing these privacy protections are critical for both ensuring that American's rights are protected, but also, Mr.Speaker, ensuring that companies that do business in America know that they can ensure their customers that if they store with them, they can protect it; that that information won't be intruded upon or searched and seized without due process of law, without their permission, without the government proving that they have a need for that information and protecting individuals' rights.  We ensure that cloud computer services are covered by the same warranty for content requirements and that all data is treated as if it is paper documents given our law modernization that is desperately needed.  In addition to updating our constitutional rights, these privacy protections do create business certainty, making sure consumers will be happy to continue to use cloud storage services.  Mr.Speaker, fundamentally, these changes in my bill codify the Sixth Circuit's decision in U.v. Warshak, which held that email content is protected by the Fourth A decision which, while important, needs to be enshrined in law as it only currently applies in the Sixth It must be applied nationwide.  Mr.Speaker, today we can cast a unifying vote in these divided times. We so desperately want to find points of bipartisanship and collegiality and to tell the American people that this Congress, this government is doing great things to help protect Americans' rights and to help modernize our laws in a way that is consistent with how we communicate today.  I thank my colleagues on the left side of the aisle for their strong work and strong support. This is a unifying bill. It passed the House last year 419-0. So it is the type of thing that is great policy coming out of the Judiciary I look forward to seeing it pass again on the floor later today.  So, Mr.Speaker, we can send a unifying vote and a unifying message to the American people today. We can dispel the myth that Congress doesn't work together, and we can send a strong message to the American people that their privacy matters.  I urge passage.  I reserve the balance of my time.
