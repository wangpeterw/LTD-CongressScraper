                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God most high, we know not what a day will bring forth--sorrow or 
joy--but our eyes are on You.
  Sustain our Senators in their work. Give them the wisdom to repay 
Your Grace with the currency of their gratitude. Lead them to bear the 
burdens of the marginalized and so fulfill the law of love.
  Lord, teach them anew the meaning of faith, hope, and love. Give them 
even tempers that can meet upsetting things with calm serenity.
  Lord, keep them from being ashamed of that which they should be proud 
and proud of that which they should be ashamed.
  We pray in Your powerful Name. Amen.
