           EXPRESSING HOPE FOR AN IMPROVED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM

  (Mr. CURTIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I realize that few policy topics are more 
tenuous and challenging than immigration reform, but I believe, before 
us now, is a unique window of opportunity that will allow us to solve 
some of these complex problems.
  We can make this a historic time for our country. As we come together 
to find solutions for more than 800,000 DREAMers, we need to take 
advantage of this moment to also address additional aspects of our 
broken immigration system. My hope is that Congress will pass a bill 
that provides certainty for DREAMers while also bringing meaningful 
improvements to our visa programs for seasonal workers and our highly 
skilled immigrants, along with providing resources for enhanced border 
security.
  We know that not every special interest group will get everything 
they want, but I believe, if we work together, we can give the American 
people exactly what they expect: an improved immigration system that we 
desperately need.
