                       BRAIN RESEARCH IS CRITICAL

  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Federal 
investment into brain research.
  Congress' commitment to fund basic brain-related research and 
scientific discovery is critical to developing our capabilities to 
treat over 1,000 diseases and disorders that directly or indirectly 
affect 100 million Americans every year. Estimates put the economic 
burden of these diseases at over $760 billion a year. Addiction, 
traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's, and other afflictions can only be 
overcome through increasing our understanding of how the brain works.
  Basic science is the foundation upon which all health advances are 
built. Federal agencies, such as the NIH, NSF, and DOD, are essential 
in advancement of brain research, as well as for so many scientific 
endeavors. Congress enacted the 21st Century Cures Act that provided 
support for a wide range of biomedical research efforts.
  I call upon my colleagues to stand with me in support of brain 
research into the new Congress. I also beseech my Republican colleagues 
to withdraw this terrible bill and work across the aisle to find a 
healthcare plan that will serve all Americans.
