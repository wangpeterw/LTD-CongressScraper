                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Thank You, Dear Lord, for giving us another day.
  As the difficult work of appropriations continues in the Congress, we 
ask Your blessing upon the Members and their staff who have done the 
detailed work to produce legislation for the government of our Nation. 
May their work be blessed with success to the benefit of all Americans.
  Continue to bless those who are recovering from hurricane destruction

[[Page H7323]]

and those fighting, still, the storms of wildfire that plague our 
Western States. Blanket those who fight to overcome these natural 
disasters with Your spirit of strength and endurance, and preserve them 
all from harm.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
