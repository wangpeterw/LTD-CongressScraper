                  TAX REFORM DELIVERING FOR AMERICANS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, I had the 
honor of being in Pittsburgh with President Trump to hear him speak 
about how tax reform is putting America back to work. We were at H&K 
Equipment, a company that is investing in itself at a rate of 50 
percent higher than last year thanks to tax reform.
  H&K credits the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for providing them with the 
ability to expense 100 percent of the investments they make in new 
construction and demolition equipment. That is tax reform right at work 
in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
  Of course, this is in addition to State College's AccuWeather giving 
year-end bonuses; Malvern's Meridian Bancorp increasing its minimum 
wage to $15 per hour, with an additional 20 percent added to the 2017 
bonuses; Allentown's American Bank giving employees $1,000 bonuses; and 
Pittsburgh's PNC Financial Services giving $1,000 bonuses to 47,500 of 
its nationwide employees, while increasing base wages, retirement 
program contributions, and its charitable giving.
  These are just a few stories. Tax reform is working, fair and simple.
