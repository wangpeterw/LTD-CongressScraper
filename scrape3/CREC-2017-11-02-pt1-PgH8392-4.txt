                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Kenneth Codner, Grace Baptist Church, Bellefonte, 
Pennsylvania, offered the following prayer:
  Heavenly Father, I am humbled to be able to stand before You on 
behalf of this assembly here today.
  Lord, we are sinners, deserving none of Your favor. But, Father, I 
come to You on the merit of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who 
washed me from my sins in His shed blood.
  Father, we are aware, more than any, of the bitter divisiveness 
throughout this room and across this Nation of ours. I know that this 
grieves Your heart, Father. I pray that we would repent of our sins, 
that You might forgive them and heal this land of ours.
  Father, I pray that You will work in the hearts of the Members of 
Congress, that they be willing to put aside their political expedience 
and partisan politics and personal agendas, that they would strive to 
do what is best for our Nation as a whole and uphold the Constitution 
which they avowed to uphold, that they would seek to do what is 
pleasing in Your sight, that they would seek Your will and wisdom for 
the decisions of this day and each and every day.
  I ask these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ, my Savior.
  Amen.
