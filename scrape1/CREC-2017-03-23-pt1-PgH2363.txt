                                 WATER

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, yesterday was World Water Day.
  When we are thirsty, we walk 3 feet to the nearest faucet or grab a 
bottle of water out of the refrigerator. Sadly, there are almost 800 
million people who lack access to clean drinking water.
  It is unacceptable that in the year 2017 there are women who are 
still forced to walk miles to obtain water from polluted rivers. These 
rivers are not clear springs. Instead, they are rivers infected with 
waste, parasites, and other insects.
  That is why my friend Representative Blumenauer and I filed and 
Congress passed the Senator Paul Simon Water for the World Act. It 
helps USAID focus on safe drinking water, better sanitation, hygiene in 
schools, and clinics in villages for poor people throughout the world.
  USAID's goal is to give 10 million people sustainable access to clean 
water by next year. They are well on their way to achieving this.
  Clean water saves lives, and Americans should be proud of what they 
are doing in helping people worldwide to have that clean water.
  And that is just the way it is.
