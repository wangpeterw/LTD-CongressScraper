2208,topic-id,182,"Mr.Speaker, small businesses are the economic engines of our economy.  There are over 800,000 small businesses in North Carolina, generating $800 million annually, accounting for half of all private sector employment in our State, and regularly creating more than 20,000 jobs a year.  We have seen a 38 percent increase in minority-owned businesses in the last decade, and across the U.S., 85 million people rely on 25 million small businesses for employment.  As vice ranking member of the Small Business Committee and ranking member on the Investigations, Oversight and Regulations Subcommittee, I recognize the impact that small businesses have on our communities. Lawmakers must continue to encourage innovation and support legislation that allows local companies to grow.  I am proud to introduce the Score Act of 2017 during the 54th annual National Small Business Week, legislation that authorizes the SCORE program, connecting experienced businessowners with budding entrepreneurs for advice and mentorship, and it ensures its funding for at least 3 years.  Small businesses make the American Dream possible, and I am committed to standing up and speaking out on their behalf.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgH3012-3.txt,2201,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,2.0,May
2343,topic-id,294,"Mr.Speaker, earlier this year, we watched President Donald Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan ram their healthcare bill through the House of Representatives before it even had a cost analysis.  It didn't take long for us to learn why. It will strip over 20 million Americans of affordable healthcare. It will drive up premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for older Americans by as much as 25 percent. It will allow insurance companies to discriminate against pregnant women, children, and seniors. And this is all so Donald Trump can give a tax break to his wealthiest friends.  Mr.Speaker, this healthcare bill will literally be a death sentence to some House Republicans had years--let me say that again--had years to come up with ways to make healthcare more affordable. But instead, they would rather pull the plug out from millions of families who put their healthcare in the hands of the insurance companies.  Since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, nearly 40,000 of my constituents have enrolled in Covered California, and nearly 200,000 in San Bernardino County, our residents, have been added to Medi-Cal following the ACA expansion. TrumpCare will end Medicaid and leave millions of Americans without coverage.  Children will be stripped of their coverage because their parents will fall into an income bracket that doesn't satisfy our This legislation isn't just bad, it is detestable. According to Donald Trump, it is even mean. Though, apparently, it doesn't matter how mean it is for middle class families as long as it gives tax breaks to his wealthy friends.  And now, Senate Republicans have taken a page out of the House Republican playbook and are writing their healthcare bill in secret. This is not how we govern. This is not what the American people expect.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5054-3.txt,2229,JOB FLEXIBILITY FOR WORKING FAMILIES,2017.0,22.0,May

When I was a kid, my father had a home next to the freeway, and I first thought it was a great place to live because it was conveniently by the freeway, and what I later learned about air pollution and smog and the ozone layer, I knew it was not a good thing. When I see kids in my district walk around with inhalers, it just breaks my heart.  Every day, many of my constituents, people of color and low income, are surrounded by oil refineries, major highways, and industrial activities. These activities generate ozone pollution, the key ingredient for smog. It is dangerous. It is deadly.  Since 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced the ozone in our air, protecting Americans against health problems, including asthma and heart attacks, shortness of breath, low birth weight, and premature death. Clean air is a good investment. The benefits of a[[Page H5952]]healthy environment pay off in worker productivity and longevity. Unhealthy people can't work or go to school, which is also a problem in my district where only 10 percent of students go on to college.  Oftentimes, it is a cycle. They are outside, they breathe in the dirty air, they get sick, they have asthma, they have to go to the doctor, and they miss school. That is only contributing to the low graduation rates that we are seeing happen in my district.  Smog is not only harmful to health, I think it is harmful especially in young children, in our seniors, and in some of our most vulnerable communities.  Over a third of the U.population lives in areas with unhealthy ozone levels--areas that would have to clean up the air under the new and improved 2015 ozone standards.  The ``Smoggy Skies Act'' is the latest in a series of congressional attempts to gut the Clean Air Act and block or delay lifesaving standards and protection.

2187,topic-id,1145,"Mr.President, I congratulate my colleague from Missouri for the excellent comments he made.  I bring to the floor a report that came out last evening, which is essentially the analysis that the Obama administration never wanted the American people to see, and it has to do with ObamaCare from 2013 to 2017. This report that the Obama administration would love to hide from the American people makes the point that my colleague from Missouri just made.  In those years, from 2013 to 2017, once ObamaCare came into place, premiums around the country in the States that are buying on the Federal ObamaCare exchange went up 105 percent on average--more than double. It more than doubled in 20 States, and it tripled in three States: Oklahoma, Alaska, and In Wyoming, it went up 107 percent in just 4 years. Tell me something else that has gone up by that price in our lives anywhere over that short period of time. Those are the numbers that are out today.  More than 7 years ago, the Washington Democrats wrote an enormously costly and complicated healthcare law. They forced it through the Senate, and they made lots of promises. They promised it would provide care for less money. They promised that you could keep your doctor and that you could keep your insurance. They promised that if you just allowed Washington to have more control, everything would be better for you. It hasn't worked out that way. These are the numbers we are looking at today, and it looks as if prices are going to go up again next year because of the mandates and the requirements of the Obama healthcare law.  In Connecticut, insurance companies say they want an average increase of about 24 percent; in Maryland, the average is 45 percent; and in Oregon, 17 percent. Americans are again facing double-digit increases in their ObamaCare premiums next year, just like this past year.  Some companies simply said: Hey, I am done. I am not going to sell anymore. It is just not worth it.  That is what Aetna has done--pulled out entirely. The thing that is so interesting about Aetna's decision is that they were one of the major cheerleaders early on back in the beginning of They said: Oh yeah, we want to do this. We want to sell insurance all around the country. Well, now they are pulling out of ObamaCare all across What that means for people at home is that they have fewer choices.  People living in two-thirds of the counties in this country--and in every county in my home State of Wyoming--are down to fewer and fewer choices. We have one choice of a carrier to buy from on the exchange in In two-thirds of the counties, people have only one or two choices. There are now places where people have no choices. Even if they get a subsidy under ObamaCare, there is no place they can use it, so it is useless to them.  The companies that remain--what are they doing to help try to control costs? Well, they are cutting back on access to doctors and to hospitals, as we just heard is the situation of the patient in  Democrats say that people have to buy the insurance anyway because they say they put a mandate on it. Americans, like it or not, you have to buy ObamaCare insurance. If you don't like it, we are going to fine you. That is what the Democrats said. Well, in spite of the mandate, 20 million Americans said ``No, thank you,'' and about 8 million paid a fine. Another 12 million got an exemption because there are actually 41 different ways you can get exempted from People realize it is not a good deal for them. They know ObamaCare has made insurance so expensive that it is not a good value for their hard-earned dollars.  It is astonishing to hear Democrats now say that basically the problem was that Washington didn't have enough control. We need more government control, they are saying. There are a number of Democrats who want a single-payer healthcare system. Some call[[Page S3121]]it Medicare for all. They can call it what they want--it means higher costs and more Washington control over the healthcare American families need.  The State of Vermont looked at this idea a couple of years ago. Even in this very small, very liberal State, they dropped the idea almost immediately. Why? Because they said it was too expensive.  That didn't stop other States from looking at it. Recently, this occurred in the State of Democrats in California recently offered a plan to have the State take control of all healthcare for everyone who lives there. Universal healthcare for all, they call it--doctor visits, hospitals, inpatient care, outpatient care, emergencies, dental, vision, mental health, nursing homes, everything, cradle to grave, universal health coverage.  So what do the stories in the California papers say about this? Well, they did a budget analysis. The budget office of the State of California did a budget analysis and said: What would such a thing cost? They came up with a cost of $400 billion a year. That sounds like a big number, but how do you put that in perspective? What else can you do? Four hundred billion dollars. So they said: Well, let's compare it to the budget of the entire State of The entire budget for the State of California today is $190 billion, so the cost of universal healthcare alone is twice the budget of the whole State of That includes teachers, firefighters, police, everything. They are proposing to spend twice the amount that they spend on everything on universal healthcare.  So what do the Democrats say? Well, we will just have to raise taxes. That is their answer to so much of everything. I guess they figure that hard-working families in California would need to pay these taxes every year--not just once but every year because that price tag is $400 billion each and every year.  Democrats have no good ideas on how to deal with this collapse of Republicans are offering real solutions. We are looking for ways to bring costs down, to give people more freedom, and to give people more control over their own healthcare. We are working to make sure people can get the care they need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost. We don't have that with  The Democrats are pushing the exact opposite approach. They are offering higher costs, higher taxes, more government control, more government say in your family's life.  ObamaCare has failed. Republicans are committed to finding long-term solutions to our Nation's healthcare needs.  Thank you. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

2204,topic-id,676,"Madam President, I want to take a moment to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the city of Cheyenne,  The city of Cheyenne is an irreplaceable catalyst in Wyoming's birth and development. Christened on July 4, 1867, Cheyenne was named after the Cheyenne Tribe found in the Dakota territory. As the population jumped from 400 to 3,000 and beyond, Cheyenne earned nickname ``The Magic City of the Plains'' in reference to how it seemingly sprouted overnight and kept[[Page S4299]]on growing. This unfettered momentum showed enough potential that in 1886, 4 years before Wyoming became the 44th State, the construction of a State capitol was approved in Among these barren plains, a wellspring of prosperity and opportunity was found for the independent, brave folks who were willing to work hard to build it. In that, Cheyenne's legacy perfectly captures Wyoming's spirit.  Cheyenne, WY, is a railroad town through and through. General Grenville Dodge, chief engineer for the Union Pacific Railroad, selected this dusty spot as a connecting point in the Nation's first transcontinental railroad. Thousands of men and their families came here to lay track up the Gangplank, the unique geography that allows a gradual grading from the plains to the Laramie Supply stores, banks, and dentists all sprang up in their wake to accommodate the booming town. Now, Interstate 80 runs alongside the Gangplank from Cheyenne to Laramie, where the climb from the plains to the mountains continues today. On March 3, 2006, the Cheyenne Train Depot become a national historic landmark, solidifying the railroads irremovable stitching in the fabric of Cheyenne, WY, and the rest of the  During Cheyenne's first fragile years, soldiers were stationed at Fort D.Russell to protect the railroad. The base was established on the same day as the city, and construction began in October 1867. It later became the F.Warren Air Force base that continues to be crucial to Cheyenne today. The base was expected to last 6 months, then to dry up along with the town itself as folks followed the train tracks to find more work. However, Cheyenne endured--and the base along with it. It became a permanent Army installation in 1884, and soon ramshackle wood housings were replaced with brick buildings. In 1930, it was renamed F.Warren Base by President Herbert Hoover to honor Wyoming's first Governor, Francis Emroy It was officially renamed F.Warren Air Force Base in 1949, making it the oldest continually active base in the Air Force system. The base is currently responsible for 15 missile alert facilities and 150 Minute Man III missiles and is known throughout Wyoming as a fixture in the Cheyenne community. The F.Warren Base and some 4,000 personnel on site continue to be a massively positive presence in the Cheyenne neighborhood, especially at Cheyenne Frontier  As with the F.Warren Air Force Base, there would be no Cheyenne without Cheyenne Frontier The first frontier day took place on September 13, 1897, kicked off with a parade led by Buffalo Bill This event started as the brainchild of passenger agent Frank Angier, hired by railroad officials to increase the number of passengers. This was following the devastation of the prosperous cattle trade by the blizzards of 1886 to 1887, which killed thousands of cattle and the businesses of their barons. Cheyenne needed a boost, and the Cheyenne Frontier Days became the perfect solution. The first rodeo was attended by 400 folks, and more and more have been coming back ever since. Today Frontier Days is the world's largest outdoor rodeo, while also boasting world famous musical acts. In 2016, 259,193 people attended the event to watch professional cowboys compete for over $1 million while enjoying the festive celebration of cowboy culture. This event symbolizes the western spirit that beats from within Cheyenne throughout the rest of  In honor of the 150th anniversary of Cheyenne, WY, I urge my esteemed colleagues to visit this ``Magic City'' themselves.

I stand proudly with them in celebrating this historical achievement.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgS4298-4.txt,1881,OZONE STANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,July

2457,topic-id,465,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would strike the language that weakens the definition of exceptional events for air quality monitoring data. We know that air quality monitoring data is incredibly important and that Americans value clean air.  I am a businessman, and it is axiomatic that we can't manage what we can't measure.  Just last month, The New England Journal of Medicine published a study that showed long-term exposure to air pollution increases mortality for all Americans, but particularly those that are self-identified as racial minorities or people with low incomes.  That is why the EPA is responsible for setting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS, for outdoor--ambient--air to protect our public health and the environment.  When States and the EPA identify areas that do not meet the standards, States prepare their own plans specifying how they will reach attainment in those areas.  States are currently allowed to exclude monitoring data for periods affected by exceptional events--exceptional events like forest fires or unusual weather conditions, volcanos or seismic activities. They can exclude this data from the measurements used to make designation decisions. This is appropriate and it makes sense.  I think volcanos are exceptional. But this bill changes the exceptions provision in dangerous ways. It changes the definition of what qualifies as exceptional. Instead of exceptional, call it routine. Stagnant air, high temperature, or a lack of precipitation are not exceptional events, but they would be considered exceptional by this bill.  We live in Washington, D.C., with a record number of days of high temperatures this summer already. But this fact shouldn't exempt D.from keeping accurate NAAQS data.  Pretending that a heat wave is exceptional or that bad air quality is not harmful to people's health doesn't make it so. Climate change, global warming, and more frequent heat waves are likely to be the reality of our Earth today. So weakening this definition means that, by default, over time, States will never need to be in compliance with the They can say it is an exceptional event.  So, frustratingly, by weakening this definition of exceptional events, we nullify the standards altogether.  None of us wants to see the disastrous smog events--think of China and India--erupt here in So by supporting this amendment, we keep our commitment to the American people to support clean air. We shouldn't weaken our definition of exceptional events to incorporate everyday air occurrences like heat waves.

Around here, climate change is pretty controversial. We seem to slowly be moving in the recognition that it is real, whether we believe that it is caused by man or not. However, one of the things that we see around the world with climate change is the ever-increasing frequency of droughts.  The existing language in the original bill says that droughts and lack of precipitation are not considered exceptional events. Certainly, if they weren't exceptional before, they are going to be even less exceptional as we move into the future.  I appreciated the debate on the last amendment from my friend, Mr.Tonko, where he talked about the EPA Administrator saying: May, may, may. Well, this is a case where the last thing we want to do is make something like a drought a typical event. It is not going to be exceptional in the years to come.  So, let's preserve these. The EPA Administrator will always have an opportunity in the case of a drought once every 100 years to say that is, in fact, exceptional.

2308,topic-id,341,"Mr.Chairman, first of all, I want to begin by thanking the committee for their hard work on this appropriations bill.  Every year, I come to this floor through the appropriations process to present amendments calling for 1 percent across-the-board cuts. So many years I have come down here to talk about how the spending continues to increase. Indeed, our budget does increase. But I have to tell you, the chairman and his team have done an incredible job this year.  The outlays that we see in this bill this year are $209 million--think about that--less than the budget authority from last year. That is significant, and it should be recognized and should be praised, because that is the type of work that we need to see.  Now, I do continue to present the 1 percent across-the-board amendment because we are facing a time in our Nation where 1 percent makes a difference, just as we are seeing from the good work that they have done.  Passing this amendment for the 1 percent across-the-board spending reduction would save us an additional $376 million. It is important to do because our Nation is facing $20 trillion in debt. Because of that, we have to ask ourselves: Is it important to spend some of the money that is being spent on programs that we see taking place in the Department of Energy?  It causes us to look at these programs and talk about priorities, where we should spend those precious dollars that are not Federal dollars. They are taxpayer dollars that are coming out of the pockets of hardworking men and women.  Indeed, we have, many times, quoted Admiral Mullins' comments from July 6, 2010, that the greatest threat to our Nation's security is our Nation's debt. Because of that, I recognize and applaud the good work that has been done, but I encourage support for my amendment and the continued honing and prioritizing of what takes the taxpayer money that is spent by this body.

2186,topic-id,1236,"Mr.President, I want to follow the comments made by the President pro tempore of the Senate--the Senator from Utah--talking about problems that people have and problems that grow every day with their future look at healthcare and what it may mean for their families.  This is a top-of-the-mind issue for families in Utah, or Missouri, where I am from, or Montana, where the Presiding Officer is from, or Anywhere in the country, anyone who is looking at this system and hoping to have a system they could rely on is finding that it is just not working. This is a plan that clearly has failed. It was a plan that gave all kinds of assurances, virtually none of which have been kept.  In our State today, we got some bad news in Missouri about what that health insurance exchange looks like next year. Blue Cross Blue Shield serves 30 counties in our Another Blue Cross-related group, Anthem, serves the rest of the But today, Blue Cross Blue Shield announced that it is going to pull out of the exchanges next year. Some 31,000 people in 25 counties around Kansas City will have no insurer at this moment who is willing to sell policies on the individual exchange. This is devastating news for those families--maybe they are already on their second or third insurance company in as many years--trying to wade through yet another individual plan that tells them what might or might not be covered. This is certainly a long way from the assurances that you would be able to keep your plan and you would be able to continue to see the doctors you like. It seems a long way from that pledge. Remember that pledge? If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. It didn't turn out to be that way at all.  In fact, in the five other counties that Blue Cross is leaving in our State--and I don't say this with any disrespect toward that nonprofit company--they are losing money. This system won't work, and that is why we are down from multiple companies willing to offer insurance in all kinds of counties around the country to now States, like Iowa, having no insurance company at all that will offer an individual policy anywhere.  In the five metropolitan counties in the Kansas area, they have three competitors this year in those five counties. Humana announced in February that they would be leaving next year. Blue Cross announced today that they would be leaving. So 5 metropolitan counties at this moment, at least, have only one company that will even offer[[Page S3120]]a policy, and 25 counties have no company that will offer a policy based on that announcement. If you only have one choice, do you really have any choices at all?  Under this plan, unless we go in a very different direction, the choice is to buy the policy or pay the penalty. This exchange that was promised where the average family would see their insurance costs go down $2,500 a year--this is as far from that promise as you could possibly get. Not only has your policy likely gone up more than $2,500, but your deductible has gone up in even higher percentages than that.  Certainly, 30 percent of the counties in America right now only have one company that will offer insurance. As I said earlier, our neighboring State to the north, Iowa, has no company that will offer insurance to anybody on the individual market. What kind of system is that?  In my State, we have 114 counties and the city of Louis in addition to those 114 counties. At this moment, 97 of them have only one company that will offer insurance. Unless things change dramatically, in January, 25 of those 97 will have no company that will offer insurance. Now, 77 counties--unless the one company offering insurance decides it can't participate in that market either--would have only one choice. I think it is likely that those 77 counties will see some change in whether they have one choice or no choice.  Last week, I came to the floor to talk about Missourians who have problems and who are seeing their out-of-pocket costs skyrocket under this. Let me share another story about one of the several people we heard from this week.  Holly is a cancer survivor. She lives in Southeast She was forced again this year to switch insurance policies when the insurance company she had left the individual exchange, the ObamaCare exchange. That left Holly with only one choice. Again, people in the vast majority of our counties have the same option--they have one option. Holly had one option, and that carrier didn't cover any of her four cancer doctors. Now, remember, this is a cancer survivor who literally has been in a fight for her life, and now she can't get a policy that allows her to see the doctors in whom, in that fight for her life, she developed confidence. So that means she can't see her oncologist under any policy she can get. She can't see the radiation oncologist, the surgical oncologist, and the reconstructive surgeon. None of those people are now available to her.  This is in a world where Holly, you, me--all of us were told: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Well, she liked all four of her doctors, and she can't keep any of those doctors. We were told: If you like your policy, you can keep your policy. If it weren't so serious, looking back at that promise, it would be like it was some cruel joke that somebody is coming up with that couldn't have been further from the truth. When you are battling cancer and you lose access to the doctors you know and trust, no reasonable person can argue to you that the system we have is working. The status quo is unacceptable. It is clearly unsustainable.  There is a lot of discussion about what kind of change we are going to have. The ``why'' here is more important than the ``how.'' The ``why'' here is the most important part of this debate because the reason we have to change is that the system we have is absolutely not working.  Americans like Holly and all the families in the Kansas City area who are certain to lose this year's coverage next year may or may not have coverage at all. No company besides this one company that left was willing to be there this year. They deserve better. That is why I am going to continue to work with my Senate colleagues to give families more choices to expand their access to the healthcare providers they want and the kind of insurance coverage they would like to have.  This plan simply hasn't worked, it isn't working, and it is going to get worse before it gets better. That is why we are debating how to change it, not debating the effort that has totally failed. Now we need to get in and figure out how to stabilize this marketplace and answer those important questions for families all over this country who not only don't have the coverage they want, but they also don't have access to the healthcare they need.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3111-2.txt,1464,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,24.0,June
2498,topic-id,1954,"Mr.President, this weekend we will mark the beginning of the Memorial Day remembrances that we do every year. Memorial Day, of course, is on Monday, but many activities will begin even today and tomorrow to honor those who have died in the defense of our country. These men and women had families, they had dreams for the future, and they had their whole lives ahead of them. But they did something extraordinary.  I remember that a few years ago I had the opportunity to be at the American cemetery in At the end of the tour of that cemetery, the guide had us sit down on a ledge with the English Channel to our back and those 8,000 graves in front of us that we had just looked at and had talked about the sacrifices made. Then he flipped open his computer and, at that exact same spot, on the 20th anniversary of the D-day, General Eisenhower--former President Eisenhower--in 1964 was talking to Walter He said to Walter Cronkite: You know, Walter, my son John graduated from West Point on D-day, and over the last 20 years, I have watched him and his wife raise their family and have the experiences they have had, and, he said, many times I have thought about these young men and the life they didn't get to lead because of what they were asked to do.  Particularly, you had the person sitting there 20 years later who ultimately was the person who asked them to do what they were asked to do, and you understand that that is the kind of decision he thought about. It is the kind of sacrifice we should think about as we think about those who didn't get to pursue their dreams and didn't get to see the family they had grown up with or have the family they would have liked to have had because they laid down their lives so that we could take care of our families, so that we could realize our dreams, so that we could enjoy the freedoms that our Nation is truly blessed with and that make us truly extraordinary in our belief and our defense of freedom, not only for ourselves but for people everywhere.  We are grateful for all that these people have done, and this is a time of year that we particularly set aside to honor those fallen heroes--the soldiers, the sailors, the airmen, the marines, the people in the National Guard and the Coast Guard and the Reserve--called up and losing their lives in that cause.  Also, it is good for us to remember those who served and who were willing to make that sacrifice, if necessary, and often have their own burdens they carry from their service. Maybe that burden was just simply losing those years when others were already at a civilian job that they would only be able to go to later.  I am honored to represent nearly 500,000 Missouri veterans. As a member of the bipartisan Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus, I am committed to helping our veterans find good-paying jobs as civilians. We took an important step in that direction recently when President Trump signed the Honoring Investment in Recruiting and Employing American Military Veterans Act, or the HIRE Vets I believe it may have been the first bill the Senate passed. I was pleased to be the principal sponsor of that bill, and it was the underlying bill on the continuing resolution that funded the government on April 17, and so it became law.  It addresses the fact that transferring from military to civilian life represents a number of challenges. It represents challenges for our servicemembers, and that transfer can be a difficult personal decision to make, but it is also difficult to navigate the civilian employment market and to find out who is recognizing the skills and the lessons learned by veterans and who may not be quite at the forefront of that.  The HIRE Vets Act helps to facilitate that transition by providing veterans more information on employers that offer benefits and opportunities geared toward hiring veterans. Many employers say they are veteran friendly, and many employers are veteran friendly, but there has really been no standard that anyone could look at to determine whether that was true or not--no standard for what employers aspire to do at their workplace or no standard that future veterans and employees can seek out.  This would be much like a LEED standard on energy efficiency. If you have that standard on your building or at your workplace, people know exactly what that means. This bill asks the Department of Labor to establish a similar kind of standard for those who are the best, for those who are nearly as good, and for those who are almost as good as them to see what people are doing--a tiered recognition of employers to see what they are doing to welcome, encourage, recognize, and promote veterans.  Some of the criteria that could go into that evaluation would include the percentage of new hires at your company who are veterans, the percentage of the overall workforce that is made up of veterans, what type of training and leadership activities are made available that are designed to maximize what a veteran uniquely has learned as a veteran, and what other benefits and resources are offered--things such as tuition assistance, things that encourage veterans to go ahead and get one other category of training or more.  Creating a national standard will help veterans narrow down their employment options and focus their job search efforts on the companies that recognize the value of their military service and what that value will bring to their new workplace, and also companies that will provide a long-term career path where those skills are used and appreciated. So this is a step in the right direction.  I have talked to the Secretary of Labor just this week, who said they intend to have this plan up and running by the end of this year, quicker than they were required to do but certainly not quicker than we hoped they would be able to do. So this is going to be a priority at the office of the Secretary of Labor, as veterans should be a priority for our society.  Today, we have the most powerful military in the world, but we really need to recognize--and I think we do recognize--that behind that military stands supporting families. Families are the backbone of the military today. They provide the kind of support that servicemembers need. They provide the encouragement for the difficult challenges of going from one post to another and one job to another. I think there are ways we can recognize those families and what they do in a better way.  I was able this year again to introduce the Military Family Stability Military families have changed over the years. Our military stays in service longer. The skill levels they acquire are more valuable than might have been the case in the past. As the military gets more technical, having invested the time and training on someone in service is a more significant investment than it may have been at another time. Our policies that affect military families haven't kept pace with our investment in people who are serving.  According to a study by the Military Officers Association of America, 90 percent of military spouses who are women are either unemployed or underemployed. More than half of those people cite concerns about their spouse's service as a deterrent to their prospective employers: having to leave quickly without notice, not getting the ability to transfer from one State to another, or when their training or licensing has happened in the State they were living in.  Too often, military spouses have to end up sacrificing their own career. I think, in any case, we would understand there is some sacrifice here when you are moving from place to place, but there doesn't need to be a needless sacrifice.  So the Military Family Stability Act would allow families to address a problem. I consistently hear from military spouses and people serving in the military who talk about the challenges[[Page S3200]]their spouses face in Missouri and across the  An ill-timed move takes a child needlessly out of school a month early or makes a child start a school year a month late or prevents a husband or wife from being able to commit to a 9-month teaching contract or start a graduate program on time because the move they had anticipated happening is delayed. I have had people come and testify on exactly those two specific things and others that made a big difference in their family and their family's enthusiasm about the service they were jointly giving to the country.  For many families, if you make that move early, the family has to absorb the move. I think there is a better way to do this. I think we can increase stability in military families. This bill enables the servicemember or family to either move early or remain at their current duty station for up to 6 months while the spouse or the serving parent begins a new assignment. Now, for that to happen--the spouse moving early to the new assignment--the servicemember moving early or staying a little bit later has to absorb their single serviceperson expenses for staying. But as to the much more significant expenses, the family goes at a reasonable time when it is better for the family to go.  I am proud that this bill has garnered widespread support from numerous military family and veteran service organizations, including the National Military Family Association, the Military Officers Association of America, and others.  I am also pleased that at this moment, as we reintroduce the bill, Senator Gillibrand and I, Secretary Mattis--a former marine and decorated General, one of our most distinguished officers, who has seen the impact on families as he served--staff members at the Department of Defense, Senator McCain, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and his staff have been working with us to iron out the details on a bill that they all support and agree will help our military men and women and their families.  So the HIRE Vets Act and the Military Family Stability Act are bipartisan. They are commonsense measures that really get us closer to our goal of ensuring that we provide the support for servicemembers and veterans who have defended us.  We will also continue our oversight on the Veterans' Administration to ensure that those who have served receive more choices and that their healthcare benefits and other benefits they have earned are benefits that they will receive. There is really no reason they can't receive many of those benefits where they would prefer to go as opposed to where the government has previously thought were the only options. Veterans' choice is important. They chose to serve. We can now give them more choice than we have in the past to decide what works for them and their families.  So as we approach Memorial Day, I know that all the Members of the Senate are appreciative of those who served and the families who served alongside them. I look forward not only to honoring veterans between now and next Monday but between next Monday and a year from next Monday, continuing to do those things we can to be sure that those who serve and those who have served are fully appreciated for their service.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

It imposes enormous burdens, stifles contractor productivity, ignores skill differences for different jobs, and imposes rigid craftwork rules.  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Davis-Bacon Act will raise Federal construction costs by $13 billion between 2015 and 2023.

It is just erratic.

Repealing the DBA would allow the government to build more infrastructure and create 155,000 new construction-related jobs at the very same cost to the taxpayers. In fact, repealing Davis-Bacon would have saved the Federal Government $10.9 billion, and that was back in 2011.

2306,topic-id,258,"Mr.Chairman, I will disagree on the economics that were just presented. But apart from the economics of the lightbulb mandate, that is, in fact, only part of the story.  With the extreme expansion of Federal powers undertaken in the last administration, when the Democrats were in charge of Congress for 4 years, Americans have just now begun to see how far the Constitution's Commerce Clause has been manipulated from its original intent. The lightbulb mandate is a perfect example of this manipulation.  The Commerce Clause was intended by our Founding Fathers to be a limitation on Federal authority, not a catchall in order to allow for any topic to be regulated by Indeed, it is clear that the Founding Fathers never intended for this clause to be used to allow the Federal Government to regulate and pass mandates on consumer products that do not pose a risk to either human health or safety.  Mr.Chairman, in December of 2007, when this bill was first passed, the columnist George Will observed on television one Sunday morning that it is the job of the Federal Government to defend the borders and deliver the mail. But instead of keeping up with those two tasks, we instead decided to ban the incandescent bulb. It was wrong in 2007. It is wrong in 2017.

2184,topic-id,3258,"Mr.President, on Tuesday President Trump sent his proposed fiscal year 2018 budget to A budget is supposed to reflect the President's priorities and the values our country holds dear. Unfortunately, President Trump's full budget shows how much disdain he has for supporting American families here at home, how little he values America's strong leadership around the world, and how much he misunderstands the essential role the Federal Government has in keeping our air and water clean, roads and bridges functioning, and the public safe from deadly diseases and other threats.  This President's budget shows how much he values corporate profits and polluters over children's health and demonstrates an irrational ignorance of basic principles that have worked for and against the American economy throughout the years. The budget wastes money on a border wall and deportation force that will not make America any safer and will tear apart families and communities.  President Trump fails to uphold the promise he made as a candidate to protect American workers and seniors, and he breaks new ground in the level of uncertainty he is willing to inject into our economy, our local communities, and relationships with our historical allies and economic partners. More than any other Presidential budget in recent memory, this budget must be considered dead on arrival.  President Trump's full budget for fiscal year 2018 is an exercise in extremism. President Trump wants to ax $610 billion from Medicaid--the program that lifts up America's veterans and the most vulnerable men, women, and children, capping the funding in order to finance tax cuts for big businesses and the wealthiest among us. The budget further slashes the social safety net by cutting the food stamp program and eliminating critical social services programs. It directly hurts children by cutting $6 billion from the Children's Health Insurance The President wants to choke off funding for essential scientific research at the National Institutes of Health and infectious disease detection and response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while also slashing funding for key global health initiatives that ensure economic stability.  Further demonstrating his misunderstanding of the ripple effect Federal investments can have, the President inexplicably wants to end the economic development assistance programs to rural and economically distressed communities. I was particularly disappointed that he would eliminate the Appalachia Regional Commission, which is very important to the people in the western part of my State as an economic tool that can bring badly needed jobs to Appalachia country.  He wants to put the American dream out of reach for would-be homeowners and seekers of safe and affordable housing with the elimination of HUD's rental assistance and homeowner partnership programs. The President calls for shifting more than $143 billion in additional student loan payments to hard-working students and their families. And he recommends ending a vital program that helps first responders, law enforcement, teachers, nurses, librarians, public safety, and military have a chance to reduce the burden of their student loans so that they can continue to serve their communities. The President also continues the ill-conceived Republican assault on Federal workers and retirees with his proposal for wholesale slashing the programs and staff, such as the economic and environmentally important EPA and Chesapeake Bay Program, making it nearly impossible for many departments to carry out their basic mission.  I want to talk a few minutes about the foreign assistance budget. I have the privilege of being the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations In terms of our Nation's foreign policy, if the budget is a reflection of values, then what the Trump administration values is an American retreat from the world that would make the United States less safe and secure. The numbers speak for themselves in the narrow-minded budget release we have received.  What is most perplexing about the administration's combined 31.7 percent gutting of international affairs spending--as Secretary Defense Mattis has said: If you don't fund the State Department Diplomacy Center, you had[[Page S3117]]better give the Defense Department more bullets and soldiers. This is counterproductive to making the world a safer place for  America is safer when the United States helps feed millions of starving people in Africa and the Middle East, helps Europe defend its democratic institutions from Russia interference, helps support countries and international organizations caring for vulnerable refugee populations, helps train farmers and other technical workers, helps lead the world in fighting climate change and promoting global health, and helps fund programs to protect human rights and promote democracy. In each of these areas, the administration has taken a penny-wise and pound-foolish approach that will cost lives abroad and endanger Americans here at home.  Each of the programs I mentioned are either eliminated or there are significant cuts, making it impossible for our dedicated Foreign Service officers to carry out the critically important missions they undertake.  As I look at the massive spending cuts put forward by the White House for vital national security, it is impossible to conclude that this is anything but an ``America alone'' budget--one that, if enacted, will have disastrous effects on our standing in the world.  Luckily, the majority of Members of Congress know this budget is dead on arrival. I look forward to working with like-minded Republican colleagues to make sure nothing remotely close to this budget is enacted.  Fortunately, our Founders developed a system of checks and balances with the Constitution providing that Congress appropriates public funds. It is our responsibility to pass the appropriations bill. I intend to do everything within my power to work with Republicans, using the model of the fiscal year 2017 Omnibus appropriations, to prevent enactment of this outlandish executive branch attempt to cripple our economy and do lasting damage to our Nation's global leadership. Congress has a responsibility to ensure that we have a more realistic budget that helps the American public, contributes to genuine economic growth, and furthers America's true values.  I want to cite some examples in some areas as to how detrimental this budget is. First of all, there are economic assumptions made by the President's budget that are just not realistic. He assumes there is going to be a 3-percent economic growth rate, which economists tell us is simply not realistic. What does that mean? That means there is about $2 trillion that is being used by economic assumptions which have no justification, meaning that we are going to see significant budget deficits increase if this budget were to become law. The budget double counts some of these gains in order to offset tax reductions. He is putting our economy at risk.  In healthcare, the President's budget continues the administration's misguided and ill-conceived efforts to jeopardize the health and well-being of our constituents under the Affordable Care Make no mistake about it, President Trump is trying to make sure that the healthcare system in this country does not work. He is deliberately putting at risk the cautionary provisions that are in the Affordable Care Act, which ensure that many of our constituents have affordable health rates without outrageous deductibles or copays. The Trump administration is jeopardizing that.  The Trump administration is jeopardizing the Medicaid system--$610 billion cut in the Medicaid system, which is critically important for some of our most vulnerable people. There are 280,000 Marylanders who gained essential health coverage through the Medicaid expansion who will be left without access to care. There are an estimated 1.25 million Maryland Medicaid enrollees who will no longer be able to depend on benefits like mental health and substance abuse, pediatric dental services, or maternity coverage.  Our President is recommending a $6 billion cut in the Children's Health Insurance Program, the CHIP program. That is absolutely outrageous. There is a bipartisan effort in Congress to make sure the children of America have the health they need.  Then there is a $7 billion--22-percent--cut in the National Institutes of Democrats and Republicans have come together, recognizing that America has provided the true leadership and basic research to deal with the mysteries of illness, and the President wants to reverse that trend. That will not only cost us in terms of our health advancements, but it will also hurt our economy.  The President cuts the funds to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health I thought we had made a commitment that we are going to narrow the gap of discrimination in our healthcare system. The President's budget moves in the opposite direction.  In Social Services and Social Security, the President, on his campaign trail, promised not to cut the Social Security system. He broke that promise with this budget. These cuts are a ``Robin Hood in reverse'' budget. His cuts in the Supplemental Security Income Program and Social Security Disability Insurance Program will be devastating for low- and modest-income individuals, as well as persons with disabilities and those over 65 years of age.  So we have seen cuts to programs the President claimed he would not cut when he was a candidate. The budget cuts nearly $200 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, or food stamps, which helps low-income Americans with food purchases. He also cuts the TANF Program, which helps people who are in need of assistance. The budget eliminates the LIHEAP, Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the Weatherization Assistance Program, and State Energy I guess Donald Trump wants low-income Americans to freeze in the dark. This is shameful and reprehensible.  Yes, there is money for some advancements--the advancement of the so-called border wall with I visited Mexico just a few months ago. I visited the U.S.-Mexico border. I couldn't find one border security guard, security personnel, who felt that building a wall made any sense. It will not keep out the illegal flow of people or drugs, and it will compromise our ability to work with our neighbors in the south to control immigration and to control drugs. The President's Executive order on immigration and the President's fiscal year 2018 budget ramp up deportation forces inside the United States, which will do more to harm our national security and public safety than to help. We shouldn't be moving in that direction.  Legal Services is one of the areas I worked on for a long time with my Republican colleagues to make sure we fund the Legal Services The Trump budget completely eliminates that funding. The late Justice Antonin Scalia said at Legal Services Corporation's 40th Anniversary Conference in 2014: ``LSC pursues the most fundamental of American ideals, and it pursues equal justice in those areas of life most important to the lives of our citizens.''  We believe in equal justice under the law. If a person cannot get legal help, they cannot get equal justice under the law. And the President says there is no Federal role for this. I hope that we will soundly reject that.  The President's budget eliminates the Community Development Block Grant That is very troubling. Here is one of the more flexible programs we offer the local government in order to be able to make their own decisions, and the President's budget eliminates that program.  The President's budget eliminates many of our programs under agriculture, which will hurt our rural areas and hurt our farming community. The budget proposes to eliminate new enrollment in the Conservation Stewardship Program and funding for the Regional Conservation Partnership I am very familiar with the Regional Conservation Partnership It was put in the last farm reauthorization bill. It was done as an effort to help deal with conservation in critically important areas, including the Chesapeake Bay watershed. It is a very important program to preserving our bay and preserving farm land so that we can have both a healthy bay and healthy agriculture. The President eliminates those programs. I could go on and on about agriculture--the many programs that are either severely restricted or eliminated under the President's budget.  In education, the fiscal year 2018 budget released by President Trump[[Page S3118]]may be entitled ``A New Foundation for American Greatness,'' but President Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have severely undercut our students, educators, and public schools. The budget proposes to eliminate the Preschool Development Grant Program, a program that has successfully placed more than 2,700 additional 4-year-olds in high-quality preschool programs across my The vulnerable children in this program get a boost that helps them to lower the achievement gap among students of color, low-income children, and children with disabilities across my We should be expanding these programs, not reducing them. And 85 Members of this body voted in favor of the Every Student Succeeds Act and the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grant That progress is jeopardized by the President's budget.  Yes, he finds money for a new program to help school choice programs, which will undermine the progress we have made in public education. Mr.President, 95 percent of our students get their education through the public schools, and that is jeopardized by the $1.25 billion the President has included in his budget for school choice programs.  Maryland families understand the value of higher education. For too many, the cost of higher education means that it is difficult, if not impossible, for their children to have the higher education they need. Yet the President's budget takes away some of the tools we have in order to afford higher education. That is just not right. We should be making higher education more affordable, not less affordable.  In the environment, the President's proposed budget would eliminate the Chesapeake Bay The Chesapeake Bay Program and related efforts are delivering encouraging results throughout the watershed and have built a tremendous movement forward. Yet President Trump has still targeted them for elimination. The local governments are doing their job in stewardship of the bay. The States are doing their job. Our stakeholders are doing their job. We depend upon the Federal Government to monitor and make sure that the programs are there--that all stakeholders are doing their fair share. The elimination of the Chesapeake Bay Program would jeopardize all of that progress. We cannot let that happen.  The President's budget would cut the EPA budget by 31.4 percent, the most severe cut of any major Federal agency. The investment in our Nation's water and waste water infrastructure has been flatlined through this budget proposal.  What in the world makes President Trump think that our Nation's drinking water infrastructure shall be kept at status quo? Don't we all remember what happened in Flint, MI? We have discovered similar things in New Jersey and In Baltimore, our public school system cannot connect their water fountains to the water supply because of lead contamination. We need to have a greater commitment to make sure that the water supply to America is safe.  Under the budget, the Office of Compliance would be cut by one-third of its budget. That is EPA not being able to enforce the law. Aren't we a country of the rule of law? You would not think so under President Trump's budget.  The President's budget also does not contain a critical infrastructure plan. We heard that during the campaign. But nowhere in this budget is he providing for that increase. Instead, it proposes cuts in some of the highway trust programs.  Every day, civil servants perform countless tasks that help support and defend and protect Civil servants are saving lives, empowering small businesses, keeping America safe from harm, and otherwise ensuring a safe and prosperous future for our country, including our children and families. We know that our Federal employees often perform the type of work that no one else can do. It is a highly qualified Federal workforce. On May 5, Donald Trump issued a proclamation declaring May 7 through 13, 2017, as Public Service Recognition He stated:       Throughout my first 100 days, I have seen the tremendous      work civil servants do to fulfill our duty to the American      people. At all levels of government, our public servants put      our country and our people first.  He has a bizarre way of showing his appreciation. Earlier this week, he released a budget that punishes Federal workers by making them pay much more for their pensions, an additional $5,000 for an average Federal worker, while making these pensions much smaller.  The relentless assault on the Federal workforce must end. The civilian workforce was smaller last year than it was 40 years ago, according to data from the Office of Personnel Federal workers increasingly have been asked to do more and more with less and less. They have already sacrificed financially, contributing $190 billion to deficit reduction just since 2011.  Workers hired in 2012 already are paying more for smaller pensions. Sequestration-related furloughs cost Federal workers $1 billion in lost pay, and there was a 3-year pay freeze from 2011 to 2013, and substandard rises since then. Salaries and wages have fallen 6.5 percent since 2010, adjusted for inflation.  Now comes the latest attack on the Federal worker's pension, on top of continued attacks on pay, healthcare and other benefits, collective bargaining, and due process rights. President Trump would eliminate the annual cost of living adjustments for people in the Federal Employees Retirement System, including current retirees, and reduce them by half a percentage point for people in the old Civil Service Retirement System, including current retirees.  According to certified financial planner Art Stein, the annuity would lose one-third of its value over 20 years if inflation averages between 2 and 3 percent annually, and nearly half of its value if inflation averages 4 percent. According to the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, the average FERS annuitant would lose $99,471 over 20 years, and the average CSRS annuitant would lose $60,576 over 20 years under the Trump budget.  That is outrageous. That is outrageous. We are talking about people who are already retired. They can't reenter the workforce. They have no choice. Yet we are telling them that they are not going to get what we promised. It is important to understand that 85 percent of the Federal workforce is located beyond the Washington metropolitan area. Federal workers are in big cities and small towns across America, striving to make things better for their neighbors.  Do we really want to engage in a race to the bottom with respect to our Federal workers? These are the people who make sure our parents' Social Security checks arrive on time. They make sure the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat are safe. They are trying to find a cure for our spouse's cancer and our sibling's type 1 diabetes.  They support our sons and daughters in harm's way, and they care for the wounded warriors at home. They patrol our borders and discover and disrupt terrorist threats aimed at our community. They are working to ensure that our grandchildren inherit a habitable climate. When we punish Federal workers--30 percent of whom are veterans, by the way--we are not just harming them and their families, but we are harming each and every  I intend to do everything within my power to work with Republicans, using the model of the fiscal year 2017 omnibus appropriations, to prevent the enactment of this dangerous executive branch attempt to cripple our economy and do lasting damage to our Nation's global leadership.

2189,topic-id,1744,"Thank you, Mr.Good afternoon.                            Paris Agreement  Mr.President, there is an African proverb that goes something like this: If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.  The Paris Agreement was developed in that spirit; that 195 nations and territories can do more to protect our planet from climate change, the greatest environmental challenge of our lifetime, than the United States or any country can do isolated or on its own. Nearly 200 countries now have agreed to do their part to limit our global temperature rise by developing national plans to reduce their own emissions.  We know climate change is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. Emissions anywhere affect people everywhere, with the poorest and most vulnerable populations affected most. There is a reason why we call it ``global warming.'' We know no one country, no one region, no one continent can solve this problem alone.  President Trump's inner circle has a different take on this historical agreement. For instance, during an appearance on ``Fox and Friends'' last month, Scott Pruitt, the EPA Administrator, denounced the Paris Agreement, calling it ``a bad deal for America.''  Asked about his biggest objection to the accord, this is what he said. He claimed China and India had no obligation until 2030--no obligation until 2030--even though ``they are polluting far more than we are.''  Well, that is just false. First, in 2015, the United States on a per capita basis produced more than double the carbon dioxide emissions of China--more than double--and eight times more than Also, contrary to what the Administrator continues to espouse, both China and India have pledged to reach their carbon emissions reduction goals by 2030, which means they are taking steps now--not 5 years from now, not 10 years from now, not 13 years from now--now, to meet those commitments. India is on schedule to be the world's third largest solar market by the end of 2017. In fact, last year, India unveiled the largest solar power facility in the world.  Meanwhile, Chinese leaders have ordered their country's coal companies to cut 1.3 million jobs over the next 5 years. Some of these workers will find jobs in the clean energy sector, which Beijing expects to generate more than 13 million jobs by 2020.  Make no mistake, if the United States cedes its leadership position on climate change, China will be ready and willing to assume that role--our role. In doing so, they will move ahead, and we will fall behind. It is just that simple.  We have a chart here that includes a quote from China's top climate negotiator. He told Reuters about 6 months ago that if Trump abandons efforts to implement the Paris Agreement, ``China's influence and voice are likely to increase in global climate governance, which will then spill over into other areas of global governance and increase China's global standing, power and leadership.''  The Chinese clearly understand that the Paris Agreement affords their country the opportunity to emerge in the 21st century as a clean energy superpower.  I have been there. A year ago, I was there. In the trains they built and the train systems they built, the huge electric buses, all electric buses that I rode, it is clear they know what they are doing, and their intent was to eat our lunch by pursuing this clean sustainable energy approach.  Unfortunately, those in the Trump administration seem to be the only ones who don't recognize that. Some day they will wish they had, and the rest of us will wish we had too. Withdrawing from this pact doesn't put America first, it puts America behind.  You don't have to take my word for it. Just ask our business community. They see the clear benefits for their businesses and for America if we continue to play a lead role in the implementation of the Paris Over 1,000 American companies and investors, some of which are represented here on this chart, have written to President Trump urging his administration and him to address climate change through the implementation of the Paris The businesses, which include Exxon, Starbucks, Apple, General Mills, Walmart, Nike, Morgan Stanley, and BP--just to name a few--this is what all these companies and their leaders said: Failure to embrace the Paris accords ``puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.competitiveness.''  I have another chart.  We have two letters here. One was written to a new President, President Obama, in 2009. Again, this is a full-page ad.  This is another ad that appeared in the past week to another new President, in this case, President Interesting enough, back in 2009, a Manhattan businessman named Donald Trump agreed with the 1,000 companies I mentioned earlier--the 1,000 companies that said we ought to do something about climate change. We ought to get on board and lead the way. Businessman Donald Trump agreed with them and joined CEOs to run an ad in the New York Times urging then-President Obama to ``lead the world by example,'' ahead of the U.Climate Change Conference in  In the ad right here, Donald Trump called on President Obama to allow the United States of America ``to serve in modeling the change necessary to protect humanity and our planet.''  Eight years later, the person who signed this letter and joined all these[[Page S3122]]other CEOs in saying to President Obama: ``Wake up. Let's do something about this climate change stuff. Make sure we are leading the parade''--8 years later, he is not signing the letter. He is the addressee on the letter, from, again, hundreds of CEOs from around the country, and they are urging him to do the very same thing Donald Trump had urged Barack Obama to do 8 years earlier. If you ever want to think of something that is ironic, find an example of two full-page ads that sort of represent the term ``irony,'' this is it. This is it.  The companies noted in this second full-page ad that the Paris Agreement provides just the kind of framework we need. So U.businesses still recognize that our country leading the world in addressing climate change is the right approach. We might want to ask: Why doesn't our President, Donald Trump, realize that? With the Paris Agreement, the global community rightly recognized that there are challenges bigger than any one State and came together to do what is best for our collective future.  It is not the first time the global community came together for the greater good. In 1944, the world came together at the Convention on International Civil Aviation to regulate international air travel so planes could avoid flying into one another in the not-so-friendly skies of the future.  In 1968, the nonproliferation treaty helped prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and further the goal of disarmament to help keep our world safe.  In 1977, the Chemical Weapons Convention outlawed the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, which the world agreed were inhumane.  On these critical issues, the world came together overwhelmingly to do what was in the best interest of humanity rather than the best interest of one single nation, but even these other historic and frankly commonsense agreements don't have as many signers as the Paris Agreement does.  We hear numbers thrown around a lot when we talk about the Paris Agreement, but to put the number of signers in context, let me just say it is nearly the whole world--nearly the whole world.  If you wonder what 195 national flags look like, pretty much the whole world, this chart depicts that. There are two flags down here that have not signed, and one of those is They didn't sign because they thought the Paris accords didn't go far enough. The other country that didn't sign on is So, in effect, there is really only one country that has refused to accept the basis of the Paris Agreement, this huge Paris accord, and that one nation is  Our withdrawing leaves the United States in company with Bashar al-We will be his wingman. That is not the company we ought to be keeping, and that is not who we are.

It is part of the fabric of our  To win our freedom, we took on the mightiest nation on Earth at the time, England, not once but twice, and beat them. A half century later, we survived a bloody Civil War that took hundreds of thousands of lives and left hundreds of thousands more crippled and wounded. After that war, our President was assassinated and his successor, Andrew Johnson, was impeached. Somehow we survived all that and we went on to lead our allies to victory in World War I and World War We led our country out of the Great Depression and into victory in the Cold War as well.  Americans should, once again, be leading the world to combat what is likely to be the greatest challenge we will face in our lifetimes. Our children and their children are counting on this, and we should not let them down.  Somebody asked me how long it would take to read a list of the 195 nations that have signed on to the Paris Peace Accords, and I have the names right here.

2190,topic-id,2215,"Thank you.                                  Iran  Mr.President, one of the countries on this list of the 195 subscribing to and signing on to the Paris Agreement was the country of I want to talk a little bit about Iran in the time that remains.  I came home from church this past My wife and I were in the kitchen--we were fixing breakfast--when I turned on the television and watched, I think it was, They were broadcasting live from Saudi Arabia our President's talking to a large group of national leaders representing Muslim countries from around the world, hosted by Saudi The President was giving his speech. He was using a teleprompter, but a lot of Presidents use teleprompters. He was reading a speech off of the teleprompter. As I was listening, I actually thought that this was a pretty good speech. Closer to the end of the speech--I do not know if he went off camera or went off the teleprompter and just did an inaudible or if this was part of the speech--he started talking about Iran and why they are a nemesis to a lot of the world and are not to be trusted--somebody we should not be doing business with or going into any kind of agreements with, even an agreement that causes them not to be able to build a nuclear weapon.  In any event, I thought to myself that there is a real irony here because, as he was going on and berating Iran, they were still counting the votes in Iran from the election that had occurred the day before, which is unlike many of the countries that were represented and that President Trump was addressing in that they do not have elections in those countries. Women do not get to hold office or run for office in many of those countries.  Let me just be the first to say that, clearly, Iran is not a Jeffersonian democracy, and, as some would suggest of late, maybe our credentials are somewhat tarnished on that too. I think of the over 1,600 people who registered to run for President in There were 1,600 people in Iran who wanted to run for President this year, and Iran's Guardian Council only allowed 6, ultimately, to run.  Iran has never allowed a woman to run for Women do hold elected positions. They serve in the parliament and in municipal positions, but none of them has ever run for We have had one or two or maybe three.  Iran does not enjoy a free press. International election observers are strictly forbidden, and there are widespread allegations that Iran's 2009 Presidential elections, in which Ahmadinejad was supposedly reelected--I doubt that he was, but there are a lot of people who think those elections were rigged.  In Iran, most of the final decisions rest with the Supreme Leader, at least decisions of consequence, and the Supreme Leader, as we know, is not popularly elected by the people of that country.  Here is what happened in the elections in Iran over the weekend. A lot of people turned out to vote, and they were willing to support a candidate who openly advocates for engagement with the West, including with us. The Supreme Leader of Iran, frankly, did not want President Rouhani to be reelected, but he was, with nearly 60 percent of the vote. In fact, the Supreme Leader, I think, and others urged others to get out of the race so that there would be just a one-on-one against a[[Page S3123]]hard-line candidate, who was favored by the Supreme Leader, and President Rouhani, who turned out to be favored in the election by almost 60 percent of the voters.  Of the people who voted, I do not know how this breaks out by age, but the country of Iran is a young country. They had their revolution back in the late 1970s. You may recall they captured our Embassy and held our folks hostage during the end of the Carter administration. They created a lot of havoc--not a lot of bloodshed but a lot of havoc--and a lot of bad will from that point in time until almost to this day.  Most of the people who live in Iran today are under the age of 30. A clear majority of them were not alive in 1970 to 1979. They never knew the fellow who led that revolution in Iran in the late 1970s. Most of the people in that country today were born after 1979.  I have talked to any number of Americans, including those who have held senior positions in previous administrations who have gone to Iran in recent years, and they all tell me the same story. They could not believe how welcomed they were by people everywhere--young people and not so young people, but especially by young people. There was a fascination on the part of especially the young people with our country, and there actually appears to be a fair amount of respect and admiration for our country. They would like to have a better relationship with our country.  They turned out and voted for a They also voted in municipal elections over the weekend. In the municipal elections, they voted out some sitting mayors of cities like Tehran, which is the capital city. The mayor there was a hard-liner, and, apparently, he has been knocked out of office or will be shortly. There are many other municipal leaders, and a moderate reformist will be succeeding one of the hard-liners.  I do not mean to suggest that all in Iran love us. They do not. The Revolutionary Guard and some of their leadership do not care for us at all. They, frankly, like terrorism and embrace terrorism and would like to continue to foment upheaval and terror in some parts around the country. They are not the future of their country. The future of their country voted last weekend. We have all heard about voting for change. Well, they voted for change, and my hope is that they will get what they voted for.  I think, for us, we have to be smart enough to say that no democracy is perfect--not ours, not theirs--and give them at least a passing grade for effort and see, as we go forward, how we can find ways to work together.  I served in the Vietnam war--three tours in Southeast I came back at the end of the war and moved from California to I got an MBA and became the treasurer, Congressman, Governor, and Senator of When I was a Congressman, I led a six-member congressional delegation, including one former U.POW, Air Force Pete Peterson, who spent 6 years in the Hanoi We went back to Vietnam a month after I stepped down as a captain in the U.We went back to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to find out what happened to the thousands of MIAs whose bodies were never recovered. We do not know how they died or where they died or when they died, but we went back and tried to get to the truth. We did so at the behest and encouragement of the George Herbert Walker Bush administration.  We took with us a roadmap to normalize relations between the United States and Lo and behold, we ended up getting to meet their brand new leader, Do He was a brand new leader who had only been in office for a week. We presented our roadmap to normalize relations. The six of us--Democrat and Republican Members of the House--had a very emotional meeting with him--a very emotional meeting--and said that these are the things you have to do. If you want to normalize relations with us, give us access to crash sites, the ability to excavate crash sites, the ability to talk to people who live in those areas and communities that are around those crash sites, the ability to go into your war museums, and the ability to go into your military archives and get as much information as we can. We said that we wanted our folks--U.folks--to be able to go around the country, to travel around their country. If somebody reports seeing a round-eye, or somebody who might be American, we want to be able to go find him.  A long story short, they did all of the things we asked them to do. Pete Peterson, a Member of our delegation, became the U.Ambassador to He made sure that the Vietnamese kept to the letter and spirit of that agreement. They did, and we normalized relations.  When I went back to Vietnam last year with President Obama, I met with some of the same people I had met with in August of 1991, who are now leaders of their countries. Do Muoi is still alive. I wrote him a note and sent it to him while I was there.  There are 55,000 American names that are on a wall down by the Lincoln Memorial--55,000 men and women who died in the war, with whom I served--and we have allowed bygones to be bygones with They are not a Jeffersonian democracy, but it turns out that we have worked through our difficulties. They have become a major trading partner with the United States--in fact, a major market. They want to buy things from us, too, like Boeing jets, and a lot of them for a lot of money--billions of dollars.  As it turns out, they and Iran have an airline that is decrepit. We used to joke about an airline in this country that was called We called it ``Agony.'' We had another airline in this country called ``Tree Top.'' In Iran, they do not have an airline to be proud of, as they have very old airplanes and not especially safe airplanes. Like Vietnam, they want to buy our airplanes--a lot of them, for a lot of money.  I would hope that we could be smart enough to say that maybe we should sell to them. We are not going to sell them military equipment. We sell military equipment to Vietnam now, but we are not going to do that kind of thing with Maybe, if we are smart, we can sell them airplanes and, later on, the parts to the airplanes and, later on, other things as well. We should start small and go from there, as we have with  I will close, but if I could, I want to just say that our President, who has called for the isolation of Iran, also has, basically, praised the actions of President Duterte, of the Philippines, the leader of the Do you know what he has done? He has launched a campaign of extrajudicial murders and has killed over 8,000 people.  He has warmly welcomed the leader of Turkey, Erdogan, who may have won or may not have won a tight election that gives him extraordinary powers as the leader of that country.  The President welcomed to the White House Egyptian President El-Sisi, who came to power through military intervention and not an elected government. President Trump has said recently that he would be ``honored'' to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong un, and that is despite the repeated threats from the Korean leader to launch nuclear weapons at the United States and our allies.  Somehow all of those things that this President has done and the things that he has spoken out against, including having any kind of relationship with Iran, does not seem, to me, to be consistent. I will be polite and say it is inconsistent. I think we need to be smarter than that.  With regard to the note that I wrote to the former leader of Vietnam when I was, literally, at the Hanoi Hilton--back at the prison in which John McCain and Pete Peterson were imprisoned--I saw a huge picture on the wall when I was there last year, and I wrote the note and gave it to a young Vietnamese man who knew Do I wrote that same African-American proverb: If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.  Ultimately, we found a way with It took a long time. The war pretty much ended in 1975. It took a long time to get to more normal relations. We finally made it, and they are better for it, and we are too. Someday, the time will come to turn a page, I think, with We are not there yet, but we are getting a little closer.  For now, I just want to say to those people, though, in that country, who[[Page S3124]]took the time and made the effort to vote and decided to vote for change and to vote for the reformist--the more moderate form of government--and wanted to be more westward looking than would otherwise be the case: Good for you. My hope in doing that is that you will join us in basically turning down the idea of continuing support for Hezbollah and for terrorism that the other part of Iran and some of the others in leadership are determined to sustain.

2478,topic-id,588,"Mr.Speaker, the Ozone Act, or perhaps more accurately, the ``Smoggy Skies Act,'' will put our communities at risk and dangerously harm public health. The delays and exemptions in this act are unprecedented. They will cut critical portions of the Clean Air Act to the detriment of our Nation and our people's health.  This motion to recommit is simple. If the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, which is an independent group of nationally recognized experts, if they believe that this act will increase asthma attacks, increase emergency room visits, increase pre-term births, increase impaired fetal growth, lead to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, premature death, then the act will not go into effect.  Now I ask, what is more important or fundamental as the representatives of the people than to ensure that our actions do not bring harm to the American people? How can we go home to our constituents and look a mother in the eye and say we voted for something that could make her child sick? How can we visit a school if we voted for something that could spike rates of asthma?  We originally passed the bipartisan Clean Air Act to protect the health of our people. As we vote to partially dismantle it today, at least we should ensure scientists certify that we are doing no harm to the American people.  Some of my colleagues may vote against this motion to recommit because they already know this act will have a devastating impact on the American people's health. Plain and simple, ozone is a pollutant. It is the leading component of smog. It causes chest pain, shortness of breath, respiratory infections, asthma attacks, acute bronchitis, and even premature death.  Smog is linked to 16,000 preterm births per year. Exposure to ozone in the womb and in childhood causes permanent lung damage. The new ozone standards could prevent 230,000 childhood asthma attacks per year. Delaying implementation of the new ozone standards will only sentence more and more children to lifelong lung disease.  When setting the new ozone standards, the EPA used the best available science and reviewed hundreds of studies on the negative health effects of ozone. One conclusion was clear: the current standards do not protect the American people.  My Republican colleagues here recently passed legislation that would have taken healthcare away from 22 million people. Now we are considering a bill that would make our Nation sicker, a bill that would hurt our most vulnerable: babies, infants, schoolchildren, the elderly.  For good reasons, this bill is opposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Public Health Association, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, and many, many more. These experts know that this bill is nothing more than a recipe for increased sickness and more suffering.  We know that people are being harmed by ozone. We have a duty to our citizens to raise the bar and protect their health. This is the people's We are here to protect the people. We are here to fight for the most vulnerable among us and not to represent special interests. We need to be the body to promote health, not take away healthcare. We need to fight for kids, not make them sick. We need to clean our air, not protect polluters.  Mr.Speaker, support this amendment and make sure this bill is not the health catastrophe all the experts know that it is.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

2278,topic-id,285,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I rise today to speak in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague, Congresswoman Pingree, which would strike the harmful provision that undermines the importance of the National Ocean  For over 7 years, the National Ocean Policy has helped guide ocean management through spurring coordination among government agencies. Ocean planning and coordination is an important aspect in supporting economic growth, protecting coastal habitats, and strengthening coastal communities.  The National Ocean Policy does not create any regulations, supersede current regulations, or modify any agency's established mission, jurisdiction, or authority. Rather, it helps coordinate the implementation of existing regulations by Federal agencies to establish a more efficient and effective decisionmaking process.  Throughout the northeast, the Regional Ocean Council allows our States to pool resources and businesses to have a strong voice in decisions that will impact their communities and facilitate coordination with Federal partners.  I am proud to say that the Northeast Regional Ocean Council is the first in the Nation to release a draft regional ocean plan. My home State of Rhode Island, the ocean State, has benefited greatly from the National Ocean With help from NOP, the Block Island Wind Farm project was successfully completed and today is capable of powering an estimated 17,000 homes.  At a time when our oceans are facing significant challenges and changes, maintaining coordination and planning is necessary in continuing to strengthen our country's coastal communities and ocean industries. Allowing Federal agencies to coordinate implementation of over 100 ocean laws and giving State and local governments a voice in the ocean planning process is smart policy, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and strike this ill-advised provision.

Congressman Steve Knight and I introduced H.3210, the Securely Expediting Clearances Through Reporting Transparency Act, or SECRET, to enable Congress to monitor the efficiency of the background investigation process. This bipartisan bill was passed unanimously by the Oversight and Government Reform  H.3210 imposes a commonsense requirement on the National Background Investigations Bureau to report to Congress on backlogs that develop in the background investigation process.  Backlogs have plagued us in the past, as my friend from Michigan just said. In 2004, when the Department of Defense was the lead agency performing background investigations, the Government Accountability Office determined the backlog was 375 days, more than 1 year. Over 100,000 new investigations or reinvestigations were delayed by that backlog.  In response, Congress transferred responsibility for those investigations to the Office of Personnel Management, and more recently, created the National Background Investigations Bureau within the Office of Personnel  H.3210 will provide Congress with the transparency needed to conduct oversight of the National Background Investigations Bureau and to help prevent backlogs like that in the future.  I am also pleased that the bill includes an amendment I offered in committee to require a report to Congress on duplicative costs to assist us in making decisions that protect taxpayers.  Last year, a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act asked the Department of Defense to develop a separate plan, to transfer responsibility for those background investigations of DOD personnel to the Pentagon instead of the National Background Investigations  The Bureau would continue to perform other background investigations for all the other government agencies, except the If that plan were implemented, resources and capabilities that are currently under the direction of the Bureau would have to be duplicated by the Department of  H.3210 would require a report to Congress on the cost of those duplicative resources and efforts.

If we choose not to put air quality and public health first today, we jeopardize and undermine our ability to live long and healthy lives tomorrow.

We need to make sure that our children aren't developing chronic bronchitis and asthma; and we risk increased numbers of premature deaths across the country.  Every American deserves clean air now. We cannot afford an almost decade-long delay of improved air pollution standards.

2177,topic-id,574,"Mr.President, I want to take a few minutes to recognize WATT Global Media, a leading provider of business information and marketing solutions for the agribusiness industry worldwide, headquartered in Rockford, More than 100 years ago, on July 6, 1917, WATT Global Media was born.  WATT Global Media's history began in 1917, when J.Watt and Adon Yoder purchased ``Poultry Tribune,'' a magazine published monthly for just 50 cents for an annual subscription. Before Watt and Yoder bought the magazine, its circulation was about 5,000. In a few short years, these young entrepreneurs grew the magazine's circulation by 400 percent. Under Watt's leadership, ``Poultry Tribune'' quickly became ``America's Leading Poultry Farm Magazine'' for poultry raisers, peaking in 1940 with a circulation of more than half a million readers.  During the mid-1920s, economic changes in the poultry industry led to the creation of the commercial hatchery industry, which led the staff at ``Poultry Tribune'' to create ``Hatchery Tribune.'' In 1934, Watt added ``Turkey World'' to its growing list of publications. WATT Global Media, originally called the Poultry Tribune Company, changed its name in 1944 to Watt Publishing In that same year, the company acquired Better Farming Methods, ``The business magazine for leaders who train and advise farmers.'' As the evolving poultry industry grew, so did Watt Publishing  In 1949, Leslie Watt--the second generation of family leadership--was named president of Watt Publishing Company and expanded the company into international markets, acquiring ``Industria Avicola,'' a Spanish language magazine targeting the Latin American poultry industry. In 1962, ``Poultry International'' was created to cater to the poultry and egg industries throughout Europe, Middle East, Africa, and In the 1980s, Leslie Watt took Watt Publishing Company to China by establishing ``Poultry International China Edition'' and became one of the first publishers from North America to make Chinese language business-to-business magazines in the People's Republic of  In the 1990s, under James Watt--the third generation of family leadership--the company expanded its portfolio to include pet food. In 1993, the Petfood Forum was created and grew into the world's largest annual event of its kind. Overnight, Watt became the global pet food market leader for business information--what an accomplishment.  Greg Watt--the fourth generation President and CEO--modernized the company by taking it into the 21st century, expanding across multiple media channels, including online and digital platforms, live events, and magazine channels. In recognition of its global audience, the Watt Publishing Company changed its name to WATT Global Media in 2014. Today, WATT Global Media serves 180,000 professionals in the pet food, poultry, pig, and animal feed industries from over 140 countries.  I will close with this: In 1907, J.Watt came to this country from the Orkney Islands, just north of He came in search of the American Dream, and boy, did he find it. Despite WATT Global Media's growth and many achievements, its proudest accomplishment is that it has been family-owned for 100 years, and this family business isn't going anywhere. I want to thank J.Watt, Leslie Watt, James Watt, and Greg Watt--four generations from the Watts family--for their service to Rockford, Illinois, America, and throughout the world. I know the good people at WATT Global Media will continue its simple guiding mission: ``to improve the health and well-being of people and animals across the globe.''

2439,topic-id,593,"Mr.Chair, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Chair, for the folks who might be watching this today, I think it is important to understand that bad ozone causes a whole lot of health problems--things like making it difficult to breathe deeply. It can aggravate your emphysema. It can cause a sore and scratchy throat. It can aggravate lung diseases like asthma, emphysema, and bronchitis. And it is actually associated with asthma attacks, as I mentioned, and it can cause very serious obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a bad thing, it is dangerous, and it hurts people.  In the Obama administration, we tried to pass some standards to say that companies that emit the polluting substances have to comply with certain air standards to make sure that people don't suffer these nasty health effects.  What is going on today with H.806 is that the Republicans are going to say: No, they don't have to implement right away. They have got a lot more time, years, before they actually have to comply with these air standards.  So what they are saying is that industries that pollute don't have to take the measures that they would need to take that will cost them money--yes, they will--in order to protect the public's health. They are saying that their money and the profits of their shareholders are more important than the lungs of our kids.  You are going to hear them say all this stuff about jobs, jobs. This is not about jobs. This is about money. This is about profitability from polluting industries that don't want to spend the money to protect the public's health. That is what this is about. That is what we are talking about.  They always say: You can have a job, or you can breathe, but you can't do both. That is what our friends say. You can breathe, but then you won't have a job; or you can have a job, but then you can't breathe.  The fact is, they want to send us to work with gas masks on, and it is wrong. We as a people deserve to breathe. Our kids deserve to breathe. Our seniors deserve to breathe. If it costs a company a little bit more to make sure the air that we have is breathable, then they should spend that money. I believe that they should, because when you look at the health costs on the other side, they are astronomical. What does it cost to lose a loved one dying from an asthma attack or bronchitis or obstructive pulmonary disease? What does it cost a family in terms of not just treasure but heartache when they have their loved ones hooked up to a bunch of machines and wires because they are undergoing a respiratory attack? That is the cost. That is the true cost that we have to consider, Mr. The real cost here is not this mythical jobs thing that they say. The real cost they are talking about is profitability, but the true cost to society is our health. Do you really want to see missed days of school, missed days of work? Do you really want to see more people incurring medical bills because of the failure of industry to protect our health when they are taking that stuff that they are spitting out of their smokestacks and putting it into the sky that we all have to breathe?

2247,topic-id,732,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment is a symbolic adjustment to the NNSA budget intended to raise awareness about two areas of emerging national security risk that I believe deserve more attention and investment.  As the only Ph.physicist in Congress, I feel a special responsibility to speak out on issues of national security, especially when they concern emerging technological threats that Congress may not be sufficiently aware of.  Any student of the history of warfare is well aware of the dangers of fighting the last war, and for more than 70 years, nuclear weapons have held center stage among threats to our national security and global safety because of their unique capabilities to threaten the existence of mankind. That threat remains, but I fear that the balance of our defensive investments do not adequately reflect emerging threats.  We now appear to be in the process of deciding to spend over $1 trillion to upgrade our nuclear weapons despite the fact that our existing systems are far more sufficient to deter any rational actor. There is no adversary of ours who is not intimidated by our nuclear arsenal but who will suddenly fall in line if we add just one more upgrade or additional weapons manufacturing capability. Put simply, another generation of nuclear weapons will not make us significantly safer.  On the other hand, we live in a world where newly emerging and potentially equally great threats loom: first, bioterror, driven by recent breakthroughs in genetic engineering and off-the-shelf biotechnology; and, second, lethal autonomous weapons systems driven by recent breakthroughs in machine vision, facial recognition, and artificial intelligence. These are small, inexpensive lethal drones and similar devices that use machine vision and artificial intelligence to target individuals or groups of humans, potentially without any human involvement in the kill decision.  For those of my colleagues unfamiliar with these technologies, perform an internet search for the term ``lethal autonomous weapons systems,'' sometimes abbreviated ``LAWS''; or read the recent press coverage of the ab initio synthesis of the horsepox virus, a close variant of the smallpox virus that killed millions; then search for the term ``biohacking.''  For more detailed information, I urge my colleagues to request a classified or unclassified briefing on recent studies of these subjects by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Both of these technologies pose unique threats to our national security for two reasons:  The first is because of the small physical footprint of a terror facility based on either of these technologies. Either a bioterror laboratory or a small shop to produce and program small lethal drones could easily fit in a basement or small apartment. There is no radiological signature to detect them as there is with nuclear material.  The second is because of the low cost and general availability of key enabling technological components. The monetary investment necessary for a capable terror facility is in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps less.  The relevant technologies are already in wide use in industry.  Contrast this with the threats of nuclear proliferation, where the multibillion-dollar investment to enrich and separate nuclear fissile material pretty much limits nuclear weapons either to established nation-states or perhaps terrorist organizations with access to fissile material from poorly guarded facilities.  Anyone who is unconvinced that we need to take these emerging threats seriously needs only to look at what happened in cybersecurity. One of the painful lessons we have learned in recent years is that everything evil that can be done with computer viruses has, in fact, been done. In large part, this is because of the low barriers to entry and the difficulty of attributing an attack. Both of these features are shared fully by both bioterror and lethal autonomous weapons systems.  So if we are going to stay ahead of these threats, we need to be strategic about our investments. It is time to reconsider the wisdom of pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into Cold War weapons which contribute negligibly to our national security and past time to consider a much more rapid increase in investments in defensive measures against lethal autonomous weapons systems and against bioterror, because by the time they become a reality, it will be too late to react.  As a leader in technology and innovation, the United States should act now to circumvent any danger these technologies could pose.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

2398,topic-id,534,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Roby for leading this Special Order, but a special thanks to you for introducing H.1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017. Everyone in the private sector, men and women, are grateful to you for doing this.  I may repeat some of the things that some of my colleagues have already said, but, Mr.Speaker, they bear repeating.  This proposal, this bill, is about freedom, flexibility, and fairness. Workers, not the Federal Government, should have the freedom to choose what is best for them and their families. Hardworking men and women need more flexibility to balance work, life, and family, and there should be fair workforce policies that don't put private sector employees at a disadvantage to those in the public sector.  Across the country, there are moms and dads who wish they had more flexibility to make their child's baseball game or dance recital, students who can't find enough time to study for college finals while working full time, and individuals who are struggling to care for an aging relative. There are many workers who want flexible work arrangements instead of rigid 9 to 5 schedules so they can attend to their personal needs.  This bill will improve the quality of life of many Americans by offering workers eligible for overtime pay a choice between paid time off and cash wages. Outdated Federal labor rules currently prohibit private sector workers from exercising this choice.  More than 30 years ago, Republicans and Democrats amended the law to give public sector workers the option of comp time. This was a positive step, but it created double standards. It is time to ease this double standard by leveling the playing field between private sector employees and government workers when it comes to workplace flexibility. That is exactly what this bill does. It is a commonsense idea that should receive the support of workers on both sides of the aisle.  As my colleague from Alabama said, the decision to choose comp time is completely voluntary and requires a written agreement between the worker and employer. Those who want to continue receiving cash wages as overtime pay are always free to do so. It also explicitly prohibits employers from coercing workers into electing comp time.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is, again, about fairness, and it is so difficult for me to understand how Democrats would be opposed to that. We should have the same rules in the private sector as we do in the public sector. I think that Democrats have run out of excuses not to provide workers this choice. All we are doing here is giving a choice.  No one, Republican nor Democrat, should think they know what is best for individual workers and their families.  Mr.Speaker, when we vote on this bill this week, I hope all of our colleagues will come to their senses and see that they are discriminating against the private sector by denying them the opportunity to take their overtime as comp time and that they will vote with us.  Again, I thank my colleague from Alabama for her leadership on this Special Order, but particularly her willingness to introduce this bill and take the lead in promoting it.

Just as these vets visited their respective memorials, so, too, should the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve in the ongoing war on terrorism in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the war that I was fighting 8 years ago. They, too, should have something to honor their sacrifice.  Under current law, a war must be over for at least 10 years before a memorial can be built in its honor. That is why Representative Moulton and I have introduced legislation that would allow for a global war on terrorism memorial.  This war is unlike any preceding it. It has no end date. There will be no victory date, no V-J Threats continue to rise, and so the longest ongoing conflict continues. After 15 years, and over 6,800 American lives lost, there is still no end in sight.  This memorial is for the brave men and women who have died fighting, who continue to fight, and are still joining the fight against terrorism. If we are going to continue passing the torch from one generation to the next, we need to build this memorial so that future generations never forget their duty to do the same and to pass that torch.

2252,topic-id,542,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I think we ought to be on a roll here, given the last amendment being accepted on a ``yes'' vote.  This amendment would make America more secure by focusing our very limited tax dollars on programs to keep nuclear material out of the hands of terrorists rather than excess national laboratory infrastructure spending.  According to The Washington Post, the world dodged a bullet when ISIS failed to realize that it had the ingredients for a dirty bomb under its control in Mosul for more than 3 years. This underscores the importance of the need for U.leadership and resources to secure nuclear material around the world.  My amendment would provide an increase of $118 million for the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, DNN, funding. DNN funding includes critical programs such as the nuclear smuggling and detection program, which works with partner countries to improve intelligence, law enforcement, and border security capabilities to detect nuclear material trafficking.  It also supports programs to improve the security of radiological material around the world and to remove it from areas when nuclear materials cannot be adequately and safely secured.  The Make America Secure Appropriations Act makes significant cuts to these programs which keep nuclear material out of the hands of terrorists and those who would then use that material to do us harm. For example, there is a 30 percent cut from the nuclear smuggling detection funding, a 79 percent cut from the highly enriched uranium reduction programs, and, overall, a $150 million cut to this program.  At the same time, the underlying legislation would increase by 38 percent, a plus-up above what the administration recommended for the weapons activities infrastructure recapitalization budget line. This increase was not requested by the administration and is not supported by the The underlying bill already includes a $59 million increase in infrastructure recapitalization spending and a $71 million increase over the fiscal year 2017-enacted level for maintenance and repair facilities.  We can go on and on. We have heard discussions here already about the trillion-dollar-plus expansion of the nuclear weapons programs.  Specifically, this money that I would move out of this particular infrastructure recapitalization account is for the construction of a new facility to build nuclear plutonium pits. These pits are presumably going to be needed for a weapon that is almost certainly not going to be built, which is the interoperable new bomb.  The interoperable weapon is to go on existing and remodeled rockets for the Navy and for the Air Force, neither of whom thinks it is a particularly good idea. So that program, should it ever come to pass, could be delayed, and we could then use this $118 million now to deal with a known problem.  If, in the future, we decide that we need to be able to produce somewhere between 30 and 80 new pits a year, there is time enough to do that. The account that calls for the maintenance of the existing facilities will provide sufficient funds to meet all of the known needs, with the exception of the interoperable nuclear weapon, which, in all probability, is not ever going to be built or needed.

2256,topic-id,317,"That might be sufficient, Mr.Chairman, although I doubt I will persuade the worthy chairman with whom we have had this little tussle back and forth.  The fact of the matter is that there are two accounts to deal with this issue of the nuclear sites and the maintenance of them.                              {time}  2145  One is a maintenance facility, which is plussed-up and sufficient to maintain and upgrade the existing facilities, particularly the plutonium pit, the metallurgical facility, as well as continue the construction of the highly enriched uranium facilities.[[Page H6443]]  Those are already available and that money is in those accounts. It turns out that this money for recapitalization is for the construction of a new pit production facility. The NNSA claims that it needs that facility to build additional pits beyond the 20 to 30 that could be constructed in the refurbished existing pit.  The need for the new pit production facility is specifically for the interoperable nuclear warhead, which is not likely to be needed. And should it be decided at a future date to be needed, there is plenty of time to build the facility and construct the additional nuclear plutonium pits. The bottom line is that this money is not needed now for that facility.  Could the money be used in the nonproliferation?  It could.  Why were those agreements delayed?  Because of many different reasons, but the fact of the matter is that those agreements are going to be going forward. The fact of the matter is that there is a continuing problem of loose nukes and materials around the world, which can cause a problem. The Mosul situation is one of many examples.  The cuts that do take place in smuggling, in research, and the like are serious. We ought to be paying attention.

2365,topic-id,5549,"Mr.Speaker, President Trump recently signed an executive order that made abundant sense for those who are in the world of common sense where good sense is common, which at least is not the case in the Federal courthouse in San  Our friend, Andrew McCarthy, has written an op-ed for National Review regarding the decision of the oligarch masquerading in the Federal courthouse in San Judge William Orrick III is amazing. In fact, his arrogance is only exceeded by his ignorance.  It is an excellent article. Normally I wouldn't read an entire article, it is not that long, but this is so well written by the prosecutor of The Blind Sheikh that it bears hearing the words from Andrew  He said: ``A showboating Federal judge in San Francisco has issued an injunction against President Trump's executive order cutting off Federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities. The ruling distorts the E.beyond recognition, accusing the President of usurping legislative authority despite the order's express adherence to `existing law.' Moreover, undeterred by the inconvenience that the order has not been enforced, the activist court--better to say, the fantasist court--dreams up harms that might befall San Francisco and Santa Clara, the sanctuary jurisdictions behind the suit, if it were enforced. The court thus flouts the standing doctrine, which limits judicial authority to actual controversies involving concrete, nonspeculative harms.  ``Although he vents for 49 pages, Judge William Orrick III gives away the game early, on page 4. There, the Obama appointee explains that his ruling is about . . . nothing.  ``That is, Orrick acknowledges that he is adopting the construction of the E.urged by the Trump Justice Department, which maintains that the order does nothing more than call for the enforcement of already existing law. Although that construction is completely consistent with the E.as written, Judge Orrick implausibly describes it as `implausible.' ''  I would interject at this point, Mr.Speaker, that upon hearing President Trump's executive order requiring sanctuary cities such as San Francisco, where their heart is so calloused on the side figuratively facing people like Kate Steinle, innocent people who are just trying to live freely their own lives, and is greatly softened on the side of those criminals who have come into the United States illegally who would tend to shoot lovely, law-abiding daughters like  So it seemed eminently reasonable what I had read was in the order. I didn't read the whole order originally, but it made eminent sense, of course, the President of the United States saying that he is authorized by the Constitution in carrying out enforcement and by Congress in carrying out enforcement, saying we are not sending Federal money to sanctuary cities--to any cities--that are refusing to use the money for the purpose for which it is intended. That makes eminent sense, because if you are not going to follow Federal law, if it is made clear to the whole world that you would rather see people like Kate Steinle shot and killed dead so that you can have criminals committing the worst kinds of violence on law-abiding citizens. That makes sense to these people who are ruling in San One ruler is Judge Orrick who we reference here.  There was a time in America when people in power thought it was a good idea for everyone to follow the law. But we have devolved in some areas of the country where we are no longer a nation of laws, where at least at one time there was a goal of pursuing absolute fairness where everyone could live under the same laws following the same laws. There was that time.  Yet we have people who are educated far beyond their mental ability to absorb education since it has used up all the gigabytes that might have otherwise been used for wisdom for cluttered knowledge that has prevented this judge and others from being able to use common sense to follow the law to protect people who are counting on the courts and law enforcement officers to follow and enforce the law themselves.  There was that time when Manifest Destiny was being pursued, people were moving The areas West were not actual States within the United There was a lawlessness. People were yearning in those territories to be States so that they could count on the Federal Government to provide fairness--ultimate fairness--and provide a life that would be lived under the United States They felt, in those days, if we could just get the Federal Government to have a Federal marshal here and a Federal Court here, wow, life would be so much better. Now we have seen it has lived beyond the usefulness it once had and has become quite a burden to overcome in reaching fairness and constitutionality.  So, Mr.Speaker, before I continue with Andy McCarthy's piece, I want to point out we are in preparation of a bill that would eliminate any Federal district court or circuit court from having jurisdiction over matters regarding immigration. Certainly, we had that power. In fact, we have the power to eliminate the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals altogether. We have a bill that would, in fact, limit the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to California, and all of the other States that comprise the Ninth Circuit would be part of a new 12th In that new 12th Circuit, whoever the current President is when the law is passed would appoint the entire banc of judges for the 12th Circuit Court of  Following the Reid rule in the Senate, if we were to get that passed through the House and Senate, I feel sure President Trump would sign it into law, and then President Trump would have an entire circuit where he appoints the judges, where people would know they would have judges of the quality of Judge Gorsuch--at least the quality he is supposed to represent--and people would know they weren't going to get oligarchs as judges, they were going to get people who at least maintain some semblance of trying to follow the Constitution and trying to live up to the oath that they took to defend the Constitution--just support the Constitution for goodness' sake.  McCarthy goes on. He says: ``Since Orrick ultimately agrees with the Trump Justice Department, and since no enforcement action has been taken based on the E.O., why not just dismiss the case? Why the judicial theatrics?  ``There appear to be two reasons.  ``The first is Orrick's patent desire to embarrass the White House, which rolled out the E.with great fanfare. The court wants it understood that Trump is a pretender: For all the hullaballoo, the E.effectively did nothing. Indeed, Orrick rationalizes his repeated misreadings of what the order actually says by feigning disbelief that what it says could possibly be what it means. Were that the case, he suggests, there would have been no reason to issue the order in the first place.  ``Thus, taking a page from the activist leftwing judges who invalidated[[Page H2888]]Trump's `travel ban' orders, Orrick harps on stump speeches by Trump and other administration officials. One wonders how well Barack `If you like your plan, you can keep your plan' Obama would have fared under the judiciary's new Trump doctrine: The extravagant political rhetoric by which the incumbent President customarily sells his policies relieves a court of the obligation to grapple with the inevitably more modest legal text of the directives that follow.  ``Of course, the peer branches of government are supposed to presume each other's good faith in the absence of a patent violation of the law. But let's put aside the unseemliness of Orrick's barely concealed contempt for a moment, because he is also wrong. The proper purpose of an executive order is to direct the operations of the executive branch within the proper bounds of the law. There is, therefore, nothing untoward about an E.that directs the President's subordinates to take enforcement action within the confines of congressional statutes. In fact, it is welcome.  ``It is the President's burden to set Federal law enforcement priorities. After years of Obama's lax enforcement of immigration law and apathy regarding sanctuary jurisdictions, an E.openly manifesting an intent to execute the laws vigorously can have a salutary effect. And indeed, indications are that the cumulative effect of Trump's more zealous approach to enforcement, of which the sanctuary-city E.is just one component, has been a significant reduction in the number of aliens seeking to enter the U.illegally.''                              {time}  1715  ``In any event, 8 years of Obama's phone and pen have made it easy to forget that the President is not supposed to make the law, and thus that we should celebrate, not condemn, an E.that does not break new legal ground. Orrick, by contrast, proceeds from the flawed premise that if a President is issuing an E.O., it simply must be his purpose to usurp congressional authority. Then he censures Trump for a purported usurpation that is nothing more than a figment of his own very active imagination.''  He is talking about the judge here. What an imagination.  ``Orrick's second reason for issuing his Ruling About Nothing is to rationalize what is essentially an advisory opinion. It holds--I know you'll be shocked to hear this--that if Trump ever did try to cut off funds from sanctuary cities, it would be an epic violation of the Given that courts are supposed to refrain from issuing advisory opinions, the Constitution is actually more aggrieved by Orrick than by  ``In a nutshell, the court claims that the E.is Presidential legislation, an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers. Orrick insists that the E.directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to cut off any Federal funds that would otherwise go to States and municipalities if they `willfully refuse to comply' with Federal law that calls for State and local cooperation in enforcing immigration law.  ``According to Judge Orrick, Trump's E.is heedless of whether Congress has approved any terminations of State funding from Federal programs it has enacted. In one of the opinion's most disingenuous passages, Orrick asserts that the E.`directs the Attorney General and the Homeland Security Secretary to ensure that ``sanctuary jurisdictions'' are ``not eligible to receive'' Federal grants.'  ``But this is just not true.''  In other words, Judge Orrick lied in his opinion.  ``Orrick has omitted key context from the relevant passage, which actually states that `the Attorney General and the Secretary, in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.1373 are not eligible to receive Federal grants.'  ``In plain English, the President has expressly restricted his subordinates to the limits that Congress has enacted. Under Trump's order, there can be no suspension or denial of funding from a Federal program unless congressional statutes authorize it. The President is not engaged in an Obama-esque rewrite of Federal law; he explicitly ordered his subordinates to follow Federal law.  ``It is not enough to say Orrick mulishly ignores the clear text of the executive order. Again and again, Justice Department lawyers emphasized to the court that Trump's order explicitly reaffirmed existing law. Orrick refused to listen because, well, what fun would that be? If the President is simply directing that the law be followed, there is no basis for a progressive judge''--like Orrick--``to accuse him of violating the law. Were he to concede that, how would Orrick then win this month's Social Justice Warrior in a Robe Award for Telling Donald Trump What for?  ``Orrick can't confine himself to merely inventing a violation, either, because there is no basis for a lawsuit unless a violation results in real damages. So, the judge also has to fabricate some harm. This takes some doing since, in addition to merely directing that the law be enforced, the Trump administration has not actually taken any action against any sanctuary jurisdiction to this point.  ``No problem: Orrick theorizes that because San Francisco and Santa Clara receive lots of government funding, Trump's order afflicts them with `pre-enforcement' anxiety. They quake in fear that their safety-net and service budgets will be slashed.''  Mr.Speaker, I would inject that it appears that Judge Orrick and leaders in San Francisco must be deeply in need of a safe space where they can go sit in the dark, suck their thumbs, hold their blankets, and feel comforted somehow because of the illusions that they have generated of all these bugaboos that are threatening in their wild imaginations.  Mr.McCarthy goes on:  ``Sanctuary cities? Maybe we should call them snowflake cities.  ``As noted above, there is a transparent agenda behind Orrick's sleight of hand. The judge is keen to warn the President that, if ever his administration were to deny funds to sanctuary cities, it would violate the It is in connection with this advisory opinion that the judge makes the only point worthy of consideration--albeit not in the case before him.  ``Here, it is useful to recall the Supreme Court's first ObamaCare ruling. While conservatives inveighed against Chief Justice Roberts' upholding of the individual mandate, the decision had a silver lining: The majority invalidated ObamaCare's Medicaid mandate, which required the States, as a condition of qualifying for Federal Medicaid funding, to enforce the Federal Government's generous new Medicaid qualifications.  ``In our system, the States are sovereign--the Federal Government may not dictate to them in areas of traditional State regulation, nor may it conscript them to enforce Federal law. The Supremes, therefore, explained that State agreements to accept Federal funding in return for adopting Federal standards, e.g., to accept highway funding in exchange for adopting the Federally prescribed 55-mile-per-hour speed limit, are like contracts. The State must agree to the Federal Government's terms. Once such an agreement is reached, the Feds may not unilaterally make material changes in the terms, nor may they use their superior bargaining position to extort a State into acceding to onerous new terms in order to get the Federal money on which it has come to depend. Whether a particular case involves such an extortion, as opposed to a permissible nudge, depends on the facts. If the Feds are too heavy-handed, they run the risk of violating the 10th Amendment's Federalist division of powers.  ``Who knew Federal judges in ur-statist San Francisco had become such Federalists?  ``Orrick contends that if Trump were to cut off funds from sanctuary cities for failure to assist Federal immigration-enforcing officials, it would offend the 10th This is highly unlikely. First, let's remember--though Orrick studiously forgets--that Trump's order endorses only such stripping of funds as Congress has already approved. Thus, sanctuary jurisdictions would be ill-suited to claim that they'd been sandbagged. Second, the money likely to be at issue would surely be nothing close to Medicaid funding. Finally, Trump would not be[[Page H2889]]unilaterally rewriting an existing Federal-State contract; he'd be calling for the States to follow Federal laws that, A, were on the books when the States started taking Federal money and, B, pertain to immigration, a legal realm in which the courts have held the Federal Government is supreme and the States subordinate.  ``Still, all that said, whether any Trump-administration effort to cut off funding would run afoul of the 10th Amendment would depend on such considerations as how much funding was actually cut; whether Congress had authorized the cut in designing the funding program; whether the funding was tightly related or unrelated to immigration enforcement; and how big a burden it would be for States to comply with Federal demands. Those matters will be impossible to evaluate unless and until the administration actually directs a slashing of funds to a sanctuary jurisdiction.  ``If that happens, there will almost certainly be no legal infirmity as long as Trump's E.means what it says--namely, that any funding cuts must be consistent with existing Federal law. But it hasn't happened.''  And for our poor, miseducated Judge Orrick sitting on the bench with his head crammed full of mush, but none of it entangled with the U.Constitution, he fails to understand that Federal courts are not allowed to issue advisory opinions. There is no standing. There is no jurisdiction of the court. But don't let the Constitution nor Federal law get in the way of Judge Orrick's ego.  McCarthy points out:  ``If that happens . . . any funding cuts must be consistent with Federal law. But it hasn't happened. And as long as it hasn't happened, there is no basis for a court to involve itself, much less issue an anticipatory ruling.  ``Such niceties only matter if you are practicing law, though. Judge Orrick is practicing politics.''  Mr.Speaker, this is exactly the kind of judge that really should be removed from office. He is allowed to sit as long as he exhibits good conduct, but this is not the conduct that is good, when he takes an oath to be judicious, follow the law, and defend the It is certainly unbecoming to a judge.  Yes, here in Congress we debate and go back and forth. Before the courts, lawyers go back and forth. But the judge is supposed to be judicious and follow the law.  It is time for us to take away all authority of any Federal district court, any Federal magistrate, any Federal judge of any kind other than the Supreme Court when it comes to issues such as this.  We have created immigration courts, but when it comes to appeals and to lawsuits filed regarding immigration and naturalization, I think, Mr.Speaker, we should restrict that to the one and only Federal court that, as Professor Gwen used to say in constitutional law at Baylor, only one court in the United States Federal system that owes its existence to the                              {time}  1730  All other Federal courts of any kind owe their existence and their jurisdiction to the United States So the Congress giveth when it comes to courts, and the Congress can taketh away. It is time to start removing authority from some of these courts that Congress has created that have now created more problems than they have solved.  An article here by Stephen Dinan and Andrea Noble in The Washington Times basically says what so many of the news media did that a Federal judge, Judge Orrick, says Trump is wrong to tie Federal funding to sanctuary status and blocks the executive order. But really it turns out, when you get the actual order and you find out what really happened, there was no such order because there was no violation. There was no harm. The plaintiffs had no standing. The court had no jurisdiction. This is a zero in the effect in this country other than the politics that this Federal judge was playing.  Unfortunately, when a Federal judge acquires a lifetime appointment and he starts running for an office he already holds when there is no opponent, he is acting outside the realm of the Constitution, and we really should have debates over what good conduct means. It doesn't matter whether or not a judge voted Republican, Socialist, Libertarian, it doesn't matter. If he or she is not acting within the confines of their oath, they need to be removed from the bench.  I do hope, Mr.Speaker, we will take up--I know my friend Darrell Issa and others have filed bills about the Ninth Circuit Court that has more cases filed in it because lawyers know it is more likely to gut the U.Constitution and ignore the Constitution, so anybody who has a claim that is not particularly meritorious under the Constitution, as written, wants to be in the Ninth Circuit because there they have got a shot that the oligarchs out there will do what a judge basically is quoted as saying before, that, gee, we know we don't follow the Constitution or we don't care about precedent, don't care what the Supreme Court says, but that is why we come out with so many decisions. We know the Supreme Court can't reverse them all.  That is a court that really ought to be disbanded. When you have a court that is ignoring their oath, ignoring the Constitution, it is just really time to get rid of it.  We have a report, too, Mr.Speaker, after the great work of the two main leaders--and I do mean that in every good sense of the term ``leaders''--Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan, especially Mark Meadows, working in the last couple weeks, working to try to have a solution even though, apparently, according to one of my colleagues who is not a part of the Freedom Caucus, he was hoping that we would stay here until we got an agreement on a healthcare bill but was told, no, we want the Freedom Caucus to go home and let their constituents yell at them, and then they will be ready to sign or vote for whatever we put in front of them.  Actually, most of us, it sounds like from our discussions, have been reaffirmed and encouraged by our constituents. In my case, it certainly felt like, as I traveled throughout east Texas, apparently not being at the places where the Democrats who call themselves Indivisible were appearing, but going to veterans' groups, chambers of commerce, banquets, meeting with many constituents, but hearing about three-fourths of the time, which was my percentage, basically, with which I won the last general election, people are saying: Hang in there. Don't give up.  So with the encouragement of constituents that most of us in the Freedom Caucus have had, we came back still willing to negotiate, still trying to work. Mark Meadows has done some good work.  I still have trouble understanding why we didn't just go ahead and bring to the floor, bring out of committee--it has been through committee before--the bill 2 years ago. I mean, it had hearings, passed out of the House and It repealed most of ObamaCare, not all of it, but more than the current bill being taken up in this Why not just bring that to the floor? Then we pass that, and we could take other steps. One that is absolutely critical--and I do applaud Speaker Ryan for bringing it to the floor. It was a very critical step in getting competition in health insurance, not to be confused with health care.  For too long, going back to 1993 when Hillary Rodham Clinton was talking about everybody deserves health care, she was using ``health care'' and ``health insurance'' as if they were synonymous. Those terms are not synonymous. People can get health care without health insurance. I know because, after ObamaCare was passed, Congress was mandated to have ObamaCare, and then President Obama, Harry Reid, and John Boehner, as Speaker--come to think of it, all three people who are no longer in positions of power--came together, and they agreed to act as if the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, did not say that Members of Congress could no longer receive the subsidy that every Federal employee in America gets to help pay for healthcare insurance. So they just ignored the law, made very clear. Even though every other Federal employee gets that assistance--and with my wife and me paying off kids' student loans, because if I had never run for elected office, they had money set aside, that we had set aside, would have paid for every year of their college. We didn't think that they should have to have big student loan debt because their father felt[[Page H2890]]the calling to be a public servant. So we are paying off student loans, and this will be the first year that I will be able to file a financial disclosure that doesn't have student loan debt listed because when it falls below $10,000, you don't have to list it. So we have made progress.  But because of that, we were not in a position to pay the massive amount that the insurance was going to cost, so I went without insurance up here in I know what it is to have health care and not have health insurance. I still don't have government-funded or healthcare insurance here. I have insurance now, but it is not through the Federal So I understand the difference between insurance and health care.  I look forward to the day when we keep blurring that line because, when the line is totally blurred, then Americans are more easily duped into allowing the Federal Government to turn the best health care in the world's history into VA-styled problems of treating people. Most of us don't want that. Most Americans don't want that. They didn't want it in 2010. They don't want it now.  But the bill Speaker Ryan brought to the floor had over 400 votes, and it is an important bill. We are going to bring down the costs, have real competition in health care and in health insurance; and what that bill did was eliminate the exemption from antitrust laws that health insurance companies have had since the McCarran-Ferguson bill passed in 1945. Although people have talked more about buying insurance across State lines, the fact is, if we don't end the exemption from antitrust laws of health insurance companies and we do allow people to buy their insurance across State lines, then instead of having 30 to 50 monopolies as we may have now in the health insurance business, we will end up with one monopoly in the whole country; because, if you don't have to follow antitrust laws, if you don't have to avoid taking actions to create monopolies and to force others out of business using antitrust tactics, then you can become the monopoly, and you will become the monopoly.  If it is legal for an insurance company that is the biggest insurance company in a town, State, or country to go to a hospital or go to a healthcare network and say, you know, we have got most all of the health insurance business in the country and we want to put you in our network, but you are going to have to agree to let us pay you a fraction of what you normally would get, and if you ever allow any of these new entrepreneurial health insurance companies to have you in their network, then we will cut you out of our network.  Well, hospitals, networks in their right minds would say, we can't turn these people down, we will go out of business because they are the big company. If we are not in their network, then we will go out of business. But, unfortunately, that would also mean all these other brilliant entrepreneurial-type insurance ideas, whether it is Medi-Share, Christians coming together and sharing expenses, whatever it is, the big monopoly health insurance company can run them out of business, and that needs to be prevented.  I applaud the Republican leadership for bringing that bill to the floor. I applaud the leadership, people like Paul Gosar, Gosar, and Austin They have done a good job, and I would like to think I have been pretty vocal on that issue as well. We had a vote on that, and over 400 people voted to end the exemption from antitrust laws of health insurance companies.  I know good and well, if the Senate brings that same bill to the Senate floor, it will also have a huge--I don't know if it would be unanimous, but it would certainly be a huge victory. It would certainly be bipartisan to pass it. I think that is the kind of thing Americans are wanting to see.  But as I talk to people around east Texas, most people have never heard of that because the newspapers around east Texas are more interested usually in talking about this Democratic group that calls itself Indivisible, as if everybody doesn't know that they are basically                              {time}  1745  I think a meeting that called itself a townhall over in Longview got all kinds of good press. It was sponsored, as I understand it, by Democratic Women of Gregg County and Stonewall, a Democratic group. It wasn't a local group, the Stonewall group. Anyway, I would be busy around the rest of the district at Chamber banquets, meetings, and things like that.  But it has been refreshing to talk to real Americans, people that are just trying to make a living, people that are just trying to pay their bills. I know some people talk in bold terms about how we are on vacation. But it is fantastic when Members of Congress go home and hear from their constituents. And I do. I hear those, Mr.Speaker, that are part of the 26 percent that want to keep But I sure have my heart set on keeping our promises.  In my district, the 74 percent said: ``We need ObamaCare repealed. We need the Federal Government to get out of our private lives. We need better jobs. We need the economy going much stronger.''  I am excited about President Trump's proposal that he rolled out today. Having talked to my friend Kevin Brady, a good friend from Texas, the plan they are rolling out, I have come to have very grave concerns about the border adjustment tax.  But if we do as President Trump proposed, bring our corporate tax down to 15 percent, as the President proposed today, manufacturing jobs will come rushing back to They will.  I know there are the pseudointellectual elites that like to tell themselves that we have evolved somehow into this service society where we don't denigrate ourselves to the point that a lot of us have been throughout our lives, and so no problem, and that is doing hard labor, producing products, and manufacturing. It is a good thing.  America needs manufacturing jobs back. It is a good thing to have a job. I know there are those that are quite cynical, those who are atheist, agnostic, and other religions. But for those who believe the teaching in the Bible, when God created the world and there was a Garden of Eden, everything was perfect. And even in a perfect Garden of Eden, God felt like it was good for people to have a job. So he gave Adam and Eve a job. He said: Your job is tending the garden. And in some form or other, Mr.Speaker, that is the job we have--tending the magnificent garden.  We can use the resources, we can continue to make the world better--cleaner air and cleaner water. Nobody wants dirty water and dirty air. And it is continuing to be clean in Texas, whether there were a Federal EPA or not. Our agencies in Texas are doing a good job.  Our Federal Government needs to allow the brilliance, the creativeness, and the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans to bloom. If we drop the largest tariff that any nation in the industrialized world places on its own products, if we get rid of that, or at least drop that down to 15 percent, manufacturing jobs will return to America and our economy will explode for the better.  Some of these young people that have come out of school--high school, college, graduate studies--so many have no idea what it is to have countering offers for their employment. They don't know. They had to move home and live at home for awhile. But it is exciting when you are wanted by more than one employer, and money is offered, and it is good money. It makes you feel good about yourself. Mr.Speaker, I am ready, like most Americans, to see that happening in America again so our young people can have that feeling of self-worth because there are so many jobs.  One of the first steps was to repeal ObamaCare and allow health care that would be affordable--insurance that would be affordable. Well, the bill we are taking up is not going to do that. But I have advised the House leadership, Republican leadership, and the President and Vice President that I will vote for the bill in its current form. It is not what I wanted.  It is not a full repeal, but it does enough now that it will bring down premiums. And it won't be 10 years under the law the way it is written right now.  It protects those who have preexisting conditions.  It allows people 26 years of age and younger--I wouldn't mind it being 50,[[Page H2891]]but it is 26--be on their parents' insurance as dependents. That is not being touched. That is there.  But some of the mandates are being repealed the way it sits now. I am not thrilled with it. But I have talked to enough people that have just got to have help on the premiums. The bill, the way it was, was not going to help them. We have got the bill to a point where it will help much more quickly with premium assistance.  I am looking forward to getting that behind us, moving on to dropping the corporate tax rate to 15 percent so we can return manufacturing jobs in droves, and seeing this economy explode.  There is reason to be optimistic. Not everybody is as mindless as Judge Orrick, so there is reason for optimism.

2294,topic-id,728,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will protect American jobs and the economy by prohibiting funds from being used to implement the Obama administration's flawed Social Cost of Carbon, or SCC, valuation. This job-killing and unlawful guidance sneakily attempts to pave the way for cap-and-trade-like mandates.  Congress and the American people have repeatedly rejected cap-and-trade proposals. Knowing that he could not lawfully enact a carbon tax plan, President Obama attempted to circumvent Congress by playing loose and fast with the Clean Air Act to unilaterally implement this unlawful new requirement under the guise of guidance.  The Obama administration continuously used the SCC valuation models, which can be easily manipulated, to try and justify new job-killing regulations.  Although President Trump issued an executive order in March to disband the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, Federal[[Page H6457]]agencies continue to work on the SCC valuation.  My amendment is necessary to strengthen the intent of President Trump's executive order while also ensuring that it is Congress, not the executive branch, which sets tax and environmental policy.  The committee wisely issued guidance in the bill report to delay the promulgation of SCC regulations until a new working group is convened. My amendment explicitly prohibits funds from being used to implement the deeply flawed Social Cost of Carbon guidance in the bill text.  The House has a clear, consistent, and strong record of opposition to the Social Cost of My colleagues voted in favor of my amendment in FY17 appropriations by a clear majority of 230-188.  In fact, the House has decisively voted 10 times to block, defund, or oppose the Social Cost of Carbon since 2013. My amendment ensures this Chamber's position remains consistent and crystal clear in  Roger Martella, a self-described lifelong environmentalist and career environmental lawyer, testified at the May 2015 House Natural Resources Committee hearing on the revised SCC guidance and the flaws associated with the Social Cost of Carbon model, stating that the ``'Social Cost of Carbon' estimates suffer from a number of significant flaws that should exclude them from the NEPA process.''  Amongst these flaws are, one, that the ``projected costs of carbon emissions can be manipulated by changing key parameters such as timeframes, discount rates, and other values that have no relation to a given project undergoing review.''  Two, ``OMB and the other Federal agencies developed the draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates without any known peer review or opportunity for public comment during the development process.''  Three, ``OMB's draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates are based primarily on global rather than domestic costs and benefits.''  Four, ``there is still considerable uncertainty in many of the assumptions and data elements used to create the draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates, such as the damage functions and modeled time horizons.''  Mr.Martella's testimony was spot on. Congress, not Washington bureaucrats, should dictate our country's climate change policy. The sweeping and costly changes that the Social Cost of Carbon metric would impose are not only misguided and unwise, they are also based on fundamentally flawed policies that sidestepped Congress, did not go through the normal regulatory process, and received no public comment.  Worse yet, the model utilized to predict the Social Cost of Carbon can be easily manipulated to arrive at the desired outcome.  Regardless of one's positions on climate change, my colleagues surely must respect the constitutional role of the legislative branch and oppose bureaucratic efforts to circumvent Congress to impose an extremist environmental agenda that is not based on best available science.  Congress must provide certainty to business and consumers that the costly and scientifically bankrupt Social Cost of Carbon valuation will not creep its way into our regulatory process.  My amendment provides that certainty.  Over the last 2 years, this effort has received support from the American Energy Alliance, Americans for Limited Government, Americans for Tax Reform, Arch Coal, Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, FreedomWorks, National Mining Association, the National Taxpayers Union, and Taxpayers Protection  Congress, not anonymous Washington bureaucrats, should dictate our country's tax and climate change policy.

2433,topic-id,469,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.806, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017, introduced by my friend and colleague, Pete This bill is necessary to shield States from job-killing mandates and ozone levels proposed by the Obama administration in October of 2015.  Most States are just beginning to adopt the 75 parts per billion ozone standard proposed in 2008, as the EPA didn't announce implementation guidance and a final rule until March 6 of 2015. Rather than allowing time for that standard to be implemented, the Obama administration moved the goalposts and unilaterally sought to dramatically lower the ozone standard once again to 70 parts per billion in October 2015.  Industry analysis projects that more than 950 different counties throughout the country will immediately be in nonattainment under the October 2015, 70 parts per billion standard. To make matters worse, the 70 parts per billion standard is not currently attainable in 9 of 10 counties in Arizona that measure ozone levels.  When pristine national parks like the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and Rocky Mountain are in danger of being in nonattainment under the proposed Obama standard, there is a serious problem with the numbers.  The Chamber of Commerce has reported that counties classified as in nonattainment can have important permits denied by the EPA and important Federal highway and transportation projects suspended.  The Arizona Chamber Foundation and Prosper Foundation stated: ``The EPA's new ozone standard of 70 parts per billion will virtually be impossible for Arizona to meet due to Arizona's high level of background, limited local sources, and unique geography. . . . Implementation of the current rule in Arizona is not reasonable, based in sound science, or achievable.''  Tri-State stated: ``In order to preserve our co-op-member owners access to affordable and reliable electricity, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association wholeheartedly supports H.806.''[[Page H5947]]  The National Taxpayer Union stated: ``The costs are high for States and localities, regardless of whether they achieve attainment . . . jobs and investments will go elsewhere without more feasible, predictable reforms that are present in H.806.''  Even the Obama administration projected in 2010 the unrealistic standard we are debating today would cost our economy between $19 to $25 billion annually.  The previous administration also admitted it did not have a clear plan for dealing with background ozone generated by factors outside a State's control. This means the Obama EPA was literally attempting to punish States for ozone pollution that is created in other States like California, or in Mexico, or even  The October 2015 Obama ozone rule will force companies to close their doors and kill countless jobs throughout the country if this bill is not passed.

2182,topic-id,1028,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the significance of the unprecedented events now occurring in Puerto  According to the May 16 editorial in the Wall Street Journal, ``The legal brawl over Puerto Rico's bankruptcy begins this week, and it will be long and ugly.''  As we have seen in Greece and Detroit, what is happening in Puerto Rico should be a wake-up call for fiscally distressed States--meaning our 50 States, our cities, and our territories--to get their own houses in order. It is the canary in the mine that ought to be available to everybody. At the same time, it should be a cautionary tale for those who seek to extend similar bankruptcy authority to our own 50  In 2015, after years of fiscal mismanagement and borrowing to finance their operations, Puerto Rico declared that its debt was unpayable and had to be restructured; however, because Puerto Rico lacked access to chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, restructuring its complex debt outside of the court presented a challenge.  I held a hearing in the Judiciary Committee to examine this issue in December of 2015. We learned at that hearing that while bankruptcy is an effective tool to restructure debt, it merely treats the symptom and it doesn't solve the disease. I told you so, in that vein. I shared my views and the views of many others that unless Puerto Rico addressed its fiscal mismanagement woes, extending bankruptcy authority alone couldn't fix the problem. I told you so that, instead, it would merely kick the can down the road and harm thousands of retirees in Iowa and elsewhere who would bear the costs of Puerto Rico's irresponsible fiscal behavior. The Obama administration, though, pressed Congress to act and to provide Puerto Rico with an orderly bankruptcy-like process to restructure its debt.  According to the testimony of one Treasury official, ``Without a comprehensive restructuring framework, Puerto Rico will continue to default on its debt, and litigation will intensify. . . . As the cascading defaults and litigation unfold, there is real risk of another lost decade, this one more damaging than the last.'' So now, even with a comprehensive restructuring framework, there is still a real risk of another lost decade.  Ultimately, this debt restructuring framework was coupled with an independent oversight board and adopted as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, referred to as This approach,[[Page S3116]]we were told, would tackle Puerto Rico's debt crisis in an orderly way and would help to remedy the years of fiscal mismanagement. Nevertheless, I remained concerned that PROMESA and its bankruptcy-like provisions would invite years of litigation and uncertainty due to the lack of existing court precedent.  So it should be no surprise that a recent Bloomberg article titled ``Puerto Rico's Bankruptcy Fight is About to Plunge Into the Unknown'' described the bankruptcy process as ``a circular firing'' squad with ``no established rule book to shape what comes next.'' The article reports that one market analyst ``foresees a chaotic brew of lawsuits'' because ``nobody has any idea what is going to happen.''  According to one news report, this is just the beginning, as PROMESA's bankruptcy provisions are ``more likely to face years of appeal than a typical case.''  Despite assurances otherwise, what happens next in the months and years to follow may be far-reaching and likely will impact us all. In particular, prior to the enactment of PROMESA, Puerto Rico, like the States, couldn't declare bankruptcy. I told you this last year, and it is as I predicted last year--granting Puerto Rico the authority to restructure all of its debts, including its State-like constitutional obligations, would be viewed as precedent for giving States similar authority.  I am not really surprised to see this is happening right now.  Getting back to the fact that I told the Senate a year ago. This past September, William Isaac, the former head of the FDIC, called on Congress to pass a law ``giv[ing] Illinois the option of utilizing chapter 9, which is akin to what Congress just did for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.''  The New York Times reported on May 3 that ``bankruptcy lawyers and public finance experts are watching Puerto Rico's case closely, to see if it shows a path that financially distressed states like Illinois might also one day take.''  The Chicago Tribune's editorial board recently wrote that investors are growing nervous about the talk of States seeking a bankruptcy system after the fashion of Puerto Rico, calling Puerto Rico ``the frightening ghost of Illinois future.''  The editorial wondered how much more difficult it would be for States to borrow money if lenders knew the States could shirk their obligations in bankruptcy when that debt becomes due.  For those who weren't listening to me last year, those who dismissed concerns that PROMESA would set a troubling and dangerous precedent should take notice and make sure that a one-time piece of legislation does not create a new norm. I hold out hope that PROMESA might manage to provide some help for Puerto  Success, though, will ultimately require strong leadership from the Commonwealth's leaders, which, for years, that leadership has been very lacking.  There is a lesson to be learned. The fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico should motivate all 50 States, our cities, and territories to find the courage now to make tough choices, which are the foundation of responsible governance, rather than look to the Federal Government and bankruptcy as a way out. If they do not, the effect could be long-lasting, harming the vulnerable both within their populations and outside of their borders.  Obviously, what a lot of smart people told us a year ago to solve Puerto Rico's debt problems simply has not worked out.  So at a time when States, citizens, and markets are all watching, we must stress fiscal responsibility and pay attention to what is happening there in Puerto Otherwise, the uncertainty and chaos we were assured would not come to pass may be just over the horizon.

I appreciate the gentlewoman championing this issue, and we have brought our kids here and know the challenges of juggling work and family--and we are not alone. As you said, many, many families in this country are facing these same challenges, and that is why I am so excited about your bill and so proud to sponsor it and stand with you tonight.  The family is really the foundation of our country, and to have strong families, we need to be able to make ways to encourage them to be together, especially for those special, special events. I know there are many, many moms and dads out there working today who would love to be able to have the flexibility of the workplace where they can take off and spend some time with their kids at the soccer game, or when they get that phone call from the school that their child is sick, please come pick them up, to be able to have that flexibility to do that and to take them to the doctor or to stay home with them if they are sick. Then, as families age, many families need to be with their parent or need to go to the doctor with them.  These are just commonsense things to allow that flexibility where you could work some overtime and choose, instead of having the extra money, you could choose to be able to use that to spend time with your family, those people that mean the most to you. That is just precious. It is priceless to be able to do that.

But yet, if you work for that small business in town or that manufacturer making a product and shipping it overseas, proud, made in U.S.A., sorry.

The CBO score will lay down an important marker for the repeal and replace efforts in the It will allow us to work to ensure that the House bill fits into the constraints of the reconciliation rules in the Senate, while we continue to strive toward our own policy goals to implement patient-centered healthcare and healthcare reforms that address cost and promote choice and competition.  I am very interested in what they say. These changes are more important than ever. Just today, we received a report from HHS that, from the time ObamaCare took effect through 2017, there was an average premium increase of 105 percent across the 39 States using healthcare.gov. This is just one snapshot of the runaway costs of ObamaCare, and it is just one of many examples indicating why we need to act as quickly as possible to repeal and replace the misguided law.  As the Senate continues to discuss the policy matters related to this effort, we will need to confront a number of different issues as we work to provide enduring reforms for our beleaguered healthcare system. As chairman of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over most of the salient issues under discussion, I want to make my views on these matters very clear.  First, it is my view that all of the ObamaCare taxes need to go. We should not be treating the ObamaCare taxes as a smorgasbord, picking and choosing which ones to keep and which to discard. I don't think there is a single tax increase in ObamaCare that has enjoyed support on this Republican side.  When all is said and done, the tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act represented a trillion-dollar hit on the economy in just the first 10 years. That is nearly 1 percent of the projected gross domestic product over the same period. In my view, it would be inappropriate, after spending the better part of a decade railing against ObamaCare's burdensome job-killing taxes, for us to then turn around and say that some of them are fine so long as they are being used to fund Republican healthcare proposals.  It is very simple. We need to repeal all of the ObamaCare taxes--the medical device tax, the health insurance tax, the so-called Cadillac tax, the taxes on healthcare savings and pharmaceuticals, and several others. They all have to go.  Second, we need to fully repeal the individual mandate. There has been some talk about keeping the mandate around temporarily, if nothing else, to help shore up the new system. But as I said with the ObamaCare taxes, Republicans have spent years condemning the individual mandate as an unconstitutional assault on individual liberty. We have also argued that it was ineffective and that it has failed to draw enough younger and healthier consumers into the insurance market in order to offset the cost of ObamaCare's draconian market reform mandates.  I don't see how we can now turn on a dime and say that the individual mandate is now somehow acceptable because we are using it to prop up a system that Republicans have designed. Like the taxes, the individual mandate, in my view, needs to be repealed. Lastly, we need to resist any temptation to alter the tax treatment of employer-provided health insurance as part of this particular exercise. Don't get me wrong. There have been a number of health reform proposals over the years that have dealt with this issue, including a legislative framework that I drafted, along with two of my colleagues. However, given the limitations we face in this current exercise and the fact that we are not starting from a blank slate but rather attempting to repeal a law that has been implemented for a number of years, we should be wary of the impact of pulling employer-sponsored insurance into this current debate.  The purpose of this budget reconciliation exercise to repeal and replace ObamaCare is to address costs in the individual markets. I believe it is important that everyone, whether they are Members of Congress, stakeholders in the business community, or living elsewhere in the country, manage their expectations about the possible outcomes of this process given the limitations we are facing.  While the constraints inherent to the budget reconciliation process may be inconvenient at the specific moment, they serve a number of important purposes. Under this process, the Senate will need to reduce the deficit by at least as much as the House bill. There is no way around that. The process for determining what provisions of the House bill will need to be changed is still ongoing. Of course, we will have to take a good long look at the numbers we get from CBO later today.  Not only do we need to take into account the CBO numbers and the budget rules, but we also need to consider what the best policy is, and, at the end of the day, what approach is doable. We can do a lot in this exercise, but we should not make this the be-all and end-all of our healthcare reform effort.  As I said before, everyone should be managing their expectations at this point. While we can and should be ambitious in our efforts, we need to be realistic about the limitations that exist and be willing to practice the art of the doable, to compromise, and to really recognize what issues will need to be set aside for another day.  None of this is going to be easy, but I believe we are up to the challenge. I look forward to working with my colleagues on these issues and to finding solutions that will help us keep the promises we made to our constituents.  I yield the floor.

2305,topic-id,638,"Mr.Chairman, with all the respect I have for Congressman Burgess, I oppose this damaging rider which would block the Department of Energy from implementing or enforcing commonsense energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs.  This rider was a bad idea when it was first offered 7 years ago, and it is even more unsupportable now. Why do I say that? Because every claim made by proponents of the rider have been proven wrong.  Number one, we have been told, including by Burgess, that the energy efficiency standards would ban incandescent lightbulbs. That is simply false. You can go to the store today and see shelves of modern energy efficient incandescent lightbulbs that meet the standard, and they are the same as the old bulbs except they last longer, use less electricity, and save consumers money.  Then we heard for years that the energy efficiency standards restrict consumer choice.                              {time}  2345  If you have shopped for lightbulbs lately, which I have, you know that isn't true. In fact, modern incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent lightbulbs, and LEDs of every shape, size, and color are now available.  Consumers have never had more choice, and the efficiency standard spurred innovation that dramatically expanded options for consumers. I am amazed how many shelves lightbulbs now occupy in the stores.  Critics of the efficiency standards claim that they would cost consumers money. In fact, the opposite is true. When the standards are in full effect, the average American family will save about $100 per year. That is pretty good. That is $12.5 billion in savings for consumers and businesses nationwide every year. That is $12.5 billion. But this rider threatens those savings. That is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider.  Here is the reality. The 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to enjoy overwhelming industry support. U.manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards.  The effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old, inefficient lightbulbs in the United States that violate the efficiency standards. That is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in U.plants to make efficient bulbs that meet the standards.  Why on Earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalize U.manufacturers who are following our laws?  But it gets even worse. The mere existence of this rider poses and additional threat to U.manufacturing. The bipartisan 2007 Energy bill required the Department of Energy to establish updated lightbulb efficiency standards by January 1 of this year. It also provided that, if final updated standards are not issued by then, a more stringent backstop standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect, and incandescent lightbulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard.  Well, we are well into 2017, and the Burgess lightbulb rider has remained on the books. So, earlier this year, the Department of Energy had to go forward with finalizing the 45-lumens-per-watt backstop standard.  Approving this rider year after year is ultimately what blocked the Department of Energy from issuing the required efficiency standards in time to avoid such stringent measures. Ironically, it is this rider that would effectively ban the incandescent lightbulb in 2020.  The Burgess rider directly threatens existing lightbulb manufacturing jobs in the United It would stifle innovation and punish companies that have invested in domestic manufacturing. This rider aims to reverse years of technological progress, only to kill jobs, increase electricity bills for our consumers, and worsen pollution.[[Page H6459]]  It is time to choose common sense over rigid ideology. It is time to listen to the manufacturing companies, consumer groups, and efficiency advocates who all agree that this rider is harmful.  Mr.Chairman, I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on the Burgess lightbulb rider, and I yield back the balance of my time.

2316,topic-id,549,"Mr.Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this particular amendment.  I say to the gentleman: For the company in your district, the regulations include the opportunity for waiver. And I would hope that the company in your district would be able to work that out.  The amendment that the gentleman proposes seeks to prohibit the Department of Energy from implementing testing procedures for the energy efficiency standards set for heat pumps and air-conditioners.  I, as the consumer, whether I am buying a heat pump, a furnace, a refrigerator--and every American who now shops looks for those--that is like the sticker. That is what you really look for, and you want to know how much you are going to pay every year for what that product will cost you for energy. And the better product you have, and you are able to put that on a label and it is verified by the Department of Energy, that helps sales.  The original standards that were created were supported and have been supported by the Edison Electric Institute, the association which represents all investor-owned utilities. The amendment, by the way, is opposed by the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, which represents manufacturers of HVAC systems that employ over 1.3 million And industry opposes the amendment, environmentalists oppose it, because it would cost an average--a cumulative cost to Americans of $12.2 billion over 30 years.  So there is a lot of opposition to this. It is important to note that these standards were negotiated in a collaborative process by industry groups, environmental nonprofits, and consumer advocates with the Department of A rider like this one damages the integrity of the negotiated rulemaking process, which is designed to provide certainty and voice to the industry and education and information to consumers.  Test procedures are simple and important. The Department of Energy develops them to make sure companies are rating their product accurately so consumers don't get stuck paying higher bills than they expect, so you know what you buy.  Let's be clear. This amendment would effectively nullify the efficiency standards for heating and cooling systems, in spite of the fact that these standards project that it will save billions of dollars over the period that they are applied, and that is equivalent to having 1 million fewer homes connected to the grid over the same period. It is an enormous savings.  If there is a particular company that is unfairly impacted by these rules, there are outlets for regulatory relief through waivers, as I have mentioned, and this amendment would neuter[[Page H6461]]those standards and thereby allow cheap imports to undercut American products by exploiting the lack of standards.  We don't want to go back to that. I look for those yellow labels. To protect American manufacturers, to save Americans money on their utility bills, and to reduce air pollution, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

Many employers are either unable to recruit workers due to excessive backlog of security clearance investigations or are forced to place employees in unfulfilling positions while they wait unacceptable amounts of time for their investigations to be completed.                              {time}  1415  Mr.Speaker, we are fortunate to live in a country with selfless citizens who seek to serve our Nation in critical national security positions and work towards safety at home and abroad. We need these bright minds to solve incredibly difficult problems and develop the next generation of American-made technology. We should reward them for choosing to work toward something greater than themselves, not punish them with jobs they don't want just because our bureaucracies can't move fast enough.  I introduced the SECRET Act so Congress can do its job of oversight better. The transparency afforded in this bill will better inform us of how substantial the security clearance backlog is and how long it takes for investigations to be completed. Equipped with that information, we will hold the executive branch accountable and keep our country safe.  I thank Chairman Gowdy and his committee staff for the diligent work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues for their support.

I also want to thank Ranking Member Elijah Cummings for all that he has done to try to get the answers about executive branch background checks.  For over 6 months, various Oversight and Government Reform Committee members have been working to get basic answers from the White House about its process for granting security clearances. In a February 2017 hearing, my colleague, Congresswoman Plaskett, asked the Director of the National Background Investigations Bureau if any senior administration officials with access to sensitive material were under criminal investigation. Chairman Chaffetz specifically asked the Office of Personnel Management to get back to Representative Plaskett about her request. Unfortunately, neither OPM nor NBIB have answered these basic questions. That is why I am pleased that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee unanimously adopted my amendment during consideration of H.3210 last week.  My amendment is very simple. It requires the NBIB to report to Congress on the process for conducting and adjudicating security clearances at the White  This bill is a necessary first step for Congress to conduct the oversight necessary to ensure that all personnel in the U.Government, regardless of administration, regardless of office, regardless of the President who happens to be in office at the time, will be thoroughly vetted and will not pose a threat to our national security.

Due to Sergeant Nykamp's tremendous dedication to the allied cause in World War II, from June of 1943 to October of 1945, there is no one more deserving of the honor.  During World War II, Sergeant Nykamp was stationed in Hardwick, England, where he flew 35 missions as a B-25 nose gunner. Some of Sergeant Nykamp's most important operations involved low-level flying in support of ground forces during the Battle of the He was awarded four Bronze Stars and five Air  Sergeant Nykamp's is a story of great sacrifice and courage.

Delaying this study impedes the ability of all interested parties to develop a long-term strategy to thwart this threat.

Though further study is necessary to determine how this carp entered the area, it is an alarming warning that the window is quickly closing to prevent large-scale devastation to the Great Lakes' ecosystem.

2524,topic-id,402,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of H.3210, the SECRET Act of 2017, introduced by my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr.Knight).  Mr.Speaker, the backlog of security clearance investigations causes tremendous waste for Federal employees and contractors and jeopardizes our national security.  There are thousands of jobs waiting to be filled in important national security positions and at least as many qualified Americans eagerly ready to fill them, but they can't, because they are waiting on their background investigation.  As of June 2017, the backlog stood at 650,000 clearances for employees, new hires, and contractors waiting either for an investigation or a reinvestigation. Many of those people are unable to perform their jobs while waiting, leading to contract delays and a pure waste of time.  Mr.Speaker, in order to fix the problem, you have to start by understanding the problem. Fixing the background investigation backlog requires information on the size, scope, and nature of the problem.  Currently, Congress receives information about the size of the backlog through briefings--only through briefings. We receive no regular data on the backlog and have no way to track progress over time.  My colleagues from California and Virginia, Representative Knight and Representative Gerald Connolly, authored this bipartisan bill to provide Congress the information it needs to assess these backlog investigations.  H.3210, Securely Expediting Clearances Through Reporting Transparency Act, requires a simple quarterly report from the National Background Investigations Bureau known as  The report will disclose the size of the backlog and the average length of an investigation broken down by level of clearance. Additionally, this bill requires two nonpartisan reports to help Congress plan potential reforms to the background investigation security clearance process.  NBIB will be required to issue a report describing the general security clearance procedure in the Executive Office of the The bill also requires NBIB to issue a report on the duplicative costs that would likely arise from transferring responsibility for background investigations to the Department of  Like the quarterly backlog report, this report will help Congress determine whether proposed options to reduce the backlog would do so or actually would increase it.  This bill is an important first step in addressing the security clearance investigation backlog, thereby reducing waste and increasing our Nation's security.

2213,topic-id,1195,"Madam President, I will not be addressing the matter before us because I have just come from Orlando, where so many are feeling such deep, deep sorrow today. It has been 1 year since the tragic attack on the Pulse nightclub in  The horror of that early morning still remains fresh for so many, especially those hundreds and hundreds of people who gathered at the Pulse nightclub this morning on the occasion of 1 year since the tragedy. There was quite a ceremony to remember the 49 innocent souls we lost. It was a massacre of huge proportions by a terrorist.  What terrorists want to do is to divide people. They want to terrorize them. They inject fear. Interestingly, the terrorist, whose name was Omar Mateen--although he changed the lives of so many, he took the lives of 49 people. He changed a lot of other lives of those who were wounded, and, of course, the families of the 49 victims are still suffering.  Interestingly, a terrorist wants to divide and inject fear, but this has had the opposite effect in It has unified people. It has unified the community as I have never seen before. It has unified our State; indeed, it has unified our So quite the opposite effect has happened from what the terrorist intended--other than the slaughter of 49 innocent lives. Sadly, these are the 49, and they are all being honored today. It was a very moving ceremony.  One of the causes that came out of the unification of Orlando is that--instead of creating a number of victims' funds--they put it all into one fund. Tens of millions of dollars have now gone into that fund, and it is helping to finance some of the victims who survived and their medical expenses, some of the families and the loved ones of those who were lost.  Interestingly, being there, suddenly those moments came rushing back. I heard about it early on a Sunday morning when the news broke about the massacre the night before, which had occurred in the early morning hours. As I raced from my home to downtown Orlando on South Orange Avenue, I was able to get on the telephone the 3 at the FBI, and he gave me authorization to tell what they originally were anticipating had happened. Once I got to the scene, I was able to share that. Of course, they had a representative of the FBI on the scene. They had set up a command post. Mayor Buddy Dyer had taken charge. It was quite a scene.  The tales of heroism are nonstop. The Orlando Police Department SWAT team, which went inside--before they could get the SWAT team there, members of the Police Department and the Sheriff's Department were there. One block away was a fire station that became a triage point. First responders got there and were trying to save people's lives. It was because of the massive number of casualties--49--that while the gunman Mateen was holed up in one of the bathrooms with hostages, some whom he had already shot had bled to death. While he was in the bathroom, police and paramedics were going in and pulling people out in those dark hours of the early morning. Of course, they were using whatever vehicle--if there was a pickup truck, they would put the victims on the truck. Fortunately, Orlando Regional Medical Center is only about six to eight blocks away, and, of course, it is a trauma center hospital.[[Page S3386]]  About a week later, I went to see the trauma surgeons. A resident who had been getting his residency there as a trauma surgeon was so moved by that experience that he put on his Facebook page what he was feeling and showed a picture of his bloody shoes that he didn't even recognize because he was so busy. It was not until the next day that he looked at those shoes. He put a picture of that on his Facebook page, and he wrote: To be a trauma surgeon and have waves of people coming in, I didn't know if they were Black or White; I didn't know if they were gay or straight. All I knew was I was doing everything I could to save lives.  In some cases, they would make an initial prep; then they would get the victim, who was still living, up to the operating room where other surgeons were taking over. In some cases, they did not have time. They had to do the operation right there in the trauma center. Fortunately, the one trauma center in all of Central Florida is right there at Orlando Regional Medical  So a terrorist, perhaps aided and abetted by his wife--this is an open question, and that determination has not been made. A terrorist tried to divide us as a nation, just as they had before on 9/11 and at San Bernardino and in so many other cases where they had been foiled. There are others whom you can't label as terrorists, but they are in their own ways--all the killings that have occurred at schools. If you lump all of that together, they try to divide us. Yet Orlando came together, united. They have a catch phrase for it. It is called Orlando  America is a nation of compassion, generosity, kindness, and respect. Those are precisely the qualities we saw from the people of Orlando when they came together a year ago, and this Senator saw that again in vivid detail this morning.  We are forever grateful for the bravery and heroism of the police, the first responders, the sheriff's department, the FBI, the families, and victims helping other victims. We are forever grateful for the trauma surgeons and the operating room nurses and doctors, as they saved lives. We are forever grateful for the hospital and how it completely accommodated all of this mass confusion and how it forgave all of the medical expenses for those who had been victims, both the living and the dead. We are forever grateful for those who rushed to the scene that night in the face of uncertainty, in the pitch darkness of that nightclub, not knowing where the shooter was. We are forever grateful for the skills of the negotiators as they tried to talk the shooter down. Ultimately, when he came out with the automatic weapons blazing, they had to take him down.  To all of those heroes, we say thank you. To all of those heroes who are also the families of these victims, we say thank you. To the victims' families and loved ones, we want to say that even though you lost those loved ones, they did not die in vain. Out of evil, what we have seen is good.  Thanks to all of Orlando, not only for what you did that night, but thank you for what you do every day. A year later, I can report to the Senate that we are Orlando  I yield the floor.

2420,topic-id,295,"Mr.Chairman, I thank my friend from the land of Lincoln for the time to speak on this important bill this afternoon.  Mr.Chairman, I remember Houston in 1972, 45 years ago. Just like today, we were the heart of America's energy and chemical industries. But back then, there were far too many days I could not see downtown from my home 25 miles away because of smog, ozone.  We have made amazing progress, Mr.All of America has made progress. Now it is rare when I can't see downtown from 40 miles away. I am raising my family in the suburbs of Houston, I don't want to see my hometown's air get any worse--or anyone else's, for that matter.  I want that progress to continue. That is why this bipartisan bill, H.806, keeps us moving forward with more breathable, cleaner air.  Nothing in this bipartisan bill changes any air quality standard. Nothing in this bill puts costs before science when EPA sets a new standard.  I will say that again because there is a lot of misinformation out there. This bill explicitly says that EPA can never ignore health data and can never put money ahead of safety.  This commonsense bill is about listening to our job creators back home. It is about giving local officials the tools they need to make air rules work. It is about making sure that our communities aren't penalized for pollution they can't control. It is about making sure that, when EPA sets a standard, they have to put out the rules to comply with that standard to our local communities at the exact same time.  Mr.Chairman, this is commonsense, bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to support H.806 so we can keep cleaning up America's air while growing our economy.

2453,topic-id,269,"Mr.Chairman, Texans like me believe that facts are little, persistent things. With all due respect to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, apparently, facts are annoying little things. Here are the facts about section 3(b) of my bill:  Section 3(b) states that if the EPA Administrator, in consultation with the EPA's independent scientific advisory committee, finds a range of levels of air quality that are needed to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety, then ``the Administrator may . . . ''--the Administrator may, not shall, not must, may--``as a secondary consideration, likely technological feasibility in establishing and revising the national primary ambient air quality standard for this pollutant.''  Again, it clearly says may, not shall, not must, but may.  H.806 does not change the Clean Air Act's requirement that standards be based on the protection of public health. Again, H.806 does not change the Clean Air Act's requirement that standards be based on the protection of public health. This bill simply clarifies that the EPA Administrator has the discretion to consider technological feasibility when choosing among a range of levels identified and supported by science as protective of public health.  This is a clarification for all future Administrators--Democrat or Republican--that Congress considers technical feasibility to be a reasonable part of the decisionmaking process with policy choices. These policy choices must be made among a range of scientifically valid options.  Again, facts are little, persistent things, and these are the facts about section 3(b) of H.806.

It is the DERA grants given to the counties from the EPA's budget that have allowed the agencies to have the 80 percent reduction in air pollution.  So taking that money away is not going to help. It is going to make matters worse. Our agencies aren't going to be able to do the things that they have been able to do, and they are not going to be able to continue those things.

Mr.Chairman, H.806 does have a couple of provisions that would be helpful to the air district in my region to avoid economic sanctions for failing to meet certain standards when very specific criteria are met. However, the underlying bill, as a whole, is completely unacceptable and has been called the most irresponsible attack on the Clean Air Act health standards ever introduced.  The Clean Air Act works. It saves lives. It has improved the environment. I am privileged to represent a portion of the San Joaquin Valley which, as was pointed out in the prior amendment, has extreme ozone problems.  We produce more than half of the Nation's fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Unfortunately, the valley has recently been rebounding from an economic downturn and is continually hurt by poor air quality. Action is needed.  This amendment seeks to address the serious health issues that are a direct result of the poor air quality in the San Joaquin Valley and other regions that are most at risk. The amendment provides a grant program for areas that are in nonattainment of PM 2.5, extreme nonattainment of ambient air quality standards, and those with high rates of asthma and unemployment. It requires a dollar-for-dollar matching from the districts receiving the grant.  California has 7 of the top 10 most polluted metropolitan areas and 11 of the worst 25 nationwide. There are millions of people at risk in the valley and south coast due to high levels of PM 2.5 and ozone, including children, seniors, and those with chronic illnesses. San Joaquin Valley counties received F grades for their air quality by the American Lung  Our kids deserve to be healthy, attend school, and live in a clean air environment. Studies have shown that high-quality air standards would prevent thousands of premature deaths in the valley and that it would work to prevent heart attacks, emergency room visits, and missed school- and workdays.  One study estimated that in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area, about 2.9 million people missed work or schooldays and were otherwise negatively affected from conducting normal activities due to poor air quality.  Valley children miss hundreds of thousands of days of school each year, and about one in five living in the valley has asthma. Illnesses related to poor air quality cost the valley billions, annually.  H.806 will be a step backward. That is why I have offered this substitute amendment that would allow the EPA to target and work with our Nation's most affected regions, like those in the valley and the south coast. This is about addressing our environment, the air we breathe, and helping those most at risk.  At the same time, California has been cleaning the air. Its economy has continued to grow. In 2016, California's nonfarm employment increased by 2.6 percent, compared to 1.7 percent nationwide. In 2009, California's clean energy industry created $2.7 billion and employed 123,000 people. By 2020, we expect it to grow to over $140 billion with 345,000 employed. California's success is proof that H.806 is unnecessary.

2233,topic-id,420,"Mr.Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking the chairman of the full committee for his extraordinary work and for the chairman of the subcommittee for this auspicious opportunity.  I have been listening to the arguments recently that we have had on the floor regarding the most recent amendments between fossil fuels and renewables, and I am hoping to strike a sweet spot here. I am not picking on fossil fuels, and I am going to talk about a renewable that I think everybody has an affinity for and an agreement with.  This amendment simply increases funding for hydroelectric through the EERE by $15 million and decreases funding to the bureaucracy. There is no increase to the budget. This amendment just increases the appropriation for the Office of Energy and Efficiency and Renewable Energy because hydropower is available in every region of the country; 2,200 hydropower plants provide America's most abundant source of clean, renewable electricity. I would say it is the first renewable. It accounts for 67 percent of domestic renewable generation and, clearly, 7 percent of total electricity generation.  By 2025, hydropower would create almost a million and a half new, good, high-paying jobs. It can be implemented in rivers, harbors, coastal areas, et cetera, to capture energy from currents and tides. Harnessing this energy will create a truly and absolutely renewable and green source of energy without any emissions and with little fanfare to everybody involved.  Hydro is predictable year-round power output, while other renewable source outputs can be variable in some areas and necessitate the use of large battery banks and alternate power sources. For instance, sometimes when the wind doesn't blow, believe it or not, if you don't know it, there is a gas-fired generator often associated with those windmill farms that has to come on because base load isn't being serviced.  Hydropower facilities are quiet, unobtrusive, while many people report that considerable noise is generated by wind power and that land is taken up by huge solar farms.  Hydropower is base load energy. That means it is on all the time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, just sitting there turning out the power so that you can hit the light switch when you come home and not wonder: Is the power going to be on? It backs up other intermittent sources of energy.[[Page H6438]]  Hydropower is safe. It harms neither fish nor man. It all faces a comprehensive and regular regulatory approval process.

I don't know why it is not as sexy as it should be. I think it is one of the greatest marvels of technology starting back since the beginning of time and when power was first generated, and I don't understand why we don't rely on it more.  To that end, literally 60,000 megawatts of preliminary permits and projects await final approval and are pending before FERC in 45 States right now. Eighty thousand--80,000--nonpowered dams in the United States, of which 600 have immediate hydro capability, right now could be producing energy.

2314,topic-id,547,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, first of all, I want to thank the Appropriations Committee for the extraordinary work they have done in a very limited amount of time.  This amendment would prohibit the use of funds to implement or enforce the final rule published by the former Secretary of Energy, entitled: ``Test Procedures for Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps.''  Mr.Chairman, this is simply an example of too much Washington, too much government. I am sure it was well-intended, but I am not sure if the good idea fairies in Washington really realized fully what they did.                              {time}  0000  Certainly we want to have test standards and so on and so forth, but the one-size-fits-all approach that comes out of Washington misses some folks and can cause some irreparable damage to businesses all around the country.  And all around the country there are small manufacturers that are trying to build some air-conditioners. In particular, there is one in the district that I represent that builds custom-made air-conditioners and heat pumps for skyscrapers and high-rise buildings.  If I can picture the scene, the original units are put in when the buildings are being constructed. So there are cranes available, there are openings in the walls and in the structure, and they just move the stuff in, and then they close it all up.  In 10, 15, 20, 30 years later when they go to replace it, well, the walls are in, the windows are in, the people are in, the offices are in. There is no crane available, and they have to piece this thing together through the elevator and into the closet. So this company, like other ones around the country, make custom-made ones, each one for a specific application--each one.  But the Department of Energy, and this rule in particular, says that this company must test each model that they make for these efficiency standards--each one--an arduous test taking months, if not years, in documentation for one application.  Again, I am sure the Department of Energy was well-intended. However, this rule is going to put a business out. They work in the city of York, a fine city in central Pennsylvania, right downtown where we want manufacturing to happen, where people can walk to work. These folks are trying. They are struggling to survive in this economy, and the only thing that is going to put them out is this regulation, Mr. While well-intended, it is not going to be helpful. These folks are trying to do the right thing, but the government is getting in the way.  Believe it or not, Consumer Reports actually recommended against buying some of these systems under this testing rule because the systems had higher costs and poor repair records.  Believe it or not, Mr.Chairman, the free market actually fixes most of this stuff. Most of us want to buy more efficient things that are cheaper, that are easier to maintain, and have a better record. This is Consumer Reports talking. This isn't Perry's record. This is Consumer Reports talking.  Let us not put this company out of business. Let us not put these companies out of business. Let us be responsible. I urge passage.

2413,topic-id,569,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize the 200th anniversary of Monroe County, Situated in southeast Michigan on the west shore of Lake Erie, Monroe County is endowed with rich historical and natural treasures, built on a strong agricultural base, home to innovative industries, and populated with dedicated citizens and entrepreneurs.  Founded by Potawatomi Tribes and, later, French missionaries, the history of Monroe County dates back to 1634. French missionaries built the first settlement, named Frenchtown, on the territory and established both a trading post and fort in 1788. The River Raisin provided an agricultural center for the residents of Frenchtown, with an abundance of natural resources to contribute to economic growth. However, in 1813, the Battle of the River Raisin occurred near Frenchtown, resulting in mass human and economic loss. Recognized as the deadliest battle recorded during the War of 1812, the U.Congress included the River Raisin National Battlefield Park as part of the National Park Service in 2009, the only national park that commemorates the human contributions and historic legacy of the War of 1812.  As one of the first steps in organizing the Michigan Territory after the War of 1812, Governor Lewis Cass established Monroe County in 1817 as the second county in the State of At the time, Monroe County included all of Lenawee and portions of Wayne and Washtenaw The old settlement of Frenchtown adopted the name ``Monroe'' in honor of President James Monroe and became the county seat. The flourishing county experienced economic growth and prosperity from the agricultural and paper manufacturing industries, from the first paper mill, Raisinville Mill, in 1834, to River Raisin Paper Company in 1910, to IKO Monroe, Incorporated, in 2000.  In the early 20th century, Monroe County hit another industrial milestone with the establishment of Monroe Auto Equipment World Headquarters, formerly referred to as Brisk Blast, in 1916, and the Newton Steel plant in 1959. Monroe County gained the reputation as the transportation hub in the State of Michigan, home to international ports on Lake Erie and one of the largest highway gateways into The development of transportation infrastructure played a crucial role in connecting the residents of Monroe County to goods and services. Monroe County also attracted entrepreneurs and inventors from across the United States, including Edward Knabush and Edwin Shoemaker who revolutionized furniture design and comfort when they invented the first upholstered reeling chair in 1929.  Today Monroe County is a vibrant community of nearly 150,000 residents who enjoy historic downtowns, beautiful parks, and safe neighborhoods. Residing along the shoreline of the River Raisin and Lake Erie, Monroe County offers a multitude of recreational activities--boating, swimming, camping, hiking, and fishing--at the Eagle Island Marsh unit of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge and Sterling State Monroe County is also active in the preservation and promotion of its history by recognizing significant landmarks and sites, including the Dundee Old Mill Museum and Navarre Anderson Trading With its rich historical and natural resources, Monroe County is recognized as one of the top visitor destinations in the State of  Monroe County has been an integral part of the State of Michigan and our great Nation for 200 years. As Monroe County celebrates this milestone, I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating its residents, elected officials, and businesses as they recognize their history. I wish the county continued growth and prosperity in the years ahead.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-18-pt1-PgS4052-2.txt,2113,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,18.0,July
2547,topic-id,1150,"Madam President, as public servants, I have always thought it is our duty to serve with dignity, integrity, and fairness to the best of our abilities. No matter where you are from or how we got here, the citizens of our States have sent us to Washington with the hope that we will do what is best for them. We hold the public's trust, and that is something that should guide us in everything we do.  Last week, I was home in Michigan for the Fourth of My family and other Michiganders celebrated and honored those who had fought for our independence and those who continue to defend our sacred freedom. Our American democracy is rooted in the promise of freedom and equal opportunity for every Our resilient Nation has persevered because of shared commitment to do what is right, even if we don't always agree on how to get there.  While home last week I had the opportunity to speak to many Michiganders and hear what was on their mind. They had a whole range of topics on their mind, but the 1 issue I heard was about the proposed Republican healthcare bill. Some were angry, some were confused, but most were simply scared. They are scared for their children, they are scared for their spouses, they are scared for their aging parents, and many are scared about what this bill could mean for their own health and well-being.  I wish to highlight a few of the stories shared with me in recent days. Susan from Clawson, MI, shared her unfortunate story about when she fell on hard times, unexpectedly lost her small business and with it her income.  Susan, despite all of her hard work in the past, no longer had the resources to obtain private health insurance. During this time--and it was an extremely stressful time--she also discovered she had an unidentified lump on her breast. Through some research and the help of friends, Susan was able to enroll in Medicaid and get the treatment for what she discovered was a very aggressive but treatable form of cancer.  Without Medicaid, Susan may not have gotten the treatment she needed and may have lost her life. Nobody[[Page S3968]]takes pleasure in sharing such deeply personal stories, but Susan wants to be sure anyone that who finds themselves in such a difficult position has the support she had.  I appreciate her bravery in beating cancer and her willingness to share this very personal experience.  Alayna from Southfield, MI, shared that she was diagnosed with a rare tumor almost a year ago. Alayna serves as a minister of music in her church in downtown Detroit and enjoys working with children through various local programs. Alayna works part time and her husband works full time, often 70 hours per week. Neither has healthcare benefits through their employers.  Alayna and her husband were able to obtain coverage through the ACA marketplace, a plan she would not have been able to purchase without the Affordable Care Alayna is rightfully terrified by the Republican plan and said she would probably be dead without the affordable coverage she received under the Affordable Care Act, leaving her husband and her 5-year-old daughter behind.  Matt, from Waterford, was unable to get health insurance before the ACA due to two preexisting conditions. After obtaining healthcare through the Affordable Care Act, he discovered one of his preexisting conditions had led to cancer in his digestive tract. Matt is convinced the ACA literally saved his life and that he would not have been able to afford the care he needs otherwise.  Hearing the stories of Matt, Susan, Alayna, and countless other Michiganders like them, I feel the need to remind this body that these individuals are our neighbors. They are husbands and wives and fathers and mothers. Illnesses or emergencies can happen to anyone. Ministers get sick. Students get sick. Small business owners get sick.  Matt didn't choose to be born with a preexisting condition, Susan didn't ask for breast cancer, and Alayna's tumor could have been on any one of us.  Last week, we honored our country's fight for independence, our Nation's brave Founders, and all who have sacrificed to build our Nation by working toward a more perfect union to ensure America is the land of opportunity for all.  The healthcare bill Republicans have written goes against the very values we honor and cherish. It does not bring us closer to opportunity for all. When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concludes that the Republican bill will leave millions of people uninsured, that should send a strong signal to all of us that we need to go back to the drawing board.  About an hour ago, my Republican colleagues released additional last-minute changes to their healthcare bill, intended to win over a few more votes within their party--changes that were drafted behind closed doors and without input from the American public, the very people we represent. In their rush to get this bill done quickly, my colleagues have not fully considered how this proposal will impact their constituents.  Healthcare stakeholders and our Nation's insurers have told Republicans this latest change will still cause premiums for older Americans and those with preexisting conditions to skyrocket. It will still increase the number of Americans without health insurance by millions.  We should be working on bipartisan legislation that will truly improve our healthcare system by increasing insurance coverage while bringing down cost, not forcing a vote next week on legislation that is seriously flawed.  I ask my Republican colleagues to listen to their fellow Americans, Americans who are scared of what this bill will mean for them and for their families. I ask my Republican colleagues to listen to the people calling their office every single day and even traveling here to Washington, DC, to speak out against this bill. I ask my colleagues to listen to the independent experts and healthcare stakeholders who have said, in no uncertain terms, that this bill will cost millions of people their health insurance and could cost thousands of Americans their very lives.  I ask my colleagues to remember why they came to Washington in the first place. I ask my colleagues to step back and ask themselves some tough questions. Will this bill help people or will it hurt people? What will this bill mean for rural hospitals in their State, for lifesaving addiction treatments, for preventive care that saves lives and taxpayer dollars? Does this bill hold true to the important American values of fairness, freedom, and equal opportunity for all?  If the answer to any of these questions is no, we should scrap this bill, start over, and work together, in a bipartisan way, to bring down healthcare costs and improve the quality of care available to every American, no matter who they are or where they live.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgS3967-2.txt,2113,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,13.0,July

My amendment would very simply close a very glaring loophole that our current Clean Air Act has--a loophole that every day harms the freshness of the air and the health of my constituents in my State and so many others across the country.  My amendment, which is based off of legislation that I have introduced, along with many other cosponsors, four times, including in this Congress, called the BREATHE Act, would close the oil and gas industry's loophole to the Clean Air Act's aggregation requirement.  Currently, oil and gas operations, like the one here, are completely exempt from the aggregation requirement in the Clean Air Under the aggregation requirement, small air pollution sources that cumulatively reduce as much air pollution as major sources, like a power plant, are actually rounded out entirely of the protections of the Clean Air Oil and gas is exempt, and they shouldn't be.  While one site like this has emissions that are significant, you can imagine having 20,000 of these in one county, which we do in my home State of Colorado, and that cannot conceivably be rounded down to zero. That is the equivalent of several large power plants. We should look at them in the aggregate, where they are close to one another geographically.  The aggregation requirement is actually intended to protect the public from small air pollution sources that might individually seem innocuous, but cumulatively account for large volumes of toxic substances that are put in the air.  We have areas of Wyoming and northern Colorado that have worse air quality than Los Angeles, not because of one or two or ten extraction sites, but because of tens of thousands within an immediate vicinity.  The oil and gas industry currently does not have to aggregate or pull together its small air pollution sources. They round them down to zero. Rounding one or two down to zero is not an issue. Rounding 20,000 in one county down to zero leads to dirtier air, higher asthma, higher cancer rates.  If we round down every fracking pad to zero in an area where there are 100 of them, zero times 100 is still zero. But if we multiply a small amount of pollutants times 100, that can equal a great deal of pollutants, not to mention times 1,000, times 10,000. This provides a more holistic fix to make sure that our air is clean.  My amendment also adds hydrogen sulfide to the Clean Air Act's Federal List of Hazardous Air Pollutants, which was originally on the list but was, in my opinion, wrongly removed by The Clean Air Act completely exempts hydrogen sulfide from the list, even though hydrogen sulfide[[Page H5959]]already has been scientifically associated as the cause of a number of health issues, including nausea; vomiting; headaches; and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat.  Hydrogen sulfide often may be released from well heads, pumps, piping, storage tanks, and flaring, which is what we are seeing here. In fact, 15 to 20 percent of all natural gas wells emit hydrogen sulfide, even though control technologies are inexpensive and are already deployed to curtail those hydrogen sulfide emissions.  This amendment ensures our oil and gas industry takes the measures that we need to avoid the release of hydrogen sulfide into communities by adding hydrogen sulfide to the List of Hazardous Air Pollutants and by listing oil and gas wells as a source of hydrogen sulfide.  My amendment simply makes the Clean Air Act work better. You can't round something significant down to zero, when you have a lot of them concentrated in a particular area. Of course, there is an impact on air quality from 1,000 or 10,000 wells that operate in one county.  Mr.Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

2467,topic-id,226,"Mr.Chair, I would like to point out that the Rules Committee granted the necessary waivers to allow this amendment to be considered, as they often do, and this amendment was also considered in a similar bill last session. That is because it is relevant to the subject matter at hand. The Rules Committee often waives those requirements.  This bill, as he pointed out, does two different things, both appearing in different sections of the Clean Air  My amendment will, very simply, make sure that oil and gas operators play by the same rules as other industries. It doesn't mean that flaring won't occur. It will, and it does. For those of us who live in and around fracking, that is a fact of life. What it means is, whereas, you have the argument the industry has made that if you have one or two of these sites and you round the profile of emissions down to zero, just simply doesn't hold water when you have 1,000 or 10,000 active wells in a very limited area. We can't round that down to zero. It is simple math. The profile of emissions from that site is greater than several large power plants, if you have 10,000 wells.  Mr.Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-18-pt1-PgH5943-3.txt,1910,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,18.0,July

In other words, they are going to be carried out without any funds.  Mr.Chairman, I am going to move forward here and make the statement that the administration and House Republicans continue to add to the EPA's workload while cutting funding and hampering State and local agencies from providing the resources needed to protect public health.                              {time}  1615  This is surely unreasonable. In the case of H.806, it will continue to obstruct the EPA's ability to advance and improve our Nation's air and water quality. My congressional district has extremely poor air quality, which has caused a variety of health issues for my constituents.  This bill does weaken the Clean Air Specifically, it targets the implementation and enforcement of air pollution health standards. It also negatively impacts the budget for programs necessary to ensure that Americans can breathe clean air.  This bill is in stark opposition to the public's overwhelming support of the Clean Air According to the Center for American Progress, the Trump administration's EPA budget, which cuts more than $2 billion from the Agency's budget, shifts the cost of implementing clean air standards to the All of these cuts would be harmful to the 649,000 children and more than 2 million adults with asthma living in  Every State agency that testified before the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on the Environment stated[[Page H5960]]that more, not less, money is needed and that the Clean Air Act was working to protect the public's health and safety.  I represent one of the worst air quality regions in the Nation, the San Joaquin Valley, and yet the San Joaquin Valley air district has been a leader in utilizing EPA grants and expertise to achieve emissions reductions from mobile sources, showing that this funding is beneficial. The valley continues to set emission levels to record lows and has reduced air pollution by over 80 percent. This data proves that the Clean Air Act works and creates a better standard of living for all  The American Lung Association issued a State of the Air report for 2017 in the State of Most of its 28 counties received an F for air quality. We should be striving for better air quality.  Grants like the EPA's Targeted Air Shed Grants and Diesel Emission Reductions Act help thousands of agriculture, trucking, and other businesses acquire low-emitting tractors, trucks, and other equipment. This funding generates jobs and manufacturing here in the United These Federal funds have a great track record of benefiting our region, and it is a good investment.  EPA estimates that for every dollar spent on DERA, more than $20 in health benefits are generated. That is $20 of health benefits for every dollar invested. All 50 States have these programs.  I also want to highlight how this bill, combined with other efforts by the Trump administration, will continue to negatively impact air quality and public health.  Our States have made tremendous progress and a significant investment toward addressing climate change and public health. However, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act would take a step backward, destroying much of the progress, leading to a greater harm to public health and our economy.

2390,topic-id,565,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1180, the Working Families Flexibility  I would love to take credit for this idea. It is not my own. It is a bill that has been carried by other Members on several occasions. I have had the privilege to carry this bill the last few Congresses, and I am excited that we are going to debate this bill tomorrow and, God willing, have a vote on it.  The Working Families Flexibility Act is a simple amendment to the Fair Labor Standards The Fair Labor Standards Act has been the law of the land since 1938.  In 1985, the Fair Labor Standards Act was amended to allow compensatory time. That is paid time off in lieu of cash wages for overtime for public sector employees. But, oddly enough, private sector employees were left out of the equation.  This bill, H.1180, simply provides that the private sector can have access to compensatory time in lieu of cash wages for overtime. This doesn't eliminate overtime, but, rather, gives flexibility in the workplace for hardworking Americans to make a decision about how to use their time.  Every time an hourly wage employee works an hour of overtime, they would be eligible for an hour and a half of paid leave only if the employer first offers this as a benefit, but, most importantly, that the employee elects voluntarily to choose compensatory time over cash payments for overtime.  Congress cannot legislate another hour in the day, but what we can do is provide flexibility for hardworking moms and dads all over this country that may want to use their accrued overtime to coach a soccer game, help with an aging parent, take their child to the pediatrician, or, quite frankly, accrue the time to go on a mission trip somewhere. But this is an opportunity for us to provide this benefit for employees all over this country, like I said, hardworking men and women that just want flexibility.  It is voluntary. It must be done through a written agreement between the employer and the employee. But, most importantly, outside of being voluntary, the employee can opt out at any time. The employee can cash out, so to speak. There are cash-out provisions in this bill.  So if the arrangement between the employer and the employee is not working out, meaning the employee can't find the appropriate time to utilize the compensatory time, the employee can say: Do you know what? I would rather have my cash payments for overtime.  And within 30 days the employer must provide those cash payments that that employee has rightfully earned.  I just think this is a great opportunity for us to provide this benefit to so many folks out there who are just trying to balance their life and work, their children, their parents, and all of the things that come with that. As a working mom, I certainly can relate to all of the pushes and pulls that parents have on them in wanting to just provide for their family. Again, at the end of the day, this time belongs to that individual, therefore, he or she ought to be able to make a decision about how to use their time.  I have several Members who are here tonight that are going to speak on this bill.

2394,topic-id,539,"Mr.Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy), our majority leader. During my time in Congress, I don't know anyone who has been a stronger champion for finding ways to help families using conservative, commonsense ideas.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, Congresswoman Martha Roby is an amazing woman. She is a Congresswoman, she is an attorney, she is a wife, but, most importantly, she is a mother to two beautiful children. She has the same concerns and the same challenges that everybody else across this country has: Does she have enough time? Does she have the flexibility?  Just going through her own life, listening to her constituents, she came forth with this bill. She has worked hard to bring the Working Families Flexibility Act to this floor. She has done it before, and it passed in this One of the things I admire most about her is she does not give up. Because it is not about her; it is about the rest of America, and it is also about fairness.  In 1978, Congress granted this choice to government employees. Twenty-nine years later, it is past time we end the double standard and offer the same deals to workers in the private sector.  You can work and work overtime, but then you have the choice if you want to take that in pay, or would you like to have comp time?  Maybe there is a child sick, or maybe you have a family member that comes down with a disease, or another choice. You can go and spend time. You get to direct it. I think that is great policy. That is why government workers have it.  But why can't they have the same standards in the private sector?  Do you know what would happen?  Higher productivity. It would actually move America's economy.  Why?  Because the individual has choice.  Instead of being concerned and worried about something that is happening away that you need to be at, you put that time in. And instead of taking the money, you put it into flexibility.                              {time}  1945  When we look at the future and think about the economy we want to have, yes, we want great employees; we want happy employees; we want employees with great productivity. But we don't want that just to happen in government. We want the private sector to have the same fairness that government has.  It is a great idea. But I will tell you, the work that Congresswoman Martha Roby has done has led this charge. It has passed this House before, and we are going to find time in a very busy week to have the flexibility to do this bill tomorrow because you know what? The rest of America is waiting for it.  I want to congratulate Congresswoman Roby for her work on it, for not giving up, for listening to constituents across this country, but also for every working family in the private sector to let them have a choice to have the flexibility to be where they need to be after they put the overtime in. It is only fair, and, to me, it is the American way to solve a problem.  ",CREC-2017-05-01-pt1-PgH2992.txt,1986,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,1.0,July

I appreciate the leader taking his time to be here and speak on behalf of the Working Families Flexibility  I would like to turn now to my friend and my colleague, also from Missouri (Vicky Hartzler). I just want to point out, though, as I move to her comments, we have to recognize that the workforce has changed.

2397,topic-id,587,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman and all of her comments and her support as a working mom who understands all of the pushes and pulls that so many American families face.  I want to spend a little bit of time, while I have the opportunity, to talk about some of the myths about the Working Families Flexibility There is so much misinformation, false information that is out there about this bill.  Trust me, we are on social media responding to the information that is being put out there that is incorrect because we want to make sure people understand. This bill is not intended to hurt people. It is intended to help people and offer a much-needed benefit to provide people flexibility in the workforce.  The first myth I want to address is that this will result in employees working longer hours for less pay. The fact is that the Working Families Flexibility Act safeguards workers' time and wages. Receiving paid time off or compensatory time for working overtime hours under this bill is completely voluntary. An employee who prefers to receive cash payments for overtime hours worked is always free to do so.  Employers and employees are required to complete a written comp time agreement, a voluntary written agreement, and an employee can withdraw from this agreement at any time and receive cash wages for accrued comp time.[[Page H2994]]  Comp time is accrued at the same rate as overtime cash wages, so employees who work more than the 40-hour week will accrue paid time off at a rate time and a half for the overtime hours worked. Workers can cash out--meaning, say ``I want the money instead of the time''--whenever they choose, and employers are required to provide those cash wages that that employee has accrued within 30 days of receiving that employee's request.  Another myth is that the Working Families Flexibility Act will allow employers to control when workers use their comp time. The fact is that the Working Families Flexibility Act protects employees' use of the compensatory time that they have earned. The Working Families Flexibility Act allows workers to use their comp time whenever they choose as long as they provide reasonable notice and the leave is not overly disruptive.  The unduly disrupt provision included in H.1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act, is the same standard used today for public employees who are using this benefit to receive comp time, and this has worked for over 30 years. As my colleagues have already stated, this is a matter of fairness. If it is good enough for government employees, it should be good enough for private sector employees as well.  All existing labor enforcement remedies, including action by the Department of Labor, are available if a worker believes he or she has been unfairly treated. I can't put enough emphasis on this, that the anticoercion, the anti-intimidation provisions that are currently a part of the law, of course, apply to the Working Families Flexibility And it even promotes greater workplace flexibility while protecting the needs of the employer, but the employee is very protected from that type of behavior and coercion by the employer.  I have some other myths and facts that I am going to go over, but I see that the chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee has joined us. I really appreciate the gentlewoman, the chairwoman, and all the work that she has done to support the working Families Flexibility  I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (",CREC-2017-05-01-pt1-PgH2992.txt,1986,ADJOURNMENT,2017.0,1.0,July
2399,topic-id,1344,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairwoman, and again, I appreciate her leadership for moving this bill through committee and for getting it ready through the Rules Committee so that we can be here on the floor tomorrow. Again, I appreciate her leadership on this and many, many other issues that she does on a daily basis to fight for Americans, in this case, Americans that are subject to the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act that would benefit from this amendment in the private sector.                              {time}  2000  I want to go back. I have two more myths that I would like to address.  Here is the myth: the Working Families Flexibility Act will allow employers to force workers to take comp time instead of cash payments for overtime.  The fact is that the Working Families Flexibility Act prohibits worker coercion. The decision to use compensatory time is completely voluntary. An employee who prefers to receive cash payments for overtime hours worked is always free to do that. It explicitly prohibits an employer from directly or indirectly intimidating, threatening, or coercing; or attempting to intimidate, threaten, or coerce an employee into taking or not taking compensatory time.  An employer who violates these anticoercion provisions will be liable to the affected employee for double damages which includes both the amount of the comp time and an equal amount in cash wages.  In addition to new provisions prohibiting coercion, H.1180 ensures all existing enforcement remedies, including action by the Department of Labor, and are available to workers if an employer fails to pay cash wages for the overtime hours worked.  Myth: this bill is unnecessary because current law already allows for workplace flexibility. The fact is that the Working Families Flexibility Act empowers workers with more options. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, private sector employees may only use paid time off during the same paid period in which it is accrued. Paid time off cannot be saved by the employee for future use outside of that pay period.  The law currently allows public sector employees to accrue comp time to be used at their discretion so long as reasonable notice is given and the leave does not unduly disrupt the workplace.  My amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Working Families Flexibility Act, H.1180, provides private sector employees with comp time benefits similar to what is already available in the public sector.  Here is how it works: an hourly wage employee would be able to voluntarily enter into an agreement with their employer to put all of some of their accrued overtime towards paid time off instead of cash wages. A working dad could use the time-and-a-half overtime he has earned to take a paid hour and a half off of work. No employee, again, could ever be forced to take the paid[[Page H2995]]time off, just like no business would be forced to offer this benefit.  Upon introducing this bill 4 years ago, I heard from a very special lady named Karen She worked as a bookkeeper in an accounting firm of my hometown, Montgomery, Like most in her line of work, Karen would put in many hours during the busy season and build up a lot of overtime. Karen once approached her boss and said: Well, can I accrue my overtime to use as paid leave rather than taking the cash payments? Because, see, Karen gave her time to serve on a mission trip in Nicaragua every summer, and she wanted to do so and go on her church's mission trip without interrupting her regular paycheck.  Montgomery, Alabama, is the State capital, and Karen had heard her State employee friends talk about how they swapped their overtime pay for comp time in their jobs. She never imagined that a similar arrangement at the private business at which she worked would be against the law, but that is what her boss informed her. He wanted to give it to her, but he couldn't under the law. To his credit, he wanted to offer it to her, but he wasn't about to break the law.  Karen's story isn't unique. As I have already referenced, just think of all the parents in this country with young kids or caring for elderly parents or a military family with one or both of the parents deployed or about to deploy. They need time to get ready to take care of their responsibilities.  So the Working Families Flexibility Act is not going to end or solve the debt crisis or fix ObamaCare or simplify the Tax I am proud of our ongoing efforts here in Congress to repeal and replace ObamaCare, to put forth a tax policy that is fair, flatter, and simpler, and to continue to cut out wasteful spending. This bill doesn't solve those problems.  But the fact that we can't solve those problems overnight shouldn't stop us here in the House of Representatives from doing what we can do right now to help make life a little easier for working moms and dads. That is what the Working Families Flexibility Act does, helping Americans better balance the demands of family and work.  I want to thank all those Members who have come here to the floor tonight to speak on this bill. As a working mom myself, I certainly understand all too well how challenging it can be to balance our responsibilities.  Again, I have sponsored this bill this Congress, of course, and the past two before that. I have heard criticism from labor unions and their allies saying that this bill is somehow antiunion or antiworker. This is just simply untrue.  Of course, many in Big Labor will reflexively attack any proposal that would change a single word of the Fair Labor Standards Ironically here, labor unions, see, they oppose this, but they themselves can and often do negotiate similar agreements for their members already.  That seems a bit unfair. So it is okay for those who are members of unions to negotiate similar compensatory time arrangements, it is okay for those who work in the public sector under the law to utilize compensatory time, but it is just not good enough for the hourly wage employee in the private sector. That is more than unfair.  The legislation is completely voluntary for both the employer and the employee. It does not affect the 40-hour workweek or change the way overtime is calculated. It strengthens provisions for workers and increases penalties for abuse. It contains strong anticoercion provisions that would prohibit an employer from directly or indirectly trying to intimidate or coerce workers into taking comp time.  Workers have the option under the Working Families Flexibility Act to cash out at any time. If for some reason this agreement, this voluntary agreement, just isn't working out, an employee can always take the cash, no questions asked.  And, finally, for workers represented by a labor union, any comp time arrangement would have to be negotiated under this bill as part of the collective bargaining agreement, just as they already do.  Mr.Speaker, as I finish tonight, I just want to say again, as a mom, a working mom, a family where both parents work outside of the home, I certainly understand for some of us the time, our time, the time that has been accrued by an hourly wage employee, is more important than the cash wages. That may not be true for everybody. That remains in that the employee can determine what he or she wants to do with their time.  Again, I am grateful for the many people who have worked so hard on this bill over the years. I am grateful for the opportunity to represent Alabama's Second District and to represent so many hardworking American families here tonight in this hour.  I look forward to the debate tomorrow here on the floor on this bill. I would urge all of my colleagues to please vote in favor of H.1180, the Working Families Flexibility  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-01-pt1-PgH2992.txt,1986,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,1.0,July

In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and targeted Yucca Mountain, located less than 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, as the sole site for our Nation's geological repository. It is a fancy way of choosing Nevada as their nuclear dump.  For over 30 years, the State of Nevada and local communities have rejected this misguided project on safety, public health, and environmental grounds. In fact, we have filed 218 contentions against the Department of Energy's license application, citing safety and environmental issues in its assessments.  Numerous scientific studies have deemed Yucca Mountain unsafe based on the fact that it sits above an aquifer and is in a seismically active area that just experienced a 4.1 magnitude earthquake.  Any plans involving Yucca Mountain, including the recently introduced Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Acts, or any proposed plans to comingle defense and civilian nuclear waste at Yucca, ignore the environmental, safety, and security concerns of Nevadans who would be forced to store nuclear waste that they had no role in creating.  Using Yucca Mountain as the Nation's dumping ground would require transporting over 70,000 metric tons of radioactive waste, much of it through my district and through the heart of Las Vegas, a city that attracts over 43 million visitors annually and generates over $59 billion in revenue.  Not only does this project endanger those in Nevada, Mr.Chairman, it also threatens the health and safety of millions of Americans from over 329 congressional districts across this country who live along the proposed transportation route.  As if this wasn't bad enough, now the Nation's most egregious nuclear waste producers and even some of my colleagues across the aisle are suggesting that we comingle defense waste with civilian waste from power plants, inappropriately increasing the amount of high-level radioactive material dumped in Nevada by 37 percent. This means more nuclear material coming to Yucca, and more waste traveling through 44 States and Washington, D. There are also concerns that this will hinder the Air Force's readiness and our country's ability to defend itself. Last week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal ran a story featuring Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force, and her concerns with the Yucca Mountain project.  She cited how it will directly impact Nellis Air Force Base's ability to complete its mission to train servicemembers for war, because there is no route across the range that would not impact testing and training.  Her concerns, unfortunately, are not new. Since 2003, the Air Force has consistently stated that they know of no route through the Nevada Test and Training Range that would avoid sensitive areas or not negatively impact readiness activities.  I understand that our country's nuclear waste must go somewhere, but this decades-old battle has proven that Yucca is not the place. We must stop wasting billions of taxpayer dollars by resurrecting a project that has been dead for over 30 years, and, instead, identify viable alternatives for the long-term repository in areas that are proven safe and whose communities consent to storage.  Mr.Chairman, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment, with the understanding that we will begin a serious discussion on how to properly handle our country's waste, instead of continuing down the path of forcing this waste on my  I fully understand we have to put our country's defense and civilian waste somewhere. But for the first time, let's bring Nevadans to the table and let's share the responsibility of facing the consequences of nuclear production.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time and withdraw my amendment.[[Page H6444]]  The Acting The amendment is withdrawn.

2289,topic-id,185,"Mr.Chairman, I want to echo the sentiments of my colleague from Nevada (Mr.Kihuen) by making one thing perfectly clear: Nevadans are completely against becoming the Nation's nuclear dumping ground. And make no mistake, that is exactly what this appropriations bill does.  Without Mr.Kihuen's amendment, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, Congress will tie the hands of this administration by explicitly prohibiting, even considering, closing Yucca Mountain or conducting a technical review before licensing activities begin.  You heard that right. The underlying bill forbids any funds from being used to conduct activities that preclude Yucca Mountain from becoming the Nation's dumping ground for radioactive waste, no matter the science, no matter the evidence.  And we already have the evidence that bringing America's nuclear waste to Yucca is bad for Nevadans and bad for We know that Yucca is unsafe for nuclear waste because it is seismically active and sits above an aquifer.

2215,topic-id,2153,"Mr.President, a year ago today, Americans--myself included--awoke to the shocking news that 49 of our fellow Americans had been killed overnight in one of the deadliest mass shootings, mass attacks in our Nation's history.  I recall that day. It was a Sunday morning. I was home, and we were getting ready to go to church, as we do. The news was on. We don't usually turn on the That day, the text messages were coming in, and it spoke about this horrifying incident that occurred overnight. The news reports were still sketchy.  For whatever reason--be it because of our work here or a bad gut feeling--I remember telling my family that I was going to get in my truck and drive the 3 hours to Orlando to be there because I felt there was something beyond the scale and scope of it, a little bit different about this horrifying attack. As I drove north on the Florida turnpike, the updates on the radio kept coming in. The scale of it was unbelievable. The numbers kept climbing, and there was still not a lot of detail about what was behind it.  After I arrived on the scene and was able to interact with some of our Federal authorities and State authorities who were there, the picture still wasn't abundantly clear, but the one thing that began to emerge was, this was the act of a single individual inspired by an ideology of hate and supported in the pursuit of that ideology by people who before that and since then have been responsible for attacks all over the world.  I think the part that was perhaps most troubling for a lot of people is--especially for me, I found myself at that time, 45 years of age, at the halfway point between the age of the people who would have been there and the age of someone whose child might have been there, and the randomness of it--the notion that a lot of young people went out that night to have a good time with their friends. It was Latin night. This was a well-known nightclub in the LGBT community in Central I don't think that when you get up at night and get dressed and go out that you think one of the risks involved is you are going to end up interacting with a jihadist terrorist. That is what happened that night.  The other part that was so startling is, so often for so many of us, these bad things happen somewhere else. They happen in They happen in They happened on 9/11 in New York This happened in Florida, just down the street from a place that I had been a year earlier--a small business, furniture store whose owners I had gotten to know as I was writing a book about small businesses and the like. The familiarity of it, how close it was to home, and the idea that the war on terror had not just come to America that day but it had come to Central Ultimately, we learned it had come to impact people whom we knew through others and whose stories sounded quite familiar.  We now know it was the worst attack on U.soil since September 11 of 2001. In this time when we are having so many debates about whom we are going to allow into our country and what criteria we are going to use and from what places they can come, it is important to stop and remember that the individual--whose name I will not even say because I think one of the hopes he had is that he would go down in history as a famous person, but this individual lived in our country for a long time. He lived among us since the day he was born. He was not someone who had come on an airplane or had recently arrived from another culture, another society. He was an American, born and raised in the United If my memory doesn't fail me, I believe he was born in Queens,  What strikes me is, he benefited from everything this country offers: freedom, liberty. He knew people. He lived among fellow Americans his whole life. He went to work every morning alongside them. He had all of the blessings and the opportunities and everything this country provides. Yet even that was not enough to somehow inspire him not just to take on this evil ideology but to act on it.  Obviously, the attack was personal for the 49 families with stories of their own and of course the countless others who were injured. I know it was personal to the LGBT community and Central As I said, Pulse was a well-known cornerstone of the community, particularly for younger people.  As I said earlier, this was deeply personal for Floridians and for the people of Central I will get to that in a moment because I am extraordinarily proud of that community. I think it was personal for all  When I arrived, I saw these people, largely still--I don't know what time it was, but the attacks weren't even 12 hours old. I saw family members of people they loved or loved ones who were outside in desperate mode. You know that look on your face where, ``I want to know what happened. I don't know if the person I love is inside there. I haven't heard from them.''  One of the most chilling things I heard from law enforcement was that[[Page S3387]]the cell phones were still buzzing as people were calling their loved ones. It brought home that this wasn't just 49 as a number. It is so easy to see that scroll across the television set. It is even easy to say it now, 49. They were 49 human beings, 49 human beings with families who loved them, parents who loved them, siblings who loved them. I saw that firsthand when I got there. I saw the look of people behind the yellow rope who had no idea if someone whom they deeply loved and cared for lay dead on the other side of that tape.  I remember not long after, crowds began to form and people started showing up with signs that said things like: ``We're with you.'' ``We love you.'' This was early. I am talking about 12 to 13 hours after the attack happened.  I commend the law enforcement--Federal, State, local--who came together and responded. I saw people coming off duty, people who were not on duty that day, putting on the uniform and showing up to see how they could help. We saw the long lines of everyday citizens bringing food and water to support their efforts. Later that day, we saw long lines of Floridians lined up to donate blood.  There is no doubt that this was a community that was heartbroken, but it was also a community that was unbroken; that I believe woke up stronger and more united than it was when I went to sleep the night before.  I think, ultimately, the man who committed this attack and the people who inspired him to do so would have been horrified by what they saw. I think they would have been horrified to see First Baptist Church in Orlando--a pillar of the Christian evangelical community--opening its doors to the LGBT community and welcoming them and their families and holding services there. I think they would have been horrified by that. I think they would have been horrified by people putting aside, if but for a moment, their voter registration cards, their preferences in the upcoming elections, their backgrounds, the way their last names are pronounced or whom they love. They put all this aside and said: These are 49 Americans--and their families--who just died at the hands of an evil terrorist. We are committed to doing everything we can to provide support for them. I think these terrorists would have been horrified to see what has happened since that time.  In so many ways, Central Florida grew up--and I mean that in a positive way--so much in the last year, in terms of coming together, in the sense of community, and obviously it is sometimes in tragedy that we see that happen. I think it served as an extraordinary inspiration to communities all around the country who hope to achieve the same level of unity without the tragedy.  While the attack may have succeeded in sowing death and heartbreak, it failed in sowing doubt about our way of life. In the year that has followed, we have seen hundreds of thousands of Americans come together in Orlando to celebrate the lives of the victims and to begin that healing process.  In the weeks and months after the attack, memorials were established throughout downtown Orlando, marking the loss of 49 of our brothers and sisters. We saw ceremonies held in every part of the State, from Pensacola to Miami,  One thing that really stands out in particular is, one of the memorials was a set of 49 white crosses that rested aside the Orlando Regional Medical Center, the trauma center where a number of the victims were taken that morning. Those crosses are now at the Orange County Regional History Each one of these crosses is about 3 to 4 feet high and has the name of one of the 49 victims. People from all across the Nation visited this memorial, including, at the time, President Obama and Vice President They came to pay their respects and to leave a token of their mourning in the honor of those taken that night--cards and pictures, teddy bears and flowers were set around each cross, and people wrote notes and well-wishes on the crosses to honor the memory of each of the 49.  When the crosses were taken by a police motorcade to the history center, one mother--I have chosen not to list her name because it is not for me to do, but she was there to assist that Tuesday with moving that cross that represented her daughter. She and her husband, I think, by now know this, but we share a mutual friend in the Orlando area, and I have learned firsthand from him just how hard the loss of their daughter was for them.  In the end, before I am a Senator or anything else I do, I am a husband and a father, and I have a child whose name is the same as their daughter. I, for the life of me, cannot begin to fathom what they have gone through in the past year, along with 48 other families.  As they moved her cross with her name on it, they saw a note on it that had been written by someone in the community. They don't know who it was. The note was very simple, but it was very powerful. The note said: ``I never knew you but I love you.''  It strikes me that line, ``I never knew you but I love you,'' for those of us in the Christian faith, reminds us of what Christ said is one of our greatest Commandments, to love your neighbor as yourself.  For the past year, we have felt the deep pain. We have also seen in Orlando that it is united. ``One Orlando.'' At a time when we can always find something to divide us, a community came together to honor the memory of those who were lost. Each of them was a son or a daughter, a brother, a sister, a mother, a father, a husband, a wife, or a partner. In the end, they were a part of our families and our communities. Each of them, like all of us, had immense promise and hope. Each in their own way were a part of what makes this country a great nation, and they were lost that terrible night 1 year ago, but they were loved.  A year later, we remember them and those they left behind. I hope we will honor them by finding a way as a nation to remember that despite our differences on a vast number of issues, we are still one nation under God, the greatest Nation on Earth, the most extraordinary people who have ever lived, a nation that is not simply a people bound together by a common blood or common heritage, a common ethnicity. America is more than a country. It is an idea, the idea that every single human being has a God-given right to live life as they so choose and to fulfill their potential. I hope we will continue to work here and everywhere we can to live up to that powerful idea that changed the world.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

2441,topic-id,400,"Mr.Chair, I thank my colleague from Illinois for his hard work, and I thank Mr.Olson for his hard work. They have worked, I think, tirelessly and in an awfully well-intended way to craft a balance between the different competing points of view on this whole issue of ozone.  I know that he is concerned about people's health. I know that he is concerned about the environment. But on this particular issue, I am going to respectfully disagree and agree with my Democratic colleagues to say that I think that the time to act is now, because at some point there becomes the question: If not now, then when? At some point, delay moves to the point of obstruction of moving forward on an idea that has had its different wrinkles, in fairness to my colleague from But at some point, you have to act.  Given the fact that people's health does hang in the balance, given the fact that there are another 2,000 cases a day of asthma that are protracted, we need to have a bias for action. I think it is a time for action.  I think it is reasonable. Moving from 75 to 70 parts per billion is not exactly a gargantuan change, given what is at play with regard to health.

2417,topic-id,567,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, H.806, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017, is about ensuring effective implementation of our air quality standards.  We have learned that timelines and procedures established almost 30 years ago can be counterproductive today, resulting in unnecessary costs, regulatory delay, and economic uncertainty.  H.806 ensures we will continue to deliver effective environmental protections, with reforms that will also help expand economic opportunity in communities around the  H.806 removes barriers to the planning and permitting of new or expanded manufacturing facilities and to related economic activity essential for building out America's infrastructure.  The bill's reforms reflect practical improvements to the law suggested by State and local regulators, who have confronted the growing challenges of implementing multiple air quality standards under multiple implementation plans and under tight statutory deadlines. As a result, these challenges have increased, and it has become more difficult for many areas to enable the economic expansion needed for their communities. This bill takes several sensible steps to fix this situation.  First, it extends the date for final designations for the 2015 ozone standards to 2025. This allows States time to implement the 2008 ozone standards and other measures to improve air quality. The provisions align requirements for new source construction permitting with this phased ozone schedule, which will reduce permitting delays and still ensure the use of the best available emissions control technologies. The provisions would require timely issuance of implementation guidelines by EPA so States can plan effectively.  Second, the bill aligns the air quality standard setting with how the process works in practice, and it ensures fuller information about regulatory impacts. For example, it updates the mandatory review of air quality standards to reflect past experience by extending the requirement to 10 years, and preserves the EPA administrator's discretion to issue revised standards earlier, if necessary. The bill ensures the administrator, prior to revising an air quality standard, obtains advice from the EPA's Independent Science Advisory Committee about any adverse effects on jobs, welfare, and other economic impacts related to implementing the standards.  Finally, the bill takes several steps to address some of the problems communities face when working to meet the standards. For example, it ensures that, for certain ozone and particulate matter nonattainment areas, States are not required to include economically infeasible measures in their plans; it ensures that States may seek relief with respect to certain exceptional events, including droughts; and it directs EPA to examine the impacts of foreign emissions on standards compliance, ozone formation, and identify effective control strategies, including ways to facilitate EPA review to avoid unnecessary penalties for foreign emissions.[[Page H5944]]  The bill also helps communities with most severe air quality challenges that are doing the most to clean up their air by providing a reasonable way to avoid burdensome and unnecessary sanctions, which harm their ability to grow their economies and create jobs.  The provisions of H.806 represent important steps to update the Clean Air Act to reflect what we have learned over the past 25 years since its last major revisions.  There is more work to be done to modernize environmental laws, but ensuring orderly implementation of air quality standards is an important place to start and essential in our environment and our economy.

2425,topic-id,113,"Mr.Chairman, I would like to highlight a few specific things.  One is the standards established by the EPA remains unchanged. The real premise of this bill is the fact that, when the 2008 standards came out, it took the EPA 7 years to get to the guidelines for how local communities and businesses could comply. While that was occurring, they ratcheted down a new set of standards.  So when we talk, this is really more about having our citizens and our communities be able to comply with the rules and regs before a new rule and reg gets in place.

2429,topic-id,307,"Mr.Chairman, let me just remind my colleagues that--why 10 years? I mean, that is a good question.  When the 2008 standards came out, it took the administration 7 years, to 2015, to tell people how to even implement the 2008 standards. Then, 3 months later, they say: Oh, no, we are going to have a new standard set at 2015.  So this debate doesn't reduce or roll back. It says, let's let the EPA establish standards and then give communities time to comply. That is all this bill does.  Mr.Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.McKinley).  Mr.Mr.Chairman, today the House will vote on a bill addressing the ozone standards issued by the Obama administration.  Look, with the comments you have heard today, we all want clean air. But America has made great strides already. Ozone is down by one-third since 1980.  But the regulations imposed by President Obama in 2015 would cost the economy billions of dollars each year and hamper job growth. In many parts of the country, it is literally impossible to meet the new standards due to the background levels of ozone.  Much of the country, as you just heard the chairman talk about, was still trying to comply with the previous standard when, suddenly, a new level was imposed. This has resulted in confusion and duplication.  The bill that is before us this afternoon provides a commonsense approach. It delays the implementation, but, more importantly, it gives the States flexibility to deal with this issue. It revises the timeframe for changing standards from 5 years to 10 years. That is all. It requires the EPA to consider--very important--the economic and technical feasibility of the new standards.  So, Mr.Chairman, passing this bill today will remove a barrier to economic growth while, at the same time, still protecting our environment.

That same year, we get new standards saying: Oh, no, no, no. You have got new standards lower than what it took us 7 years to define.  That is really the debate. We are not eliminating standards, we are not rolling back standards, we are just saying: Give us a break. Give us time to comply with the 2008 standards before you even force down the 2015 standards. Nothing in this bill rolls back either of those standards.  Mr.Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from South Carolina (Mr.Sanford).

Mr.Chair, when you drive up north through and past my district in California, you go through some amazing places--Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon, then right on over to These are beautiful places. American treasures. You don't have to go far off the road to feel like you are remote and completely surrounded by the peacefulness of nature.  I have had my troubles with the EPA--regulatory cap and trade, waters of the U.rule. They are a couple that come to mind. But I do think and believe there is a purpose to ozone standards that clean up our air and make our communities healthier.  Yet the latest ozone and particulate matter regulations are so severe and divorced from reality that even the national parks like Sequoia, Kings Canyon, and Yosemite may not be clean enough. If such pristine nature isn't clean, nothing can be.  The problem is that the EPA sets new standards before we reach the old ones, and even before we have the technology to reach the new standards, the only result will be failure.  California's Central Valley faces many disadvantages with air quality. We have prevailing winds from the north to send us pollution from San Francisco, and because of our topography, it traps it all in. But we have made some amazing progress. Good days, when ozone isn't a problem, are up 144 percent since 2002. Unhealthy ones are down over 75 percent in the same period. You see similar trends in particulate matter as well.  But no matter how much better we make our air, we cannot catch up to reach the latest unrealistic EPA hurdles. The head of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District said that, to do so, we would have to stop all fossil fuel combustion in the Central If we don't do that, don't stop all industry, stop building, stop businesses, and even stop driving our cars, you know what will happen? We will be punished, and we will be fined for where we live.  Now, something obviously has to change because these regulations are not rooted in reality. In this legislation, Mr.Chair, Congressman Pete Olson's Ozone Standards Implementation Act, we don't get rid of ozone or particulate matter standards, we don't even oppose raising our standards when we use our technology and abilities to improve. What we do is make sure that the standards are set with a specific level for a set time so that the EPA cannot come back and change the goalpost every few years.  What we do is make sure that the EPA actually determines whether something is technologically possible when setting new attainment deadlines. What we do is make sure we aren't penalized for all things affecting our air that we can't control.                              {time}  1530  We made sure that this legislation accomplished these goals without rolling back the protections for our communities or without backsliding on meeting current EPA standards in the Central  In the end, we must have clean air, but we have to be smart with this and set achievable and fixed goals our communities can meet. Building on our success, the people of our district and across America can continue to have cleaner air tomorrow than we do today.

2446,topic-id,1364,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I would first of all like to thank my colleague from New York who serves as the ranking member of the committee. We have done some good work together that we look forward to bringing to the floor in a more amicable setting. Obviously, this one is not. I wish it could have been, but so the public policy world goes.  Let me, in my remaining time, highlight some of the organizations that are supporting our action. Through the committee process, we had the Farm Bureau, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, the Portland Cement Association, National Association of Manufacturers, and the U.Chamber of Commerce express the need to reform and modernize the Clean air Act in order to encourage economic growth and job creation, because we understand that what has, also, a major impact on health and welfare is our citizens having good-paying jobs.  There is a focus on what we are trying to do as Republicans through the legislative process, and we want to reduce the tax burdens, to ease the regulatory burdens, and to create jobs so that all of our citizens are able to achieve their economic goals and aspirations.  We also received a letter today that I include in the Record from over 145 organizations and over close to 20 State chambers of commerce.                                                    July 18, 2017.

This      legislation provides a common-sense approach for implementing      national ambient air quality standards, recognizes ongoing      state efforts to improve air quality through a reasonable      implementation schedule for the 2015 ozone standards,      streamlines the air permitting process for businesses to      expand operations and create jobs, and includes other reforms      that bring more regulatory certainty to federal air quality      standards. Additionally, the undersigned support language      including certain elements of H.806 and 263 included in      the Fiscal Year 2018 Interior, Environment and Related      Agencies Appropriations bill.       We have significant concerns that the 2015 ozone standards      overlap with existing state plans to implement the 2008 ozone      standards, leading to duplicative and wasteful implementation      schedules, and unnecessary and severe economic impacts. The      new ozone standards were promulgated in October 2015, only      months after states received their final guidance from the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on how to implement the      2008 ozone standards. This delay was the result of the Obama      administration's decision to halt work on the 2008 ozone      standards during a 2010-2011 reconsideration period. The EPA,      however, did not account for this self-imposed delay when      issuing the 2015 ozone standards, thereby imposing      duplicative costs and burdens of implementing multiple      standards simultaneously. This is particularly wasteful as      the EPA itself projects that nearly the entire country would      attain the 2015 ozone standards simply by being provided an      opportunity to fully implement already-planned measures like      their state implementation plans for the 2008 ozone      standards. Local economies also face severe impacts, as      analysis of data indicates that the 2015 ozone standards      could expand nonattainment to more than 950 counties if      planned reductions are not allowed time to take effect,      subjecting large parts of the country to costly nonattainment      control requirements.       Notwithstanding concerns expressed by thousands of elected      officials, state agencies, businesses, community groups, and      other stakeholders, the EPA issued the 2015 ozone standards      without addressing the overlap with the 2008 ozone standards      and the enormous impacts that dual implementation would have      on limited state resources, permitting, and the economy. It      is now up to Congress to address these issues, and that is      why we support H.806 and 263. By better aligning the      2015 ozone standards with the 2008 ozone standards and their      associated emissions reductions, H.806 and 263 will      help prevent unnecessary nonattainment designations and cost      burdens, without sacrificing environmental protection. The      legislation's permitting relief and other reforms are also an      important step towards national ambient air quality standards      that balance environmental protection and economic      development.       In sum, H.806 and 263 and the related appropriations      language provide a common-sense plan that maintains continued      air quality improvement without unnecessarily straining state      and local economic resources.

2447,topic-id,2719,"If I may, in the middle paragraph it says: ``We have significant concerns that the 2015 ozone standards overlap with existing State plans to implement the 2008 ozone standards, leading to duplicative and wasteful implementation schedules, and unnecessary and severe economic impacts. The new ozone standards were promulgated in October of 2015, only months after States received their final guidance from the Environmental Protection Agency on how to implement the 2008 ozone standards.''  Mr.Chairman, I couldn't say it any better than that. This is not, as I have said a couple of times, a rolling back of our regulations. This is identifying the fact that 2008 standards were implemented. It took 7 years to do the implementation guidelines, and when those guidelines came out 3 months after that, the Federal Government, through the EPA said, oh, we are going to now ratchet it down 5 more parts per billion, which leads you to believe that people are trying to comply.  Other benefits of this bill address the fact that you could be in the remotest parts of the country and fall against the EPA and ozone standards based upon nothing that you can do. We have communities that are trying to comply, are doing great work, but they are receiving emissions outside of their control. Plus, they will be penalized for that.  So we look forward to continued debates. I know that there have been amendments offered that we will consider.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

2449,topic-id,445,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate my colleague, and I don't question her passion and her evaluation of her perception about what we are doing.  But again, as I have said in general debate, nothing in this bill rolls back the 2008 standards; nothing rolls back the 2015 standards. The attempt is to say: Why is it so difficult to believe that we should meet the 2008 standards and give our communities time to do that before we throw on them a new 2015 standard? So that is the basic premise.  This amendment would allow the advisory panel to nullify one of the central provisions of the bill, section 2(a), which allows States to fully implement the 2008 ozone standards for which EPA only issued the implementing regulations in 2015 before turning to 2015.  So EPA says meet the 2008 standards. Delay, delay, delay; don't know how to do it; no guidelines. 2015 comes, they say meet the 2008 standards; 3 months later, oh, but now we have got 2015 standards we want you to comply with. That is the basic premise of this bill.                              {time}  1545  Ozone air quality will continue to improve under H.806. Regarding the 2015 standards, the EPA projects the vast majority of U.counties will meet the 2015 ozone standards by 2025 just with the rules and programs now in place or underway.  The bill ensures hundreds of counties are on track to meeting the 2015 standards, and that can come into compliance without being subjected to additional regulatory burdens, paper requirements, or restrictions, which will not do anything to improve public health.  The bill also does not limit States from imposing more stringent emission requirements if a State finds that such a condition exists in section 2. Nowhere does the bill authorize States to increase their emissions. This is not about continuing to improve air quality in a manner that doesn't require the States to duplicate paperwork requirements.  Since 1980, ozone levels have declined 32 percent, and as we talk about in the environmental process, the low-hanging fruit has been picked. It gets more and more difficult as you start reducing the standards time, effort, energy, and technology.  So with the reduction of 32 percent by 1980, the EPA projects air quality ``will continue to improve over the next decade as additional reductions in ozone precursors from power plants, motor vehicles, and other sources are realized.''  Nothing in the pending bill prevents these improvements to air quality from being realized.  Mr.Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (",CREC-2017-07-18-pt1-PgH5943-3.txt,1527,SECURELY EXPEDITING CLEARANCES THROUGH REPORTING TRANSPARENCY ACT OF,2017.0,18.0,July

2459,topic-id,297,"Mr.Chairman, under the Clean Air Act, section 319 provides relief to areas that violate National Ambient Air Quality Standards due to unusual or naturally occurring events as that they cannot control.  Section 3(h) would add--and I would argue strengthens the definition--droughts and extraordinary stagnation to the act's definition of an exceptional event.  Let me give you an example. In 2012, there was a major drought in the Now, I am from corn country, and[[Page H5958]]we don't irrigate our corn because we have got great soil, and we have got weather conditions for most of the years that provide plentiful rain for that to happen. But that didn't happen in 2012. It was an extraordinary event. It was a drought.  Now the question is posed: Should we punish the communities for an extraordinary event; i.e., a drought that is out of the control of any human being?  It is an ``extraordinary event.'' This language would provide reasonable relief for States in this condition, particularly those in the Western United States for, as I said, events beyond their control.  Nothing in H.806 does away with the detailed statutory requirements under section 319(h) of the Clean Air Act for demonstrating ``an exceptional event.'' Nor does anything in the bill do away with the detailed regulatory procedures and guidelines that the EPA has laid out for demonstrating exceptional events or the requirements to measure air quality or to make that air quality data available to the public.                              {time}  1600  This provision simply ensures citizens in areas experiencing unusual or natural occurring events beyond their control do not become subject to penalties or sanctions under the Clean Air Act as a result of those events.

Obviously, this is part of the debate where we are agreeing to disagree.  I will just say that air quality standards are put in place so that there are things that we can effect and we can deal with through mobile emissions, as you would probably know about, as stationary sources.  Exceptional events, such as droughts, are out of our control. That is why we think it should be placed into the language. We do believe it strengthens the provision of the law, doesn't weaken it.

2466,topic-id,240,"Mr.Chairman, the subject of H.806 is criteria pollutants and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards program, not the hazardous air pollutants programs, which my colleague is referring to.  These two programs are addressed under different sections of the Clean Air The whole title is Clean Air Act, but you have one section here dealing with national ambient air quality, and then you have another section on hazardous air aspects, which is what my colleague is trying to address. Criteria pollutants are addressed under section 107 and 110 and part C and D of title 1 of the Clean Air Act, while hazardous air pollutants fall under section 12.  This amendment, moreover, is wholly unrelated to the purpose of H.806, which is to provide State regulators with additional time and flexibility, as we have heard throughout this debate, to implement ozone and other standards for criteria pollutants.  H.806 makes process-related reforms to address practical implementation challenges identified by State regulators. This amendment would make substantive changes relating specifically to regulation of the oil and gas sector.  This amendment would make significant changes to the Clean Air Act that did not receive any Energy and Commerce Committee consideration during the markup of this bill.  The amendment would also circumvent the established regulatory process for listing new hazardous air pollutants set forth under the Clean Air  Mr.Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

2468,topic-id,238,"Mr.Chairman, to my colleague from Colorado, sitting in with the Rules Committee yesterday, the question was asked: Would you accept this amendment or would you not? I said: I appreciate my colleagues on the Rules They will do the due diligence in agreeing which amendment comes to the floor or not.  So it is good to see the Rules Committee has so much comradery and comity that they would allow someone from the committee to offer an amendment on the bill, but I still have to object because it splits this bill and tries to bring in air issues that are in the hazardous air program and jam it into this one where, basically, what we are trying to do is send a signal and allow communities to meet the 2008 standards before a new 2015 standard gets placed upon them 3 months after they do the implementing guidelines.  It is really a process, a bill that makes it easier for people to comply. It really helps EPA more easily be able to evaluate the data and move us forward to a cleaner environment.  Mr.Chair, I reluctantly hold my position that we should vote against the Polis amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

2474,topic-id,716,"Mr.Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague for his impassioned discussion, especially of his area. We all have a lot of friends here. It is hard for the public to believe I am on both sides of the aisle, so it[[Page H5962]]saddens me to have to speak in opposition to this amendment.  This is doing, similarly, what I had to address with Congressman Polis in that it is taking a bill in which we are trying to streamline the processes and then somehow creating a grant program out of the money. I don't know where this money is coming from, whether it is coming from the supposed savings from nonimplementation.  But as my colleague from Texas mentioned, the process, as you followed through the committee, is to say: How do you force people who are just told how to comply with 2008 standards, how do you then turn around and give them 2015 standards when they were just told how to comply 3 months prior?  And so what we have tried to do in this piece of legislation is to say let's allow people to move forward on 2008 while making sure that the 2015 standards occur with a deadline of 2025. That is the basic premise.  And it also addresses the issue of, and I know, there are parts of the country where they can do all that they can do and they are not going to meet the standards because of what is being imported from other regions, maybe, in your case, from Asia or from San Francisco or those areas. So how do you end up punishing an area when they are doing everything that they humanly can do?  There is some great, obviously, statistics that you have shared of the success in that region, although they are still stressed under the current standards.                              {time}  1630  So your amendment would eliminate the widely supported reforms in this bill. And I read, and we will have submitted for the Record, the 145-plus organizations that support it, plus the five or ten that we addressed earlier from the markup, and then really kind of apply only to a few parts of the country versus the entire country as a whole.  Across the Nation, States and communities struggle to implement these standards, and we are trying to streamline that process. This amendment would deprive communities across the Nation of the benefits of H.806. It would reduce red tape, relief from the sanctions and penalties for emissions that are outside their control, as I said earlier, and streamline the implementation of the standards.  Mr.Chair, I appreciate my friend and colleague. I know it is a tough environment we are trying to address, especially some of those concerns.  Mr.Chair, I still urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chair, how much time is remaining?  The Acting The gentleman from California has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining.  Mr.Mr.Chair, clearly everybody wants clean air, and I don't doubt that for a second, and I appreciate the effort that is being made to streamline the implementation of clean air. But my questions are: Is this going to be a message bill? Or is this something we are actually going to get signed into law?  And my answer rhetorically is that if you want to get something signed into law, you really have to work on both sides of the aisle.  Now, there are a couple provisions in the bill that I think are completely objectionable. There may be room for compromise. The 10-year extension seems out of bounds to me. Technology moves much faster than 10 years. The idea that technical achievability can be taken into account really does lose sight of the important aspect of the Clean Air Act, which is that we want to protect people's health.  So among other things, if you want to actually get something done, if you want to actually work across the aisle and get something that we may get signed into law, work with us. Otherwise, I am going to have to put forward this amendment that replaces the ozone 805 and replaces it with something that actually works.

2480,topic-id,294,"Mr.Speaker, to my colleagues and friends, I appreciate the debate. Those who followed it here, just a couple of points.  The question is: Why are we here today?  In 2008, the EPA established ozone standards, and then it took the EPA 7 years to tell communities how to comply with those 2008 standards. It is the truth. I am just telling you the truth.  Three months later, after they told the communities how to comply, they said: Now we are going to give you 2015 standards.  That is why we are here. We are just here trying to say that if the EPA is going to establish standards, then they ought to say: We are going to give you the guidelines on how to comply now, not 7 years later.

The first one is Greta  Greta recently left as my legislative director; and as you know, Mr.Speaker, that is your top adviser in the legislative field. So not only running the legislative office, she also had some personal expertise in the telecommunications regions.  But Greta is from northern Illinois, north of I-80, originally from the Chicagoland area, and is a graduate of Northern Illinois University, She started as a staff assistant in 2003 and worked her way up through the ranks, as I said, becoming legislative director[[Page H3076]]in 2011, and then served as deputy chief of staff from 2013 until she left recently in  She focused on telecommunications as her expertise, and we primarily in our office dealt with 911 issues, especially the Next Generation 911 Advancement She also spearheaded the Next Generation 911 Caucus in my office.  She is married to Bob and has two children, Gavin and We already miss her activity and work in the office, and we pass on best wishes.  Next is Mr.Chris Sarley, who has a 14-year career on Capitol This is his tenth year with me, and I think it is uncommon in many offices for people to stay that long. I think it is a tribute to my chief of staff, Craig Roberts, and the fact that I don't meddle too much how they manage the office and get their job done.  Chris has served 10 years with me. In addition to handling health care and energy policy in my office, Chris has served the committee under Chairman Walden and Chairman Emeritus Upton as policy coordinator for the Subcommittee on Environment since 2011.  Chris has been an invaluable member of my team, and some of his achievements include:  Before he came to my office, he worked on the Medicare part D rollout.  Under my office, he advanced several medical device titles in the 21st Century Cures  He worked on what we call the ADAPT Act and the GAIN Act, which target the antibiotic threats that hopefully will not occur in our country, but we need to be ready to respond.  He was very involved in ADUFA, Animal Drug User Fee Act, and enabling the FDA to approve drugs used for pets and livestock.  But for all of us on the Energy and Commerce Committee, he was one of our primary House negotiators during the first major rewrite of a United States environmental protection law in over 2 decades, and facilitated passage of the Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amends the Toxic Substances Control Act, which is the Nation's primary chemical regulation law.  I think the public really would appreciate if they knew the work that our staff members do on long hours and over the weekends. We mention it all the time, especially when we are fighting across the aisle, because it is primarily the staff that is trying to get to the point where they can share language where we can then give a thumbs up or thumbs down, and it is very seldom that we say thanks for those.

2242,topic-id,276,"Mr.Chair, first, let me say, it was not a $300-some-odd-million plus-up in the fossil energy research. In fact, I think the fossil energy research account was down from last year.  It was more than the President requested, but it is not a plus-up from what it was in 2017.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The amendment would increase funding for the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy by $20 million but has to use $40 million from the Fossil Energy Research & Development account as an offset.  This bill was the result of some tough choices. I have to admit, they were some tough choices. It is not that I oppose the program that the good lady advocates for, but there were some tough choices. We had to prioritize research and development that will increase our energy independence.  Our domestic energy resources are vast, and this bill strikes a balance to lay the foundations for future energy generation technologies, while maintaining full support for the resources we use most today.  Increasing funding for EERE by diverting funding from fossil energy strikes the wrong balance when considering the Nation's electricity needs. Fossil fuels produce 65 percent of the electricity we use today and will continue to provide the majority of the Nation's energy needs in the future.  This amendment would reduce funding for a program that ensures that we use our Nation's fossil fuel resources as well, and as cleanly as possible. For all of the reasons that team fossil talked about earlier tonight, I must oppose the amendment and urge my Members to do the same.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

2254,topic-id,319,"Mr.Chairman, although I am opposed to the amendment, I have to admit that I do enjoy our annual discussion on this.  I oppose this amendment because the bill already shows strong support for the nonproliferation programs of the Funding for nuclear defense nonproliferation is $1.83 billion--$76.5 million below fiscal year 2017 and $16.8 million below the budget request.  Within nonproliferation, the bill largely supports funding as requested, but makes a limited number of realignments within the account to emphasize the importance of nonproliferation research and development activities and to meet international commitments for plutonium disposition.  Our understanding--and this is the important point. Our understanding is that budget request is down because NNSA still has significant unexpended balances in this account due to slow progress on international nonproliferation agreements.  Specifically, the NNSA reported in May that it had approximately $2.2 billion in funds available to carry out its nonproliferation mission, of which over $680 million is left over from prior years. For years, NNSA has struggled to execute funding in its nonproliferation budget because it could not obtain agreement from other nations to do the work as quickly as planned or as we would maybe like to.  This amendment also targets funding from the weapons activities infrastructure recapitalization program. Created in fiscal year 2014 by Congress, the recapitalization program has been highly successful in addressing the aging and deteriorating infrastructure at NNSA sites. Replacing things like telephone poles, leaking fireman valves, roofing, and addressing other basic infrastructure needs are essential to the safe and continued operation of these nuclear security sites.  The budget request proposed to cut the program, and the bill increases funding $118 million above the request to restore that program to the fiscal year 2017 level. We should not divert funding needed to address these urgent infrastructure needs, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

2257,topic-id,243,"Mr.Chairman, I would just say that this infrastructure need is not for a new pit facility. They would need to come to us and ask us what they were going to do with funding, and request funding for that. They did not do that. This is for infrastructure needs and upgrades.  But the other thing is that I am as much a nonproliferation activist as anyone in this body. I think it is important work. But the reality is that there are $681 million unexpended from previous years, not because funding is not available--the money is there--but they haven't been able to get agreements with other countries. Unfortunately, you can't do work in other countries without having agreements with those countries.  So, consequently, we are--I guess you could maybe say--overfunded in nonproliferation if we can't spend the money on that activity. That is the problem.  Why would we put the money into that when we need the money in infrastructure and building and repairing the buildings and facilities that NNSA has?  It just doesn't make any sense to me.

Unfortunately, the way the Obama administration developed the National Ocean Policy increased the opportunities for Federal overreach.

2310,topic-id,574,"Mr.Chairman, let me first say that I compliment the gentlewoman for her consistency. She is a true budget hawk in trying to make sure that we ultimately balance this budget. It is tough work to do that.  We have actually, as she mentioned, reduced spending in this bill over last year. Could we reduce it another 1 percent across the board? The problem is we have to choose some priority in the bill.  The highest priority we had was our Nation's defense, the nuclear weapons program. Even though the overall bill is down $206 million, the defense activities are actually up nearly a billion dollars.  We then have to look at the infrastructure of this Nation and the fact that we have deteriorating infrastructure, and Congress has told us that each year we have to meet what is called the WRDA target. We have to spend with the Army Corps of Engineers to meet the infrastructure of our harbors, dams, and inland waterways and restore those things, because it is very important to our commerce and something the Congress supports greatly.  So when we have had to increase the Army Corps of Engineers funding over what was spent last year and then we have had to increase weapons activity, that means the Department of Energy has been significantly reduced over what they were last year.  We have had to make some very hard choices. We have cut the EERE, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, program in half from $2 billion to $1 billion, roughly.  We have had to eliminate the ARPA-E program, a program that I happen to support, but we just don't have the money for it.  We have had to eliminate the loan guarantee program, a program that, again, I support, but we just don't have the money for it.  So we have made some significant reductions while prioritizing basic science research and those types of activities within the Department of I think we have done a good job, given a pretty skinny budget. We have made tough choices. That is okay. That is what we do all the time in the Appropriations  The reality is, if we are ever going to balance this budget, if anybody looks at the numbers, right now we are spending about 70 percent of our total Federal budget on mandatory programs. We have been reducing discretionary spending over the years. As a portion of the total budget, it has gone down every year.  If we don't get a hold of mandatory spending--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest on the debt--within 10 years we will have enough money for our mandatory programs and defense, nothing else--zero.  We are not going to balance this budget by reducing discretionary spending. Keeping control of it, you bet, that is what we have been doing. That is what the Appropriations Committee has been doing since 2010, or earlier. We have actually been reducing spending. It is very important that we do that. But we have to get a hold of mandatory spending if we are going to balance the budget.  So while I appreciate what the gentlewoman is trying to do, I agree with her, we need to balance this budget.

This bill delays implementation of the 2015 ozone standards until 2025, extends the review cycle for all National Ambient Air Quality Standards from 5 to 10 years, and authorizes the EPA administrator to consider technological feasibility when establishing or revising a  Today, we will hear that removing health and environmental protections creates jobs, despite all the evidence that protecting public health and growing the economy are not mutually exclusive.  Since its enactment, the Clean Air Act has reduced key air pollutants by roughly 70 percent, while the United States economy has more than tripled.  We will hear today that our country has made enough progress, and we will hear claims that further progress will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, but this bill's supporters may not tell us that the American Lung Association's 2017 State of the Air report found that nearly 4 in 10 people in the United States live in counties that have unhealthful levels of either ozone or particle pollution. Delaying EPA's more protective health standards will only serve to delay these Americans' access to guaranteed clean air.                              {time}  1445  I believe American ingenuity continues to be up to the task of developing and deploying technologies that will protect our citizens. History has shown again and again that meeting such basic health protective standards is achievable. More importantly, advancing these protections will make America more productive, more competitive, and will improve quality of life and drive down public health costs tied to asthma, heart disease, and even cancer.  We may hear today that standards change too frequently and EPA should have more time to review and implement each standard. We will likely not hear that EPA has discretion on these matters and is only tasked with changing those standards if it will protect health.  Every year, more studies are completed. With each new study, we gain an even better understanding of how ozone and other pollutants are harming Americans' health. It is critical that these standards reflect the latest available science.  What we are not likely to hear today is questioning of the large and growing body of scientific and medical evidence that breathing air that contains ozone and other criteria pollutants can cause serious health effects.  Unfortunately, this bill would cast aside that scientific evidence in favor of adding cost and technological feasibility considerations into the standard setting process. The proposed changes to the Clean Air Act will slow down, if not outright roll back, the progress we have made to clean our air. This would be a giant mistake.  Healthier people means fewer sick days, fewer hospital visits, and fewer premature deaths, all of which lead us to a more productive society.  According to a peer-reviewed 2011 EPA study, in 2010 alone, the Clean Air Act prevented over 160,000 premature deaths, 130,000 cases of heart disease, 1.7 million asthma attacks, and a million more respiratory illnesses. Many of those health benefits have helped our most vulnerable populations, particularly our children.  Let's do this for our children. Let's not make it worse. Let's improve our standards. That is why so many public health and medical organizations and professionals have vocally opposed this bill every step of the way.  The Clean Air Act keeps kids in school, adults at work and on the job, and tens of thousands of Americans out of the emergency room each and every year.  At a time when Republicans in Congress have been almost singularly focused on ramming through legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans, this bill adds insult to injury.

2434,topic-id,1606,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As I earlier stated, the State of Arizona has over 660,000 residents with asthma, including 175,000 children; and I just question putting their health at risk with this bill that moves us in the wrong direction.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record a number of supporting documents. The first is a letter opposing the bill signed by the State Attorneys General of New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, and the Acting Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental                                                   April 26, 2017.     Re Opposition to H.806, Ozone Standards Implementation Act          of 2017.     Greg Walden, Chairman,     Frank Pallone, Ranking Member,     Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives,          Washington,       Dear Representative Walden and Representative Pallone: We      write in opposition to H.806, Ozone Standards      Implementation Act of 2017. This bill would not only delay      implementation of more protective ozone air quality      standards, but, more broadly, would undermine the mandate in      the Clean Air Act (Act) that the national ambient air quality      standards for ozone and other criteria pollutants be based on      up-to-date scientific evidence and focus solely on protecting      public health and welfare. As explained below, these measures      would be a significant step backward in combatting the      dangers of ozone and other criteria pollutants.       Many of our states have struggled for decades with the      pervasive problem of ozone pollution. The scientific evidence      of harm to public health from ozone pollution is well      established, as are the economic consequences. At certain      concentration levels, ozone irritates the respiratory system,      causing coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and headaches.      People exposed to elevated levels of ozone suffer from lung      tissue damage, and aggravation of asthma, bronchitis, heart      disease, and emphysema. Children, older adults, people with      asthma or other lung diseases, and people who are active      outdoors are particularly susceptible to the harmful health      effects of ozone. Public health harms also exact an economic      toll. For example, increased hospital admissions on bad ozone      days increase health care costs borne by states and local      governments. Ozone pollution also harms public welfare by      damaging trees and reducing crop yields by interfering with      the ability of plants to produce and store food and making      them more susceptible to disease, insect pests, and other      stressors. Ozone can also inhibit the ability of plants and      trees to mitigate harms from climate change.       To protect against these and other adverse impacts and ``to      promote the public health and welfare and the productive      capacity of its population,'' the Act aims ``to protect and      enhance the quality of the Nation's air resources.'' 42      U.S.7401(b)(1). To achieve this goal, the Act      requires EPA to adopt primary standards for certain criteria      pollutants, such as ozone, at a level that protects public      health with an ``adequate margin of safety.'' 42 U.S.     7409(b)(1). The Act also requires EPA to adopt secondary      standards at a level that protects the public welfare from      ``any known or anticipated adverse effects.'' 42 U.S.     7409(b)(2). The Act mandates that EPA review the air      quality standards for each criteria pollutant every five      years and revise the standards as advances in science      warrant. As Justice Scalia explained for a unanimous Supreme      Court, EPA's review must set the primary and secondary      standards based on the scientific evidence, and may not      consider implementation costs or other economic consequences.      Whitman v. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.457, 465 (2001).      Rather, implementation decisions are a matter for states,      which are empowered to evaluate the costs and co-benefits of      potential implementation strategies and determine, in light      of those costs and co-benefits, which strategies are most      suitable for them. See Union v. EPA, 427 U.     246, 266 (1976).       To ensure that our residents and natural resources enjoy      the benefits of the clean air that the statute demands, our      offices have advocated in rulemakings and litigation that EPA      set standards that protect public health and welfare with an      adequate margin of safety, as the Act requires. E.g.,      Mississippi v. EPA, 744 F.3d 1334 (D.2013) (State      petitioners, including New York, California, Connecticut,      Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico,      Oregon, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia,      successfully argued for remand of secondary ozone standards);      American Farm Bureau v. EPA, 559 F.3d 512 (D.     2009) (State petitioners and amici, including New York,      California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland,      Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania Department of      Environmental Protection, Rhode Island, and the District of      Columbia, successfully argued for remand of primary fine      particulate matter standards); Murray Energy v. EPA (D.     15-1385) (State amici., including California Air      Resources Board, Delaware Department of Natural Resources,      Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the      District of Columbia, filed a brief supporting the 2015      primary ozone standard against attempts to weaken it).       The ozone rule promulgated by EPA in 2015 strengthened the      primary standard of 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. 80      65,292 (26, 2015). This level was at the high      end (i.e., less stringent) of the 65-70 ppb range that EPA      proposed in 2014. EPA's independent science advisors, the      Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, cautioned that this      level may offer little margin of safety, particularly for      sensitive subpopulations. Therefore, in comments on the      proposal, several of our states urged EPA to adopt a primary      standard lower than 70 ppb to protect public health with an      adequate margin of safety. However, even tightening the      standard from 75 ppb to 70 ppb will result in important      public health benefits. For example, EPA conservatively      estimated that meeting the 70 ppb standard nationally (not      including California) will result in net annual public health      benefits of up to $4.5 billion starting in 2025. These      national benefits include preventing approximately: 316 to      660 premature deaths; 230,000 asthma attacks in children;      160,000 missed school days; 28,000 missed work days; 630      asthma-related emergency room visits; and 340 cases of      acute bronchitis in children.       Under current law, states will develop and submit their own      plans to attain the 2015 standard by 2020 or 2021. But H.     806 would delay this deadline until October 2026 and delay      other similarly related deadlines, postponing even further      the life-saving benefits of attaining clean air. The bill      should be rejected on these grounds alone.       In addition, H.806 would undermine the protection of      health and welfare from the dangers of all criteria air      pollutants by weakening the national ambient air quality      standards process for updating standards based on the most      recent scientific evidence. Instead of requiring that      standards be reviewed--and as necessary, revised--every five      years based on the latest scientific evidence on the harms to      public health and welfare from exposure to criteria      pollutants, H.806 would require updates only once a      decade.       The bill would also eliminate the Act's requirement that      air quality standards be set solely based on adequate      protection of public health and welfare. Specifically, the      bill would authorize the EPA Administrator to also consider      ``likely technological feasibility'' in establishing primary      and secondary standards. This provision appears designed to      allow EPA to weaken standards nationwide if it thinks a      single area might be incapable of meeting them. But if that      were ever the case, the Act already provides relief      mechanisms for the affected area. In addition, the bill      undermines the Act's existing protections by creating a      loophole that allows EPA to treat hot or dry weather as an      ``exceptional event'' excusing an area's nonattainment.       Finally, the bill appears to be based on a misunderstanding      of the Act's balance between federal and state authority. The      bill directs EPA to cherry-pick hypothetical state      implementation strategies and only evaluate their adverse      side-effects, and, potentially, use that evaluation to weaken      ambient air quality standards. But EPA cannot know at the      time it sets standards what strategies states will choose, or      how individual states will value their beneficial side-     effects. Those considerations should remain separate from the      standard-setting process.       In summary, ozone pollution remains a serious and      persistent problem for our nation, posing a particular risk      to the health of children, the elderly and the sick, as well      as individuals who spend time outdoors. Because H.806      would represent a significant step backward in combatting      ozone and other dangerous criteria pollutants, we urge you to[[Page H5948]]     oppose the bill.

2435,topic-id,1741,"Mr.Chairman, the second document I include in the Record is a letter from the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, again, opposing the bill.         Office of the Commissioner, New York State Department of            Environmental Conservation,                                                       Albany,     Re H.806, Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017.     John Shimkus, Chairman,     Subcommittee on the Environment, Committee on Energy and          Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington,     Paul Tonko, Ranking Member,     Subcommittee on the Environment, Committee on Energy and          Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Honorable Chair Shimkus and Representative Tonko: The      State of New York strongly opposes the ``Ozone Standards      Implementation Act of 2017,'' which will substantially harm      public health to the detriment of New Yorkers and residents      of many other states. The proposed bill would restrict the      efficacy of the Clean Air Act in a way that would delay      implementation of critical health-based standards for      protecting the public from harmful ground-level ozone and      other dangerous air pollutants. The result of this proposed      bill would be the significant postponement of health and      environmental benefits for nearly a decade, inevitably      resulting in increased illness and deaths from air pollution.                              Introduction       The Clean Air Act (``Act'') addresses the critically      important issue of protecting the health and welfare of all      Americans from excessive levels of air pollution. It      establishes a federal-state partnership under which EPA,      informed by established science, sets National Ambient Air      Quality Standards (NAAQS) at a level necessary to protect      public health, and states develop and implement plans for      achieving those standards. This collaborative process has      significantly reduced pollutant concentrations to the great      benefit of the public. Importantly, the process provided by      the sections 109 and 110 of the Act recognizes that air      pollution knows no boundaries and that air quality in many      states, including New York, is impacted by emissions from      sources located upwind.       Section 109 of the Act ensures that implementation of the      Act is guided by established science; it charges the Clean      Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) with reviewing the      latest ``state of the science'' relating to public and      environmental health, and conveying its findings to the      Based on that information, the Administrator      establishes the NAAQS at a level necessary to protect public      health within a reasonable margin of safety. Under Section      110 of the Act, States then develop plans to achieve air      quality that meets the standard in those areas that do not      meet the standard, known as ``nonattainment'' areas.       In its latest review, CASAC determined that the existing      2008 ozone NAAQS was insufficiently protective of public      health, particularly for at-risk groups including children,      older adults, people of all ages who have lung diseases such      as asthma, and people who are active outdoors. Based on      CASAC's scientific findings, EPA determined that implementing      the 2015 ozone NAAQS would help prevent a range of harmful      health effects each year, including 320 to 660 premature      deaths; 230,000 asthma attacks in children; 160,000 days when      kids miss school; 28,000 missed work days; 630 asthma-related      emergency room visits; and 340 cases of acute bronchitis in      children. EPA has identified additional serious health      threats from ozone including cardiovascular disease (e.g.,      heart attacks, strokes, heart disease, congestive heart      failure); potential harm to the central nervous system; and      potential reproductive and developmental harm. The health      benefits from meeting the 2015 ozone NAAQS exceed the costs      of controls by 2 to 4 times.       Like many other states, New York strongly supported EPA's      strengthening of the ozone NAAQS in 2015. This support comes      even though New York faces a substantial burden of achieving      ozone attainment in the New York City metropolitan area.      This-burden, however, is outweighed by the need to address      the serious public health impacts. In New York City,      approximately 1 in 10 emergency room visits for asthma are      attributable to ozone pollution. Rather than seek to delay      its ozone attainment efforts, New York strives to bring the      New York City metropolitan area into attainment as      expeditiously as possible, in order to provide its residents      with cleaner and more healthful air to breathe.        Delaying public health benefits of the 2015 ozone NAAQS       The proposed legislation would harm public health by      delaying the implementation of the 2015 ozone NAAQS (and its      corresponding health benefits) for eight years and further      postponing any future standard for several years beyond when      they are necessary. Current law requires EPA to designate      states under the 2015 ozone NAAQS according to their      monitored air quality by October 2017, and states not meeting      the standards would have a number of years to reach      compliance proportional to the severity of their ozone      problems. However, this legislation would defer action so      that designations would not be made until October 2025, thus      postponing even the beginning of planning efforts until after      attainment would otherwise have been achieved under the      current structure of the For New Yorkers and other      Americans, this would result in a substantial delay in their      ability to breathe clean and healthful air.       Even worse, this proposed bill compounds this public health      harm by allowing the construction of new power plants and      factories without considering their impact on a region's      ability to achieve compliance with the Under current      law, such new and modified facilities located in areas      designated nonattainment are subject to a control technology      review under the Clean Air Act's nonattainment new source      review program, which requires a demonstration of control      technology that would consider the ``lowest achievable      emission rate,'' resulting in the most stringent emission      limit for a certain source class. This bill would eliminate      these new source reviews, which are critical for advancing a      nonattainment area toward NAAQS compliance.       Together, these aspects of the legislation will have even      worse additional adverse impacts on states like New York that      are victimized by upwind air pollution. First, this      legislation will impair New York's relief from ozone      transport from upwind locations. EPA modeling indicates that      between 75% and 94% of the ozone in the New York City      metropolitan area comes from sources outside of New      Although New York will continue actions to reduce emission of      ozone precursors, it cannot achieve healthful ozone levels      without a substantial reduction in emissions from states      located upwind, which are responsible for most of New York's      ozone levels. Many of these states encompass areas that are      currently monitoring as nonattainment, and these areas would      have to achieve emission reductions under current law if      designated nonattainment. Postponing a nonattainment      designation for the New York City metropolitan area will have      the unacceptable effect of postponing the ``good neighbor''      obligation of upwind areas to reduce their significant      contribution to New York's nonattainment until sometime after      the nonattainment designation.       Moreover, postponing compliance with nonattainment New      Source Review in areas that would otherwise be designated as      nonattainment with the ozone NAAQS establishes an inequitable      outcome for New York and other states that have already been      designated nonattainment. Under this proposed bill, new      industrial facilities in areas currently designated      nonattainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS or in the Ozone      Transport Region--including all of New York--will have to      comply with nonattainment NSR requirements, yet facilities      located in regions with comparable or worse air quality and      much higher emissions will not have to do so for a decade or      more. As such, states that would otherwise be designated      nonattainment would gain an unfair advantage in attracting      business development under this bill.[[Page H5949]]  Delaying public health benefits from reducing other criteria pollutants       Aside from ozone, provisions of this proposed bill would      affect future NAAQS reviews for all criteria pollutants, thus      compounding negative public health impacts. For example, the      bill would irresponsibly extend the NAAQS review time from      five years to ten for all criteria pollutants. Retaining the      five-year review schedule ensures that the Administrator      reviews the relevant state of the science while it is timely      and germane. Health science moves quickly; by the time one      NAAQS revision is reaching completion, other pertinent      clinical studies are being published.       This proposed bill weakens public health protection by      making cost and technological feasibility larger factors in      the establishment and implementation of The Supreme      Court has already upheld the notion that the consideration of      costs has no place in the setting of a NAAQS (Whitman v.      American Trucking Associations, Inc., 2001). Instead,      questions of technological and economic feasibility are      considered at the stage of implementing the For      example, the Act's nonattainment area classifications      recognize that areas with more difficult ozone pollution      problems require more time to comply. Unfortunately, Section      3(b) of the proposed bill would change the long-standing      practice of how an Administrator determines the NAAQS by      allowing him or her to analyze, as a secondary consideration,      the likely technological feasibility of a revised      Section 3(c) would expand CASAC's role to providing advice to      the Administrator on adverse economic effects (among others)      prior to the setting of the Taken together, these      proposed revisions would have the effect that NAAQS would no      longer be set at levels that are protective of public health      and welfare.       Finally, the proposed bill unnecessarily redefines ordinary      expected conditions as ``exceptional events'' that need not      be considered by a state in demonstrating attainment. The      intent of the ``extraordinary event'' exception is to allow a      state to discount NAAQS exceedances that result from one-     time, unpredictable, and uncontrollable events such as      wildfires. The proposal, however, would allow commonplace      conditions such as stagnant air masses and ``meteorological      event[s] involving high temperatures or lack of      precipitation'' to be considered exceptional. In their ozone      planning, states should anticipate these conditions, which      are expected to occur each year and promote the formation of      ozone when public health is at the greatest risk.       We also disagree with the proposal to allow sources to      avoid nonattainment new source review until release of the      implementation guidance. EPA's delay in issuing guidance      should not be an excuse to allow new sources in nonattainment      areas to contribute to further air quality degradation. In      addition, the bill's reduction of the time allotted for      states to formulate and submit attainment plans from the      current three years to one year reflects a misunderstanding      of the laborious process for developing these plans.                               Conclusion       The Clean Air Act is a bipartisan success story. Citizens      across the country have benefited from the Act's clean air      requirements over the last few decades. People can breathe      easier due to the clean air standards that have resulted from      rigorous reviews that are guided by the latest scientific      evidence. Passage of this proposed bill would deprive the      American people of those benefits, worsen air quality and      harm public health substantially.

2436,topic-id,1572,"Mr.Chairman, the third document I include in the Record is a letter signed by 15 medical and public health organizations, again, opposing the bill.                                                    July 17, 2017.       Dear Representative: Clean air is fundamental for good      health, and the Clean Air Act promises all Americans air that      is safe to breathe. The undersigned public health and medical      organizations urge you to oppose H.806, the so-called      ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017.'' A more      fitting name for this legislation would be the ``Smoggy Skies      Act,'' as it delays lifesaving standards to reduce ozone      pollution, or smog, and permanently weakens the Clean Air            Clear, up-to-date, scientific evidence documented the need      for greater protection from ozone pollution, and drove the      stronger limit on ozone that the U.Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA) finalized in 2015. To meet the      updated standard, the states have clear authority and plenty      of time to plan and then work to reduce pollution under the      Clean Air Act's long-established, balanced implementation      timeline. Despite those facts, the Smoggy Skies Act imposes      additional delays and sweeping changes that will threaten      health, particularly the health of children, seniors and      people with chronic disease.       The Smoggy Skies Act also reaches far beyond implementation      of the current ozone standards. It permanently weakens the      Clean Air Act and future air pollution health standards for      all criteria pollutants. Specifically, the Smoggy Skies Act      weakens implementation and enforcement of all lifesaving air      pollution health standards, including those for carbon      monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter,      and sulfur dioxide. It would also permanently undermine the      Clean Air Act as a public health law.       The Clean Air Act requires that EPA review the science on      the health impacts of carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen      dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide air      pollutants every five years and update these national ambient      air quality standards according to the current science. The      Smoggy Skies Act would lengthen the review period of the air      pollution health standards from once every five years to once      every ten years for all criteria pollutants. As the science      continues to evolve, the public deserves that their      protections be based on the most up-to-date science,      certainly not a schedule that is twice as long as they      currently have under the law. The work that EPA and states do      to clean up air pollution should be based on the best and      most current science.       Emerging research adds crucial information to our      understanding of the impacts that air pollution has on human      health, and EPA should not have to wait a decade to      incorporate it. For example, on March 29, 2016, a newly      published study, Particulate Matter Exposure and Preterm      Birth: Estimates of U.Attributable Burden and Economic      Costs showed new information linking particulate air      pollution to nearly 16,000 preterm births per year. Under the      Smoggy Skies Act, EPA would have to wait as much as a decade      to consider such new evidence when setting standards. Ten      years is far too long to wait to protect public health from      levels of pollution that the science shows are dangerous or      for EPA to consider new information.       In the 2015 review of the ozone standard, EPA examined an      extensive body of scientific evidence demonstrating that      ozone inflames the lungs, causing asthma attacks and      resulting in emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and      premature deaths. A growing body of research indicates that      ozone may also lead to central nervous system harm and may      harm developing fetuses. In response to the evidence, EPA      updated the ozone standards. While many of our organizations      called for a more protective level, there is no doubt that      the updated, 70 parts per billion standard provides greater      health protections compared to the previous standard.       The Smoggy Skies Act would delay implementation of these      more protective air pollution standards for at least eight      years. This means eight years of illnesses and premature      deaths that could have been avoided. Parents will not be told      the truth about pollution in their community and states and      EPA will not work to curb pollution to meet the new      standards. The public has a fundamental right to know when      pollution in the air they breathe or the water they drink      threatens health, and Congress must not add eight years of      delay to health protections and cleanup.       Furthermore, the American public overwhelmingly supports      upholding these more protective limits on ozone. A 2017 poll      found that by a 2-to-1 margin, Americans believe Congress      should leave EPA's updated standards in place, showing clear      public opposition to the Smoggy Skies       The Smoggy Skies Act would also permanently weaken      implementation of the 2015 and future ozone standards. The      Act would delay implementation to a date when the evidence      shows that most states would meet the standard with cleanup      measures already in place. It would also reduce requirements      for areas with the most dangerous levels of ozone. Areas      classified as being in ``extreme nonattainment'' of the      standard would no longer need to write plans that include      additional contingency measures if their initial plans fail      to provide the expected pollution reductions. The Clean Air      Act prioritizes reducing air pollution to protect the      public's health, but the Smoggy Skies Act opens a new      opportunity for communities to avoid cleaning up,      irrespective of the health impacts.       Further, the bill would greatly expand the definition of an      exceptional event. Under the Clean Air Act, communities can      demonstrate to EPA that an exceptional event, such as a      wildfire, should not ``count'' in determining whether their      air quality meets the national standards. This bill would      recklessly expand the definition of exceptional events to      include high pollution days when the air is simply stagnant--     the precise air pollution episodes the Clean Air Act was      designed to combat--and declare those bad air days as      ``exceptional.'' Changing the accounting rules will undermine      health protection and avoid pollution cleanup.       Additionally, the bill would permanently weaken the Clean      Air The Clean Air Act is one of our nation's premier      public health laws because it puts health first. The Act has      a two-step process: first, EPA considers scientific evidence      to decide how much air pollution is safe to breathe and sets      the standard that is requisite to protect public health with      an adequate margin of safety. Then, states work with EPA to      develop a plan to clean up air pollution to meet the      standard. Cost and feasibility are fully considered in the      second phase during implementation of the standard.       This bill states that if EPA finds that ``a range of      levels'' of an air pollutant protect public health with an      adequate margin of safety, then EPA may consider      technological feasibility in choosing a limit within that[[Page H5950]]     range. Further, the bill would interject implementation      considerations, including projections of adverse economic and      energy effects, into the standard setting process. These      changes will permanently weaken the core health-based premise      of the Clean Air Act--protecting the public from known health      effects of air pollution with a margin of safety.       These changes would reverse the intention of the Clean Air      Act explicitly included by its bipartisan authors in      Congress: that basing the standard on the protection of      public health would push technology to develop new tools and      techniques to reduce emissions. They understood that pushing      the cleanup technology to meet the urgent need to protect      health would help to expand job development and growth. They      were correct, as the emission control industry today has      helped the nation meet stronger standards in creative, cost-     effective ways.       The text also explicitly states that the Smoggy Skies Act      does not authorize any additional funds to be appropriated to      EPA for its work carrying out the bill's provisions. Forcing      EPA to perform the additional work of implementing this bill      with no additional resources could put the agency's current,      lifesaving work at further risk.       Finally, an amendment adopted in committee would eliminate      key enforcement provisions under the Clean Air As      amended, the bill could perpetuate poor air quality in      communities with the highest pollution levels indefinitely.      The provision waives the obligation for states with areas      heavily polluted by ozone or particulate matter to write      effective plans to attain the health standards. Currently, if      an area with unhealthy air fails to write an adequate plan to      meet air pollution standards, EPA can impose sanctions.      Because that enforcement provision exists, EPA has almost      never needed to use it--states wrote effective plans. As      amended, the Smoggy Skies Act would bar EPA from using this      key enforcement tool for especially polluted areas,      essentially eliminating the obligation for states to write a      meaningful pollution cleanup plan that can demonstrate      meeting the health standards.       The Smoggy Skies Act is a sweeping attack on lifesaving      standards that protect public health from air pollution. This      bill is an extreme attempt to undermine our nation's proven      clean air health protections. Not only does it delay the      long-overdue updated ozone standards and weaken their      implementation and enforcement, it also permanently weakens      the health protections against many dangerous air pollutants      and the scientific basis of Clean Air Act standards.

2437,topic-id,955,"Finally, Mr.Chairman, I include a letter signed by 121 environmental and other groups opposing the bill.                                                   March 21, 2017.       Dear Senator/Representative, on behalf of our millions of      members, the undersigned 121 organizations urge you to oppose      the ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act'' (H.806,      263). The innocuous-sounding name is misleading: this      legislation would actually systematically weaken the Clean      Air Act without a single improvement, undermine Americans'      46-year right to healthy air based on medical science, and      delay life-saving health standards already years overdue.       This bill's vision of ``Ozone Standards Implementation''      eliminates health benefits and the right to truly safe air      that Americans enjoy under today's law. First, the      legislation would delay for ten years the right to safer air      quality, and even the simple right to know if the air is safe      to breathe. Corporations applying for air pollution permits      would be free to ignore new ground-level ozone (aka smog)      health standards during these additional ten years. For the      first time the largest sources of air pollution would be      allowed to exceed health standards. The bill would also      outright excuse the parts of the country suffering the worst      smog pollution from having backup plans if they do not reduce      pollution. The most polluted parts of the country should not      stop doing everything they can to protect their citizens'      health and environment by cleaning up smog pollution.       This bill is not content to merely weaken and delay      reductions in smog pollution. It also strikes at our core      right to clean air based on health and medical science. The      medically-based health standards that the law has been      founded on for 46 years instead could become a political      football weakened by polluter compliance costs. This could      well result in communities being exposed to unhealthy levels      of smog and soot and sulfur dioxide and even toxic lead      pollution. The bill would also double the law's five-year      review periods for recognizing the latest science and      updating health standards, which are already frequently years      late; this means in practice that unhealthy air would persist      for longer than ten years.       The legislation also weakens implementation of current      clean air health standards. The bill expands exemptions for      ``exceptional events'' that are not counted towards      compliance with health standards for air quality, even when      air pollution levels are unsafe. This will mean more unsafe      air more often, with no responsibility to clean it up.      Requirements meant to ensure progress toward reducing smog      and soot pollution would shift from focusing on public health      and achievability to economic costs. Despite the bland name      ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act,'' this bill represents      an extreme attack on the most fundamental safeguards and      rights in the Clean Air       Since 1970, the Federal Clean Air Act has been organized      around one governing principle--that the EPA must set health      standards based on medical science for dangerous air      pollution, including smog, soot and lead, that protect all      Americans, with ``an adequate margin of safety'' for      vulnerable populations like children, the elderly and      asthmatics. This legislation eviscerates that principle and      protection. We urge you to oppose H.806 and 263, to      protect our families and Americans' rights to clean air.

When we talk about the difficulty of having to respond or achieve the standards that have been established and then they go stronger, well, on your way to 70 parts per billion, you are going to be moving through 75 parts per billion as you reduce those particulates that get emitted into our air. It is only logical that you could move along and continue to improve those standards.

Mr.Chair, I want to remind my colleagues, having just heard from a Californian, that California has nearly 3 million residents with asthma, including 650,000 children. Why on Earth would we want to put them at further risk by going backward? I suggest that we keep that in mind as we vote on this measure.  I heard the comment made about unachievable or unrealistic standards. Well, how is it that we have been making progress through the years? We have been growing jobs, and we have been cleaning the air. How is it that that was deemed unrealistic and unachievable?  Mr.Chairman, I believe in the pioneer spirit of this great country. I believe in her intellect. I believe in the passion to do the right thing. And I think that will continue to motivate us as we listen to scientists who tell us about the standards that we ought to achieve.  On our way to 75 parts per billion, we know that it is continued progress if we achieve 70; and if we listen to the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, they will tell us that the air, for safety, with the safety factor, we should be closer to 60. So we have much more room for progress, and we have the technological wizardry to make that happen. Our children and generations unborn are counting on us.  As has been stated many times over today, this is a move in a backward direction. We are concerned on this side of the aisle about H.806. We need to know that the standards that are out there are achievable, that those standards drive technological improvement.  We can grow the economy and clean the air. They are not mutually exclusive. In fact, we have proven that they are inclusive.  Mr.Chair, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this effort of opposition to H.806. It is, as many have called it, an effort that will continue to hold back progress.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

2451,topic-id,525,"Mr.Chair, my amendment strikes subsection (b) of section 3, which would allow the EPA to consider technological feasibility when determining what level of pollution is safe.  Health-based standards are the cornerstone of the Clean Air Act--health-based. The EPA sets NAAQS at levels sufficient to protect the public health, essentially, the level of ambient air pollution that is safe to breathe.  While costs are not considered in establishing these standards, costs can be--and are considered--in developing plans to achieve the necessary pollution reductions to meet the standards.  Unfortunately, H.806, as currently drafted, would change the longstanding criteria for establishing an air quality standard from one that is based solely on protecting public health to one that includes a consideration of the technological feasibility. This issue has been long debated and settled by  Since passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, including the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, Congress has excluded technological feasibility considerations from standard setting to ensure that public health--and public health alone--would determine the standards for air quality.  In 1970, on the passage of the Clean Air Act, Senator Ed Muskie from Maine said: ``The first responsibility of Congress is not the making of technological or economic judgments--or even to be limited by what is or appears to be technologically or economically infeasible. Our responsibility is to establish what the public interest requires to protect the health of persons. This may mean that people and industries will be asked to do what seems to be impossible at present time. But if health is to be protected, these challenges must be met.''  For approaching five decades, that has been the guiding tenet of the Clean Air Act: what is in the betterment of public health.  Guided by this principle, our Nation has experienced a 70 percent reduction in key air pollutants while tripling the size of the economy.  I believe that a great deal of this success can be credited to American innovation. Despite assertions that achieving clean air was not feasible, American ingenuity has consistently risen[[Page H5957]]to the challenge and made our country the leader in both clean air and clean air technology.  Unquestionably, these standards have driven innovation, creating a thriving domestic pollution control industry.  So I ask my colleagues who are in favor of this measure: What is it about a can-do attitude that you don't get? Why is it that you have a lack of trust in the power of American ingenuity?  Had these standards not been ambitious and focused solely on public health, we may still be relying upon the technology from the 1970s and breathing the poor air quality from that era along with it.  Available technologies cannot and should not determine what we can have in terms of clean air. Let's have the scientific and medical experts guide us, and I have confidence that our engineers and innovators will find that way. The history of those protections that we enjoy has been to set ambitious, but achievable, goals. We have achieved those goals, and we have much cleaner air to show for it.

2391,topic-id,394,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama for yielding, my good friend, Martha Roby, who has been such a leader on this issue. It has been my great privilege to be a sponsor of the Working Families Flexibility Act in the 113th Congress, in the 114th Congress, and now again in the 115th  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017, which will remove a Federal restriction on private sector employees who would like the option of comp time compensation in lieu of cash for their overtime work, the same as public sector employees. Mr.Speaker, we are talking about a voluntary choice made by employees for cash overtime or for comp time.  The last thing our Federal Government should be doing is dictating how our small-business employees and entrepreneur compensation operates. Mr.Speaker, in November, Missourians and many Americans spoke loud and clear: it is time to get government out of the pocketbooks and off of the backs of hardworking  Americans are also desperate for job flexibility. I know I was also as a working mom when I worked at Ralston Purina in Louis, They want to have a better balance of obligations of their day-to-day jobs while taking care of family and family matters.  The Working Families Flexibility Act will help us do just that. For the past 30 years, public sector employees have enjoyed the benefit of choosing voluntary paid time off, or comp time, instead of cash wages as compensation for working overtime hours. Private sector workers, who make up an incredibly large portion of our economy, should also reap this benefit. It is simply common sense.  Amending this overtime restriction through this legislation will help bring our workforce standards into the 21st century and allow our workers to do their jobs while still providing them with the voluntary flexibility to raise a family, pursue a college degree, care for aging parents, or tend to the day-to-day obligations that come their way.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Working Families Flexibility Act, as it safeguards workers' time and wages, and protects their use of the comp time they have earned. Most importantly, as we work each day to get our economy back on track, this legislation empowers the American worker with more options and flexibility that will ultimately lead to a better quality of life.

And I must say, since we do have time, that her being a champion of this in the last three Congresses that I have had the pleasure of working--and my constituents in Missouri's Second District have sent me--it is wonderful to see a working mom like her, who is juggling all of those day-to-day needs, to stand up for private sector workers who deserve the same kinds of options and flexibility that our public service has enjoyed for some 30 years.

2350,topic-id,323,"Mr.President, I recently received the sad news that Herbert Needleman has passed away. With Herbert's passing, we lost a great man--and the scientific community lost one of its best.  In the 1970s, Herb undertook groundbreaking studies that revealed the dangers of lead exposure in children. According to the Pittsburgh Gazette, Herb ``had been thinking about the impact lead had on children's cognitive abilities for nearly two decades before he finally came up with a way to test historic lead levels.'' He made powerful adversaries in the lead industry, but true to his research, Needleman found new and inventive ways to prove the toxic effects of lead exposure.  As a researcher at Temple University, he developed the ``Tooth Fairy'' approach: a method to test children's baby teeth for lead exposure levels. This method led to pioneering research that found that Black children living in cities had lead levels five times higher than suburban, White children. In the words of Herb's son, ``He just couldn't tolerate injustice and could not stop seeking the truth.'' The results of Herb's hard work and his dedication to seeking the truth today reach from the halls of science to the apartments of inner cities.  I got to see his determination first hand, working alongside him in fighting the lead paint industry in Rhode When I was confronting the lead industry, over 35,000 Rhode Island children under the age of 6 had elevated levels of lead in their systems. His research was instrumental in the fight for the health of Rhode Island's children. I am deeply grateful for Herbert's help in my home State, and I know Rhode Island families are grateful as well.  America has lost a beloved pediatrician, psychiatrist, and brilliant scientist. I offer my condolences to the Needleman family and to the many people he taught and mentored through the years. He lives on as a lasting lesson in the power of science to help others.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4763-2.txt,1823,JOB FLEXIBILITY FOR WORKING FAMILIES,2017.0,2.0,June
2179,topic-id,1334,"Madam President, the Senate will shortly consider the nomination of Courtney Elwood to be the CIA's General I wanted to take a few minutes this morning to discuss the nomination and put it in the context of the extraordinary national security challenges our country faces.  It is hard to imagine a more despicable act than the terrorist attack in Manchester Monday night, killing innocent teenagers and children who were out to enjoy a concert. The suffering that Americans and all in the Senate have been reading about and watching on television is heartbreaking by any standards. I think it is fair to say that, as Americans, we stand in strong solidarity with our British friends, our allies, as they confront this horror. Our country will, as we have for so many years, stand shoulder to shoulder with them as there is an effort to collect more information about this attack, about what actually happened, and work to prevent future attacks.  Not everything is known about the attack, but one thing Americans do know is that it can happen here. That is why, as I begin this discussion on this important nomination and the challenges in front of our country, I would like to start, as I invariably do when we talk about intelligence matters, by recognizing the extraordinary men and women who work in the intelligence community, who work tirelessly across the government to keep our people safe from terrorist attacks. So much of what they do is in secret, and that is appropriate. It is so important to keep secret what is called the sources and methods that our intelligence community personnel are using. It is important to the American people and it is important to our country to make sure that the people protecting them every day can do their jobs.  The reason I took this time this morning to talk about this nomination is to talk about the broader context of what we owe the American people, and I feel very strongly that we owe the American people security and liberty. The two are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible to protect the people of our country with smart policies that protect both their security and their liberty.  Smart policies ensure that security and liberty are not mutually exclusive. For example, I would cite as a smart policy something I was proud to have been involved in. Section 102 of the USA FREEDOM Act sought to make sure that we weren't just indiscriminately collecting millions of phone records on law-abiding people. A provision, section 102, says that when our government believes there is an emergency where the safety and security and well-being of the American people is at stake, our government can move immediately to deal with the problem and then come back later and settle up with respect to getting a warrant. That was something that, I thought, really solidified what was a smart policy.  Our Founding Fathers had a Fourth Amendment for a reason--to protect the liberties of our people. What we said is that we are going to be sensitive to those liberties, but at the same time, we are going to be sensitive to[[Page S3112]]the security and well-being of the American people at a dangerous time. We are going to say that, if the government believes there is an emergency, the government can go get that information immediately and come back later and settle up with the warrant process.  Issues ensuring that we have security and liberty are especially important today. We obviously face terrorism. We are challenged by Russia and North Korea, and the list can go on and on. The fact is, there are a host of these challenges, and it seems to me that if we look at the history of how to deal with a climate like this, too often there is almost a kind of easy, practically knee-jerk approach that is billed as dealing with a great security challenge that very often gives our people less security and less liberty. At a time when people want both, they end up getting less. That is what happens so often in crises, and far too often it happens in large part because senior lawyers operating in secret give the intelligence community the green light to conduct operations that are not in the country's interest.  I am going to walk through how misguided and dangerous decisions can be made and how much depends on how the lawyers interpret current law. In past debates people have said: You know, that happened years ago, many years ago, and various steps were taken to correct it. Today, I am going to talk about how misguided and dangerous decisions can be made today.  At the center of this question is the nominee to be the CIA general counsel and what I consider to be very troubling statements that have been made on a number of the key issues that involve decisions that will be made now. In outlining those, I want to explain why it is my intention to vote against the confirmation of Courtney Elwood to be the CIA's general counsel.  The key principle to begin with is that there is a clear distinction between keeping secrets of sources and methods used by the intelligence community, which is essential, and the creation of secret law, which is not. We in the Senate have a responsibility to make sure the public is not kept in the dark about the laws and rules that govern what the intelligence community can and cannot do.  I believe the American people understand that their government cannot always disclose who it is spying on, but they are fed up with having to read in the papers about the government secretly making up the rules. They were fed up when they learned about the illegal, warrantless wiretapping program. They were fed up when they learned about the bulk collection of phone records of millions of law-abiding  What our people want to know is that the rules are going to be, 1, clear to everybody and, 2, that the government is operating within those rules. That is why the nominations for the intelligence community are so important. The American people need to know how these men and women understand the laws that authorize what they can and cannot do in secret.  Shortly, the Senate will consider the nominee to be the CIA's general counsel. I believe there are few more important positions in government than this one, when it comes to interpreting key laws. The advice the general counsel provides to the Central Intelligence Agency will be shielded from the American people and possibly from Congress as well. There is almost never accountability before the public, the press, watchdog groups, or other public institutions that help preserve our democracy. There are almost never debates on the floor of the Senate about the legality of the CIA's operations. It is all in secret.  The advice of this general counsel will carry especially important heft, given what CIA Director Mike Pompeo said during his confirmation. Again and again during those confirmation hearings, when asked what boundaries Director Pompeo would draw around the government's surveillance authorities, the Director responded that he was bound by the law. In effect, the Director said to the Senate and this body that he would defer to the lawyers. So if Congress and the American people were to have any clue as to what the Central Intelligence Agency might do under Director Pompeo, we were going to have to ask the nominee to be general counsel. That is why it is critical that she answer questions about her views of the law and that she answer them now before a confirmation vote.  I asked those questions, and what I heard in return was either a troubling response or some combination of ``I don't know,'' and ``I will figure it out after I am confirmed.''  Now, without answers, we are left largely to judge ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3111-2.txt,1247,REMEMBERING HERBERT NEEDLEMAN,2017.0,24.0,June
