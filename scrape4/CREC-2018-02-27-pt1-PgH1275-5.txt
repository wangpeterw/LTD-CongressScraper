            CUTTING TAPE FOR RECREATIONAL RODEO COMPETITORS

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight another example 
of Federal overreach that threatens our Montana and Western way of 
life. Unclear Federal regulations could force millions of Americans who 
recreationally compete in rodeos or participate in other equestrian 
events to get a commercial driver's license. But these are not folks 
competing for their livelihoods. In a recent story in the Billings 
Gazette, Andy Bolich, the head coach for the Montana State University 
rodeo team, said: ``For the most part, around Montana, I would say 
rodeo is a hobby for most people.''
  Yet Federal regulations could force these rodeo participants to wade 
through unnecessary, costly red tape for their hobby. That is why I 
recently led a letter which a bipartisan group of 26 colleagues signed, 
to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. We urged the 
Department of Transportation to clarify how the CDL regulations treat 
those who participate recreationally in rodeo events.
  Mr. Speaker, we must continue reforming, rolling back, and repealing 
unnecessary regulations to protect our Montana and Western way of life.
