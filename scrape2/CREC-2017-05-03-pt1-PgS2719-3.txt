                       AMERICA AT THE CROSSROADS

 Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to share a poem and song 
titled ``America at the Crossroads,'' written by my dear friend and 
fellow Floridian, JoAnna O'Keefe. She conveys a message of unity and 
patriotism that I believe is important for Congress and our Nation as 
we tackle many challenges at home and abroad. Mrs. O'Keefe's work won 
her the George Washington Honor Medal by the Freedoms Foundation at 
Valley Forge this year, and I am honored to share it with my Senate 
colleagues.
  The material follows:

                        America at the Crossroads

                          (By JoAnna O'Keefe)

     We the people
     Are on opposite sides;
     We've lost sight of the middle
     Where Resolutions reside.

     If Jefferson were here right now
     He would pick up his pen.
     On parchment he'd write:
     Be Patriots again!

     Look into the eyes

[[Page S2720]]

     Of your sisters and brothers.
     Be Americans!
     Respecting one another.

     No outside force
     Will ever take this land.
     But a ``house divided,''
     Cannot stand.

     Blood has been shed
     For this land of the Free
     Be Americans!
     Embrace your destiny.

     Be that ``City on a Hill.''
     Be that Light!
     Lay down your anger.
     Americans! Unite!

                          ____________________
