    RECOGNIZING JEREMY RICH, NEW YORK'S 2017 NATIONAL DISTINGUISHED 
                               PRINCIPAL

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeremy Rich, the 
principal at Barringer Road Elementary School in Ilion, a constituent 
of the 22nd Congressional District. For his stellar record of service, 
professionalism, and contributions to the educational process, Mr. Rich 
was named New York's 2017 National Distinguished Principal by the 
National Association of Elementary School Principals.
  In 2013, Mr. Rich became the principal of Barringer Road Elementary. 
Since that day, he has arrived at school promptly at 6:30 a.m. each 
morning, bringing a positive attitude and inspirational words to each 
morning announcement.
  Prior to his service at Barringer Road, Mr. Rich served as principal 
at the now-closed Remington Elementary School, where he was integral in 
facilitating the successful merger of the Mohawk and Ilion school 
districts.
  During his time at Ilion Junior High School, he served as the 
principal, the dean of students, and an English teacher.
  Mr. Rich's commitment to his role is unparalleled. Both teachers and 
parents alike describe Mr. Rich as comforting, helpful, and passionate. 
One teacher described him as a ``superstar principal and a fantastic 
human being.'' Mr. Rich's record exemplifies his clear dedication to 
public education, his students, and our community.
  Please join me today in congratulating this well-respected educator 
and beloved member of the 22nd District.
