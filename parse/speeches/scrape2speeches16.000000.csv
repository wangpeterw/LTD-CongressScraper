Across the state, Keith is well known for his steadfast commitment to strong Wyoming communities. After starting his career in banking and spending nearly two decades with the Farm Credit Services of America, Keith has served as the president of Platte Valley Bank in Wheatland for 15 years. In addition to his work at the bank, Keith is exceptionally active in his community. The list of organizations, boards, and associations that have benefited from Keith's leadership and involvement is long. He has served, among others, as a member of the Platte County Economic Development Board of Directors, as chairman of the Wyoming Agriculture in the Classroom, and as a member of the Wyoming Stock Growers Land Trust Board of Most notable, however, is Keith's focus on the youngest members of our Wyoming communities.  Keith and his wife, Marie, have two children, several grandchildren, and have served as foster parents. Keith knows that a community's strength is in its future, and he has worked hard to ensure that the next generation will be as dedicated to our State as he is.

4388,topic-id,1111,"Mr.President, over the weekend, President Trump celebrated 100 days that he has been in office as President of the United Newspapers and magazines and pundits on television were all talking about[[Page S2661]]what the President has accomplished in those first 100 days.  From what I heard talking to people at home in Wyoming this past weekend, his first 100 days has been a huge success. People tell me that they think America is finally headed in the right direction again. I had a lot of people tell me they feel as if they have actually gotten a new spring in their step as a result of the Presidential election last year and President Trump taking office.  The other day when I was home, I was in line at the gas station behind a guy. A friend of his came and said: Hey, how are you doing? The guy said: We are hiring again.  That is the kind of confidence that is happening all around The polling company Gallup says that it is happening not just in Wyoming but all across the country. For 24 straight weeks, more Americans have been more optimistic than pessimistic about the economy. As soon as Donald Trump was elected President, economic confidence soared, and it has stayed positive ever since. Gallup said that this is the exact opposite of what they had seen in the previous 8 years; that is, during the whole Obama administration, during the entire so-called economic recovery.  In another poll released last week, Gallup said that people are also less worried that they will lose the job they have. They found that American workers are less concerned about being laid off from their job than at any time since Gallup started asking questions way back in 1975. That is more than 40 years ago.  Why are people optimistic now? I think it is because they see that President Trump and the Republicans in Congress are serious about improving the economy. They see that we are serious about giving relief to Americans who have been getting buried under an avalanche of redtape. They see that the President is off to a very fast start in the White  Just look at what we have already done to help relieve the burdens on Congress has rolled back 13 different midnight regulations that President Obama tried to sneak through at the last minute. We struck down a stream buffer rule that was meant to block coal mining. We got rid of a rule that puts Americans at a competitive disadvantage when they are trying to develop energy resources overseas. We got rid of a regulation that took the control of local energy issues away from the State officials; we got rid of that regulation. And we got rid of one of the regulations that gave more control to Washington and less to These were regulations that harmed Americans and wiped out American jobs. Now those regulations are gone.  We have more that we can do to roll back terrible regulations like these. I have introduced a resolution to block another damaging rule that has come out by the Bureau of Land Management, which has to do with the Obama administration rules on methane that is produced at oil and gas wells. The new regulations created confusion by duplicating other rules that were already on the books.  That was the problem with so many of these regulations coming out by the Obama administration as they left office: regulation on top of regulation causing costs and confusion. They added costs that discourage energy production and kill energy jobs.  I hope that we can have a vote on this resolution very soon and get rid of this unnecessary red tape.  As active as Congress has been getting rid of these unfair, last-minute rules, President Trump has been even more active. He has already signed at least 30 Executive orders to help clear a path for the American economy to take off again. He signed a major Executive order promoting American energy independence. This has been an enormous shift away from the Obama-era approach of disruptive regulations, restrictions, and Washington overreach. All of these regulations did more to harm hard-working Americans than they did to actually help the environment. From now on, Washington will be looking for ways to protect our environment while helping our economy to grow.  Just last week, President Trump took another important step to keep his promises. He eased restrictions on drilling for oil and gas in offshore areas, like the Arctic and the Atlantic These places have great potential for producing the energy America needs. President Trump is helping to create certainty that those resources will be available if we need them.  President Obama couldn't imagine that it was possible to have responsible energy development in President Trump knows differently. He knows it is possible. He knows that American workers can do the job. He knows that America will be stronger because of it. I think that is the kind of thing the American people mean when they tell me that they feel they have a spring in their step.  I can also tell you that this is just the beginning. Remember when President Obama bragged that he had a pen and a phone? Well, President Trump has proved that he has a whole drawer full of pens, and he intends to keep using them to help get the American economy growing again. He wants to hear more people saying that things are great; we are hiring again. That is what the President has been doing, and it is what Congress is doing. These are the kinds of things that will get this country back on track when it comes to our energy policy.  In Wyoming and in much of the country, energy means jobs. Our goal should be to make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can without raising costs on American families. All of us should be able to agree on that. It is time to restore that balance to America's energy policy. President Trump is dedicated to getting that balance right.  Republicans in Congress are dedicated to getting the economy back in gear, and I hope that more Democrats will join us with their ideas and with their support. That is what the American people want, and it is what they voted for. It is why people are confident and why they see better days ahead for this great country.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

4411,topic-id,2253,"Mr.President, I thank the ranking member of the Finance Committee for his leadership not only on this bill but also healthcare over the decades. He knows something about the right way of doing it and the wrong way of doing it, which is partly what brings me to the floor today.  I want to say something that I think will be uncontroversial to the people at home but may be news to some people here, and that is whether you support the Affordable Care Act or whether you don't support the Affordable Care Act, whether you have been a supporter of ObamaCare or whether you are not a supporter of what is called ObamaCare, in general, people are pretty dissatisfied with our healthcare system at home. In general, people are pretty dissatisfied with the rate their insurance goes up. They are pretty dissatisfied with the fact that a lot of people are still uncovered in this country. If they are a senior, they are pretty dissatisfied not just with the idea but with the practice that month after month, people have to cut their medicines in half just to get through the month. They are pretty dissatisfied with the fact that they call an insurance company to make a claim to say ``My child was sick'' and point out that month after month they have paid their premiums only to find that on the day they make that claim, there is someone at that insurance company who has more time than they do to stay on the phone, to keep them on that phone, to deny them their claim. They are pretty dissatisfied about that.  As a whole, I think the American people are dissatisfied by the fact that we spend 16 percent of our gross domestic product, our entire economy, on healthcare when every other industrialized country in the world spends half of that or less than half of that on healthcare and--this is going to come as news to some people in this Chamber--get better results. We are moving in the wrong direction on too many dimensions when it comes to our healthcare.  I have said all of that as a proponent of the Affordable Care I spent a year and a half in Colorado, in certain places, being called a Bolshevik or a socialist, being accused of advocating for a government takeover of our healthcare system. This was at a time when the tea party was very active, and people would come and say, quite rightly: Read the bill. Read the bill. We need to take our government back.  We tried to do some things to help in that bill. For the first time in the country's history, we tried to say that it wasn't OK to discriminate against people who were sick or have what is called a preexisting condition when they went to buy health insurance. As the Senator from Oregon said, it wasn't OK that if you did get sick when you had insurance and you got something like cancer that an insurance company could just throw you off their rolls because you hit their cap.  We said that we thought it wasn't OK that there were millions of people, many of them children, who didn't have access to primary care; that is, a doctor to be able to give you a checkup and see how you are doing so that you weren't getting treated in the emergency room--the most expensive, least intentional way of running a healthcare system that is imaginable. In fact, I would say that is the Bolshevik way of running a healthcare system: When you are sick, you get to show up at the emergency room, and somebody is going to take care of you. It gives you the results of a Bolshevik system because you are paying more for less of an outcome.  We tried to address some of those things, and that became the Affordable Care That became That became something that was politicized for 7 years, as the House of Representatives cynically, month after month, voted to repeal the Affordable Care Then the majority of the House went home to their districts and said: We repealed We voted to repeal  You didn't repeal it.  No, we voted to repeal it. If you send me back there next week, I will do the[[Page S3899]]same thing. I will do it the week after that.  Then at some point, people started to say: Well, you keep having the vote on repealing Why haven't you actually done it?  They said: Well, we didn't have the  They have had the Senate now for two  Well, we didn't have the  Now we have the same party in Presidency, the Senate, and the House of This terrible bill we are considering is not a bill that anybody--that is an exaggeration--virtually anybody in my State supports or has asked for. That is what we have in front of us.  I know somebody else who knew that the American people were dissatisfied with their healthcare system, and that was Donald Trump when he was running for President of the United  I hope, in particular, the people who voted for the President, as a way of keeping Washington accountable, will remember that he said he was going to provide the American people ``a terrific plan,'' to ``cover everyone at a fraction of the cost.'' The President, when he was running--he still does it--was very fond of talking about--his words--how stupid everybody in Washington was and he knew how to make deals and he was going to come here and make great deals and he was going to cover everybody at a fraction of the price with a terrific plan. That is what he promised the American people. That is what he was peddling when he was running for He said: ``Everybody is going to be taken care of much better than you are taken care of now.'' That is what he said. This isn't fake news. This isn't CNN or the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or whoever is in the crosshairs. This is what the President said on the campaign trail when he was running because he detected, quite rightly, that the American people are unhappy with the way our healthcare system works--unhappy in the richest country of the world to have a healthcare system where people have to make decisions about their lives and about their children's lives that no one in the industrialized world has to make about their lives or their children's lives--and they wonder why.  I think the diagnosis has a lot to do with what some people have said, which is special interests having a grasp on Washington, That is what the President said he was going to give to the American people. This is what his promise was to the American people. What did we get instead? We have a bill passed by the House that was a massive tax cut for the richest people in America, which, literally, nobody in my townhalls in red or blue parts of my State has ever said is something that would help with their healthcare. Not a single person has said what they want for healthcare is a massive tax cut for people making more than $250,000 a year--not one, not one person.  There is a 25-percent cut to Medicaid in this bill. That was done in the name of, I guess, reforming entitlements. The argument has been made that there are a lot of lazy people who are on Medicaid, and if you cut Medicaid by 25 percent, they will go to work, and they should go to work. Well, there are two issues with that. The first is, it is important to understand who is on  In my State, 50 percent of the people are children. Are they supposed to be at work or can they go to school? Then there are a whole bunch of people on Medicaid--in fact, it is a very large share of the population of Medicaid who have spent their entire life savings down for the privilege of being in a nursing home paid for by Are they supposed to work? Then there are a lot of people--I am ashamed to say this--there are a lot of people in this country who are working one job, two jobs and can't make enough money to buy private insurance in the United States of That is a shame. Do they need to get a third or fourth job before we are saying they are not lazy or should we fix this healthcare system so it is more affordable, more predictable, more transparent for American families? Those were the promises the President made. That is the content of the bill with one addition. They slipped in--between that tax cut and that 25-percent cut to Medicaid, which is paying for that tax cut for the wealthiest Americans--what my colleague Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, has described accurately as ObamaCare lite. He is absolutely right about that. If you hate ObamaCare, you will hate ObamaCare lite. If you are looking in a rural part of my State or the country, and you already can't afford insurance because there is no market there and you can't get a subsidy that will help you because you are making too much money, you are going to hate that even more. Wait until they pass the Cruz amendment, which he is calling the freedom amendment--freedom to have to endure something no one else in the industrialized world has to put up with, which is buying lousy insurance that doesn't cover anything. You can create the worst product in the world and make it affordable. That is not hard to do.  We have come a long way from Franklin Roosevelt's four freedoms, if we are talking about the freedom of insurance companies to be able to throw you off if you hit the lifetime cap, freedom not to give you insurance if you have a preexisting condition. We have come a long, long way.  Finally, my colleagues are here so I am going to stop. I do want to say one word about the process. The majority leader today announced that he is going to keep the Senate in for 2 weeks in August because they have to finish their work on healthcare or maybe it is 3 weeks in I don't care if it is a month. I don't care if they cancel every recess we have between now and the end of the year. I don't care if we work on weekends if it will create a situation where we can actually improve healthcare for the American people. I am glad to stay. In fact, I think we should stay, but, unfortunately, that is not what he is trying to do. What he is trying to do is jam through a bill that is incredibly unpopular with the American people. That is why, until 2 weeks ago, it was a secret. Until two Thursdays ago, it was a secret.  I have to suspect that one reason they want to keep us in August is because they don't want to go home because they were just beaten to death over the July 4th recess because people came out in Republican and Democratic parts of their States and said: Are you out of your minds? This bill has nothing to do with our healthcare. They probably don't want to repeat that in  I will close just by saying this, and I said this again to the people who came to my townhalls and were highly critical of the Affordable Care Act and the process: I want to remind you folks that back then--the Senator from Oregon will remember this--back then, we spent over a year debating that bill here in the We had countless--somebody could count them up--but countless committee hearings in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Finance We had almost 200 amendments that were Republican amendments that were adopted as part of that bill. Everybody remembers, no Republican voted for it, but there were 200 Republican amendments adopted as part of that bill. We have not had a single committee hearing in the Senate about this healthcare bill--not one.  So you can keep us in for 2 weeks or 3 weeks longer in August, but a better idea might be to follow the regular order around this place. Talk about take our country back, take our government back, make it work, have hearings, have witnesses. I can think of 100 Coloradans, off the top of my head, who would like to come here and testify. I would even say 50 of them can be Republicans and 50 of them can be Have them come testify what would make healthcare better for them. That is what this should be about: families all across this country who are struggling because of our healthcare system and who need relief from this Congress and who so far aren't getting it.  I will close just by saying, if the President could submit a proposal that actually would meet the criteria he set out when he was running for President--instead of having a bill he couldn't pass with even 51 Republican votes--he would have a bill he could pass with 100 votes here in the Senate, and that is what we should strive to do.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-07-11-pt1-PgS3889-7.txt,1965,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,11.0,July

4576,topic-id,388,"Mr.Speaker, I am always amazed when I start hearing conversations about the Affordable Care Act and how it is working so well today.  I want to talk about two situations in my home State of  When the Affordable Care Act went into place in the State of Tennessee, we had a risk pool. The risk pool covered about 28,000 people. They were happy with their care, they were happy with their providers, and they were happy with the cost. It was patient centered. They determined what best fit their needs. These were people with preexisting conditions, happy with where they were.  In 1 day, because the Federal Government said, You don't meet this and you don't meet that and you don't meet this, they lost their insurance. They were in the marketplace.  I want to tell you about two situations that are very close to me, but they only represent a number of the many calls that I get in my office.  One is a good friend of mine who has lupus. She went on the marketplace. For the first year, she did pretty good. Her premiums were pretty low; her deductible was reasonable. But here is what she found: she couldn't keep her doctor.  Can you imagine someone who has had lupus for a number of years, it is being controlled, and now she is told she cannot keep her doctor? She had to find other doctors. She was not happy with that because she had a relationship. They didn't use the same treatment and care that she had received before. So she has not felt very healthy.  In the meantime, every year that it is renewed, she calls me to say: My premiums have gone up, my deductibles have gone up, and now it is more than what I was paying before when I liked what I had and I couldn't keep it, opposite of what the President told everyone: If you like what you have, you can keep it.  The second one is someone who has myasthenia gravis. Again, on that same risk pool. She lost her opportunity to get the medication that she was receiving, an IV medication. She has myasthenia gravis.

We firmly believe that Members of Congress should live by the same rules as everyone else, period. The bill we are considering now will make a simple technical correction to ensure that the American Health Care Act and its amendments apply equally to everyone when signed into law.  Over the last several months, we have worked thoughtfully and thoroughly with our colleagues in the Senate to achieve our shared goal of repealing and replacing Throughout these discussions, we have come to better appreciate and better understand the other Chamber's reconciliation limitations. As a result, we have drafted the American Health Care Act with constant awareness of what the slightest misstep may mean for the legislation's privileged status or that 51-vote threshold in the other body.  Some might say it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than to draft House policy to Senate procedure, but we are confident that we have achieved that challenging feat.  One of the limitations we have come to respect is that no committee other than the Senate Committee on Finance or the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions can receive a jurisdictional referral. For example, if we were to cross-reference multi-State plans established by the Affordable Care Act, we would get a referral to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee because those plans are under the Office of Personnel                              {time}  1115  So let's be clear, congressional healthcare operates as a small group plan within the District of Columbia's SHOP This was a decision that was made by the Obama administration.  So for waivers impacting the essential health benefits of age rating, which impacts both the individual and small group markets, Members of Congress and our staffs would be treated the same. As far as community rating, this impacts only the individual market, so no group plans, including Members of Congress or our staffs, would be impacted.  Even so, in an attempt to be crystal clear, today we are passing a bill, out of fairness and transparency, to ensure that Congress operates under the same laws as private citizens, a principle that both Republicans and Democrats should support.

They may also change the way individuals who have not maintained continuous coverage are charged for their healthcare plan, but only if the State has a risk-sharing program in place, like the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program established by the Palmer-Schweikert amendment.  In order to receive a waiver, a State must explain to the Secretary of Health and Human Services how the program will reduce average premiums for patients, increase enrollment for residents, stabilize the State's health insurance market, stabilize premiums for individuals living with preexisting conditions, or increase the patient's healthcare options.  It is important to note that in providing assistance to reduce premiums or other out-of-pocket costs, for individuals who may be subject to an increase in their monthly premiums because they reside in a State with an approved waiver, have a preexisting condition, are uninsured because they have not maintained continuous coverage and they purchase health insurance on the individual market, there will be $138 billion to assist with premium assistance.

You have skyrocketed premiums for hardworking Americans who have preexisting conditions, and that is what my colleagues need to understand.

4424,topic-id,1336,"Mr.President, I have joined my colleague in coming to the floor to talk about how we need to make progress on healthcare and make sure that we don't pull healthcare out from millions of I thank the Senator from Illinois for talking about his constituents. Like the Senator from Illinois, I was at home this past July recess talking to my constituents, and I heard many of them talk about their individual healthcare needs and their concerns about what is happening in  I met a young woman who told me about her daughter who was born prematurely and weighed less than 2 pounds. Her daughter required specialized, expensive treatment as a newborn. She was concerned that if we keep moving ahead with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, she and her husband would be overwhelmed with crushing hospital debt if, in fact, we hadn't covered preexisting conditions. She is one of millions of Americans who are scared that they are going to lose their health insurance under the proposal that is being talked about, that has been talked about for the last several weeks, and from what we can tell--because, obviously, there is a lot of secrecy--may still include details about reducing coverage for those who have access to care through  I have come to the floor tonight to talk about the latest idea because I think one of the things that is clear--and probably why the Senate majority leader said that he wanted, basically, to cancel the first 2 weeks of the August recess--is that my colleagues don't want to go home and talk about the proposal that was brought before them. In fact, they are now trying to bring up a new proposal, thinking that, again, with a very limited time period, without floor discussion, without committee debate, without an amendment process, somehow our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will fall prey to the notion that there is a silver bullet, a magic solution. I have come to the floor knowing that an amendment or a discussion piece or the new behind-closed-doors discussion proposal being advanced by my colleagues from Texas and Utah is basically to allow junk insurance into the marketplace.  What do I mean by junk insurance? I mean a proposal that basically offers less than the essential benefits, such as hospitalization, prescription drug benefits, lab costs, and all of those things; that, basically, by offering a market where you can get junk insurance, you can say: Oh, well, you have to have one offering of insurance that does cover all the basics and essentials, but then you can have junk insurance.  I say ``junk insurance'' because this is the wrong idea for the marketplace. It is basically mixing good and bad and not having adequate risk spread across--so basically it means that you don't have to have compliant plans for the market. I know this firsthand because we had this in We had this same experiment in Washington in the 1990s, and people tried to do the exact same thing--basically, have a compliant plan, and then say that you have a bunch of less-than-adequate proposals for insurance in the market that really aren't giving individuals coverage. What happened? It drove up the cost of the compliant plans that covered most of healthcare and basically drove the insurers out of the market. That was the experience in Washington This same idea was tried, and it failed because basically it ran up the price, and insurers didn't stay around to offer options. They[[Page S3911]]couldn't make the mandate of the required plan work because it basically took the risk out of the system.  The notion that somehow this new idea by my colleagues is going to be the silver bullet is, in my opinion, not an answer at all. People who would be the ones who could get that kind of coverage for a short period of time would then end up leaving the rest of the people without adequate coverage. As I said, what happens is, the costs then just go up, and then the market has to adjust. I would say that in our State--because a lot of people are talking about leaving the individual markets over the proposals that we are talking about today because they are concerned about the costs and who is going to be covered--you would see a very rapid collapse of the individual market exacerbated by what my colleagues from Texas and Utah are proposing.  There are numerous nonpartisan health experts who seem to be saying the same thing. There is the American Academy of Actuaries, where one individual said:       People who are healthy now would tend to choose      noncompliant plans with really basic benefits. People who      want or need more comprehensive coverage could find it out of      their reach, because it could become unaffordable.  Another individual from the American Enterprise Institute wrote that ``the main effect of the Cruz-Lee amendment would be to shift costs from healthy consumers to less healthy consumers and households with lower incomes.''  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former Director of the Congressional Budget Office called the amendment by my colleagues from Texas and Utah ``a recipe for a meltdown.''  Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, summed it up best when he called the amendment ``a recipe for instability and discrimination.''  So you can see that many people already understand the idea of junk insurance is not a market solution at all. It is not really even healthcare coverage. In its May 24 score of the House proposal, the CBO provided a definition of health insurance, saying that they would ``broadly define health insurance coverage as consisting of a comprehensive major medical policy that, at a minimum, covers high-cost medical events and various services, including those provided by physicians and hospitals.''  To me it seems pretty clear that the types of plans that could be sold under this proposal don't meet that definition.  What are essential benefits that we expect to be covered in a plan? Obviously, hospitalization, emergency services, ambulatory services, mental health, prescription drugs, rehabilitation, if needed, laboratory services, like lab tests, and we have moved toward some preventive, health, and wellness measures. Those are the essential benefits that are supposed to be in a plan, and I want my colleagues to know that this experiment was tried. It failed. It drove insurers out of the marketplace because it just made the plans that were covering essential benefits so costly by distorting--really tearing the market apart.  The second point about the proposal we are hearing about is that it is still a war on In my opinion there are cost-effective ways for us to continue access to healthcare. I have brought them up on the Senate floor. One would be looking at rebalancing from nursing home care to community-based care or, as I have mentioned, a basic health plan that bundles up a population and serves them up to get a discount so that individuals would have as much clout as a large employer would have in the marketplace.  I hope that my colleagues will stop the focus on capping, cutting Medicare--because it would throw so many people off of the system--and focus on rebalancing people to the type of healthcare that will help us save costs, keep people in their homes, and give consumers the ability to compete cost effectively in the individual market.  These are the problems I still see with this proposal. To think, basically, that junk insurance will be the way for us to get a proposal and to see that Medicaid is still the target in a war on Medicaid, to me, is not the proposal to move forward on. I hope our colleagues will realize that both of these have severe faults and will sit down and talk about the proposals that will help us in establishing a more robust individual market.

4419,topic-id,1231,"Mr.President, I take this time to share with my colleagues the experiences I had in the State of Maryland during our most recent work period and shortly before that, when I took the opportunity to meet with different groups with regard to the healthcare debate.  I had a townhall meeting this past week at Atrium Village, which is a senior living place in Baltimore We had a robust discussion primarily with seniors, but not just seniors, about their concerns as to whether the changes in the healthcare law would affect their ability in the Medicare system as well as relating to long-term care and  A little bit earlier than that, I had a townhall meeting at one of our local hospitals where we had a chance to talk with lots of people. It was an open townhall meeting, and a lot of people from the community showed up. They expressed their concerns about what would happen under the changes being suggested in healthcare on coverage and quality of coverage, and we had a very robust discussion.  I also had a chance to meet with leaders of the faith community as we talked about our responsibility to make sure healthcare is a right and not a privilege in the United  I met with the leaders of the community health centers in Park West, in Baltimore City, to talk about the impact on the viability of health centers if the Medicaid Programs were cut.  I had a chance to visit with Mosaic Behavioral Health Center, which deals with behavioral health in Baltimore, and their concern is, if we eliminate the essential health benefits of mental health and addiction, what impact that would have on access to care.  There was a consistent message from each of the places I met with, with regard to whether we would be able to maintain coverage--under the Affordable Care Act, we expanded coverage by tens of millions--and whether that coverage would be compromised under the legislation being considered in the  We also had a chance to talk about whether there would be a weakness in what benefits would be covered. I already mentioned mental health and addiction. There were also concerns expressed about reductions of benefits regarding obstetrics and how it would affect women, and pediatric dental care, which is a particular concern in Maryland after the tragic death of Deamonte  They also raised many issues concerning discrimination in healthcare that was present before the Affordable Care Act and whether these conditions would be returning. A young father told me a story about how his daughter was born prematurely and, as a result, the baby was in the neonatal intensive care unit for 4 months. When his daughter was 4 months old, she had reached her lifetime limit of what the insurer would pay for healthcare if we returned to lifetime limits. Whether we would be returning to the predatory-type practices of the insurance companies that were present before the Affordable Care Act and whether we would be returning to preexisting conditions or doing that indirectly through what benefits would be covered--that was expressed at several of my healthcare meetings.  I already mentioned the concerns that the elderly expressed, including the discrimination of the near elderly, if we go to a 5-to-1 ratio on health premiums, so that those who are 60 or 62 years of age paying five times higher premiums than younger people are paying. All of that was brought out during my townhall meetings.  The one message I just wanted to leave with my colleagues is that there was a strong interest that we work together--Democrats and Republicans--because we all acknowledge that the Affordable Care Act can be made better. We don't want to repeal it. We want to improve it.  Before we left for the July 4th break, I introduced legislation that deals with some of these issues. The legislation would improve competition by putting the so-called public option in the exchanges so that we know there would be at least one governmental option without subsidies, without any additional breaks over private insurance companies, to guarantee more competition in the marketplace.[[Page S3905]]  I also included in my legislation a solution to deal with the two major problems that we have under the Affordable Care For some people, the insurance premiums are too high. Why? Well, I asked CareFirst, which is the major health insurer in Maryland, about the uncertainty as to whether President Trump is going to fund the cost-sharing issues. My legislation makes it clear that those funds will be made available, as was anticipated under the Affordable Care  I also provide predictable subsidies for lower income families, up to 400 percent of poverty, so that we can help bring down the cost of premiums in that marketplace, and we reimpose the reinsurance program so that we can spread the risk so the insurance companies know that they have a more predictable risk when they set their premiums.  All of this would make a big difference. CareFirst said that, in the individual marketplace in Maryland, if you do that and endorse the individual mandate, we could reduce our premium increases by 50 percent.  So I am trying to work, I hope with Democrats and Republicans, to deal with the problems that have been brought to our attention on higher premiums and then to deal with healthcare costs generally.  More and more people talk to me about bringing down the costs of prescription drugs. It is outrageous that Americans pay twice what our friends in Canada pay for the same medicines that are manufactured here in the United So why don't we have a more competitive marketplace? Why don't we have the rebates that we have in the Medicaid and the Medicare systems, and why don't we allow for more collective bargaining for prices in the pharmaceutical industry? My legislation would do that, and I know there is bipartisan support for that.  Lastly, we deal with more integrated care. I mentioned Mosaic, a behavioral health facility in Baltimore They have an integrated care model. If you come into their community health center, they will treat whatever your problems are. They are not going to say: Well, come in one day and we will deal with diabetes, and the next day we will deal with high blood pressure. Let's deal with the whole patient in a coordinated and integrated care model, and that would help save on costs.  My bottom line is this. No, I am not going to support weakening the Affordable Care I am not going to support legislation that would diminish those who currently have coverage or the quality of their coverage. Let's work together--Democrats and Republicans--to deal with the real problems of bringing down costs in our healthcare system--everybody benefits from that--and to make sure there is more competition in our exchanges and to make sure there is better premium support for those who cannot afford their premiums. If we do that, then, I really think we would be carrying out what the people of Maryland were asking me to do during the recess; that is, not to go back on the progress we have made under the Affordable Care Let's build on that. Let's make healthcare more affordable, and let's deal with more competition on the premium costs.  With that, I yield the floor.

There were about 20 patient advocates from organizations across the State of We were in Georgetown at a place called the CHEER Community Center, which is a gathering place for seniors in the southern part of our A lot of good activities happen there for seniors from all over Southern  Some of the organizations on the frontlines of our healthcare system were there. I am going to mention a couple of them. They include the Mental Health Association, the National Alliance on Mental Illness in Delaware, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Autism Delaware, the American Heart Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Alzheimer's Association, and atTAcK addiction. The folks at the roundtable explained to me and to others how the new plan that was presented several weeks ago would dramatically diminish their ability to care for the Delawareans they serve.  During our roundtable, we heard directly from representatives of these organizations, and we heard directly from patients. These Delawareans shared with us just how devastating a repeal of the Affordable Care Act would be for them and for their families.  One person's story stood out to me. She is a woman I have met before. Her name is Jan She is pictured here with her husband They live in Newark, which is at the other end of the If you drive up I-95 from Washington through Baltimore, on up to the Delaware line, the first town you come to in Delaware is That is where the University of Delaware is located. That is where they live.  Jan and her husband were college sweethearts. This October they are going to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. They run a successful small business in It involves setting up meetings, running them, organizing and running special events.  Together they have one child, a son named This September, Ethan will start his senior year at the University of Delaware, which is one of my alma maters. I went to graduate school there after the end of the Vietnam war on the GI bill. It is a wonderful school. He will be a senior there this fall.  Jan, depicted here with her husband, was doing everything she was supposed[[Page S3907]]to do to stay healthy. She ate right. She exercised. In fact, she was studying martial arts.  I eat right too. I exercise almost every day of my life and have since I headed to Pensacola, FL, as a newly minted ensign in the I still work out, just like One thing she has done that I haven't--she has studied martial arts and achieved her third-degree black belt. She did it a couple of years ago, in April of 2015.  Jan also worked hard at their business and helped to raise Jan, Mike, and their son Ethan were living the American dream, but their lives were irreparably changed in April of 2016--a year after she earned her third-degree black belt.  Something happened. What happened was that Jan was diagnosed with aggressive stage IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It had invaded her chest and her spine. She went from teaching kickboxing and studying for her fourth-degree black belt to relying on a walker.  Jan underwent over 5 months of intense chemotherapy. I am told it was 102 continuous hours every 3 weeks. Think about that: 102 continuous hours of intense chemotherapy every 3 weeks. She had two injections into something called--I think it is a cavity in our brain--the She had two injections every 3 weeks for her spinal tumor, a high dosage of inpatient chemotherapy, and a month of radiation.  Jan was pronounced in remission earlier this year. Thank She desperately hopes to stay there, and our prayer is that she will.  When Jan was sick, she and her husband Mike kept working. There was no quit on that team. They kept working at their business, although it certainly wasn't possible to keep up with everything. That business had its usual pace that they followed.  As Jan has said, the bills don't stop just because you have cancer. That is true. Today she continues physical therapy repair damage from spinal cord compression from the tumor and the chemotherapy for the spinal tumor. She continues this therapy, even though her insurance-approved visits ran out a long time ago.  Jan monitors daily for relapse, hoping and praying it will not happen. She and Mike have worked hard to keep their business doors open and to try to put their lives back together.  The current debate in Washington over the Affordable Care Act makes Jan and Mike wonder if they will be able to afford the premiums that they face. Their current premiums now--not including deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, or denials--are double their mortgage payments.  Jan told me that they wonder if they will have to forgo Jan's medical care. They wonder if they will have to choose to pay for care and maybe put their family in bankruptcy. What if the treatments don't work?  Most of us know that cancer is a hard battle. In my own family, we know that my grandfather, his wife, and others who have fought cancer ultimately succumbed to it. It is a hard battle. Jan shouldn't have to fight for the chance to fight and survive. That is what she is doing.  We are encouraged that she has had better than a fighting chance. Jan and her family hope that those of us in this body--in the Senate--and our friends in the House of Representatives will do the right thing. That is why she is now involved with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society as a patient advocate.

The place was closed, and most of us were in our I covered the State of Delaware almost every day. I saw thousands--probably tens of thousands--of people during the course of that time. I am amazed at how many people talked to me about healthcare legislation. They called on us to do the right thing.  The other thing they called on us to do was to work together. Any number of people said to me: This shouldn't be all Republicans trying to solve this; this shouldn't be all Democrats trying to solve this. This should be everyone working together.  I couldn't agree more. I think we have a great opportunity right now to hit the pause button and not retreat to our different corners around here but to figure out how we can engage and do three things with respect to the Affordable Care Act: Figure out what in the Affordable Care Act needs to be fixed and let's fix it; figure out what in the Affordable Care Act needs to be preserved and let's preserve it; and if there are provisions in it that should be dropped, let's figure out how to drop them.  I talked with one of my colleagues, a former Navy guy from Arizona on the other side of the aisle. We came to Congress together in 1982. We served in the Navy together before that. We were talking yesterday about a path forward for us. We both said almost at the same time: What we should do is regular order.  I don't know if our new pages have heard that term, ``regular order.'' What it means is pretty much this: If someone has a good idea--or maybe a not-so-good idea--on an important issue, introduce it as a bill. It gets assigned a committee, and the committee chair, ranking member, senior Republican, senior Democrat talk about scheduling a hearing. They hold a hearing--maybe not just one hearing but maybe a series of bipartisan hearings. Sometimes they actually schedule some roundtables in addition to hearings, which are more of an informal discussion, which are sometimes helpful in working out consensus around the very difficult issues like healthcare.  The regular order is that after there has been a lot of testimony, a lot back-and-forth, a lot of questioning, they have a markup in the committee on jurisdiction. The markup is to vote on the bill before we vote on the bill. We have the opportunity for members--Democrats and Republicans have the opportunity to offer amendments to the legislation, amendments for and against, amendments that would change and hopefully improve the underlying bill.  After the amendments are offered, there would be a vote on the underlying bill, to keep it in committee or report it out. In regular order, if it is reported out, then it competes for time on the floor. That is something our leaders, Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer, would need to work out amongst themselves.  If the bill makes its way to the floor, in regular order, we would have time for debate, especially for something this important. As I recall, when we debated the Affordable Care Act in committees, hearings, and roundtables, I think we spent 80 days. All told, I think over 300 amendments were offered. There were 160 Republican-sponsored amendments adopted to the Affordable Care Is it perfect? Anything that big, that complex, should have been even more bipartisan than it was. This is something we need to get right.  I will close with this thought: If you go back 8 or 9 years ago, we had a new administration. I was a brandnew member of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid and We share jurisdiction in the Senate on healthcare legislation; the other committee is the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which is led by Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Senator Patty Murray of Washington State, two very able people and leaders. I would suggest that they are the kind of leaders who can help us actually figure out what is the right thing to do.  I don't know that either party is smart enough to figure it out by themselves, but if you ask a lot of people around this country, including people like Jan and her family or folks who are providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and nurses, and folks who work in pharmaceuticals, health economists--if you ask a lot of people ``What do you think?'' there is a much better chance to ultimately get this right.  I will add a P.as a former Governor of Delaware, as some of my colleagues know. I call myself a recovering We have a new page here from One of the guys from Ohio is now a pharmacist. John Kasich, my old colleague from the House, is now Governor of He has been a strong voice in favor of just what I am talking[[Page S3908]]about doing, and that is to hit the pause button and figure out how we can do this together, and we need to.  In closing, I will paraphrase something Mark Twain used to say. Mark Twain used to say: ``When it doubt, tell the truth. It will confound your enemies and astound your friends.'' Think about that.  In this case, maybe we should paraphrase Mark Twain: When in doubt, try regular order. When in doubt, try working together. When in doubt, try a bipartisan approach that is focused on getting this country and our healthcare delivery system a lot closer to where it needs to be.  Every President since Harry Truman said as President that we need to change our healthcare delivery system so that everybody in this country has access to healthcare. By the time we took up the Affordable Care Act in the Finance Committee and the Senate, we were spending, as a nation, 18 percent of the gross domestic product on healthcare in this country. I have a friend, and if you ask him how he is doing, he says: Compared to what? We are spending 18 percent What were they spending 8 years ago in Japan? They were spending 8 percent of GDP for healthcare in Did they get worse results? They got better results--higher rates of longevity, lower rates of infant mortality. In Japan they covered everybody. They still do. They are getting better results for less money.  Frankly, what we did in writing the Affordable Care Act was we looked around the world, including Japan, and we looked around this country, including at places like Mayo, the Cleveland Clinic, and others, to see what they are doing to get better results. We tried to put a lot of that in the legislation, in the law. Wonder of wonders, some is actually delivering good results--better value, better results for less money. That is part of the Affordable Care Act we want to maintain and preserve.  I have probably stood here long enough talking about this today. This is an important issue. It is one-sixth of our economy, and healthcare eventually affects us all. People who get sick will eventually get care. For too long, the care they have gotten has been in the emergency room of a hospital. By the time they get sick enough to go there, sometimes they are very sick. It is very expensive. They don't spend an hour or two in the emergency room of a hospital; they may spend a week or two in the hospital and really run up the tab. That is a hugely expensive way to provide healthcare. Who pays for it? The rest of us. We have to be smarter than that.  I am hoping that in the days ahead, particularly as our Governors gather up in Providence, RI, later this week to discuss, among other things, providing healthcare for their constituents in 50 different States, my hope is that some of what I said here today will be on their minds: Hit the pause button. Fix the things in the Affordable Care Act that need to be fixed. Preserve the aspects that need to be preserved. Let's do it together.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

4330,topic-id,593,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and rise in opposition to this bill.  Mr.Speaker, this bill restructures section 2251 of title 18 of the United States Code as apparently requested by the unit at the Department of Justice that enforces the laws against child pornography.  H.1761 is intended to address limitations in the prosecution of cases pursuant to section 2251, as identified by the  While we all agree that no child pornography offense should go unpunished, we cannot overlook the consequences of mandatory minimum sentencing.  Section 2251(a) prohibits the use of a child to produce child pornography and related conduct, including overseas production and advertising child pornography.  Pursuant to this bill, two new offenses would be added to this section to prohibit the production of child pornography and the transmission of live depictions of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct, such as live-streaming abuse online.  This measure would also modify the existing offense that prohibits having a minor assist in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing or transmitting child pornography. As amended, this offense would prohibit[[Page H4584]]having a minor assist in sexually explicit conduct that violates each of the three newly enumerated production offenses, except the transportation of a minor for use in child pornography production.  In addition, it would amend the prohibition against the production of child pornography abroad to forbid the live transmission of child pornography produced abroad.  The jurisdictional requirement for each of the offenses enumerated in section 2251, except the production of child pornography abroad, would be codified in a separate subsection. Other portions of the bill would be modified to follow the restructure of the statute for consistency.  Unfortunately, current law sets forth a series of mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for production of child pornography offenses. First-time offenses are punishable by mandatory imprisonment of at least 15 years; offenders with a prior conviction face mandatory imprisonment for at least 25 years; and offenders with two or more prior convictions must be sentenced to imprisonment of at least 35 years.  By modifying and expanding section 2251 to include several new ways in which to violate the prohibition against the production of child pornography, the bill would subject new classes of defendants to mandatory minimum sentences. Although the bill does not establish new mandatory minimum sentences, it would--in this way--expand the application of the existing mandatory minimums, which I oppose.  Mandatory minimums have been studied extensively and found to distort rational sentencing systems, discriminate against minorities, waste taxpayers' money, and violate common sense. Under mandatory minimum sentences, regardless of the nature and circumstances surrounding the offense, the role of the offender in the particular crime, and the history and characteristics of the offender, a judge must impose a sentence set by the legislature.  Even if everyone involved in a case--from the arresting officer, prosecutor, and judge to the victim--believes that the mandatory minimum would be an unjust sentence for a particular defendant in a case, it still must be imposed. Mandatory minimum sentences are the wrong way to determine punishment under this or any other statute.  During the Judiciary Committee's consideration of this bill, the committee rejected an amendment that would have eliminated the applicable mandatory minimums in the current statute but would still have allowed judges to sentence these offenders to lengthy sentences up to the existing statutory maximums.  Because those changes were not made, the bill continues to present problems with mandatory minimums.  Accordingly, Mr.Speaker, I must oppose this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1030  ",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgH4582.txt,229,CALLING FOR UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF U.S. CITIZENS AND PERMANENT,2017.0,25.0,May

4334,topic-id,297,"Mr.Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, the Members of the House cannot rely on prospective discretion to protect juveniles under this statute. We simply can't rely on it, participate in, given the new policy of the Attorney We are under a new regime here at the Federal level, and I can't depend on relying on the prosecutorial discretion to protect juveniles under this statute.  Mr.Speaker, I believe this bill is well intended, and I share my colleagues' desire to protect children from being victimized by their depiction in pornography. However, I also believe that we must address the serious problem presented by the bill, namely, that it would expand the application of the existing array of mandatory minimum sentences that the code provides for these offenses.  This aspect of H.1761 directly conflicts with the growing bipartisan realization that mandatory minimums are unjust and unwise; this is so even for egregious offenses for which judges should be allowed to impose sentences--often severe and even beyond the minimums--based on the facts and circumstances of each case. I want to leave it up to the judges.  In considering legislation to better protect our children from the types of exploitation addressed by this bill, we must not ignore the sentencing implications of these revisions to the statute. In light of the bill's failure to address these serious concerns, I oppose H.1761 and urge my colleagues to do likewise.  We should consider even stronger legislation that addresses all these concerns. We are not through with the subject matter by this bill coming before us today. There is more work to be done.

4392,topic-id,2324,"Mr.President, first, I would like to offer a brief word on some tragic events that occurred in my State over the last few days.  Yesterday, at the University of Texas in Austin, a man wielding a knife began attacking students on campus. He injured three and tragically killed another. My prayers are with the entire UT community, particularly the friends and families of those injured and the student who lost his life.  This was a senseless act of violence, and it is abhorrent. We don't yet know the details for why this deranged individual acted the way he did. Local officials are still gathering details about the case.  I am grateful to the University of Texas police for quickly apprehending the suspect and stopping further loss of life and injury. I offer them and the rest of the law enforcement community in Austin, around the State, and around the Nation my support as they seek justice and continue to protect, in this instance, one of the State's flagship institutions of higher learning.                      Deadly Storms in East Texas  Mr.President, many are aware that major storms ripped through parts of East Texas, including Van Zandt, Henderson, Rains, and Hopkins Counties, last weekend. On Saturday afternoon and evening, four tornadoes tore through the area, leaving a lot of damage in its wake, particularly in the town of Canton, in Van Zandt Dozens of people were injured and taken to the hospital, and, tragically, four people died.  I plan to speak to the mayor of Canton and to Judge Kirkpatrick, the Van Zandt County judge, later today to offer them my condolences but more importantly, perhaps, to offer our help in addition to our prayers.  I know they are working as hard as they can to continue to assess the damage done and to find a way forward to help bring assistance to those most in need.  I am particularly grateful and impressed by the work of local leaders across my great State and around the country who step up at a time of crisis like this and organizations like the American Red Cross, which always seem to show up to offer a helping hand, as well as local schools and churches that have come together to lend a hand in this area during such a difficult time. Some have lost their own homes, vehicles, and, of course, loved ones.  As I said, my thoughts and prayers are with all of them, and I stand ready to work alongside them in this resilient part of my great State as they recover from these deadly storms.                     Government Funding Legislation  Mr.President, as we all know by now, over the weekend an agreement was finally reached on the funding bill to keep the U.Government open and to provide much needed, long-term funding to our Federal agencies.  I am particularly glad we found a way forward. Now, that is not synonymous with saying I like everything in the bill, but a piece of legislation like this is inherently a compromise. Compromise means that usually people on both ends of the negotiation are not entirely happy because they have had to give up something in order to get something. This is the process, and we have to build consensus, even on controversial topics like this funding bill.  The agreed to bill consists of the 11 remaining appropriations bills, with additional funding set aside for our military, disaster relief, and border security. I, for one, have been encouraged to hear folks from both sides of the aisle--Republicans and Democrats alike--make clear that we actually agree more than we disagree when it comes to securing our border.  President Trump has made no secret of his position. He said from the beginning that border security would be a top priority for him. Coming from a border State, as does the Presiding Officer, we all understand particularly well how important this is to our communities along the border but also to our States and to the entire country.  I have been glad to read press reports and hear the minority leader, Senator Schumer, among others, talk about how providing more resources to secure our borders is necessary to keep us safe and to stem the tide of illegal drugs, illegal immigration, and contraband entering our country.  In fact, last week, the Senator from New York, the minority leader, said: ``Democrats have always been for border security.'' Well, I was glad to hear him say that.  Last month during the State work period, I had the chance to speak to hundreds of my constituents from all across the State--10 cities in all. Part[[Page S2664]]of that time was spent visiting with folks who live and work along the U.S.-Mexico border, specifically in Laredo and in the town of Mission, near  All along the border, we talked about the significant ties between the United States and Mexico, how Mexico is Texas' largest trading partner, and how Texas farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers rely greatly on trade with our southern neighbor. They pointed out that the U.Chamber of Commerce has actually issued a chart that documents that 5 million American jobs depend on binational trade with I think most people are unaware of that or don't pay enough attention to the fact that our economies are inextricably tied together.  During my visit to the border, I was fortunate enough to have the chance to talk about our mutual security concerns with Governor Cabeza de Vaca, the Governor of Tamaulipas, a State that shares its northern border with  I am grateful to Mexican leaders like the Governor and my friend Ambassador Gutierrez, the new Mexican Ambassador to the United States, who share our vision for a more secure border and more robust trade at the same time. They are not mutually exclusive. It is important that we have both--security and trade.  It goes without saying that free trade has been a cornerstone of the economy in Texas, adding billions to our economy annually and bolstering our relationship with our partner to the south. In other words, free-trade agreements, particularly NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Agreement, are particularly important to many of my State's leading industries, such as agriculture and energy.  As I said, bilateral trade with Mexico supports 5 million jobs across our entire country, and this has led to a vibrant border, from El Paso, out in West Texas, and all the way to Brownsville in the south. Of course, like anything that is 20-plus years old, there is room for it to be updated and improved, and NAFTA is no different. I hope in moving forward that the President will work with us to modernize  As we consider this Omnibus appropriations bill and specifically more resources to enhance security along the border, I think we can all agree that our approach should be twofold: We must devote resources to not only enhance border security but also to fix aging infrastructure at our ports of entry. Fortunately, this bill does exactly that. It contains the most robust border security funding in 10 years, and that includes funding for infrastructure upgrades, increasing technology along the border, and improving TSA screening at airports too.  I am glad we found a way to fund the government and to actually govern while doing more for our national defense and security, particularly security along the border. But let's not lose sight of the ultimate aim here: Our country needs long-term, sustainable funding for our government, particularly for our national security, so they can plan and prepare in the years ahead, and the stop-start and short-term continuing resolutions or the threat of a government shutdown does not facilitate that sort of planning and preparation. That is how the appropriations process was designed to work best, and that is what I hope we are all working toward--a restoration of the normal appropriations process, with no more of these narratives about shutdowns.  We weren't elected, in my view--certainly not given the majority here in the Senate and in the House, as well as the President in the White House--to shut down the government; we were elected to govern. Yes, governing is hard. It is hard by design. It is hard for anything to navigate the maze of the legislature and this legislative process. It is hard to get people to agree in the House and then the Senate and then to get the signature of the President of the United But that is the way our Founding Fathers designed our constitutional system.  I think most of our colleagues in this Chamber would agree that we want to provide more stability, not less. It is important for our economy, if we want to see our economy grow.  I just heard from folks who visited my office. They said the political instability of rules changing from one administration to the next with Executive orders and the like really is a deterrent to investment because they don't know whether the business model they are employing today will be viewed the same way tomorrow with a new administration. So we need to provide more stability by getting back to the consensus-building process that is legislating, and we need to do away with short-term continuing resolutions and funding that actually hurts us strategically.  I know my family and most folks I know take a look at their budget. They consider what they want to do with it, including the things they absolutely have to pay for, and then from there decide if they have anything left for a vacation or if they want to save more or if they need to make an improvement in their home down the road. That is how we responsibly prepare for tomorrow in our personal lives, and governing is no different in that sense. That is how we can do better by the generations coming after us in the Senate--by putting our country on a budget and sticking to it. This bill, while not perfect, is a step in that direction. It complies with the budget caps of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which has kept discretionary spending roughly flat since 2011. That is an amazing accomplishment in many ways.  But if you look at the rest of what Congress does not appropriate--the so-called mandatory or entitlement spending--it has been going up, and it will go up next year 5.5 percent.  The fact is, until we have the courage to come to grips with all of the money the Federal Government spends so we can prioritize it in a fiscally responsible way--we will never adequately fund our military and we will never adequately fund our other national priorities as long as Congress and the White House are left with 70 percent of that spending untouchable because of the politics involved. I hope some day we will have the courage to deal with that.  Mr.President, just a couple other thoughts before I close. I hear people from time to time talk about whether a government shutdown is one of those tactics or tools one might use in a negotiation to actually gain advantage. I happen to think that a government shutdown is basically an abdication of our responsibility, particularly if we are in the majority.  On what basis would we argue to voters: Look, elect me, and I will shut down the government. Our voters, the people who elected Republican majorities in both Houses and elected this President, did not vote for us in order to shut down the government; they voted for us to govern, as hard as it is. As I said a moment ago, it is hard by design. People get frustrated. People don't get everything they want the first time they try to get it. Sometimes people just give up, which is what shutting down the government is--it is giving up.  I hear other people talk about things like the filibuster. It is important to recognize there are basically two types of things we do here in the One is that we take up the nominations of the President's nominees, as we did with Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme We do that for his Cabinet and the like. Basically, there are two choices there: yes or no.  We have decided together that all of the President's Cabinet nominees and now all of the judges will get an up-or-down vote. So we have eliminated the so-called filibuster, or the 60-vote requirement, when it comes to nominations because you can't offer an amendment to a nomination. You can't shape it in order to try to develop consensus. So I think there is a good argument that we should never have headed down the road of a filibuster of nominees. They need to get a majority vote, and if they do, then they are going to be confirmed.  Legislation is fundamentally different. We have 535 Members of Congress, all of us coming with different experience and different points of view. Again, the Founding Fathers made it hard for us to build sufficient consensus in order for us to govern this big country of ours, some 320 million people. What they understood fundamentally was that the only way that happens is when we are forced to govern by consensus; that is, to build sufficient votes in order to have some stability and durability in the laws we pass. Laws having to do with Medicare and[[Page S2665]]Social Security were controversial in their day, but there was bipartisan consensus that supported them, and that is why they remain durable to this day.  I have heard people recently--actually since the election and actually as recently as today--say ``Well, maybe we ought to do away with the 60-vote cloture requirement,'' which is another way of saying ``Let's do away with the filibuster on legislation.'' Well, I think I know how Members of the Senate feel about that, by and large.

4417,topic-id,2384,"Mr.President, as we move forward in our efforts to repeal and replace the failed ObamaCare law, it is worth remembering the reasons why this work is so urgent and why it is so important. The Affordable Care Act has left many American families paying far more for healthcare than they did beforehand, and it has taken away their freedom to choose the doctor they want or the health plan they want. That is, of course, all contrary to what was promised at the time ObamaCare was passed back in 2009 and 2010.  We all remember what the President said, and none of it has proven to be true in terms of your plan, your doctor, or the costs. In fact, as I mentioned before, the cost has gone up 105 percent for people in the individual market since 2013 alone. So rather than seeing a $2,500 decrease in the cost to their health coverage, they have seen a $3,000 increase, and the prices continue to go up. It is actually getting worse by the day, which is another reason for the urgency of what we are about to do. A report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, released yesterday, found that 40 percent fewer insurers have applied to participate in[[Page S3903]]the ObamaCare exchanges next year. The reason why that is important is because when fewer insurance companies choose to participate, of course, consumers have less choice and there is less competition in terms of quality of service or the price they charge. The damage goes far beyond the damage to the doctor-patient relationship and the damage to our pocketbooks, when we are told things will cost us less and they cost us more. The damage of the Affordable Care Act has literally permeated our entire economy and has led to a lot of people losing their jobs along the way.  ObamaCare consists of a number of mandates, government coercion, and punishment if you didn't comply with the mandates that forced many Americans to buy a product they would not have bought of their own volition and in many instances simply could not afford. But if you refused to do it, the government fined you, punished you. That represents a radical change in the nature and guiding philosophy of this country. This country was founded on the concept of individual freedom, not on Big Government coercing you to buy something that you don't want and you can't afford. But that is the theory behind  In addition to that, for small business owners, it included a penalty for any business that exceeded more than 50 employees who did not provide government-approved health insurance policies. It cost them at least an additional $70,000 a year, in addition to other increases in healthcare costs.  Let's say you are a small business of 50 or so employees. You are sure not going to hire over the cap and subject yourself to the additional $70,000 a year in costs. What you are likely to do is to hire fewer than 50 employees in order to protect yourself from that expense, and that is exactly what happened.  I still remember, after the Affordable Care Act passed, having lunch in San Antonio, TX, with a friend of mine who was an architect at the particular time. When I described to him the nature of the employer mandate and its effect, he made it clear to me that he would rather lay off some of his employees in order to avoid that additional expense under the employer mandate. In fact, that is just what he did.  This is just another bit of evidence about the pernicious impact of the Affordable Care It is not just about premiums. It is not just about deductibles. It is not just about freedom of choice. Literally, it has been a wet blanket on our economy.  This damage reaches across many different sorts of industries. According to a recent study by the Mercatus Center, an estimated 250,000 jobs nationwide were lost due to this mandate. That strikes me, frankly, as too small a number, but that is the number they projected. A quarter of a million people lost their jobs because of this mandate because small employers were motivated to keep their numbers under the cap in order to avoid the extra expense. This does not even take into account the consideration of businesses that were forced to shut their doors altogether.  In other words, ObamaCare was, in part, premised on this idea that businesses could endlessly absorb additional taxes and new costs and mandates and somehow continue to keep their doors open and do business as usual, but that is not the real world.  It also does not take into consideration the many businesses that choose to cut the hours their employees can work instead of firing them. This is another one of those stealth characteristics of ObamaCare, in which employers are judged on the number of full-time employees they have.  I remember talking to a restaurant owner in East Texas--in Tyler, TX--who told me he had to lay off a single mother who was working as a waitress in his restaurant. He could not afford to have her work full time. He had to put her on part time in order to avoid the penalties that are associated with What that meant for this single mom is that she essentially had to go out and get two jobs in order to fill the gap that was left by her going from full-time work to part-time work. That is not the only story I can tell you.  A small business owner in Donna, TX, epitomizes this reality in a letter that was written to me a few weeks ago. This gentleman said he and his wife are both on Of course, they are unaffected directly by ObamaCare because Medicare covers people who are 65 years and older while ObamaCare covers people who are younger than that. While they were left unaffected personally by ObamaCare's changes, on behalf of his 54 employees, he wrote that after ObamaCare went into effect, he was faced with a choice, either he could buy his employees expensive health insurance that his business could not afford or he could pay fines totaling more than $100,000. Instead, he made the painful choice to lay off six of his employees in order to remain under the ObamaCare-imposed threshold. As he pointed out, this meant more than just simply laying off six people; it also meant risking the well-being of each of those families represented by those six people.  Small business owners should not be forced to choose between growing their businesses and providing jobs or risking the financial livelihoods of their entire companies and their employees just to satisfy the demands of Big Even beyond causing layoffs, ObamaCare has effectively ensured that many businesses cannot grow and that existing businesses will not hire any more employees.  ObamaCare did not just lead to a new form of healthcare coverage, as some have claimed, as two-thirds of the small businesses that were surveyed by the Mercatus Center report already offered insurance. Two-thirds of the businesses affected by ObamaCare already had healthcare coverage, but that was effectively displaced and replaced by government-approved healthcare, which proved to be far more expensive.  Instead of having the choice to shop around for the insurance that best meets their needs and the needs of their employees, these businesses have been forced to either pay the penalty or to pay the piper--that is the Federal Government--when it comes to these mandates and these demands.  It ought to be clear by now--7 years into the implementation of ObamaCare--that this kind of one-size-fits-all mandate should not be applied to a country of 320 million people, especially when it comes to something as personal as healthcare. Each of us is a unique human being. Each of our families has its own unique needs and desires. Frankly, we ought to be able to choose the sort of healthcare coverage that best suits our needs as well as our incomes and our desires to buy health insurance. Some people want policies that provide purely for catastrophic coverage when they go to the hospital. Maybe they prefer to have savings accounts that use pretax dollars under health savings accounts in order to save money so as to pay for their doctors' visits, and they combine that with a high deductible health insurance plan. You literally cannot do that under ObamaCare, but you will be able to do that under the Better Care Act, which we will be voting on next week.  What we have tried to do is to look at the meltdown of ObamaCare and say that we need some emergency measures to take place because of the phenomenon I mentioned earlier in which insurance companies are pulling out, people's premiums are going through the roof, or deductibles are so high that they are effectively being denied the benefit of their health insurance. We need to do something quickly and urgently.  What we are going to do is take measures to stabilize the insurance markets because if insurance companies continue to pull out of the insurance markets and deny people a choice or competition or even access to a qualifying policy at all, that is going to put people in an impossible situation. So the first thing we are going to do is to stabilize the marketplace.  The second thing we are going to do is to repeal the mandates that have made health insurance so unaffordable and restore the freedom to choose the sorts of policies and create a marketplace in which people can choose the policies that best suit their needs and at prices they can afford. It will literally bring down the cost of what people are charged in order to buy healthcare coverage.  Because we understand the importance of protecting families against preexisting condition exclusions, we are going to make sure the current law[[Page S3904]]remains in effect that protects people from exclusions when they change jobs or lose jobs based upon preexisting conditions.  The fourth thing we are going to do in the Better Care Act is put Medicaid on a sustainable growth rate. Medicaid is an important program. It provides the healthcare safety net for the Nation, but unfortunately it is unsustainable at the current rate of spending. Over the next 10 years, we propose to spend $71 billion more than we do today on In other words, it is going to continue to grow but at a more controlled and fiscally responsible rate.  We are also going to provide people with tax credits who have an income between zero and 350 percent, including those people who are left out in the event that the Medicaid expansion is not embraced by their States and States like Texas--people who are now at 100 percent of the Federal poverty level up to 138 percent who were left out because of the fact that Texas did not expand Medicaid to able-bodied adults. They are going to be able to use that tax credit to buy private insurance. Private insurance provides much better access to coverage because, right now, Medicaid pays doctors and hospitals about 50 cents on the dollar when it reimburses them. Private insurance pays them much better so it improves the range of choices available to consumers.  Our bill continues to be a work in progress. We have done our best to try to work with everybody who has been willing to work with us and to use their ideas. What we have tried to build is a consensus bill, but the fact is, our friends on the other side of the aisle have simply refused to participate in the process, thus leaving it up to us to save people and help people who are currently being hurt by the status quo. We are going to do our duty. We are going to fulfill our responsibility to our constituents the best we can under these circumstances. In recognizing that no bill is ever going to be perfect, certainly, we have to do what we can in order to help the people who are being hurt now under the status quo.  Let me just close by saying that I have heard my friend the Senator from New York--the Democratic leader--talk about this bill. If we are unsuccessful in getting this bill passed next week, he wants to engage in a bipartisan negotiation in order to address healthcare. Yet what I predict is this: What he is really talking about is a massive, multibillion-dollar bailout of insurance companies without there being any reform. To me, that is an exercise that, frankly, I am not willing to participate in. I will never support a multibillion-dollar bailout of insurance companies and not be able to reform the system that created the problem in the first place.  I urge all of our colleagues to work together with us. Bring us your best ideas. Work with us. Try to figure out a way to be constructive in this process and help us to achieve a result. It is not going to be the final result. We will have other opportunities, for example, in the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is a bipartisan program that expires by the end of We will have another opportunity to come back--hopefully, then on a bipartisan basis--to do additional things that we were unable to do because of the constraints of the budget reconciliation process and the fact that our Democratic colleagues simply refuse to participate in saving the people who are being hurt today by  I encourage my colleagues not to be lured by the seductive message of our friends across the aisle about doing something bipartisan after this bill is unsuccessful. They are not interested in changing anything about the structural defects in If all we are going to do is propose to pay insurance companies billions of dollars more in order to bail them out--in order to support the same flawed structural program known as the Affordable Care Act--you can count me out.

4348,topic-id,449,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1282, the DHS Acquisition Review Board Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, in recent years, the Department of Homeland Security has strengthened the management of its major acquisition programs, which historically has been weak.  H.1282 authorizes the key mechanisms from the previous administration to ensure acquisitions valued at more than $300 million, which account for over $7 billion of DHS' annual budget, receive ongoing scrutiny--let me repeat, receive ongoing scrutiny.  Since 2008, the Acquisition Review Board has brought leaders together from across the Department to validate foundational acquisition documents such as cost and schedule estimates and performance requirements. The Department has had to learn the hard way about the importance of adhering to its acquisition best practices, including the establishment of realistic requirements in cost estimates that take into account the life cycle of costs.  An example is the SBInet program, started in 2006, that was supposed to bring together integration of systems of infrastructure and technology to secure the border. This program was terminated in 2011 only after $1 billion had been spent. Let me repeat that. This program was terminated in 2011, but only after $1 billion had been spent.  The acquisition went wrong because CBP bypassed required processes and awarded a multimillion-dollar contract without having laid the foundation to oversee contractor performance, cost controls, and scheduling.  Just last week, the Department was forced to cancel its $1.5 billion Agile Services contract, or the FLASH contract, due to significant errors and missteps in the procurement process.  Many of us are concerned that, in the Department's haste to deliver the President's campaign promise to build a wall, critical steps in the acquisition process will be short-circuited, leaving Americans with a bill for a bad investment.                              {time}  1500  At this time, a centralized oversight body for DHS major acquisitions is more important than ever.  This bill provides for the board to convene when a major acquisition program requires authorization to proceed from one decision event to another, or is in breach of its approved requirements, or requires additional review.  Efficiency and effectiveness in the acquisition process is imperative for the DHS mission of procuring goods, services, and supplies in support of its national security efforts. The Committee on Homeland Security unanimously approved this measure earlier this Congress, and similar language was approved by the House in October 2015.  By establishing this board into law and laying out its responsibilities, Congress can ensure that this vital oversight will continue and that DHS will continue to show progress in its management of acquisitions.

4391,topic-id,562,"Mr.President, I want to take this opportunity to highlight what I consider an unsung achievement of this administration and this Congress--the slow but steady rollback of the last administration's midnight regulations.  The numbers are impressive. Using the Congressional Review Act, we have repealed 13 regulations so far, which adds up to a $3.6 billion reduction in regulatory costs. To put it in more human terms, we have saved the American people 4.2 million hours of paperwork, which I can tell you is more than welcome news in  The other thing about these resolutions we have passed is that they are permanent. We haven't simply put these regulations on pause for a future President to revive them with a pen and phone. No, we have outlawed them forever. Any President who wants to reimpose them and their huge costs will have to pass a new law to do so, making the rules we live under and the people who make them accountable to the voters. That is a bit of a foreign concept to the people in Washington these days. But the way I see it, that is all the more reason to celebrate what we have achieved.  I know the other side will say: This is a dark day for To hear them tell it, blotting out all these regulations will leave a dark stain on our law books. To them, this rollback is a throwback to a dangerous, rough-and-tumble era--one filled with dirty air, dirty water, and a frighteningly low quality of life. But it just ain't so.  Stop and take a look at the regulations we have repealed, and then ask yourself: Why should Washington decide how we evaluate our teachers? Shouldn't parents, States, and cities do that? Why shouldn't States be able to test for drugs before handing out unemployment insurance? Is that such an unreasonable request? Why are bureaucrats who are sitting in an office thousands of miles away managing our land and wildlife? Shouldn't it be the people who live right there?  Why should Federal bureaucrats be able to override a law duly passed by Congress and signed by the President? Do any of these regulations add much to our quality of life?  Is this really about protecting the public interest? Or is it more about rewarding special interests? In fact, I can understand why liberals are bewildered at the idea that all these rules are hurting jobs, because these rules certainly are creating jobs--for lawyers and lobbyists. If there had been a bill, it would have been called ``The American Bar Association Full Employment Act.''  That, perhaps, is the real issue here. It is not a question of whether we are going to live under rules. We have rules--plenty of them. The question is this: What kinds of rules are we going to live under? Are we going to pass laws that impose costs on rural America, only to add more wealth to urban America? Are we going to kill blue-collar jobs so we can create more white-collar jobs? Or are we going to pass laws that help all Americans in all walks of life, as we should?

For the past 2 years, Idaho has had a three-judge caseload handled by just one active judge. What is even more challenging is that our lone remaining active judge is already eligible to take senior status since this past Even with Judge Nye's confirmation, Idaho still needs another U.district court judge.  Confirmation of Judge Nye today or tomorrow is undoubtedly a proud day for the entire Nye family, including Judge Nye's wife Katre and their eight children. Knowing that a successful public servant draws so much strength from the family surrounding him or her, I salute their partnership with Judge Nye in making this important occasion possible.  Again, I strongly endorse Judge Nye's nomination and appreciate the Senate's confirmation of him.

4479,topic-id,3723,"Mr.President, over the past few years, the Affordable Care Act has made tremendous strides in expanding healthcare coverage for hard-working Americans and the families who need it. I thank my colleague for his stories, and I would like to add some of my own.  While the law could certainly be improved, the way to do it is not by passing TrumpCare, which even President Trump has admitted is a ``mean'' bill. Unfortunately, Republican Senate leadership has indicated whatever it is that the Republicans are crafting in secret, behind closed doors, is going to be very similar to the version of TrumpCare that has passed the That is simply bad news.  The version of TrumpCare that passed the House could cost 23 million Americans, including 385,000 Illinoisans, to lose healthcare coverage. It would make it more expensive for older Americans and working people, especially those with preexisting conditions, to purchase insurance.  TrumpCare would cause their premiums and their out-of-pocket costs to simply skyrocket. The premiums of the average Illinoisan would increase by $700.  TrumpCare would also make critical services like maternity care for new moms and mental health and substance abuse services significantly more expensive, even though they are desperately needed. That is extremely mean-spirited.  Making matters worse, it would also put veterans on the chopping block. Specifically, TrumpCare would prohibit veterans who are eligible for VA healthcare from receiving tax credits to help them afford insurance in the individual marketplace. However, there is a big difference between being eligible for VA healthcare and being enrolled in Oftentimes, that is not even a choice you can make.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as many as 7 million of our veterans are eligible for VA care but are not enrolled. Preventing them from receiving tax credits would amount to a massive tax hike that would force them to pay thousands of dollars extra each year. That is not just mean; it is unacceptable.  There has been ample reporting indicating that Republicans knew exactly what they were doing. They could have included a fix to this but purposefully did not because that would have made their bill ineligible to be considered under the Senate's budget reconciliation process, which requires only 51 votes. That is because to remedy this huge flaw, the veterans tax credit language would need to be considered in committees of jurisdiction. That would entail holding public hearings and markups in committees, which would then reveal to the American people what exactly is in the Republican bill.  Apparently, the cost of public scrutiny is too high for Senate Republican leaders who are willing to raise taxes on veterans so they can hide this bad bill from the American people. As a result, the appalling flaws in their bill remain unfixed, and up to 7 million veterans remain on the chopping block.  That is not the only way TrumpCare would harm veterans either. Its massive cuts to Medicaid would have a direct impact on veterans, since nearly 2 million veterans across our country, including 60,000 veterans in my own home State of Illinois, rely on Medicaid for their healthcare coverage. That is 1 in 10 veterans.  For nearly 1 million of these veterans, Medicaid is their only source of coverage. Many of them are eligible for VA care only for the injuries they sustained in the military but not for any of their other health needs.  I shouldn't have to remind my colleagues that veterans are at a higher risk for serious health issues because of the sacrifices they made for our Yet, if TrumpCare becomes law, many of them will lose the coverage they gained from Medicaid expansion under the  Right now, 13 Republican Senators are sitting behind closed doors in some secret room on Capitol Hill, gambling with the lives of millions of Americans and people who have honorably served their country. One of those lives belongs to Robin Schmidt, a veteran from the North Side of  Robin served during Desert Storm in Army military intelligence. Robin loved her job in the military because it had always been her dream to serve her country. As a 13-year-old girl, Robin[[Page S3631]]stood at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, She knew that serving her country was her true calling. However, she was eventually forced to end her military career because, in her words, ``the Army refused to allow my husband to come back overseas to live with me.''  When she was pregnant with her child, she was forced to leave the military in order to return home to Arkansas to be with her husband to raise their children. When she was stateside, the VA denied her benefits because they were not service-connected, thus forcing her and her husband to pay the costs of maternity care and childbirth out of pocket.  She faced medical complications and developed endometriosis, a preexisting condition, and had to have a Caesarean section during delivery. After she delivered her baby, she ended up with $500,000 in hospital debt.  This enormous debt followed Robin and her husband throughout their marriage, and it eventually left them in divorce, medical bankruptcy, and with all of the repercussions that come from extreme financial hardship. She was also blocked from accessing affordable healthcare coverage because she now had a preexisting condition and could not afford good coverage on an $8.50-an-hour wage, so she went without care.  Robin remained uninsured for a total of 22 years, until she remarried and gained healthcare coverage under her husband's insurance. This was especially devastating because in 2007, Robin was diagnosed with cancer. Even though Robin was covered by her husband's insurance, insurance companies were not required to cover chemotherapy in 2007, and chemotherapy was too expensive for Robin and her family to pay for out of pocket. Instead, she had to choose debilitating surgeries.  After her cancer diagnosis, Robin developed severe autoimmune arthritis. Her autoimmune treatments started at $5,000 a month and soon increased to $14,000 a month. Insurance companies wanted Robin to pay for her medication upfront, with no guarantee of reimbursement.  As her medical costs grew and grew, Robin had to choose between her medical care and her mortgage payment. After the Affordable Care Act became law, insurance companies were mandated to cover Robin's medications and treatments. They were no longer able to refuse her the medications she needed. Her insurance premium prior to the Affordable Care Act was $1,600 a month, which was more than her family paid for their monthly mortgage and household bills. Now she pays just $300 a month for her entire family. There was no more redtape, constant stress, or fear that she might not be able to work--or worse, might not be able to stay alive.  Unfortunately, the coverage, relief, and peace of mind the ACA brought to Robin and her family is now under attack by congressional Robin is afraid that if TrumpCare becomes law, she will once again become nothing more than an uninsurable preexisting condition. She is afraid she would be considered a high-risk pool patient who will be able to have insurance but will not be able to actually afford any of her treatments. She is afraid that if Republicans push through TrumpCare, she will not be able to walk, work, and will have absolutely no quality of life.  Her dream was to serve her country in our Armed She took two oaths to serve this country, and she kept those oaths--promises that she would defend this great  Robin may not be in uniform anymore, but she certainly deserves that we in Congress and here in the Senate defend her right to access quality healthcare.  For Robin and for nearly 7 million veterans, middle-class families, our seniors, and some of our most vulnerable Americans, I urge my Republican counterparts to stop these secret negotiations, take repeal off the table, and work with Democrats to improve our healthcare system. Just like Robin, each of these Americans has a story, a family, and a valued place in society. Robin's family and all Americans deserve better than having their coverage stripped away from them behind closed doors.  I yield back.

Coup Attempt in Montenegro  Mr.Mr.President, last week, the Senate voted 97 to 2 to strengthen sanctions against Vladimir Putin's Russia for its attack on America's 2016 election and its other aggressive and illegal behavior. I hope the other body will take swift action to send this legislation to the President's desk.  We need strong Russia sanctions now because it has been 8 months since the U.intelligence community said publicly that the Russian Government directed this attack on our democracy. Yet, in the last 8 months, the Russian Government has hardly paid any price for its aggression. Thus, Vladimir Putin has been learning all over again that aggression pays. He learned that in Georgia in 2008. He learned that in Ukraine in 2014. He has learned that in Syria since 2015. So Vladimir Putin remains on the offense. This year, Russia attempted to interfere in France's election. We have already seen attempts to influence German public opinion ahead of elections in And there is every expectation that Russia will do the same thing in the Czech Republic, Italy, and elsewhere in future elections.  But perhaps the most disturbing indication of how far Vladimir Putin is willing to go to advance his dark and dangerous view of the world is what happened in October 2016 in the small Balkan country of Montenegro, when Russian intelligence operatives, in league with Serbia nationalists and others, attempted to overthrow the democratically elected Government of Montenegro and murder its Prime Minister on the country's election day. Why would Vladimir Putin go this far? To answer this, one must understand why Russia was so interested in the outcome of Montenegro's election.  Russia opposes the spread of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law across Europe, which is advanced by the European Union and protected by the NATO alliance. To Russia's great frustration, Montenegro's Government had committed the country to a Euro-Atlantic future and pursued membership in both the EU and  Indeed, NATO's invitation to Montenegro to join the NATO alliance in December 2015 was considered particularly insulting and threatening by After all, Montenegro had once been part of Russia's traditional Slavic ally, Montenegro has long been a favorite destination for Russian tourists. Russian politicians and oligarchs are reported to own as much as 40 percent of the real estate in that country. A few years ago, when it feared losing its naval base in Syria due to the civil war, Russia reportedly sought a naval base in Montenegro but was rejected. Now, if Montenegro joined NATO, the entire Adriatic Sea would fall completely within NATO's borders.  Montenegro's accession into NATO would also send a signal that NATO membership was a real possibility for other nations of the Western Balkans--Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and, according to some optimistic voices in the region, perhaps even  That is why Montenegro's October 16 election was no ordinary one. In Russia's eyes, it was a last chance to stop Montenegro from joining NATO, to thwart Montenegro's pursuit of a Euro-Atlantic future, and to reassert Russian influence in southeastern That is why there was little doubt that Russia would exert heavy pressure on Montenegro ahead of the election. Russia had already been accused of fomenting anti-government demonstrations and funding opposition parties. Yet few would have guessed how far Russia was willing to go. But now we know.  This April, as part of my visit to seven countries in southeastern Europe to reaffirm America's commitment to the region, I visited Montenegro and was briefed by Montenegrin officials on[[Page S3632]]the status of the investigation into the coup attempt. On April 14, Montenegro's special prosecutor filed indictments against 2 Russians and 12 other people for their roles in the coup attempt. This past weekend, a Montenegrin court accepted the indictments. As a result, the evidence before the court is now public.  I believe it is critically important that my colleagues and the American people are aware of the allegations made in these indictments. Pieced together, they reveal another blatant attack on democracy by the Russian Government--an attempt to smash a small, brave country that had the nerve to defy its will. And it is another unmistakable warning that Vladimir Putin will do whatever it takes to achieve his ambition to restore the Russian  According to the indictments, the coup planning got off to a slow start in March 2016. That was when opposition leaders in Montenegro allegedly sent an emissary known as Nino to Belgrade to meet with Slavko In the first meeting at Slavko's office, Nino said that he had been doing business for years in Russia, and he claimed that he was in contact with powerful men in He claimed that one of the men with him was a Russian FSB agent in charge of special tasks. Nino tried to enlist Slavko and his men to lead a plot to destabilize Montenegro, and Slavko indicated he was able and willing to participate. Later, Nino and Slavko met on the Pupin Bridge in Belgrade, this time with the supposed FSB agent in tow. The Russian told Slavko it would be good if he traveled to  After these encounters in Belgrade, Nino enlisted the help of Bratislav Dikic, the former chief of Serbia's special police and someone we will meet later in this story, to use his contacts to check into Slavko's reliability. He didn't pass the test, and this original version of the coup plot was abandoned.  It was at this point that the two Russians, Eduard Shishmakov and Vladimir Popov, stepped in to take control of the plans for destabilization operations in Both of these men are believed to be members of the Russian military agency, the  Shishmakov in particular already had a colorful past. In 2014, Shishmakov had been serving as deputy military attache in Russia's Embassy in Warsaw, After a scandal involving a Russian spy network within the Polish Government, the Polish Government identified Shishmakov as a GRU agent, declared him persona non grata, and ejected him from  Having taken over the Montenegrin operation, Shishmakov moved quickly to contact Sasa The two had first met in Russia back in 2014, when they discussed their opposition to the EU and Shishmakov even offered to help support Sindjelic's organization, the Serbian Wolves, which promotes Pan-Slavism and close relations between Russians and Serbs and opposes NATO and the Government of  The two met again in Moscow in 2015. This time, Shishmakov had Sindjelic submitted to a polygraph test that lasted for hours. After the test went well, he sent Sindjelic home with $5,000 and a promise to contact him if something urgent came up. That was in the spring of 2016. Shishmakov wrote that Montenegro's Prime Minister, Milo Djukanovic, and his government must be removed immediately and that the people of Montenegro must rebel in order for this to happen.  Then in September 2016, Shishmakov told Sindjelic to urgently come to Shishmakov even sent $800 to Sindjelic to buy his ticket. It was no trouble for Shishmakov to send the money--after all, he sent it from a Western Union conveniently located on the same street as GRU headquarters in Once in Moscow, Shishmakov and Sindjelic discussed the planning and operation of the plot to overthrow the Montenegrin Government, install the opposition in power, and abandon all plans for Montenegro to enter Shishmakov said opposition leaders from Montenegro had already visited Moscow a number of times and were in agreement with the plan.  In total, Sindjelic received more than $200,000 to support the operation. He used those funds to pay personnel, acquire police uniforms and equipment, and purchase weapons, including rifles, gas masks, bulletproof vests, electrical tranquilizers, and a drone with a camera. He was also provided encrypted phones to enable secure communications between the coup plotters and GRU agents.  Sindjelic and Shishmakov stayed in close touch as preparations continued ahead of the October elections. The plan was this:  On election day, the Montenegrin opposition was planning large protests in front of the Parliament, expecting to draw nearly 5,000 people. Sindjelic and his coconspirators, including Bratislav Dikic, the former commander of the Serbian special police, would recruit as many Serbian nationalists as they could to travel from Serbia to Montenegro to join the demonstrations. They were hoping 500 would join the protests and be ready to act when called upon.  As the protests were underway, a group of 50 armed men recruited by Shishmakov and wearing police uniforms provided by Sindjelic would ambush and kill the members of Montenegro's Special Anti-Terrorist Unit to prevent them from interfering with the coup. The armed men, still wearing their police uniforms, would then proceed to the Parliament building, where they would begin shooting at members of the police defending the Parliament building. They hoped to create the impression that some members of the police were changing sides and joining the protesters against the government. As the coup plotters saw it, this was poetic justice--reminiscent of how former Serbian President and convicted war criminal Slobodan Milosevic had fallen from power.  Led by the coup plotters and the Serbian nationalists, who would wear blue ribbons to be recognizable to one another, the protesters would then storm the Parliament building and declare victory for the opposition. Within 48 hours, the new government would be formed and arrests would be made across the capital, including Prime Minister If the Prime Minister could not be captured, he would be killed.  The coup plotters obviously wanted to create chaos, and it appears they may have had someone in mind to blame for the violence. Ahead of the election, the Montenegrin opposition hired a U.company to provide services, including countersurveillance and planning to extract personnel from the Montenegrin capital, around the time of the election. It is still unclear, the precise nature of this outreach to the U.company by the Montenegrin opposition or what services the company may have ended up providing, if any. Now, this is speculation, but if I know the Russians, American security personnel--some likely to have military or intelligence background--on the ground during the coup in the Montenegrin capital would have made excellent patsies for stories on Sputnik and Russia  Fortunately--one might even say luckily--the plan never got off the ground. Four days before election day, one of the coup plotters got cold feet and informed the Montenegrin authorities. On election day, Montenegrin police arrested 20 Serbian citizens, including the on-the-ground leader of the nationalist protesters, Bratislav Dikic, the former commander of the Serbian special police. News of the arrests sparked fear among others involved in the plot, many of whom retreated to  Furious that the plot had been disrupted, Shishmakov, the Russian GRU agent, grasped at straws for new ways of bringing down the Montenegrin He ordered Sindjelic to procure an assassin to kill the Prime Sindjelic did not carry out that order and later turned himself into police, fearing he would be next for assassination by the  Shishmakov also ordered a false flag attack on the opposition party headquarters to create the appearance of an attack by the government. He even hoped to entice one of the political parties that was part of the Prime Minister's coalition to leave the government with a bribe using Russian money funneled through Again, fortunately none of this worked.  Montenegrin police made several arrests in the aftermath of this failed coup attempt, but those arrests did not[[Page S3633]]include the alleged GRU agents, Mr.Shishmakov and Mr.They were in Belgrade, Serbia's capital. Presumably, Montenegrin authorities hoped the Serbian Government would consider expediting the pair to Montenegro as the government had done with some of the lower level coup plotters, but that did not happen, and the two Russian agents returned to  I know that sounded a little complicated. Every American should be disturbed by what happened in We should admire the courage of the country's leaders who resisted Russian pressure and persevered to bring Montenegro into the NATO alliance, which finally took place officially 2 weeks ago.  If there is one thing we should take away from this heinous plot, it is that we cannot treat Russia's interference in America's election in 2016 as an isolated incident. We have to stop looking at this through the warped lens of politics and see this attack on our democracy for what it is--just one phase of Vladimir Putin's long-term campaign to weaken the United States, to destabilize Europe, to break the NATO alliance, to undermine confidence in Western values, and to erode any and all resistance to his dark and dangerous view of the world.  That is why Putin attacked our 2016 election. That is why Putin attempted to overthrow the Government of That is why he tried to influence the election in France and will try the same in Germany and elsewhere throughout That is why it probably will not be long before Putin attempts some punitive actions in Montenegro to show other countries in the Western Balkans what happens when you try to defy  That is why it will not be long before Putin takes interest in another American election. The victim may be a It may be a To Putin, it will not matter as long as he succeeds in dividing us from one another, weakening our resolve, undermining confidence in ourselves, and eroding our belief in our own values.  I urge my colleagues again that we must take our own side in this fight, not as Republicans, not as Democrats but as It is time to respond to Russia's attack on American democracy and that of our European allies with strength, with resolve, with common purpose, and with action.

Millions have been displaced from their homes, and the prevalence of rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war is almost beyond belief, earning eastern Congo the grim distinction of being the ``Rape Capital of the World.'' Sam Brownback first took me there in 2005, and I returned again in 2010. At the time, the U.reported that about 1,000 women were sexually assaulted every day in Congo, roughly equivalent to 12 percent of all Congolese women. I can still vividly remember walking across the lava-strewn refugee camps and visiting the victims of sexual assault in the heroic Heal Africa I also recall the hearing I held in the Judiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law about rape as a weapon of war. Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege testified about the horrors of the region's sexual violence he helped treat at Panzi One of the drivers and funders of this conflict was paradoxically that which fills the DRC with such potential: its natural resources. Instead of paying for the nation's peace, education, roads, and public health programs, the DRC's mineral wealth was being siphoned off to fund the armed groups that vie for local and regional control of vast areas far from Congo's capital,  Tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold are found in everyday electronics, jewelry, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment, but these minerals also have provided weapons and salaries to fighters, including conscripted child soldiers, who then commit unspeakable horrors on innocent civilians. That is why, in 2009, I joined Senators Brownback and Feingold and Congressman McDermott in drafting a simple reporting requirement for US-registered corporations that source these four minerals from the DRC or its neighbors. It passed and became law in 2010 to help stem the flow of financial support from illicit mining to the region's horrific violence.  It wasn't a ban. It was simply a transparency measure that said if you use any of these key minerals from the region, you had to note in your filings with the U.Securities and Exchange Commission what, if anything, you were doing to not source from those fueling the region's violence. If a company isn't taking any action to avoid fueling the region's violence, there isn't a penalty, but at least consumers would know that. This gives consumers the final decision on what electronics they want in their pockets. On a broader scale, the measure aimed to use collective industry action to clean up the supply chain of these minerals, which I am proud to say has worked.  For example, before the law, not a single smelter of tin, tungsten, tantalum--also known as the 3Ts--or gold had submitted to and passed an audit about dealing in conflict minerals. Today, 76 percent of the world's smelters of the 3Ts or gold have passed such an audit. Today more than 200 mines have also now been certified as conflict free. The effects of supply chain due diligence in this region are remarkable and are due to the leadership of many in the industry, including Intel, Apple, Kemet, and a number of companies from Illinois, including Motorola and AAR This process is far from complete or perfect, but the conflict minerals law has helped clean up the minerals trade and ease the grip Congolese warlords have had on the mining sector.  So imagine my dismay when I recently learned the Acting Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Michael Piwowar, unilaterally instructed his staff to halt enforcement of the law. In his April 7 statement, he mistakenly conflated aspects of an earlier court decision to justify his actions. It sets a dangerous precedent when an Acting Chairman decides which laws the SEC should and should not enforce.  Let me be clear, this unilateral action was without legal basis and is beyond the scope of the Acting Chairman's authority. As such, I urge the Acting Chairman to rescind his directive and allow full enforcement of the Conflict Minerals law and rule. This isn't just about enforcing the law as written by Congress, this is life-or-[[Page S2962]]death for millions of people in the Democratic Republic of the The Acting Chairman would be well advised to remember that.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-16-pt1-PgS2961-3.txt,326,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,June

4423,topic-id,3142,"Mr.President, I represented the congressional district of Springfield, IL, for 14 years, and this is my 21st year in the It is a big State with 102 counties. We are proud of our diversity in our State, which runs from the great city of Chicago, to deep, deep Southern Illinois, to a town of Cairo, IL, which is literally south of Richmond, VA, by latitude. They grow cotton down there in the So it is a very big and diverse I am proud to represent it.  I have spent some time doing my best to understand the challenges that businesses, individuals, and families face and to measure their sentiments on issues over the years.  For the last several months, I have spent my time visiting every corner of downstate Illinois, which is the more rural, smalltown area of our State outside of It is more conservative politically. President Trump ran well in some parts of downstate And I have been in this area--representing it, growing up in it--to measure what I consider to be the topic and issue of the day, and that is the issue of healthcare in It is an issue which each of us takes very seriously and personally because each of us is called on in a variety of different ways in our lives to have healthcare for ourselves and our family--the people we love--at critical moments.  We are now engaged in a national debate about the future of healthcare in The Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House, and have been from the beginning opposed to the Affordable Care Act, which was passed under President I voted for it. I think it was the right vote. I think it has achieved a great many things. I hope we can build on it to make an even better healthcare system for our It is not perfect. There are areas that need to be changed, improved, and areas that I think need to be strengthened over the long haul to make sure America has more fairness when it comes to healthcare for our people.  Last week, I visited about a half dozen healthcare facilities in I jokingly said to my staff that I have come to know hospital administrators in my State far better today than I ever have.  Here is what they told me. They told me the healthcare bill that Senator McConnell has proposed in the U.Senate would be devastating to the families, the patients, the employees, and the healthcare facilities in our They told me that nearly $800 billion in Medicaid cuts would cripple rural hospitals and health clinics. Not only would this harm patients in rural communities, but 35 percent cuts in the Medicaid Program would also cost jobs in The Illinois Hospital Association in my State estimates that the Republican bill, which passed the House and now is being considered in the Senate, would cost us 60,000 healthcare jobs.  I went to Granite City, IL, which is near the Louis area. I met a young woman named Sam, who has Down syndrome and her mother They are worried about the Republican plan to cap Medicaid spending. Sam's health needs can't always be anticipated. There are not some that can be capped in terms of future needs, and the amount of care can hardly be determined in advance for this young woman who is doing her best to lead an active and involved life facing this disability, which she does. This is so true for so many people nationwide.  Some of my Republican colleagues in Illinois have said: We just don't understand why Medicaid as a program has grown so much. Well, it may be hard to understand until you look inside the program and realize what it does. Medicaid may have started as a small idea, but it has really grown into a major provider of healthcare in In my State of Illinois, it is responsible for paying for the prenatal care, birth, and care of mothers and their children after they have been born for more than 50 percent of the kids.  It is an important provider of healthcare resources to our school districts in Illinois, which count on Medicaid to help them take care of special needs students--counselors, psychologists, transportation, even feeding tubes for those who are severely disabled. It is a critical program as well for the disabled community, like Sam and young men and women who are victims of autism or Down syndrome who want to lead a full life but need health insurance. Medicaid is their health insurance.  One woman said to me in Champaign, IL, my 23-year-old son is autistic. He counts on Medicaid, and, Senator, if I don't have Medicaid, my only recourse is an institutional program that would cost us over $300,000 a year. It is impossible for us to even consider that.  So those who would cut back on Medicaid spending in the name of flexibility and saving money or generating enough to pay for a tax cut for wealthy people would leave people just like those I have described in a terrible circumstance.  I haven't described the largest cost of The largest cost in Illinois and across our Nation is the Medicaid services and benefits provided to those who are older--mothers, grandmothers in nursing facilities and care facilities[[Page S3909]]who count on Medicaid along with Medicare and Social Security for the basics in life.  I heard from He is a worker from Urbana, IL, who is worried that the Senate Republican bill is going to increase his out-of-pocket expenses by thousands of dollars. He is worried because he fits into an age category which would see premiums go up dramatically in costs under the Republican bill. The Affordable Care Act, which we passed under President Obama, set limits on the increases in premium costs so no premium paid would be more than three times the cost of the lowest premium that is paid for health insurance in our country. Well, Republicans have changed that. In both the House and Senate, they have raised that to five times. So it means for people, particularly between the ages of 50 and 64, they are going to see a substantial increase in their premiums because of that Republican provision. People are following this closely enough to know that when premium costs go up for many of them, it becomes impossible to buy the coverage they need.  As I returned to Washington, I once again face the reality of what this Republican healthcare plan would mean. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office told us the bill would cost 22 million Americans health insurance coverage--cutbacks in Medicaid as well as cutbacks in private insurance. Think of that. I don't know how the Republicans in our State can go home and explain why a million people in Illinois are about to lose their health insurance in the name of healthcare reform.  I can tell you the notion of repealing the Affordable Care Act may have had some surface political appeal until you realize you might be 1 of the 1 million people in my State who ends up with no health insurance when it is all over. It would cut Medicaid dramatically, as I have mentioned, and then keep cutting--a 35-percent cut over the next 20 years--with devastating impacts on hospitals, clinics, and many other facilities.  By 2020, average premiums in the individual market would increase by 76 percent under the Republican plan. Costs would skyrocket even higher for seniors, rural communities, and those with medical needs.  What happens to people with preexisting conditions under the Republican repeal bill? One out of three Americans has a preexisting condition. In the old days, they couldn't buy insurance or, if they could, couldn't afford it because they had a history of cancer in their family, diabetes, heart disease. Well, this Republican plan would take away the protections of the Affordable Care It would allow States to waive essential healthcare benefits, like maternity care, mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment. People in need of these services would be left to fend for themselves.  The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the Republican bill, and it said: ``People who used services no longer included in the Essential Health Benefits would experience substantial increases in out-of-pocket spending on health care, or would choose to forgo the services. Moreover, the ACA's ban on annual and lifetime limits . . . would no longer apply.''  With this scathing analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, what did the Republican leadership decide to do? Instead of addressing these challenges straight on, they retreated. They shut themselves off behind closed doors and tried to cut a deal within the 52 Republican Senate Members here to pass this measure, as bad as it is. There was not one hearing on this bill--on the Republican healthcare bill--no markups, no amendments, and no support from medical advocates in any part of our There was no input in the Senate from any Member outside the Republican caucus.  They want to call this bill right away, and it is understandable. The longer it sits out there and the longer people get to know it, the less they support it. You know we still haven't seen the final language. Why? Because Republicans continue to work in secret on a bill that literally impacts one-sixth of the American people and every single person in our country.  This measure affects everybody. Even if you get your insurance through your employer or Medicare, this bill would make Medicare go insolvent sooner and allow employers to, once again, impose annual or lifetime limits on care under their health insurance plans.  Now, the latest we have heard is that the Republicans are meeting in secret, making some changes to this bill. They may be throwing some money at the opioid crisis facing America, but that will not make up for kicking 15 million people off of The amount of money they are talking about to deal with the opioid crisis is literally inadequate to deal with the seriousness of that issue or to provide the substance abuse treatment people currently receive from Medicaid who will be cut off under the Republican plan.  Cutting Medicaid, our best tool to fight the opioid epidemic, and offering a coupon for drug treatment is a cruel step backward. If it ends up buying a vote on the Republican side, shame on my colleagues for selling out so cheaply.  Republican John Kasich of Ohio is not fooled. He called this idea of a special opioid fund to win some votes on the Republican side ``like spitting in the ocean.'' I called Governor Kasich this last week. He and I came to Washington together many years ago. I have known him, and I like him. We disagree on some political issues, but he is very forthright and frank. He has warned us that what is going to happen to Ohio is going to happen to the Nation, if the Republicans have their way with their healthcare bill.  We have also heard the Republicans are considering adding provisions that allow insurers to offer bare-bones plans. I have just heard some more about this today, and I believe the author of this idea is the junior Senator from Texas, Mr. Here is what he says: If your State offers a health insurance plan that complies with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, then you may offer it to other consumers in the State insurance plans that do not. He says it gives consumers choice. Well, it sure does, but look at the choice it gives them because if he is aiming for lowering premium costs by offering health insurance plans that are junk plans, health insurance plans that are fake insurance, the net result is going to be people paying a lot more in copays and deductibles and a lot less coverage when they definitely need it.  There are a couple other things it will do. Because these younger healthier people will buy the cheaper plans believing they are invincible, it will end up raising the cost of premiums for those who buy other insurance. The discrimination, in terms of premium costs, will be dramatic, and that, in and of itself, could be damaging to people all across the United  So Senator Cruz believes that offering junk insurance plans and telling the consumers we are giving you a choice is going to answer the needs across It will not. It will raise premiums on everyone else. It will provide inadequate coverage for those who buy these plans, and sadly many of them are going to be facing deductibles and copays they just can't handle. That is no answer. It may be a political answer to get his vote, but it is certainly not a credible answer.  We have had this before the Affordable Care Act, and do you remember what it was like? People got sick and found out their insurance didn't cover what they needed. Women who were pregnant found out their plans didn't cover maternity or newborn care. People who were diagnosed with a mental health condition found out their insurance covered no treatment for mental illness. So what good is insurance if it doesn't care for the most basic and essential needs of Americans?  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, we changed it. We required that policies provide real insurance for real families. Do you know what happened, in addition to providing more care for people across America? The number of bankruptcies, personal bankruptcies, have been cut in half since the Affordable Care Act passed. Why? The 1 driver of personal bankruptcy and family bankruptcy in America was medical bills--medical bills that were beyond the payment of an ordinary person. There are fewer of those today because of the Affordable Care  Senator Cruz's plan for selling fake insurance or junk insurance plans that will not be there when you need them,[[Page S3910]]I can just tell you it means more business for the bankruptcy court. It would banish those with preexisting conditions to the world of sky-high premiums, all in the name of Senator Cruz's freedom of choice. Well, freedom isn't free when it comes to relegating so many Americans to such a precarious state when it comes to health insurance. No matter how much the Republican Senators tinker around the edges, they are dealing with a flawed, unfixable bill.  The American people oppose any bill that rips health insurance away from millions of individuals and families, they oppose any bill that causes nearly 1 million people nationwide to lose their jobs, and they are also opposed to a Republican health insurance plan that would cost coverage for half a million American veterans.  The American people oppose any bill that hurts those with preexisting conditions. They oppose a bill that throws millions of people off Medicaid and slashes billions in Federal funding to hospitals, healthcare clinics, and schools.  The American people oppose any bill that is rejected by every major medical and patient group. The Republican bill is opposed by the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, nurses, pediatricians, AARP, heart, diabetes, and lung associations. How can you write a bill that draws that much opposition? They did it. They did it behind closed doors, and they don't want you to see what they are doing with it now.  Finally, the American people oppose any bill that takes away nearly a trillion dollars in healthcare in order to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and large corporations. Case in point: Of the 145 pages of the Senate repeal bill, 94 pages are devoted to slashing Medicaid and providing tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and pharmaceutical companies.  Last week, one conservative writer penned an article which said that it gives conservatism a bad name when we are giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people in order to cut and eliminate health insurance for the poorest people in That is exactly what this bill does.  I am glad the Senate Republicans have delayed their vote on this repeal, but many have not given up. In all of my townhall discussions, the plea from Illinois people has been clear: Improve the Affordable Care Act; don't repeal it.  So where do we go from here?  First, Republicans need to take repeal off the table. We need 3 Republicans out of the 53 to say this is the wrong way to go about it.  Second, President Trump must stop undermining the stability of the marketplaces with his uncertainty and sabotage.  Third, we need to work together on a bipartisan basis to strengthen our current system. We need to address the price of pharmaceutical drugs. The current bill and law does not. That is the biggest driver, according to Blue Cross in Illinois, of premium increases--the cost of pharmaceutical bills. We need to build competition through a Medicare-like public option available to everyone who chooses it across the United  Some Republicans, including Senator McConnell, have said that the Republicans have to do this by themselves because the Democrats refuse to work with them. That is simply not true. We are here. We have been here all along, and we want to have a hearing. Bring in some experts. Let's just have a meeting. That would be a breakthrough.  Democrats have asked the Republicans to join us. Let's sit down together, informally, like grown-ups, and address this issue in a responsible fashion. We are ready and willing to work on legislation to improve the individual market for the 6 percent of the people who purchase their insurance there. I fail to see how gutting Medicaid and throwing 22 million Americans off of health insurance in order to provide tax breaks for rich people does anything to help that 6 percent.  This is a critical moment when it comes to healthcare across It is unfortunate that we are now considering a bill that was revealed only 2 weeks ago, a bill that has never been subject to a hearing before any committee, a bill that has never been amended in an open process.  When it came to the Affordable Care Act, over 140 Republican amendments were adopted. The Republicans haven't offered us an opportunity to offer one amendment to their proposal--not one. It is a take-it-or-leave-it, closed-door deal. That is not the way the Senate was designed to work. It is not the way the American people want us to work. They expect us to work in a constructive fashion on a bipartisan basis to solve the problems facing our The biggest single problem is giving peace of mind to Americans and American families across the Nation that they have healthcare they can count on and afford.

4440,topic-id,182,"Madam Speaker, after Hurricane Sandy, thousands of homeowners throughout the New York region learned that they were ineligible for federal disaster assistance because they lived in a co-op or a condo; not in a single family home.

4513,topic-id,2131,"Mr.President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for July 2017. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate approved in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, 3. This information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. The Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act (CBA).  My last filing can be found in the Record on June 7, 2017. The information contained in this report captures legislative activity from that filing through July 10, 2017.  Republican Budget Committee staff prepared tables 1 through 3 of this report. They remain unchanged since my last filing.  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget totals approved by the  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017, which helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA section 311. CBO's estimates show that current-law levels of spending fiscal year 2017 are below the amounts assumed in the budget resolution by $303 million in budget authority and $6.4 billion in outlays. CBO also estimates that revenues are $1 million above assumed levels for fiscal year 2017, but $21 million below assumed levels over the fiscal year 2017-2026 period. Social Security levels are consistent with the budget resolution's fiscal year 2017 figures.  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate's PAYGO scorecard currently shows increased deficits of $226 million over the fiscal year 2016-2021 and $227 million over fiscal year 2016-2026 periods. For both of these periods, outlays have increased by $201 million, while revenues decreased by $25 million over the 6-year period and $26 million over the 11-year period. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 201 of 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.  Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's budget enforcement activity on the floor. No budget points of order have been raised since my last filing.  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.  I ask unanimous consent that the tables be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED

CBO estimates that, for fiscal year 2017:    The $20 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 193 would result in an additional $5  million in outlays for FDA innovation projects;    The $352 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 194 would result in an additional $91  million in outlays for NIH innovation projects;    The $500 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 195 would result in an additional  $160 million in outlays for state response to opioid abuse.  Consistent with sections 1001-1004 of P.114-255, for the purposes of estimating the discretionary budget  authority and outlays for these provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974 and the  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, those amounts are estimated to provide no budget  authority or outlays.c For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as  approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a  result, current level does not include these items.d Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in 3, pursuant to  various provisions of the resolution. The total for the Initial Senate Resolution shown below excludes $81,872  million in budget authority and $40,032 million in outlays assumed in 3 for non regular  discretionary spending, including spending that qualifies for adjustments to discretionary spending limits  pursuant to section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

It is the same thing with a few more poison pills in it.  People are going to have to pay higher premiums and deductibles, and it is going to increase what comes out of their pocket; there is going to be less coverage; 24 million people will lose their coverage--that remains in this bill--and key protections are gutted, American people: emergency rooms, maternity care, opioid, mental health care, a string of things that you want in your insurance coverage, a crushing age tax for seniors.  Now, there is a real hypocrisy here. Every single Member of Congress has been enrolled in the Affordable Care I want to know which one of you dropped out of it. It was good enough for you--one person, great. Two people, big deal. It was good enough for you, but it is not good enough for your constituents.  And you know what? Who is standing with you?

4462,topic-id,158,"Mr.Speaker, in my home State of Hawaii, hospitalizations and emergency room visits from opioid-related conditions have more than doubled in the last decade. More people are now dying from overdoses than motor vehicle accidents. This opioid epidemic is killing 91 Americans all across this country every single day.  For years, companies like Purdue Pharma, the maker of the commonly known drug OxyContin, have profited off of the suffering of millions of Americans who are dealing and struggling with opioid addiction. Now Purdue and others are going overseas, targeting foreign populations, using the very same shady marketing tactics, lies, and false advertising that helped them get rich at the expense of the American people.  This is absolutely unacceptable. We can't just keep wringing our hands about the opioid crisis without actually tackling the cause of it. Purdue and those responsible should be prosecuted for the deaths and lives that have been ruined as a result of their lies.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgH5773-3.txt,2122,PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT AMENDMENT,2017.0,13.0,May
4362,topic-id,185,"Mr.Speaker, 93 percent of Americans support the legalization of doctor-prescribed medical marijuana--93 percent. But despite this widespread public support, marijuana remains classified as a schedule I drug, the same as LSD or heroin.  This harms low-income communities each year, it turns thousands of citizens into felons, and it punishes people who are sick and looking for medical help.  I think of Rayann, a young lady in my district with juvenile refractory epilepsy. She has seizures every day. Other treatments failed, but medical marijuana helped improve her condition. I thought of her when I worked on, and passed, Florida's Compassionate Medical Cannabis  Marijuana must be moved to schedule III, which will make it easier to conduct research into its medical uses. It will allow businesses to work with banks instead of looking over their shoulders in fear of a Federal raid, and it will keep States from being at odds with Federal law.  Today I am proud to introduce legislation that will reclassify marijuana as a schedule III drug. I look forward to working with my colleagues. America is watching, and now we must act.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2769-5.txt,99999999999999,PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT AMENDMENT,2017.0,6.0,June

The Pikes Peak Region plays a significant role in our American history. For centuries, this area was home to Native Americans, pioneers, miners, farmers and ranchers, and other explorers. The Pikes Peak region became a prime location for trade and, eventually, the home of the ``Pikes Peak or Bust'' gold rush in 1857. Thousands of prospectors scrambled to the area for their piece of the gold fortune. This area became the pinnacle of the American frontier, which spurred development and innovation.  Today community-wide events, including the Pikes Peak or Bust rodeo, celebrate the adventurous spirit of the Pikes Peak region and its Western heritage. In addition, the rodeo donates all proceeds to charities that support military members and their families, such as the Fort Carson Outreach Program and the U.Air Force Academy's Operation Warm Thank you to the Pikes Peak or Bust Rodeo leadership and entire El Paso County community for keeping these longstanding traditions alive.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-22-pt1-PgS3063-3.txt,99999999999999,PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT AMENDMENT,2017.0,22.0,May

4347,topic-id,713,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to implore my colleagues to join in supporting our bill, H.1282, the DHS Acquisition Review Board Act of 2017. This legislation provides commonsense reform and saves the taxpayers' dollars.  The Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of Inspector General have reported the longstanding challenges the Department of Homeland Security faces in managing its major acquisition programs. These programs are those costing more than $300 million, which cost the Department about $7 billion in 2016 alone.  Since the Department's creation, the GAO has placed DHS management functions, including acquisition management, on its high-risk list of programs that are highly susceptible to fraud, waste, and abuse. Mismanagement is present or in need of transformation, and the DHS still struggles to ensure that major acquisition programs stay on budget, are delivered on schedule, and provide capabilities as originally intended.  Homeland Security is a unique committee insofar as it affords the opportunity for folks on both sides of the aisle to work in a bipartisan manner for things that we can all concede are in the best interest of our  A recent GAO report found that 9 of 26 major acquisition programs experienced cost growth or schedule slips. The amount of cost overruns totaled nearly $1 billion and are scheduled to slip by an average of 6 months per program. The GAO also found that half of the major acquisition programs it reviewed deployed capabilities before meeting all key performance parameters, which are the most important requirements a system must meet in order to do the jobs that they are intended to do.  It is unacceptable for waste and dysfunction to continue, and it is imperative that the DHS take acquisition management seriously. This bill makes that the case.  We must provide strong accountability mechanisms to ensure major acquisition programs with challenges are caught up, found early, and that solutions are quickly implemented.  This bill ensures that DHS provides that accountability and consistency needed to manage major components, acquisition programs, et cetera, by authorizing the Secretary to establish an Acquisition Review The Acquisition Review Board would then strengthen the accountability and uniformity in DHS' acquisition process, review major programs, and evaluate the use of best practices.  This bill essentially codifies the already existing Acquisition Review Board to ensure that that board continues and has the oversight authority[[Page H5022]]it needs under law to make sure that the dollars that we take from the taxpayers are sufficiently and adequately managed and not wasted.  The Acquisition Review Board would be chaired by the Under Secretary for Management and would require at least two component heads or their designees to be permanent members. This would ensure participation from all DHS components.  The Board would be required to meet regularly and would be responsible to determine if a proposed acquisition has met planning requirements needed to proceed to production and deployment, oversee major acquisitions as a business strategy, and review programs in a cost benefit analysis format to determine performance objectives and ensure that our dollars are well spent.  Mr.Speaker, a recent news story pointed out that nine individuals on the planet Earth control as much wealth as 50 percent of the population of the planet That means that these nine people control as much wealth as 3.5 billion people. And yet, Mr.Speaker, if you were to take the amalgamated wealth of those nine individuals and add it to those 3.5 billion and apply it to the United States' national debt, we could pay off a mere 9.4 percent.  Given that our national debt is almost $20 trillion dollars and rising, it is imperative that we take this bipartisan step to ensure that our homeland is secured but that the dollars spent doing so are spent effectively, efficiently, and with good stewardship. This legislation helps to ensure that tax dollars are safeguarded, but it also helps to ensure that DHS personnel receive the tools they need to keep us safe.  Mr.Speaker, I implore and urge my colleagues on each side of the aisle to join in this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our tax dollars are well shepherded but that our Nation is as secure as can be possible.

4329,topic-id,661,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.1761, the Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act of 2017, and urge my colleagues to do the same. I would like to note that May is National Missing Children's Month and today marks National Missing Children's It is an honor to be on the floor here today as we continue our mission to protect these innocent victims.  We have made great strides toward ending child exploitation. However, gaps still exist in our laws that are contrary to Congress' goal of protecting children and criminalizing the production of images of child sexual abuse.  H.1761 takes necessary steps to close an unfortunate loophole created by a Fourth Circuit decision in United States v. Palomino-Coronado--a case in which a defendant was able to walk free from Federal conviction despite photographic evidence he had engaged in the sexual abuse of a 7-year-old child.  On May 3, 2012, Prince George's County police officers responded to a home in Laurel, Maryland, based on a report of a missing 7-year-old child known as ``B.H.'' Officers found the child at the fence that separated her house and her neighbor's house. Upon investigation, it was uncovered that the neighbor, Anthony Palomino-Coronado, a 19-year-old male, had sexually molested the child.  At trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of knowingly employing, using, persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing a minor in sexually explicit conduct, for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of that conduct--in other words, for the production of child pornography. The defendant appealed his conviction, alleging insufficient evidence.  Incredibly, the Fourth Circuit vacated the defendant's conviction, finding there was insufficient evidence the defendant's sexual abuse of the 7-year-old girl was ``for the purpose of'' creating an image of such conduct. The court found that, though the defendant engaged in sexual conduct with a child, ``the fact that only one image was produced militates against finding that his intent in doing so was to take a picture.''  Essentially, the court decided that the defendant had engaged in sexual conduct with a 7-year-old and taken a picture but had not engaged in sexual conduct with a 7-year-old to take a picture. To me, this is a preposterous, offensive result.  Under the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in Palomino, a defendant could admit to sexually abusing a child, and memorializing the conduct, but could argue that he should, nonetheless, escape Federal conviction because he lacked the requisite purpose or specific intent, prior to initiating the sexual abuse. Indeed, defense attorneys have begun to raise these Palomino defenses in other courts.  In response to Palomino, H.1761 establishes additional bases of liability to the crime of production of child pornography. Specifically, the bill clarifies existing law by prohibiting the knowing production of, or knowingly causing the production of, a visual depiction of a real minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.  Additionally, H.1761 amends current law to prohibit the knowing transmission of, or knowingly causing the transmission of, a live visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct while also criminalizing the knowing creation of the visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.  This language will serve to fix this judicially created loophole and ensure our court system will not have to spend time evaluating this meritless defense and will make certain predators such as this will not be able to escape Federal consequences.  Mr.Speaker, with this bill, Congress' intent is clear. We must continue to protect our children, the most vulnerable and innocent members of society. I commend the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.Johnson), a member of the Judiciary Committee, for introducing this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

4402,topic-id,1379,"Mr.President, I am going to speak for about 5 minutes. Before I begin, I will reference an item that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record following my speech.  I rise to share real stories of real hardships from hard-working families in my home State of Seven years ago, Americans were promised that the Affordable Care Act would make health insurance cheaper and healthcare more accessible. Well, I will not pretend to break any news here. The facts speak for themselves: ObamaCare is not living up to its promises. When passing the law, the other side made promises they knew could not be kept.  The irony is, the so-called Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable. I have heard from many Iowans who tell me, in no uncertain terms, that they cannot afford to buy health insurance because ObamaCare is unaffordable. In fact, 72,000 Iowans can't even get help from the exchange because there isn't an insurance company to service them.  One Iowan wrote to me:       I am forced to pay $230 a month for a healthcare plan that      covers nothing until I reach $11,000 in deductible. So on top      of paying 100 percent of my medical bills anyway, now I also      have to pay for insurance I can't use.  How did we get to this point?  Seven years ago, I spoke right here on the Senate floor and predicted what would happen to the cost of insurance if ObamaCare passed. So let's go back to that period of time when I spoke in October of 2009. This is my own quote from that speech:       And while some of the supporters of these partisan bills      may not want to tell their constituents, we all know that as      national spending on health care insurance increases,      American families will bear the burden in the form of higher      premiums. So let me be very clear, as a result of the current      pending health care proposals, most Americans will pay higher      premiums for health insurance.  That is the end of my quote from a speech in the Senate in October of 2009.  Now, I don't have a magic crystal ball, but it was easy to read the writing on the wall. I knew that layers of new taxes and burdensome new mandates in ObamaCare would lead us to where we find ourselves today: a broken healthcare system that is not better off than it was 7 years ago, and for millions of Americans--including those 72,000 Iowans--it is much worse.  So where do we go from here? After 7 years of rising premiums, soaring deductibles, and climbing copays, Republicans are committed to fixing the damage caused by the Affordable Care[[Page S3890]]Not only is it unaffordable for too many people, it is unsustainable. ObamaCare is unable to fulfill its promises to the American people.  Here is what every lawmaker in Congress ought to agree on: Insurance isn't worth having if patients can't afford to use that insurance. The facts are clear. A one-size-fits-all, government-run plan from Washington, DC, is driving insurers out of the exchanges, driving up premiums, driving away customers, and driving up the tab to the tax-paying public.  ObamaCare has overregulated, overtaxed, and oversold its promises to the American people. ObamaCare has not healed what ails the U.healthcare system. It is time to move forward.  Mr.President, I also want to speak about Medicaid for a moment.  Medicaid, as we know it, is not sustainable. The Federal Government and States spent $553 billion on Medicaid in 2016. That amount is very close to $593 billion spent on the 1 responsibility of the Federal Government--our Nation's defense.  Every decade since Medicaid started, it has grown faster than the economy. Medicaid is now unmatched as a driver of the deficit of our country. We cannot sit by and leave this kind of debt to our children and our grandchildren.  Dollars are not the only metric by which we measure Medicaid is a program that should supply healthcare to diverse populations and should have quality measured, but it does not.  Medicaid dollars should be spent efficiently, but they are not. Activists in Washington, DC, are fighting to preserve the status quo and, of course, in the process, scaring the daylights out of the American people.  Yet Iowans tell me that there are waiting lists for Medicaid waivers to obtain services for children with disabilities. Others tell me that medicines that will cure diseases are rationed to be used only with those with the most advanced disease. In other words, you have to get really sick for Medicaid to cover medical expenses.  It is a fact that Medicaid is not working the way it should for everyone. The time to act to preserve and improve Medicaid as the safety net for the most vulnerable citizens is right now.  I am holding up a letter here because, under a Democratic President, proposing to do what we are doing, 46 Democrat Senators wrote to President Clinton and expressed their ``strong support'' for Medicaid per capita caps. The letter went on to say that it would give States the flexibility to achieve savings without cuts to essential services. That is what the current proposal aims to do as well.  We are proposing per capita caps as a way to make sure tax dollars are spent wisely on the most vulnerable people in our Medicaid dollars should be spent on a child with cystic fibrosis who needs a blockbuster drug. A person with severe mental illness should be able to rely on Medicaid for care.  Medicaid cannot continue to be a limitless credit card for the States to spend money without any accountability to the people who need it. I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan dogma and work to solve this problem for the American people.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Washington, DC,                                                December 13, 1995.     President William Clinton,     The White House,     Washington,       Dear Mr.President: We are writing to express our strong      support for the Medicaid per-capita cap structure in your      seven-year budget. We have fought against Medicaid block      grants and cuts in the Senate, and we are glad you      acknowledge the importance of our position.       We support a balanced budget. We are glad you agree with us      that we can balance the budget without undermining the health      of children, pregnant women, the disabled, and the elderly.       The savings level of $54 billion over seven years included      in your budget will require rigorous efficiencies and      economies in the program. However, after consulting with many      Medicaid Directors and service providers across the country,      we believe a reduction of this level is possible to achieve      without dramatic limits on eligibility or cuts to essential      services. States will need flexibility to achieve these      savings, and you have taken steps toward granting it in your      bill.       We were encouraged that your Medicaid proposal does not pit      Medicaid populations against one another in a fight over a      limited pot of federal resources.       We were further encouraged to hear Chief of Staff Panetta      relay your commitment to veto any budget not containing a      fundamental guarantee to Medicaid for eligible       We commend you on the courage you have exercised in making      these commitments to Americans eligible for There      is a bottom line when it comes to people's health; do not      allow the current Congressional leadership to further reduce      our commitment to Medicaid beneficiaries.       Your current proposal is fair and reasonable, and is      consistent with what we have advocated on the Senate floor.      We urge you in the strongest possible terms to hold fast to      these commitments in further negotiations. We are prepared to      offer any assistance you may need in this regard.

Mississippi Plane Crash  Mr.Mr.President, I want to start this afternoon by offering deepest condolences to the Marine Corps and to all those who lost loved ones in the tragic plane crash yesterday in We are still learning details about the incident, but we know that at least 16 on board the plane perished as a result of the crash.

Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, on a totally different matter, ObamaCare is a direct attack on the middle class. Seven years ago, Democrats imposed it on our country. In the years since, Americans have found themselves at the mercy of its failures repeatedly. Choice was supposed to go up, but it plummeted. Costs were supposed to go down, but they skyrocketed.  ObamaCare's defenders spent years trying to deny these clear realities. When the weight of the evidence became too clear to ignore, some appeared to bemoan ObamaCare's harmful impact on our country.  The Democratic Governor of Minnesota declared that it was ``no longer affordable.'' President Clinton branded it ``the craziest thing in the world.'' Other Democrats said similar things.  Such acknowledgements of the obvious seemed to many of us like progress, but they turned out to be just rhetoric. In the last election, voters delivered Congress the opportunity to finally address the ObamaCare status quo. Yet Democrats made clear early on that they did not want to work with us in a serious, bipartisan way to actually do so.  I wish they had made a different choice. I wish their sudden calls for bipartisanship now were even somewhat serious, but this is the reality before us. We must accept it because that is where we are.  As my Republican colleagues know, this is the charge we must accept as well. The American people are looking to us for a better way. That is why, despite the headwinds, I chose to keep working toward a better solution than I have seen the pain in the eyes of too many of my constituents because of this law. I think they deserve better than what ObamaCare has given them. I hope, in the end, that a majority of the Senate will agree.  We have been continuing with ongoing conversations across the conference about how to get there. Members shared significant input over the State work period. We are going to keep working very hard on this. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals that have guided the process from the start, like improving the affordability[[Page S3891]]of health insurance and stabilizing collapsing insurance markets before they leave even more Americans without any options at all.  We also want to strengthen Medicaid for those who need it most by giving States more flexibility while ensuring that those who rely on the program don't have the rug pulled out from under them.  Many States want the ability to reform their Medicaid programs so they can actually deliver better care at a lower cost. Under current law, States have some ability to do so.

This is not working. ObamaCare is not working. This bill will bring some sanity back to the system. It will take us a couple of years, but the rates of insurance will, in fact, come down.  This business that we keep hearing that all these people are going to be without availability of insurance, it is just fake news. It is not true.

4478,topic-id,2014,"Mr.President, I want to start by thanking my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Udall, for his advocacy on behalf of the pieces and parts of our healthcare system that are so important to the State of New Things like rural hospitals, opioid treatment, Indian Country, he has been an incredible champion on those. That is part of the reason why both of us come to the floor today, given what is at stake.  Last month, President Trump and House Republicans rushed through a disastrous healthcare bill that would leave average New Mexico families paying thousands of dollars more for less healthcare coverage. It would destroy the Medicaid Program as it currently exists in our State and throw our entire healthcare system into chaos. Now Senate Republicans are drafting their own version of a similar healthcare bill in complete secret, behind closed doors, with absolutely no--none--bipartisan input.  This lack of transparency and departure from regular order is unacceptable and deeply irresponsible, especially when every single American family's healthcare coverage is at stake if this bill ever becomes law.  While we don't know for sure what the Senate Republicans' version of TrumpCare will look like, media reports say it is shaping up to look more and more like the train wreck of a bill that President Trump and House Republicans celebrated in the White House Rose Garden just a couple months ago, a bill President Trump reportedly said in another closed-door meeting with Republican Senators last week was, in his words, ``mean'' and cold-hearted.  The House-passed TrumpCare bill is devastating to low-income families, to seniors, to Americans living with preexisting conditions. This isn't so much a healthcare bill as it is a tax cut for the ultrarich masquerading as healthcare reform. You don't have to take my word for it. You can look at how the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office described its projected impacts of the House-passed TrumpCare bill.  According to the CBO's analysis, TrumpCare would strip 14 million of their health insurance next year and 23 million by 2026, all to give tax breaks to the wealthiest of That is reckless, and frankly it is inexcusable by any measure.  How would the bill do that? The House-passed bill, which again seems to be the baseline for the ongoing secret negotiations here in the Senate, would slash funding for the Medicaid Program by hundreds of billions of dollars and end the need-based tax credits for individual healthcare market plans under the  I have heard from so many New Mexicans who have told me how access to healthcare coverage has helped their families and, in some cases, even saved their lives.  I recently met with patients at the Ben Archer Health Center, a rural health clinic in Hatch, NM, and heard firsthand how important Medicaid coverage can be to families in Southern New One of the New Mexicans I met there was Anna Marie, a Las Cruces native who worked for the Las Cruces public food service for 22 years.  Anna Marie's husband passed away in 2008, and when she found herself unable to keep working following a minor stroke, she could not afford healthcare coverage on her own. When she reached out to my office last year, she had bronchitis and walking pneumonia. My staff helped her enroll in Medicaid, and now she is able to get access to the care she needs.  I want to take a moment to explain why the Medicaid Program is so critical in my home State of New As a Medicaid expansion State, New Mexico has seen dramatic gains over the last 5 years in coverage for the folks who need it the most. Stories like Anna Marie's illustrate just how important Medicaid can be for hard-working New  Medicaid currently provides affordable healthcare coverage to over 900,000 New Mexicans, including many schoolchildren, seniors in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, people with disabilities, and people who need treatment for mental health and addiction.  Just one example of the wide-ranging consequences of the Republican healthcare plan's drastic cuts to the Medicaid Program would be the end to any possible progress we have made so far in fighting the opioid and heroin epidemic. The opioid addiction epidemic has been deeply felt in communities across the State of New For years, without adequate treatment resources, our State has suffered through some of the highest rates of opioid and heroin addiction in the  I would just note that today a story came out about how we hospitalized in the ER long-term care or hospital care 1.3 million Americans last year because of this epidemic. However, when provided with an opportunity to receive comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation, people who have suffered through the trials of opioid addiction can and do turn their lives around.  Evidence-based treatment works, but it is only possible when we devote real resources to pay for it. So much of that comes directly through the Medicaid As we can see on this chart, Medicaid pays for 30 percent of opioid medication-assisted treatment in New Mexico--30 percent. It is the foundation to build on for opioid treatment.  In States like West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, Medicaid pays for nearly half of opioid treatment payments. This came up just last Friday when the White House hosted its first meeting for President Trump's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid The President's top advisers probably didn't hear what they would have liked to from the advocates who have been on the front lines of fighting the growing opioid crisis.  For example, Joe Parks, the medical director for the National Council for Behavioral Health, told the President's Commission:       Medicaid is the largest national payer for addiction and      mental health treatment. Since the majority of increased      opiate deaths and suicide occur in young and middle-aged      adults, which is the Medicaid expansion population, the      Medicaid expansions must be maintained and completed.  It is nothing short of hypocrisy for the Trump White House to claim it is taking steps to address the opioid epidemic when it is helping Republicans in Congress push through legislation that would end the Medicaid Program as we know it. Slashing hundreds of billions of dollars in Federal funding from the Medicaid Program will ultimately pass all of those costs on to the Let me give a sense for just how big a burden that would be.  In New Mexico, it is estimated that our State government would have to either come up with a way to raise $11 billion of new taxes over the next decade or cut the equivalent amount of coverage for the hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans who rely on the program. That is a hit to the State budget of 1 billion-plus dollars a year. This would have an especially hard impact on our State's rural communities.  When you go to small towns in New Mexico, like Clayton, Raton, and Santa Rosa, as I did last fall on a rural healthcare listening tour, you see right away the vital role hospitals play in rural communities. In most cases, these hospitals are the only healthcare providers for many miles in any direction.  Hospitals are also often the major employer in these small towns. Rural healthcare providers face enormous challenges because it is financially difficult to provide care to populations that live over vast spaces and are, on average, older, less affluent, and more prone to chronic diseases than those in more urban and suburban communities.  Medicaid expansion and the need-based tax credits for individual healthcare market plans in the ACA have been critical financial lifelines for rural healthcare providers. Thanks to the coverage gains we have seen in New Mexico, instead of seeing uninsured patients coming to the emergency room during expensive medical emergencies, our rural healthcare providers are able to help New Mexicans live healthier lives with primary care and a preventive medicine approach.[[Page S3630]]  When medical emergencies do arise, New Mexicans have coverage that helps rural healthcare providers cover those expenses. If President Trump and Republicans in the Senate pass their healthcare bill, all of that could go away, and some of our rural healthcare providers may very well have to close up shop.  Right now, more than one-third of rural hospitals are already at risk of closure. If you look at where the hospitals that have been forced to shut down in recent years are located, they are almost all in States that chose not to expand We should learn a lesson from that.  I know for a fact that if hospitals shut down, healthcare delivery in rural New Mexico would be decimated and economic impact would be severe in these small towns. It is estimated that when a single hospital closes in a small rural community, nearly 100 jobs are lost, taking more than $5 million directly out of the local economy.  A recent report by the Economic Policy Institute estimates that if Congress passes TrumpCare into law, New Mexico alone would see a loss of almost 50,000 jobs by the year 2022. Thanks in large part to the major coverage gains that we have seen under the ACA, the healthcare sector has been New Mexico's strongest area of job growth for the last 5 years. New Mexico added over 4,000 healthcare jobs in 2015 alone.  A couple of months ago, I met with students at Central New Mexico Community College, CNM, in Albuquerque, who were training for those healthcare jobs. These bright young people want to make careers out of making their communities healthier and safer. With this dangerous legislation moving through Washington, they are all worried about what it might mean for their future career plans.  Why would we want to rip the rug out from under them by wreaking havoc on the Nation's healthcare system? Again, you really have to ask yourself why Republicans are so intent on rushing through a massive piece of legislation before we can even understand its potential harmful consequences.  As I said earlier, I have heard from literally thousands of New Mexicans who have called in or written or come up to me on the street to oppose this legislation. Many of them have told me how it will directly impact their families. I could pick any one of these stories to demonstrate what is at stake in this debate, but I will leave you with just one.  Brittany, from Aztec, NM, wrote me about her two young children who were diagnosed with a rare form of food allergies that created absolutely unaffordable costs through her husband's employer-provided healthcare plan.  Brittany said that she and her husband were averaging three doctors' visits a week and were ``barely keeping [their] heads above water just from paying co-pays.''  After applying for Medicaid, she and her husband have full coverage for their children's medical costs. Brittany wrote to me and said:       For us Medicaid is literally lifesaving. Please do not take      away this program or any of the ACA! It may not be perfect      and could use some work, but taking it away altogether would      be catastrophic for so many people like my family.  That is what she wrote to me.  I want to urge President Trump and I certainly want to urge my Republican colleagues in the Senate to listen to that urgent message. It is time to turn the page on the disastrous policy path that is ``repeal and replace'' so we can finally get to work on actually fixing those things in the current healthcare system that we all agree need work.  Our common goal--regardless of whether we are Republicans or Democrats--that we should all be working toward is making quality healthcare more accessible, more affordable for all  I would welcome a good-faith effort to tackle that challenge because healthcare policies shouldn't be a political football. It should be about giving peace of mind to the millions of Americans like Anna Marie in Las Cruces, like Brittany in Aztec, who are only one diagnosis away from a crisis if we don't get this right.

And if you add to that additional cuts to Medicaid proposed by the President's budget, we are now north of $1 trillion of cuts to Medicaid in the next 10 years.  Who receives Medicaid? In Virginia, between 50 and 60 percent of those who receive Medicaid are children. In Virginia, 600,000 young people are Medicaid recipients.  If you go to school and you are receiving an individualized education plan because you have a designated disability, Medicaid is paying for it.  About 50 percent of childbirths in Virginia are paid for by  If you are a kid who is doing everything right, but your family is dysfunctional and a juvenile court judge has to decide whether to keep you with your family or put you in a group home, if the judge decides to send a social worker to your house 5 hours a week, Medicaid pays for that.  If you are a child with autism and you are getting services for your autism after school so you can succeed in school, Medicaid pays for that.  In Virginia, 600,000 children receive  We recently had the administration's OMB--Office of Management and Budget--Director, Mick Mulvaney, before us, and I asked him about these Medicaid cuts. These cuts are catastrophic. How can you say these cuts are a good thing? This is his quote:       We are no longer going to measure compassion by the number      of programs or the number of people on programs like      We are going to measure compassion . . . by the      number of people we get off those programs and back in charge      of their own lives.  So the philosophy that drives this is, we want to get people off Medicaid and back in charge of their own lives--600,000 kids.  I had a roundtable yesterday in Springfield, VA, here in Northern Virginia, and I had five families, parents and children, come to talk about what Medicaid cuts would mean to them.  Angie and Anna are from Haymarket, Anna is a little 5-year-old and, her mom says, typical in so many ways. She loves to play with her brothers, and she loves to play with dolls. But she has cerebral palsy and tracheal bronchial malacia and subglottic stenosis and chronic lung disease. In 2014, she developed a condition that caused her to have 30 bone breaks in 18 months.  Anna is in school. Anna is in school with a wheelchair that Medicaid pays for. Anna is in school with some home health that Medicaid pays for. Medicaid enables this child who has so many needs to actually go to school so she can be all that she can be. Her family has TRICARE through the military because the dad is in the military, but they couldn't make it without  Jen and Cailyn are from Sterling, VA, also in Northern Cailyn is about 9\1/2\. Within a week after she was born, the family knew there were some things wrong. She was finally diagnosed at age 3\1/2\ with a very rare, noninherited genetic anomaly. The family was able to get her qualified for a Medicaid waiver when she was about a year old. And this is secondary insurance. The family works and they have private insurance, but it doesn't cover a wheelchair, a hospital bed, and things that she needs to succeed. Again, this little girl who is 9\1/2\--and her mother testified that she functions on about the range of a 6-month old--she is able to go to school because Medicaid can pay for some of the technology she needs.  Kim and Isaac are from Ashburn, VA, in Loudoun Isaac is a youngster, a very active kid, but he has a tracheotomy. He is feeding-tube dependent. His family has private insurance, but they couldn't get along without He is in the Loudoun County schools succeeding because of  Dylan is another kid in Loudoun County schools. Corinne is his mother. Dylan has a rare neuromuscular disease called spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress. He has a tracheotomy tube. He relies on a ventilator to breathe. Little Dylan was at this meeting. The family has private insurance, but they couldn't succeed without Dylan is able to go to school because of  Finally, there is a family from Richmond--Amy is the mom, and the son is Declan is not in school because he is only 18 months old. He has cerebral palsy, and his medical needs are intense. With Medicaid, he is able to get some home nursing help, and he is able to get some machinery at home that helps him succeed.  These are beautiful parents, one of whom had adopted her child--first as a foster care and then adopted knowing the special needs of this child. This was Angie and These parents are the saints of the world, and these kids are fighting so hard. They are fighting so hard just to try to develop every talent they have, every capacity they have, but with Medicaid cuts, they would be in deep, deep jeopardy.  Why would we vote for a bill that slashes Medicaid to families like these when President Trump said we are not going to cut Medicaid? Why would we vote for a bill that shatters those promises, that takes health insurance away from 20 million people, that increases premiums for seniors, that subjects those with preexisting conditions to being cast in the shadows yet again? That is what this bill would do.  I had a conclusion written, but I will tell you, one of my moms yesterday gave me a better one. She gave me a better conclusion.  We had this roundtable with five families. We had some great folks from the American Academy of Pediatricians who were there, too, saying what a bad bill this would be for kids.  After the hearing was over, one of the moms looked at me and said: You know, they kind of picked the wrong group of people to fight with--talking about this bill.  I said: What you do mean by that, wrong group of people to fight with?  She said: Parents of kids with disabilities.  I said: I don't get where you are going.  And this is what she said to me: From the moment our children are born, all we do is fight. We fight so that our kids can survive. We fight so that our kids can have as normal a life as possible. We have to fight with hospitals. We have to fight with insurance companies. We have to fight with school systems. We have to fight with cultural stigmas about people with disabilities. If you are a parent of a child with a disability, from the day they are born, all you do is fight. And if they think that we are going to pass a bill to cut Medicaid to these kids and their families and that we are not going to fight about it, that we are not going to stand up and be heard, they have seriously underestimated us.  I think we can do the right thing, as my colleagues have said, if we will get together. I am on the HELP Committee, Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the only topic that has been taboo on my committee this year is health. We have had hearings about nominees. We have had hearings about the We have not been allowed to have a hearing about this health proposal--either the House bill or the Senate bill.  Let's have a hearing, listen to patients, listen to parents, listen to hospitals, listen to doctors, listen to people who are worried about their premium costs, listen to insurance companies, and listen to medical innovators. If we listen, we will get this right. But if we shut down a process, if we don't allow the public in, don't listen, don't have hearings, and rush it through, we will get it wrong.  This is the biggest sector of the American economy, and it is the most important expenditure that anybody ever makes in their life. On behalf of the 600,000 children in Virginia and the 30 million children in this country who receive Medicaid, let's get this right.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

4390,topic-id,1743,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss an issue of extraordinary importance to the people of Louisiana and to many Yet again, Americans are witnessing a dramatic, rumor-filled guessing game. I am not talking about the latest new release from Netflix, I am talking about the reauthorization of the extremely important National Flood Insurance Program--we call it the NFIP, which I can assure you has played more like an episode of ``Veep'' than ``House of Cards'' for the audience that watches it unfold every few years.  I am sorry to say, Congress has repeatedly and consistently mangled the reauthorization of this essential Federal program. In 2010, the NFIP expired four times--not once, not twice but four times, for a total of 53 days, which injected uncertainty throughout a fragile housing market that had just been devastated 2 years previously.  That was inexcusable. Local economies felt the sting of 1,400 home closing delays or cancellations per day that the program was expired. Now, along with many of the program's stakeholders and participants, I believe it is crucial that we avoid this type of congressionally imposed delay.  Congress should extend the program. Let me say that again. Congress should extend the National Flood Insurance Program for a multiyear reauthorization before the September 30 deadline of this year. Our economy demands it. Many Americans may remember when the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act was signed into law in 2012. I was not in the Senate then. I was State Treasurer in Louisiana, but I certainly remember it.  In an effort to bring the program closer to solvency after Superstorm Sandy, policyholders, as a result of Biggert-Waters, saw their premiums quickly rise to ``actuarial levels.'' For policyholders in my home State of Louisiana, this meant unaffordable levels. It doesn't do any good to offer[[Page S2662]]Americans insurance they cannot afford. That is what Biggert-Waters did, just like the Affordable Care  FEMA's mishandling of Biggert-Waters implementation resulted in truly inaccurate rate hikes that placed the viability of the entire National Flood Insurance Program at risk. I even remember the local news stations in Louisiana, like WWL and WBRZ, broadcasting horror stories of exponential rate hikes as a result of Biggert-Waters, hitting hardest in South Louisiana's middle-class neighborhoods.  Residents of Charles Parish and Lafourche Parish--in my State we call our counties parishes. We are the only one in America, only State in America, Louisiana, that does it. We do it right. Everybody else does it wrong. I remember residents of Charles Parish and Lafourche Parish sending in copies of their house keys to congressional representatives to give to FEMA because they could not afford the flood insurance.  They were required to carry it. Therefore, they were just going to turn their home over. This was a sign that the government might as well take their homes because the insurance rates were so unaffordable.  In this way, Biggert-Waters also made their homes unsalable. Going forward with the extension of the National Flood Insurance Program, we have to find a way to deal with the solvency of the NFIP that is responsible. At the same time, we cannot move the program from red to black entirely on the backs of policyholders. It just will not work.  What do we need to do? We need to examine how FEMA spends every single dollar of premiums paid by policyholders into the system--every single dollar. We need to find solutions to improve the functionality and efficiency of the National Flood Insurance Program and to ensure that those who are mandated to carry flood insurance actually purchase flood insurance.  It is clear to the policyholders in Louisiana that the NFIP has to do a better job also in one other respect. That is by giving our local officials a seat at the table. It is not written in the Constitution that flood policy and flood mapping has to originate and end with the Federal bureaucracy in Washington,  In fact, flood mapping and flood policy will benefit from having our local officials participate with a seat at the table. Our local levee boards and levee districts in Louisiana, along with the families who have lived on the land being insured for generations, know every single ditch, every single drainage canal from Tammany Parish to Terrebonne The NFIP bureaucrats ought to be asking them for guidance when rewriting flood maps and flood policy, not the other way around.  Instead, our folks only get invited to the dance after all the decisions have been made in Washington, when the cow is already out of the barn. I believe this is a commonsense principle that ought to be included in legislation to ultimately extend and reform the program: give our local officials who know the land best a seat at the table, not perfunctory, a real seat at the table, to contribute to flood mapping and flood policy. The NFIP will be better for it.  FEMA's mission, as we all know, is to lead America, to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and recover from disaster. That is why FEMA exists. The flood program is an extension of that mission. That is why, when consultants who work for FEMA--I am talking about contractors, I am talking about engineers, I am talking about lawyers, consultants who spend taxpayer money and are paid with taxpayer money working for FEMA, both contractors and subcontractors, if you wish to call them that, with the National Flood Insurance Program's Write Your Own Program, lose focus sometimes in helping flood victims.  Let me say that again. We spend millions of taxpayer dollars through the National Flood Insurance Program paying consultants, contractors, lawyers, engineers to help administer the program and adjust claims. When it works, it is a beautiful thing. When it doesn't work, it is an unmitigated disaster and is unfair to every taxpayer who put up his or her hard-earned money and every policyholder of the National Flood Insurance On occasions it has not worked.  The vast majority of consultants do a fine job, but some don't. Those who have abused the program should be fired. That is why I am introducing a bill. It is called the National Flood Insurance Program Consultant Accountability It is real simple. It will give the FEMA Administrator the authority to fire any consultant, contractor, lawyer, engineer, whomever, who engage in conduct detrimental to the mission of the National Flood Insurance  The bill will be fair. It will have an appeals process to ensure that good consultants are not penalized for being falsely accused, but this is a simple, commonsense reform that frankly should have been put in place years ago. If a consultant commits activity that in the opinion of the FEMA Administrator is detrimental to a program--for example, if he falsifies an engineering report that shows flooding caused the insured's damage, if he falsifies a report to say it didn't cause damage--then that consultant should be fired. This bill is going to give the FEMA Administrator the authority to do it.  I believe the proper tools are not in place to hold government accountants accountable and to throw out bad actors. They are just not. During the Sandy recovery, major media reports claimed several firms actually altered engineering reports tied to flood insurance claims. The altered reports--engineering reports that originally said a flood caused the insured's damage and therefore the insured should be paid, those engineering reports were altered to say flooding did not contribute to the damage.  These altered reports--intentionally altered--cost families the insurance payments they deserved and delayed their recovery. These were Americans who did the right thing. They bought flood insurance, and because of some consultants working for the NFIP, they were not allowed, at least initially, to recover. Only one engineering company was actually convicted of wrongdoing, but a number participated. Many of those who participated in this tomfoolery are still participating in the program and are still receiving taxpayer funding to contract with  On March 14, the head of FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, Mr.Roy Wright, testified before the Banking Committee, on which I sit. He has testified that he can only fire contractors from participating in the National Flood Insurance Program if they are debarred, disbarred, or criminally convicted. He can't just pick up the phone and correct the situation.  If he sees a consultant misbehaving, not acting in the best interest of the National Flood Insurance Program or the insured or the American taxpayer, he can't do a doggone thing about it, according to Mr.Wright's testimony, unless they are actually criminally convicted or disbarred, if they happen to be a lawyer.  This bill is going to let the FEMA Administrator do something about it. There is nothing like a good firing every now and then to shake up an organization.  The NFIP is responsible for administering insurance payouts for the 29,600 flood insurance claims--30,000 flood insurance claims--in my State submitted for the historic, ``once in a thousand years'' flood that occurred in Louisiana last August and last  FEMA and its consultants and its contractors will be aiding in paying out, I hope, more than $2.4 billion in taxpayer money. Louisiana's insured and the American taxpayers need to know that these consultants can be trusted and are highly regarded by their peers.  As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I plan to include this bill and other types of commonsense reforms during the reauthorization process of the National Flood Insurance Program, and I hope to do so on a bipartisan basis.  I encourage my colleagues not to play politics with this legislation. I encourage my colleagues not to play politics with the National Flood Insurance It is central to the success of the American economy.  Let's try to work to avoid partisan battles and develop a National Flood Insurance Program that makes sense for the policyholders and for the American taxpayer.[[Page S2663]]  I am not naive.

That is why doctors, hospitals, nurses, the mental health community, and patients have spoken out, and spoken out against this bill.

Over 30 million children receive their health care      coverage through The legislation as written[[Page H4147]]     cuts the budget, coverage, and benefits for the care for      children, many of whom have significant health care needs,      including children with disabilities.       Children's hospitals have identified several provisions in      the AHCA that create serious concerns about the bill as      passed by the House Energy and Commerce Foremost      among these concerns is that the bill would cut the health      care budget for children by converting the Medicaid program      to a per-capita cap system beginning in 2020. This limits      future funding for the states and risks significant      reductions in the Medicaid budgets providing care for over 30      million children. The current Medicaid entitlement financing      structure allows for greater certainty for children in the      Medicaid program and shifting to a capped environment risks      undermining the current health care available to children.       We are alarmed children's health care financing is not      considered and protected in the AHCA, and that children are      exposed to equal funding risk in the Congressional Budget      Office (CBO) estimates that AHCA will reduce overall Medicaid      funding by $880 billion or 25%. Medicaid is the largest payer      for children's health care in the nation and cuts of this      magnitude will have a severe negative impact on children's      health care. There are also discrete program changes      envisioned in the AHCA posing detrimental effects to      children's access to health care. Eligibility policy changes      in the bill risk reducing or delaying access to Medicaid      coverage. We are concerned by CBO's projections that Medicaid      enrollment will substantially decrease under the AHCA and the      absence of information on the impact on children specifically      suggests that additional examination of these issues is      needed.       We support maintaining Medicaid as an entitlement for      children as well as retaining essential elements of the      program. Every child in America should have access to high      quality health care and Medicaid is critical to this aim.      Research shows providing Medicaid coverage for children is a      smart investment for the nation, resulting in better health      outcomes for children into their adult lives and bringing      long-term returns for the country.       Children's hospitals cannot support any bill that does not      safeguard funding, coverage and benefits for children. With      respect to the AHCA, we call on lawmakers to protect kids and      recommend, at a minimum, the following:       We must not cut funding for children's care under a per      capita cap. Children are already funded at the lowest per      beneficiary levels, and ensuring sufficient funding for      children's health care into the future is absolutely      essential. Accomplishing this under the current proposal      requires clear identification of spending for all children,      including those eligible based on disability, and exempting      funds spent on children from a ``claw back'' on any spending      that exceeds per capita cap target expenditures. We believe      spending on all children should be protected from recoupment      in the following year. This is critical to ensuring states do      not have incentives to restrict children's access to      medically necessary care.       Ensure all funding for children, including blind and      disabled children, is clearly identified. Accurate      information on Medicaid spending is vital to evaluating the      program's effectiveness for children and holding states      accountable for the delivery of services. We believe all      children, including blind and disabled children, should be      included in a single children's 1903A enrollee category and      the per capita cap for children should be adjusted      accordingly to reflect the higher expenses of children with      disabilities. Children are a separate and distinct population      from adults. Funding dedicated to children must be      identifiable, allowing for an accurate picture of the federal      and state investment in kids. This is an important part of      ensuring accountability and the availability of sufficient      resources to address children's health care needs. We believe      it is important to consider protections preventing diversion      of resources specifically intended for children. As we work      with state governments to innovate and improve care delivery,      the nation's pediatric providers are in a better position to      help states achieve their goals if all kids are in a common      eligibility category.       Continue requirements that all children receive pediatric-     specific benefits providing medically necessary care      determined by their physicians. The current Medicaid      structure includes important protections for all children and      ensures they have access to medically-necessary care. It is      essential that Congress includes language guaranteeing      continued access to pediatric-specific services provided      under the Early and Periodic Screening Diagnostic and      Treatment (EPSDT) benefit.       Maintain Medicaid coverage levels for children and protect      them from potential loss of coverage or delays in      eligibility. Changes to eligibility, such as ending      hospitals' ability to make presumptive eligibility      determinations, limiting retroactive coverage, or reducing      children's Medicaid mandatory eligibility levels, directly      risk children's coverage and should not be included.       Remove the provision in the bill eliminating hospital      presumptive eligibility authority. Hospital presumptive      eligibility authority allows hospitals to temporarily enroll      children, pregnant women, and other individuals in Medicaid      until their full enrollment determination can be made. This      means earlier access to needed care for Medicaid eligible      children.       Remove the provision in the bill repealing the ability of      states to provide retroactive eligibility up to three months      prior to the month of application, as allowed under current      law. Ensuring retroactive coverage of benefits under Medicaid      is very important for children, especially children with      complex medical conditions. Without this provision, it will      be challenging for families who incur high levels of expense      prior to their Medicaid-eligible child being enrolled in the      program.       Remove the provision in the bill reducing mandatory      eligibility levels for children age 6-18 from 133 percent of      federal poverty level (FPL) to 100 percent of All other      children are required to be covered by Medicaid up to 133      percent of the       Thank you again for the opportunity to provide comment on      this legislation.

Their mountains are a tad higher than ours, but both my wife and I love hiking in the mountains, and I have enjoyed his                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, for the last 7 years, we have heard Republicans in Congress campaign on the pledge to repeal the Affordable Care For 7 years they have said: We are going to repeal it and replace it. State to State, district to district, like President Trump, they pledged to repeal and replace the health reform bill that made access to affordable healthcare a reality for millions of  One would think--and what I get asked in Vermont is--when they campaigned for 7 years that they were going to repeal and replace it as soon as they were in power, you would think they would have a plan to do that. But it seems there is no plan. Instead, there are a dozen or so Republican lawmakers meeting behind closed doors. And they are shielded from public view. I don't think any other Members of Congress are allowed in their presence--lobbyists, but no Members of They say they have negotiated, finally, a grand plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act--and oh, by the way, a plan that makes devastating cuts to the Medicaid And they have done this with no hearings, no debate, no process, no showing what the cost would be, and no bill. They are keeping a tight lid on the decisions they are making for the rest of What I get asked back home in Vermont is: What are they so afraid of? We are about to find out.  We hear they still intend to bring this yet-to-be-finalized bill to the Senate floor very soon under the expedited reconciliation process, without even the most basic vetting and transparency. Not only is this latest TrumpCare plan that is about to be foisted on the American people and on the Senate not ready for prime time; it is not fit for prime time. It is really nothing short of shameful.  Certainly, in my decades here in the Senate, I have never seen anything by either Republican or Democratic majorities done like this. In fact, I will give you an idea of how it can be done differently.  When the Democrats were in control, before we passed the Affordable Care Act, the Senate held over 100 hearings on the issue. Republicans haven't held one. We had over 100 hearings. We had roundtables on health reform. Hundreds of amendments were considered by the Senate Finance and HELP Committees during an exhaustive markup process, with 160 amendments by Republican Senators adopted. The process itself stretched for so long--more than a year--in the vain hope that Republicans would come to the table and stay at the table. In fact, the final Senate bill included more than 145 Republican-authored amendments, and it was posted for every single person in America to see for nearly a week before the Finance Committee marked it up. The same can be said for the HELP Then, more than 160 hours were spent on this Senate floor in considering the Affordable Care Everybody had an opportunity to speak on it. That is when the Democrats controlled the  What is happening with the Republicans? Will they have 100 hearings? No, they have not had one single hearing, and they are not having any debate and not having any process. We don't even know what this is going to cost. And as of right now, there is no bill.  In the House and now in the Senate, this charade boils down to bumper sticker politics. It is not a solid, seriously vetted, workable, fair and equitable plan or policy. Let's see what happens when you do it this way.  After this bill passed in the House--a bill that no one had read--even the Secretary admitted he hadn't read it. After it passed and people had a chance to see what was in it, what did we find out? That 23 million Americans were going to lose coverage. And then the President proposed a budget that assumes savings from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act through big, big cuts to the Medicaid  Under the House-passed TrumpCare bill, the State of Vermont will spend hundreds of millions more on Medicaid to compensate for the loss of Federal funds targeted by President Trump and the House Under the House-passed TrumpCare bill, premiums are expected to rise by 20 percent. Seniors--many of whom live on fixed incomes--will be charged five times more than younger enrollees under the House-passed TrumpCare bill. Well, that translates north of $4,400 in increased healthcare costs for Vermonters between the ages of 55 and 64.  Notwithstanding the millions of people being thrown off the list, notwithstanding the cuts to Medicaid, President Trump joined Republicans at the White House, and he celebrated the House-passed bill. He celebrated. He said: Look what we can do with me as They all applauded, and they were all so happy.  Then somebody must have finally read the bill. Somebody at the White House must have read the bill and actually told the President what was in the bill that he was praising. And then,[[Page S3625]]in a sudden about-face, he described the House-passed bill as ``mean.'' ``Mean'' is what President Trump said of the House GOP healthcare plan.  Some back home may find it a surprise that I could be in agreement with President Trump, but do you know what? President Trump is right. I am saying it right here on the floor: President Trump is right. The House-passed bill that he praised is mean. It is mean because it would do so much harm to so many  It is untenable. It is unrealistic. And if Senate Republicans think they can fix it behind closed doors, they are wrong. We should be working together, Republicans and Democrats--together--to improve the Affordable Care If there are parts where it is flawed, let's fix it. If there are parts where it could be improved, let's join together and strengthen it. Let's not double down on Americans at a time when their President is turning his back on the very programs that support our social safety net. Women and children and low-income Americans and small businesses alike are all going to suffer under his plans.  We 100, as representatives of our constituents--I think we have a responsibility to give voice to their concerns. We 100 Senators are elected to represent 350 million We are supposed to be the conscience of the Maybe it is time that each one of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, started listening to what Americans say about healthcare.  A family physician from Manchester, VT, wrote to me saying: ``I do not support efforts to roll back or eliminate the patient-centered insurance reforms established in recent years that prohibit discrimination against patients due to their race, gender, health status, or geographic location. These reforms matter to the everyday lives of our patients.''  Someone from Brattleboro, VT, wrote: ``I am writing to ask what I can do to help stop Medicaid from being changed to the system being promoted by the Republican majority.''  From Jericho, VT: ``I had Hodgkin's lymphoma 3 years ago and was fortunate to have insurance to cover most of the roughly $100,000 bill. Having had cancer is stressful enough without constantly worrying about severe financial consequences if it strikes again.''  From Bennington, VT: ``Being patient-centered means we put the patient first. As a physician and advocate for my patients, I do not want any of them to be hurt by the actions Congress takes or fails to take.''  And then from Manchester Center, VT: ``I will be one of the [20 million] people to lose their health insurance when the Trump administration almost certainly repeals the ACA in a few months. Tax credits will not help me to regain it.''  And from the small town of Sandgate, VT: ``My son has a chronic illness that, without our insurance, would cost $1,000 per month in prescriptions alone. That doesn't even cover the regular checkups. Right now he is covered, but, as I'm sure you remember from when you first got out of college or high school, we know that he may not have as good coverage when he gets out on his own. The Republican plan is a death sentence for him.''  The Republican plan is a death sentence for him.  These are real people. These are real stories about their lives, and I am willing to guess that there are similar people in virtually every State in this country with more stories like these.  This isn't a political campaign. This is about life and death and access to healthcare. For these Vermonters and for millions of Americans across the country, the decisions we make here will have consequences--real consequences in their lives. Every Senator should think about that before we hastily undo years of progress to increase affordable access to healthcare for millions of  The Republican majority, led on, cheered on by President Trump, passed a bill which would take so many millions of people off of healthcare. It would devastate It would make it so much more difficult for people to get healthcare. Then the bill they fought so hard to pass, the bill they cheered on, the bill they celebrated in the Rose Garden with President Trump, finally, somebody read what they passed. What a novel idea. They had all voted on it. They had all gone home. The President had praised them. I remember the pictures of them beaming in the praise of the Well, somebody finally read the bill and told the President, and he said that bill is ``mean.'' The House GOP healthcare plan--that bill is ``mean.''  Well, I agree with President Trump, but you know what they are pushing now--he and his administration--the Senate bill; yet nobody has seen the Senate bill. Nobody knows how many people are being cut off the roll. Nobody knows how many people are going to be without healthcare. Nobody knows how large the cuts will be to Nobody knows how much our 50 States are going to be hurt by it. Nobody knows which millions of Americans--good, hard-working, honest Americans--are going to lose healthcare in the wealthiest, most powerful Nation on  Will that be celebrated? Then, after it is passed, will somebody at the White House whisper to the President: The Senate bill is pretty mean, too. The Senate bill is pretty mean, but by golly, we got it passed.

4572,topic-id,1107,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to express my opposition to this morally bankrupt bill, and I include in the Record a letter of opposition from the National Rural Health              [From the National Rural Health Association]                Vote NO to the American Health Care Act       The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on      the American Health Care Act (AHCA).       Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other      populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced      that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and      the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural The      AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural      America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more      uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure      crisis.       Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill improve      the base bill, NRHA is concerned that the bill still falls      woefully short in making health care affordable and      accessible to rural For example, the modified bill      contains a decrease in the Medical Expense Deduction      threshold from 10% to 5.8% in an attempt to assist Americans      between the ages of 50 and 64 who would see their premiums      skyrocket under the current plan. However, this deduction is      not a credit and therefore would be of little use to low      income seniors that are in very low tax brackets or do not      pay income tax at all. Additionally, the new amendments to      freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of 1, 2018, and      reduce the Medicaid per-capita growth rate will      disproportionately harm rural       The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural      Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved      populations in our nation without coverage, and further      escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to      the Wall Street Journal, the ``GOP health plan would hit      rural areas hard.[[Page H4145]]     . . . Poor, older Americans would see the largest increase in      insurance-coverage costs.'' The LA Times reports ``Americans      who swept President Trump to victory--lower-income, older      voters in conservative, rural parts of the country--stand to      lose the most in federal healthcare aid under a Republican      plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.'' Let's      be clear--many provisions in the ACA failed rural      The lack of plan competition in rural markets, exorbitant      premiums, deductibles and co-pays, the co-op collapses, lack      of Medicaid expansion, and devastating Medicare cuts to rural      providers--all collided to create a health care crisis in      rural However, it's beyond frustrating that an      opportunity to fix these problems is squandered, and instead,      a greater health care crisis will be created in rural            Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural      health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect      it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain      access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America      are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to      protect rural patients' access to care. Three improvements      are critical for rural patients and providers:       1. Medicaid--Though most rural residents are in non-     expansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are      covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%).       Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is      different and thus requires different programs to succeed.      Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not      `bonus' payments, but rather alternative, cost-effective and      targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for      millions of rural patients and financial stability for      thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal      health care reform must protect a state's ability to protect      its rural safety net providers. The federal government must      not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities      to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to      care.       Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access      to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a      state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a      matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to      create stability among rural providers to maintain access to      care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent      to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers,      a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is      provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued      access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not      limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective      Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian Health      Service providers, and individual rural providers.       2. Market Reform--Forty-one percent of rural marketplace      enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing      70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack      of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums.      Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34      for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan).       Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes,      cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to      participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking,      poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural      Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and      less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance.      Rural communities have fewer health care providers for      insurers to contract, with to provide an adequate network to      serve the community.       Any federal health care reform proposal must address the      fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural      markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies      are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for      participation and are currently not obliged to provide      service to markets with less advantageous risk pools.      Demographic realities of the rural population make the market      less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance      company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the      same way that financial service institutions are required to      provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable      insurance companies should be required to provide services in      underserved communities.       3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals--Rural hospitals      serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban),      thus across-the-board Medicare cuts do not have across the      board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad      debt decrease significantly.       However, because of unaffordable health plans in rural      areas, rural patients still cannot afford health care. Bad      debt among rural hospitals has actually increased 50% since      the ACA was passed. According to MedPAC ``Average Medicare      margins are negative, and under current law they are expected      to decline in 2016'' has led to 7% gains in median profit      margins for urban providers while rural providers have      experienced a median loss of 6%.       If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to      protect rural patients' access to care, could rapidly be      undone. The National Rural Health Association implores      Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the      nation.

4412,topic-id,1358,"Mr.President, let's revisit recent history. Four weeks ago,[[Page S3900]]my Republican colleagues were meeting secretly in this building, in a hallway that the press was not allowed in because they didn't want to have the press see them sneaking in and sneaking out of this completely undemocratic process--13 Republican men crafting a healthcare plan to destroy healthcare for 22 million That is where we were 4 weeks ago.  We made a big deal out of the fact that is not the way a Congress is supposed to operate. You are supposed to have committee hearings. You are supposed to have committee debate and invite experts in. You are supposed to have time to consult with your constituents back home, but none of that was happening. No, we had the Republican zero-zero-zero process: Zero committee meetings. How does that compare to more than 100 committee meetings and roundtables and walkthroughs from 8 years ago? Zero committee amendments. How does that compare to more than 400 amendments that were considered 8 years ago and more than 100 minority amendments, Republican amendments, that were adopted in this process? Zero exposure of the bill to the folks back home and to the healthcare stakeholders.  Then, 2 weeks ago, we had a draft, and we had a chance to circulate that draft and get a few folks from home to weigh in on what it looked like. We received a CBO analysis. Yes, it looked a lot like the House bill. The House bill was going to eliminate 14 million healthcare policies in a year, and the Senate was going to best that by eliminating healthcare for 15 million Americans and 22 million Americans over a 10-year period.  The President had called the House bill mean, but we had the even meaner Senate bill. Fortunately, we were able to create such a fuss that the majority leader canceled the vote--the vote that was going to take place with the zero committee hearings and zero amendments and that would give my colleagues the opportunity to go home and talk to their constituents. But what happened?  Well, in the course of this entire year, two-thirds of my Republican colleagues haven't held a single townhall, and last week, when they had a full opportunity to finally take their secret 13 bill--zero-zero-zero bill--and ask their constituents what they thought, they didn't hold townhalls. By best count, 2 Senators across the aisle held a townhall out of 52.  Why are my colleagues so terrified of their constituents? Is it because wiping out health insurance for struggling Americans is a travesty? Is it because wiping out healthcare for working Americans is a crime--a crime against decency? Is it because their bill proceeds to give $33 billion to the richest 400 Americans? No, that is not $33,000 or $33 million, that is $33 billion to the richest 400 Americans--more than several hundred billion dollars to the richest Americans overall. You know, the money they want to give to the top 400 richest Americans would fund healthcare for more than 700,000 Americans under  Well, I went home. I went to a lot of places. I went to three cities in what you might call blue I went to 13 towns in what can clearly be called red Oregon--predominantly Republican I went to towns like Echo and Helix; Adams and Athena; Weston and Sumpter; Granite and Greenhorn, with 37 individuals; and Adams, with a population of 348. I went to larger towns like North Powder and Wallowa; and Baker City, Burns and  In six of those Republican towns, I held full townhalls, and what did I hear? I heard that the top concern was healthcare because constituents in red America across this country are terrified of the secret 13's bill and all that it involves. What would it do in my home State? Well, 400,000 Oregonians under the Oregon Health Plan would lose their care. At least another 100,000 would lose their care because of the changes in the way the exchange operates. They kind of put their minds to work at what the picture looks like from the draft the Republicans were willing to circulate after we applied extensive pressure. And what did we hear? Well, we heard that they are very concerned about extinguishing the expansion of Those are folks who are working hard but struggling, often in multiple part-time jobs.  We heard about the fact that Medicaid pays for more than two out of three individuals on long-term care in rural In fact, I went to one nursing home and asked: Does Medicaid--Oregon Health Plan--pay for two-thirds of your residents?  They said: No, Here in Klamath Falls, it is nearly 100 percent.  Realize that an individual who is getting paid-for, long-term care under Medicaid has to have assets of less than $2,000. So there is no backup plan. You wipe out healthcare for those 400,000 individuals who are on expanded Medicaid, many of whom are in long-term care, and they have no backup plan.  One woman, Debra, said to me: Senator, I am paid for by Medicaid, and if they cut Medicaid, I will be out on the street. That will be a problem because I can't walk.  That is right, Debra, you are in trouble, and so is every other individual who is funded through Medicaid for long-term care.  What about maternity care? One out of three individuals in rural Oregon and rural America who is preparing to have a baby is funded through Children and the disabled are funded through  What do we get as an alternative now that the Republicans are back, having ducked their constituents? They want a new plan to offer? Well, they are talking about the Cruz plan. Now, this is interesting. It is a plan that says an insurance company can offer policies that cover nothing as long as they have at least one policy that covers quite a bit, which means the young and the healthy buy the policy that covers almost nothing, and then the policy that covers quite a bit that older Americans and those with preexisting conditions need becomes incredibly expensive because the group in that pool are people with lots of healthcare problems, and it creates a death spiral in insurance.  Well, at the one end of the spectrum, you have a death spiral for insurance policies that cover a lot; at the other end of the spectrum, you have fake insurance because it covers virtually nothing. Oh, maybe it only costs $50 a month. Oh, isn't that wonderful--until you find out it doesn't cover a day in the hospital; doesn't cover a trip to the emergency room; doesn't cover maternity care; doesn't cover drugs. In fact, it doesn't cover anything.  Why is it that a President who is so concerned about fake news is so interested in supporting fake insurance?  My constituents back home told me a lot of stories. These are stories that I hope to share in the next couple of days, but right now, I think it is important that we hear from my colleague from Virginia, Senator Tim Kaine, because he has also been looking in detail at this bill. He also understands what a devastating consequence TrumpCare will have for American healthcare.  Can't we come together with a better vision? Can't we come together and make the marketplace work better, restore the reinsurance that has ripped apart the ability of insurance companies to go into new markets? Can't we restore the cost-sharing payments that buy down the premiums, in fact improve them, so there are lower premiums and lower deductibles? Can't we come together and do a better job of funding opioid treatment? Can't we come together and take on the high costs of drugs in general, which is driving costs in the healthcare system? Just those four things would be something very positive to make our current healthcare system even better.  Let's work together to make healthcare here in the United States of America even better, not tear it down and destroy it, as is being proposed by my Republican colleagues.

4475,topic-id,2569,"Mr.President, I have come to the floor this afternoon to mark the 40th anniversary of the first oil moving through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline In Alaska, we call it This is an 800-mile-long engineering marvel that runs from the North Slope of Alaska to tidewater in  Forty years is a good, long history. I recognize that, and so this afternoon, in the interest of time, I will abbreviate the history, but I want to start the story of our pipeline in the late 1960s. Believe it or not, this was a pretty bleak moment for oil exploration in Despite great promise, many companies had given up on exploration on the North By some accounts, at that point in time, there were at least 14 dry holes that had been drilled before ARCO and Humble Oil Company decided they were going to sink just one last well. It was actually an ARCO executive who described it ``more as a decision not to cancel a well already scheduled to go ahead.''  That well, Prudhoe Bay State 1, would prove to be a game changer for We had discovered oil. We discovered oil on the North Slope and a lot of it. We quickly learned that Prudhoe Bay would be one of the largest oilfields in global history, by far the largest ever discovered in the United Early estimates, at that time, suggested as much as 9 billion barrels of oil could be recovered from it. We have learned over these intervening 40 years that we so far underestimated that.[[Page S3626]]  Yet it was not just the issue of discovering the oil. Prudhoe Bay is located in a very remote part of the State, as far north as you can go--a pretty inhospitable area given the climate--far away from population centers in the lower 48. So a lot of challenges needed to be overcome before production could begin.  Initially, it was like, OK, how do we move significant quantities of oil? How do we transport this oil to market? It was Dan Yergin, in his book ``The Prize,'' who did a great job of describing the various choices that were out there.  He wrote: ``Icebreaker tankers that would travel through the frozen Arctic seas to the Atlantic were seriously considered. Other suggestions included a monorail or fleet of trucks in permanent circulation on an eight-lane highway across Alaska.''  They then ``calculated that it would require most of the trucks in America'' to do this. There was also ``a prominent nuclear physicist recommended a fleet of nuclear-powered submarine tankers that would travel under the polar ice cap to a deepwater port in Greenland--the port to be created, in turn, by a nuclear explosion. Boeing and Lockheed explored the idea of jumbo jet oil tankers.''  Obviously, none of those ideas came about, and some probably for very good reason, but after significant study and debate, a pipeline emerged as the best way to transport Alaska's oil. While two routes were considered--one over land, which would run across Canada--an all-Alaska route was ultimately chosen as the best way to go.  Yet, even then, pipeline construction could not begin right away. There were serious debates in the State over issues like taxes and tariffs and pipeline ownership, and it really consumed our State's legislature for years. The land claims of the Alaska Natives needed to be settled. This occurred in the landmark legislation that passed in 1971.  Then it was in 1973 that Congress took up the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization As part of that debate here on the Senate floor, Alaska's Senators offered an amendment to deem the environmental impact statement for the pipeline to be sufficient and to shield it from what could have been decades of litigation by its opponents. This was a critically important aspect to the debate and really to the future of the pipeline in order to ensure that this construction would not be delayed by litigation.  The vote was as close as votes get here in the It was deadlocked 49 to 49, and sitting in that chair, the Vice President at the time, Spiro Agnew, cast the deciding vote in Alaska's favor. So every time I see the bust out here of Vice President Agnew, I look at him. Other people reflect on Vice President Agnew in different ways. I reflect on that deciding vote that allowed us to proceed with our Trans-Alaska  The pipeline bill went on to pass the Senate on a strong bipartisan basis. Not long after that, then-President Richard Nixon signed it into law. This was tremendous news for Alaska because we would be allowed to move forward with the construction.  The construction of this pipeline was a monumental undertaking, but that monumental undertaking was also done with considerable speed. In April of 1974, construction on a 360-mile haul road began. We now call it the Dalton It was finished in 154 days.  For those of you who have heard my plea on the floor and to colleagues who have been in committees when I have talked about the history of my efforts to try to get a 10-mile, one-lane, gravel, noncommercial-use road for the people of King Cove, I think about what we were able to accomplish in 154 days with that haul road that allowed us to then help to facilitate the buildout of the pipeline.  The pipeline itself was the largest privately funded infrastructure project ever undertaken in America at the time. It was significant. It was significant for Alaska, of course, but it was significant for the Nation as well. Its total cost came to be about $8 billion. In October of 1975, there were about 28,000 people who were working to make this pipeline a reality, and that pipeline was completed in 1977. Again, initial construction of the haul road began in 1974. It was completed in October 1977, which was just 3 years and 2 months after construction began. I am told it was actually 10 days ahead of schedule, according to one estimate, which is pretty remarkable.  The Trans-Alaska Pipeline--and I cannot find a picture that really shows the line well--an extraordinary line, which again, is 800 miles long, running from the North Slope to an ice-free Port of Valdez at tidewater. It crosses three mountain ranges, including Atigun Pass, which has an elevation of more than 4,800 feet. It reaches a grade of 55 degrees at one point in the Chugach So it goes up incredible mountains and down the other side. It crosses more than 600 streams and rivers, and more than 400 miles of it are elevated above the ground.  We have it elevated aboveground here, but in certain areas, you can follow the pipeline either by air, or occasionally, you can see it from the road. It is probably one of the most photographed pipelines in the country, but you will see it go underground in many areas. About half of it is buried underground.  This was part of the engineering that allowed for the recognition that you are building in a permafrost area, so it is how you ensure that you are not having an impact in the ground and the area around it.  It crosses a major fault line, the Denali Back in November of 2002, we had a 7.9 magnitude earthquake just about 90 miles from Fairbanks on that Denali The pipe moved 7\1/2\ feet horizontally--moving back and forth this way--and 2\1/2\ feet vertically. This pipeline was designed for an 8.5 earthquake. It allows for 20 feet of horizontal movement and 5 feet of vertical movement.  The engineers not only worked to cross some extraordinary terrain but also recognized that this was in an area in which earthquakes did happen. It is extraordinary to listen to the stories of the engineers who inspected every inch of that line after that earthquake in 2002 and to hear their comments about, truly, this engineering marvel.  There are so many stories about the construction of the pipeline just as Alaskans, as we have lived through those pipeline years. It is hard to really capture what it was like to be in Alaska during the time of the construction of that line. We saw our population boom as we saw new workers come into the I was living in Fairbanks at the time. I was a high school student and was going into college there. Obviously, that was my town. In my town, all of a sudden there were people from Louisiana, Texas, and I can remember seeing guys in cowboy boots in Fairbanks in the winter on the ice and thinking that these guys are going to figure out how to change their footwear. But we worked to welcome these people who were there to really help make a difference.  There were pressures on our community. You could not find a hotel room. You couldn't find a rental car. It was hard for the grocery stores to keep the shelves stocked in many of the towns. We saw a significant investment in our communities in many different ways. There were a lot of wild stories and tales, some which are appropriate to tell years afterward, some which still keep us smiling, but we do not talk too much about them. There are many good stories out there.  I am proud of this extraordinary infrastructure that we have in Alaska--an extraordinary energy asset--and to be celebrating the fact that, for 40 years now, this pipeline has been not only contributing to Alaska, but contributing to the Nation as something that, as Alaskans, we do look to with pride.  This pipeline is not just a piece of pipe; it is an economic lifeline for the State of Over the course of 40 years, TAPS has become the veritable backbone of our State's economy. It has helped us create jobs to the point at which our oil and gas industry either employs or supports fully one-third of the Alaskan workforce. So it is pretty significant in terms of its impact.  It has generated tremendous revenue for our State, some $168 billion at last count, which has been used for everything from roads, to schools, to essential services. It really has helped build the State and continues to allow our State to operate.  TAPS has allowed us to create our permanent fund, which we have used to[[Page S3627]]convert the revenues from a nonrenewable resource--oil--into something that will make an enduring contribution to the growth and the prosperity of future generations.  Our pipeline has also allowed us to keep our tax burdens low, which is critical in a State like Alaska, where the cost of living is extraordinarily high. Alaska has one of the lowest tax burdens of any State, and that is thanks to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline It also allows us to keep other industries, whether it is fishing or tourism--keep their taxes much lower than they would otherwise be. The scale of this is often hard to imagine.  Terrence Cole, who is a history professor at the University of Alaska, put it this way back in 2004: ``Prudhoe Bay oil was worth more than everything that has been dug out, cut down, caught, or killed in Alaska since the beginning of time. The discovery of the Prudhoe Bay oil field in the late 1960s fulfilled even the most optimistic dreams for statehood.''  From day one, Alaska's pipeline has also strengthened the energy security of our Remember, TAPS began operating in the wake of the first Arab oil embargo. It helped tide us over during the 1979 oil crisis. It has insulated us from OPEC and has lessened our dependence on nations who do not share our interests. It has provided reliable and affordable energy that is needed by millions of Americans all up and down the west coast. It really is hard to imagine Alaska without the Trans-Alaska It is hard to imagine the consequences that America would have faced without the 17.5 billion barrels of oil that it has now safely carried to market. Think about that--17.5 billion barrels of oil over the past 40 years. It is no exaggeration to say that, while we built a pipeline, that pipeline helped us build our  Today, as we mark the 40th anniversary of TAPS, we can also take stock of the challenges that it faces. Many are a direct result of the decisions made--or perhaps not made--in this very While our pipeline once carried 2.1 million barrels of oil per day, accounting for a full quarter of America's supply, today, that amount has been crimped down to just over 500,000 barrels a day. It is not due to lack of resources--not at all--but instead it is due to our lack of access to those resources. Alaska has never lacked for energy, just the permission to produce it, despite the promises that had been made to us at statehood and beyond.  According to the Federal Energy Information Administration, we have at least 36.9 billion barrels of oil. That is enough to produce 1 million barrels a day for the next 100 years. We have prolific potential in our National Petroleum Reserve, which was specifically set aside for oil production. We have world-class resources in our offshore areas, in the Beaufort, and in the Chukchi Seas in our Arctic Outer Continental We have what is believed to be North America's largest untapped conventional oil field, which would occupy about one ten-thousandth of the nonwilderness 1002 Area within the Arctic National Wildlife Again, this is an area that was specifically set aside for development, and the Federal Government recommended that it be opened for that purpose back in 1987--a 30-year anniversary there.  So while we have the resources, what we need are partners at the Federal level who will work with us to restore throughput to the Trans-Alaska I welcome the new administration and its commitment to helping us produce energy--energy for Alaska, energy for the  I want to end with a quote from the Fairbanks Daily News-This is an opinion piece by VADM Tom Barrett, who is the president of Alyeska Pipeline Service This is the TAPS operator. He has written this opinion piece, and he states as follows: ``Though there has been a lot of change on TAPS in 40 years, one unwavering constant remains: the commitment of the people who work on TAPS today to provide safe, reliable, operational excellence, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, resilient amid all of Alaska's extreme geography and weather.''  I think about the men and women--the engineers, the workers, the contractors, and all those who do such an incredible job to deal with the day-to-day to keep that oil flowing safely. Again, as we recognize 40 years of safely transporting this oil, I want to repeat to my colleagues: TAPS, or the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, is not just a pipeline; it is an economic lifeline for us. It is source of security and prosperity for us as a nation.  So I join my delegation and my colleagues--Senator Sullivan and Congressman Young--and all of the Alaskans who are marking this anniversary today, as TAPS reaches 40 good years. We look back, and we appreciate the past, but we also look forward and set our sights on another good 40 years to come.  Mr.President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.

4409,topic-id,1249,"Mr.President, from the moment President Trump and Republicans began trying to jam TrumpCare through Congress, I heard from family after family in my home State about the damage their efforts to undermine families' healthcare would do, and this last week was no different. Again and again, my constituents told me what a difference it makes to have affordable insurance, to know that benefits like substance abuse treatment are covered, or to worry about how they would manage if TrumpCare ever became law.  I heard some of my Republican colleagues went out of their way to avoid those kinds of stories when they were home, so I wanted to make sure they heard a few examples now that they are back in town. And I appreciate that many of my Democratic colleagues will also be sharing stories they heard from their constituents over the past few days.  Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I come from a State in which the opioid epidemic has had a devastating impact. It has been both heartbreaking and inspiring to talk with patients and families who are doing everything they can to fight back. Right now, the message I am getting from them loud and clear is that they do not want  Daniel, one of my constituents, was injured in the military. He was given a prescription for painkillers. He was on them for 8 years, and he told me that during that time, his three daughters wondered why he wouldn't play with them. Eventually, Daniel changed doctors and was prescribed Suboxone, which made all the difference for him. He is now able to work again. He manages a grocery store. He relies on Medicaid for healthcare coverage, which covers the hundreds of dollars a month his prescriptions cost. Daniel told me that if he loses Medicaid under TrumpCare, he will not be able to make ends meet and all of the progress he has made will be threatened.  I heard from a constituent named Rachel of Seattle who was addicted to opioids and living in her car when she found out she was eligible for She got connected with Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, where she received wraparound health services, including mental healthcare and primary healthcare. Now she and her husband are successfully in recovery. They are raising a family, and Rachel is going to school. But, just like Daniel, they do not know what they will do if TrumpCare becomes law and the Medicaid coverage that is keeping them going is taken away.  Those are just two of the countless stories I heard from patients and families and doctors in my home State and nationwide. I have heard from cancer survivors who have fought back as hard as they can and are worried that TrumpCare will allow insurance companies to price them out of care because they are now labeled with a preexisting condition. I heard from young parents of medically fragile children who stay up at night worrying about how to afford care for their toddler if lifetime caps on coverage are imposed under I heard from seniors who simply don't have the savings to cover the premium spikes TrumpCare would cost. I heard from women and men who are furious, and rightly so, that a group of 13 men wrote a bill in secret to defund Planned Parenthood--the Nation's largest provider of women's healthcare--removing a quality, affordable provider from communities in which it is now very difficult to get care.  These stories are powerful. They make it undeniably clear just how much TrumpCare would hurt people. So it is no wonder that Senate Republicans spent the last week lying low and avoiding defending, oddly, the indefensible. Senate Republicans have read the same independent Congressional Budget Office analysis as we all have. They have heard from countless doctors and nurses and hospitals and nursing homes and patient advocates about all of the ways TrumpCare would raise families' costs and take away coverage. They know that people across the country are completely, resoundingly rejecting It is the least popular bill in three decades, according to one study.  All in all, TrumpCare shatters every promise President Trump and Republicans made about providing insurance to everybody and making sure no one is worse off. And, incredibly, the extreme rightwing still thinks it leaves too much of the Affordable Care Act intact.  Even though it seems one would be hard-pressed to find anyone who wants to stick up for TrumpCare--including, by the way, President Trump--Senate Republican leaders are still doing everything they can to jam this through Congress as quickly as they can. They are working on backroom deals as we speak and coming up with new ways to sweeten the deal for Senate Republicans who are rightly wary of voting for a bill that would so clearly do so much harm.  In particular, this afternoon I wanted to address the ongoing effort by extreme conservative Senators to double[[Page S3897]]down on pulling the rug out from under patients with preexisting conditions. They put together this two-track plan to make middle-class workers and families pay more. If they get their way, insurance companies would be back in charge and could tell patients with preexisting conditions or anyone who happens to get sick in the middle of the year ``tough luck,'' and they will do that in a way that even conservative experts predict will cause premiums and deductibles to skyrocket. Senate Republicans are coming up with other ideas, too, such as an opioid fund that a Republican Governor said is like ``spitting in the ocean.''  Let me be clear. There is no ``fixing'' No tweak around the edges is going to turn TrumpCare--which, by the way, is just a tax break for special interests and the healthcare industry on the backs of patients--into a healthcare bill that actually helps people. There is just no way. TrumpCare, as the President said, is mean at its core, and unless it is dropped altogether, Senate Republicans are going to have to decide whether they stand with their party or the people they came here to represent.  So to everyone out there who has called and written and rallied and tweeted, you are having an impact. You are why TrumpCare isn't already law. But you cannot give up now, and Democrats here in the Senate won't either. We are going to keep doing everything we can to make sure Senate Republicans can't hold their noses and vote for TrumpCare just to hand big corporations a tax break and President Trump a hollow political win, whether it is next week or the weeks into  I also want to remind my Senate Republican colleagues again that we have made clear all along the way that there is a better way to do this. Democrats are ready. We are willing to work with you on policies that make healthcare more affordable and workable for patients and families.  So I am here today to say I hope you all listen to the stories our Democratic colleagues are bringing to the floor. Think about how devastating TrumpCare would be, and do the right thing. Drop this mean bill once and for all so all of us can get to work on real healthcare solutions that actually help people afford care, get covered, and stay healthy. If you do, you won't have to defend this defenseless bill a minute longer.  Thank you. I yield the floor.

4438,topic-id,458,"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, thousands of New Yorkers and other Americans learned that they were ineligible for FEMA assistance because of the type of home in which they lived. Families who lived in condos were eligible for assistance for their individual units, but could not get any assistance to repair ground floor entryways, boilers, or other common areas. Those who lived in cooperative housing, or co-ops, were ineligible for any disaster assistance to repair the walls or floors of their units, let alone their common areas.  This was not a small problem for my constituents. In the storm surge area in New York, nearly 20 percent of housing units are in co-op buildings and an additional 8 percent are in condominiums.  Seniors in high-rise condo buildings were able to get assistance to repair their floors and repaint their floors, but nothing to fix the elevators they needed to reach their units. Families in co-ops could replace their furnishings and make some repairs, but the halls of the buildings remained covered with mold and uninhabitable. Almost every district in the country has condos, and homeowners in these condo communities will continue to face the same terrible realization that FEMA can give them no help in the wake of new disasters.  Community associations, or common interest communities, around the country have experienced similar roadblocks when they seek FEMA disaster assistance. Many of these associations own and operate their own roads, canals, bridges, and water systems. In the aftermath of a disaster, however, they are not eligible for FEMA assistance for basic essential government services, such as removing trees and debris from communal roads. Residents cannot get out of their neighborhoods and emergency vehicles cannot get in.  This bill would address these eligibility problems in two ways:  First, it would direct FEMA to provide common interest communities with technical assistance to identify options for public assistance eligibility. Many of these communities are unaware that they could already be eligible for assistance if, prior to a disaster, they entered into agreements with their local governments on issues like debris removal.  Second, my colleagues and I have communicated several times with FEMA about the issue of condo and co-op eligibility for disaster assistance. FEMA has studied this issue for several years, and this bill directs FEMA to take the next step in this process by providing the House and Senate committees legislative proposals to address these issues and to make condos and co-ops eligible for disaster assistance.  Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor today, and I thank Mr.Sanford and Mr.Engel for cosponsoring it.

4406,topic-id,2868,"Mr.President, I want to speak on behalf of a group of Floridians I have met with who would be tremendously hard-hit by the healthcare bill, whether it be the one that has already been published by the majority leader or some of the iterations that are being discussed.  I want to talk on behalf of and be the spokesperson for these people who have cried out to me. I want to say that people are crying out. It is not just the group of four families I assembled in my Tampa office last week, but it also includes walking down the street, being in an airport, or going into a public building. Constantly, folks are walking up to me and saying: Please, don't let them take away my healthcare.  Just this past week, I was in--it shall remain nameless--a Republican Senator's It happened in the airport there as my colleague, the Republican Senator in that State other than mine--the travelers, the constituents of that Senator in the airport as we were waiting for the airplane walked up to that Republican Senator and begged: Please don't take away my healthcare.  What we have seen in this Republican bill is that it takes health insurance away from millions of That is not my conclusion; that is the conclusion of the Congressional Budget According to CBO, it also cuts back some $800 billion out of Medicaid over a decade, and it allows insurance companies to hike rates for older  Under the bill, 22 million people would lose their insurance by 2026. Over 2 million of these folks are in In fact, the bill would increase the uninsured rate in Florida by 62 percent. That is not what I want inflicted on the folks in  This bill lets insurance companies go back to the days when they had annual and lifetime limits on coverage and refused to cover basic health benefits, such as prescription drugs, mental health services, and even maternity care. This Republican healthcare bill, which has been so much the subject in the news and the center of the debate here for the past innumerable weeks, really does cut According to CBO--again, not my words; CBO's words--funding will be 26 percent lower in Medicaid by the year 2026 than under the existing law.[[Page S3894]]  My home State of Florida is projected to lose $5.7 billion in Federal Medicaid funding from 2020 to 2026 under the bill that is proposed by the majority leader. If that is not enough, the Senate bill would dramatically increase healthcare costs for Americans between the ages of 50 to 64 before they turn that magic age of 65 when they are eligible for It dramatically increases those costs. That dramatic rise in cost is due in large part to a provision that would allow insurance companies to charge older Americans up to five times what younger people are charged. The current law, the Affordable Care Act, has a differential of 3 to 1. This bill as proposed has a differential of 5 to 1. So if you are not on Medicare because you haven't turned 65 and you are an older American in those ages--which increasingly seem very young to me--up to age 64 when the differential from what the insurance company charges the young person is five times, not three times, as is the current law, this would especially be felt among those older individuals making between $42,000 and $48,000 a year who, after that point, no longer qualify for the tax credits under the Republican bill to make coverage more affordable.  Remember, in the current law, up to 400 percent of poverty level, you are entitled to get tax credits according to what your income is to help you buy private health insurance from insurance companies on the marketplaces in each Even that is going to be reduced.  This bill also includes a backdoor provision that undermines the protections that currently exist for people with preexisting conditions. In defending the bill, people will argue that it doesn't do that, but look what the bill says. It says that it can be left up to the States to determine that. What is a way that the State can lessen the cost of insurance premiums? Take away the guarantee that someone can get insurance if they have a preexisting condition.  I have given a number of speeches. I have had some experience in this as the former elected insurance commissioner of Florida, when it was an elected position. It was also a constitutional position of the State treasury. I held that position for 6 years, and I have dealt with insurance companies. I have seen some insurance companies say: You have a preexisting condition. We are not going to insure you because you have asthma. I have even seen an insurance company cite: We are not going to insure you because you have a preexisting condition; you had a rash.  Under the current law, an insurance company cannot deny you insurance because of whatever your preexisting condition is. Your preexisting condition may be that you have a weak heart, and you, of all people, would want health insurance. Before, you couldn't get it. Now, under the current law, you can.  I don't want you to hear this plea over and over again from me. I want the pleas from several Floridians to reach out across the State lines and get to the Senators who are going to be voting on this. I want them to hear from some of my constituents. When I met with them last week in Tampa, I had many who said that they would be devastated if Medicaid were cut.  I want to share with you how this has personally affected them and how apprehensive and plain scared they are right now that the healthcare they are getting will cease if this bill proposed by the majority leader is to become law.  Take, for example, Michael He is 36 years old, and he has spinal muscular atrophy. It is a genetic disorder that affects control of his muscle movement. He relies on a tracheotomy, a breathing tube, and uses assistive computer technology to be able to talk. The computer talks for him.  Michael was supposed to join us on that day, but he wasn't feeling well, and, of course, there is always the added exposure to germs in his weakened immune condition. Instead came his two caregivers, his single mother Karen and his brother Michael relies on Medicaid, which allows him to live at home with his mom and have a personal care assistant. He benefits from the Medicaid home and community-based waivers. If the waivers are eliminated because of the whacking of billions and billions of dollars from Medicaid, he would ultimately end up in a nursing home, away from his mother and his family, being forced to compromise his level of care and quality of life.  You may have seen this fellow and his mom interviewed by the national news networks. He is one and the same, Michael  The Senate healthcare bill ends Medicaid as we know it. Whether it is a cap on the amount of money going to the State or it is called a block grant, the effect is the same. It will put people like Michael at risk of losing critical services, and it will certainly take away his independence and his quality of life.  I have already said that the bill certainly takes away the guarantee of coverage with a preexisting condition. Let me tell you about another Floridian who was in that meeting. Elizabeth Isom is from Petersburg, and she told me that the Affordable Care Act saved her life and allowed her to purchase insurance for the very first time. If it is taken away, she doesn't know how she is going to be able to afford coverage because of lifetime caps. An insurance company cannot put those lifetime caps on what they pay out. For example, in the old days, before the existing law, an insurance company would say: I'll pay you as long as it doesn't exceed, say, $25,000 or $50,000. That was all figured into their insurance payment and their premiums. In the current law there are essential health benefits. There are about a dozen of them.  Elizabeth was a social worker before she developed a sinus tumor. She went without insurance for 3 years, during which time her health was deteriorating. Because she did not have health insurance, she could not afford to have that tumor operated on. What I do not know is if she knew this at the time--because she hadn't had the operation--or if she thought it was cancerous. As it turned out, later, when she was able under the Affordable Care Act to get health insurance and to have the operation, thank the good Lord it was benign. But her health had deteriorated to the point that as this thing started to grow into her sinus passages and into her brain cavity, she actually thought she was approaching death. She ended up having vital organ damage and reached the point of complete disability. The mass in her sinus had extended into her skull.  After the ACA became the law of the land, she purchased insurance through healthcare.gov. She says that it is the best insurance she has ever had because it covered essential health benefits like preventive services. It certainly provided for her to go on and get the operation, and it saved her life.  If this Senate bill passes, services that Elizabeth relies on may no longer be covered, and she likely will never be able to afford a decent health insurance package again. She obviously has a preexisting condition. She would be one of the 22 million people whom the Congressional Budget Office estimates would lose their health insurance if the bill proposed by the majority leader, Senator McConnell, were to become law.  Let me tell you about another Regina Hebert is from She is a small business owner. She was diagnosed with stage IIB breast cancer at the age of 57. She, too, told me that the ACA saved her life. Without the ACA, she would not have received health insurance because her cancer is considered a preexisting condition--57 years old, preexisting condition, stage II breast cancer. She obtained health insurance through the She had two surgeons, months of chemo and radiation, and she told me that if her cancer comes back and she doesn't have insurance, then she is going to have to choose between going bankrupt--not through what she is doing now with her small business. She is paying taxes. She is contributing to society.  What is her other choice? Her other choice is to give up. Take away her insurance and those are her choices: bankruptcy or giving up. I don't think we want to put Americans in that position. The Senate healthcare bill allows States to waive the essential health benefits--the dozen I talked about that are listed, like those needed if they have a preexisting condition.  There was another lady I met named Olivia She is from outside of[[Page S3895]]Tampa, a place called She also has a preexisting condition. She told me that she uses the essential health benefits guaranteed by the existing law. She is scared that insurance companies would take away the coverage of treatments for her disability and also reinstate annual and lifetime limits on coverage.  Let me tell you about this young lady. She is just amazing. She was born without arms. She uses her feet and her toes to be able to function in the place of hands and fingers. She had to have a total knee replacement in one leg by the time she turned 30. She works as a community organizer. She doesn't qualify for Medicaid in Florida because her income is considered too high. She actually has an income. Olivia purchased health insurance through healthcare.gov with the help of tax credits to help her afford health insurance.  This young lady, now in her midthirties, is just amazing. With no arms, she uses her feet and her toes, and she is capable of getting around in her wheelchair. She is capable of driving a car. She has a business. She has an income, and she is paying taxes. She is able to function because she has health insurance.  Now, thanks to the ACA, people like Olivia benefit because there are bans on lifetime limits in insurance policies, and, thanks to the ACA, she lives an active life. She goes snorkeling, hiking, and even skydiving. Her legs are good, except for the knee replacement that she had so that she can walk. Then, when she has to do the normal functions with hands and arms, she sits down, and she uses her legs, her feet, and her toes. She told me that, without the ACA, she is trapped.  I told you about this unnamed Republican Senator who was in an airport in another State--that of the Republican Senator's. What happened to that Republican Senator happens to me back in Florida with people coming up and begging me: Please do not take away my healthcare.  We should not continue to waste our time with this healthcare bill that only takes away healthcare and charges more for less coverage. We have said--so many of us out here on this floor--that we should be looking for ways to improve the existing law, the Affordable Care Act, not to undo all of the good that it has done. We have Floridians and folks across the country who are grateful for it. They want us to fix it, not repeal it, and they say that over and over: Why can't you guys get together in a bipartisan way and fix it?  These are the personal stories of Olivia, Michael, Regina, and Elizabeth, along with the hundreds of people who have come up to me in the street or in the airport and have begged me: Do not take it away. They do not want us to get rid of this. As you have heard, several of them claim that they would not be alive today without the Alternatively, they would be bankrupt if it were not for Medicaid in the  In order to truly improve our healthcare system, why don't we work together to make it better? We need to look at real solutions. I am happy to say that this Senator has been talking to Republican Senators, and we have talked about specific things. I told some of these Senators about my experiences as the formerly elected insurance commissioner of  When I had a problem after the monster Hurricane Andrew in the early 1990s and we had a paralyzed marketplace in which you could not get homeowner's insurance in Florida from insurance companies because they were scared to death that the next big one was coming and that the losses were going to be so great that they would have to price the premiums so high, what did we do? We created a reinsurance fund called the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, which builds up the reserves that would reinsure the companies if they were to have a catastrophic loss.  The same principle with hurricanes can apply to health insurance, which is that of creating a reinsurance fund that will insure the health insurance companies against catastrophic loss, which, occasionally, they will have. Do you know something? I costed that out in Florida, and it would reduce the premiums from the marketplace in Florida by 13 percent. Now, that is a real savings, and that is just one solution for a fix. We ought to be looking at approaches like this.  I welcome all of our colleagues on this side and on that side--and I have been talking to some on that side--to join together and do something productive, like getting behind ideas just like the one that I suggested.  I heard our colleague this morning. One of our favorite colleagues out here is Joe Manchin from West Virginia, and I heard him being interviewed on one of the morning shows. He was terrific. He said: We need to be working together. We should not be divided by party over this, and we should not be divided ideologically on this. We ought to be openly trying to work together to figure out how to drive down healthcare costs and increase coverage for more  That is what those folks in Tampa, FL, told me last week with whom I met. That is what those hundreds of folks are telling me who come up to me in the airport, on the airplane, on the street corner, in the public buildings, in the hospitals--wherever I am: Please, get together, and work it out. They are asking us to fix what needs fixing. That is what the American people are asking us today, and that is what I beg of the  As the good Lord says: Let us reason together.

Mr.Mr.President, every indication, I would say to my friend from Florida, a most valued member of the Armed Services Committee, they will continue to try to interfere in any election they possibly can. They are spending large amounts of money.

Mr.Mr.President, I would just say to my colleague from Florida that when you look at their early attempts versus their latest attempts, they learn with every experience. It is a lot easier--as my colleague from Florida knows, it is a lot easier to play offense than defense.  We are going to have a hearing on this whole Montenegrin thing, and I know the Senator from Florida will play a very significant role. Every time we turn around, we have a new revelation of some of the activities that have been carried out, not just by Russian hackers but by Chinese, by Iranian, even by single individuals. This is probably the national security challenge that may not be the greatest, but I would say we are the least prepared for.

4482,topic-id,1950,"Mr.President, this Senator certainly looks forward to that hearing in the Senate Armed Services I thank the chairman for his leadership in constantly bringing up and reminding the American people of the threat that is coming through cyber attacks into this Nation and others.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, I wanted to speak about what is going on here in this Capitol at this moment. It has been the subject of a lot of discussion last night and again as we have been in session today; that is, trying to hatch a plan to overturn the Affordable Care Act and to find something that would replace it. In fact, it is being done in secret.  I would just merely pose the question, Why is it being done in secret if it is to be something that is to help the American people more than what the existing law is? Why wouldn't that be something you would want to expose to the light of day? If it is to improve the existing law, why in the world would that not want to be done on a bipartisan basis?  Yet we find ourselves confronting a situation where the majority leader has said he is trying to cobble together 50 votes to overturn the existing law, and it must be something that is not very palatable in what it is to overturn the existing law. Otherwise, it would be done in the open and in the sunshine.  Now, the existing law is not perfect so we ought to improve it, but the existing law, as we have heard in some of these dramatic townhall meetings, is the reason some people are alive today. It is the reason some folks no longer have to worry about being denied coverage for a preexisting condition.  By the way, that requirement of not allowing an insurance company to deny you coverage because you have a preexisting condition is not applicable just to those who are on the State and Federal exchanges. That is applicable to all insurance policies.  So if you have that kind of condition, which I can tell you might be a condition such as asthma, we are not going to insure you for the rest of your life because you had asthma or, if you want to go to the extreme--and it has been done--an insurance company saying: I am not going to insure you because you have had a rash. The flip side of that is insurance companies put a lifetime limit on it so if they pay out up to a certain amount--let's say $50,000--the insurance policy stops, no more payouts.  That is not according to the existing law. In the existing law, they can't say you are going to lose your coverage because you hit that lifetime limit cap that their payout is.  Every day I hear from Floridians who tell me how the House-passed bill would affect them and what we speculate, since we don't know, that the Senate bill that is attempting to be brought out at the last minute next week--what we suspect is going to be in it. Every day I hear from people.  So take, for example, the lady from Sebring, FL, Christine She has allowed me to use her name.       My daughter has Juvenile Diabetes (Type 1). She was      diagnosed at age 15 . . . when the Affordable Care Act was      signed into law. I absolutely rejoiced about the end of all      the horrible things that come along with having a pre-     existing condition. She no longer had to worry about      cancellation of her insurance, waiting periods, denial of      coverage, annual and lifetime limits, higher premiums, and      the dreaded high-risk pools.  Then she continues to write:       Fast forward to 2017. All the fear and the worry are back.      Our President and Congress plan to repeal and replace the      Affordable Care Now she has the very real prospect of      having to enter a very expensive high-risk[[Page S3634]]     pool. That could mean bankruptcy and denial of needed      medicines and care.  Take, for example, an unnamed constituent from Florida's panhandle who wrote me. I got this today.       I have chronic and persistent illnesses that would be      debilitating without affordable and comprehensive care. I      have chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease in      every part of my spine. I have had innumerable procedures to      help manage the pain, including epidural and targeted nerve      block injections at multiple levels.  This unnamed individual, a constituent of mine, continues:       I am now planning to get radio frequency ablation of the      nerves. Using pre-ACA rules--  Before the existing law--       I would have hit my lifetime limit at least 1 year ago and      been unable to continue getting pain-managing treatment. I      often feel like I am a burden to my wife who is one of the      most understanding and supportive people I know.  He concludes:       If the AHCA passes and our insurance and total health costs      go up significantly, the burden I feel I am right now will      become a reality. Please, I deserve more than to suffer from      uncontrollable pain. And my wife deserves more than to have      to care for me in that condition.  The existing law is not perfect, but it has given millions of people, including those with preexisting conditions like juvenile diabetes, access to healthcare they otherwise would not receive. This healthcare bill that passed the House that is the model for apparently something--for taking it out of that--if they are ever going to get an agreement between the two Houses, that Republican healthcare bill will take us back to the days when it was nearly impossible for people with a preexisting condition to get health insurance coverage. People with asthma could be forced to pay more than $4,000 more because of that preexisting condition. People with rheumatoid arthritis could be forced to pay up to $26,000, and people who are pregnant could pay more and more and more.  Let me tell you about another constituent from Volusia County who shared how the repeal of this would affect her.  She writes:       My husband, a 50-year-old leukemia survivor, would lose his      ability to obtain comprehensive health insurance due to the      lack of protections for people with preexisting conditions.       My daughter, who has asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, would      lose her ability to obtain comprehensive health insurance due      to the lack of protections for people with pre-existing      conditions. Our family, all hard working, tax paying      Americans, will once again be subjected to annual and      lifetime limits which could easily bankrupt us.       My daughter, who is a young woman just starting her career,      would lose her ability to purchase affordable health      insurance and receive tax subsidies that she currently      receives under the Affordable Care  She goes on to say that she is afraid that TrumpCare would relegate them, if you change all of that, to second class citizens.  Why am I saying this about preexisting conditions with regard to what was passed at the other end of this hallway, down at the House of Representatives? They say: No, no, preexisting conditions are not eliminated down there. But that does not tell you the whole story. The whole story is that, in the House-passed bill, it is left up to the States, and the States see that as a way of so-called lowering their premiums. If you start doing that for some and do not keep it spread over the millions and millions of people who are now under the protection of the preexisting conditions, it is going to become a select few more, and it is going to spike the cost of that insurance.  I conclude by telling you another part of what happened down there in the In effect, they changed Medicaid as we know it by cutting out of it over $800 billion over a 10-year period.  Donna Krajewski, from Sebastian, FL, wrote to me recently to tell me what Medicaid is for her family.  She writes:       I am writing this letter on behalf of my son . . . who has      Down syndrome. . . . These blocks--  That is the technical term they are using in the House of In other words, it is capping Medicaid to each of the States--       or caps [on Medicaid] will cause States to strip critical      supports that my son needs to live, learn and work in the      community.       These [Medicaid] funds have enabled him to participate in      an adult supervised day program and transportation to and      from the site. This program involves classes, such as daily      living skills, social skills, and daily life skills. He is      also able to go out once or twice a week to socialize. . . .      He has become more confident and happy with his life.  We need to find ways to improve the healthcare system. We need to fix the existing law. We do not need to unwind all of the good things that we have done. We need to fix it in a bipartisan way so that, when folks come to me and ask, ``Senator, what are we going to do to fix it?'' what I will then say is that it is my responsibility to do something.  Last week, I filed a bill, with a number of other Senators, that would lower healthcare premiums for people in Florida by up to 13 percent. What it would do is help to stabilize the existing law's insurance marketplace by creating a permanent reinsurance fund that would lower the risk that insurance companies face--a risk pool, a reinsurance fund.  It is kind of like what we did back when I was the elected insurance commissioner of Florida in the aftermath of the monster hurricane--Hurricane Insurance companies just simply could not take the risk that a category 5 would come along, hit directly on the coast, and just wipe out everything--wipe out all of the capital reserve the insurance companies had. What they did was to go to a reinsurance fund for hurricanes, which we actually created in Florida--the catastrophic reinsurance fund--so that the insurance companies could reinsure themselves against a catastrophic hurricane loss.  That is exactly what this proposal is. It would lower premiums by 13 percent and create a reinsurance fund--a permanent one--that would lower the risk to the insurance companies that are insuring people's health.  At least one Florida insurer estimates that this bill, if passed, would reduce premiums for Floridians who get their coverage from healthcare.gov by 13 percent between 2018 and 2020.  So you ask: What is a suggestion? I figured that it was my responsibility to come up with a suggestion on how to fix it. This is one of several fixes, and it is a tangible fix, and it is, in fact, filed as legislation.  What we are facing in the suggestion that I have made is not the ultimate solution to solving the healthcare system, but it is one small step in the right direction to making health insurance available and affordable for the people who need it the most.  How are we going to fix it?  You are not going to do it by running around in the dead of night, secretly putting together a plan that is only going to be a partisan plan. If you are going to fix the healthcare system, you are going to have to do it together, in a bipartisan way, building consensus. That is what I urge the Senate to do instead of what we are seeing happen behind closed doors.  Let's get together. Let's work together to make healthcare more affordable for people and stop all of this stuff behind the closed doors. The American people deserve better.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgS3624-2.txt,859,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,20.0,July
4436,topic-id,326,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.[[Page H5145]]  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.1684, the Disaster Assistance Support for Communities and Homeowners Act of 2017, introduced by the gentleman from New York (Mr.Nadler), my good friend and colleague. This bill will assist common interest communities such as condos, co-ops, and community associations after disaster strikes.  Hurricane Sandy caused severe impacts to New York City and the surrounding areas, inflicting billions of dollars of damage.  While condominiums and cooperative associations are not common in large parts of the country, they are common in dense areas such as New York City and Washington, D. FEMA's Individual Assistance Program does not consider these types of housing units which share common areas such as entryways, stairwells, and elevators. As a result, FEMA determined that disaster damage to common areas is the responsibility of the condominium or cooperative association board and, therefore, not eligible for disaster assistance. That cannot be what Congress intended.  The bill also addresses another type of housing common in certain parts of the Nation: community associations. Community associations provide essential services of a governmental nature such as trash collection and maintaining roads and waterways. After disaster strikes, however, FEMA may deny reimbursement to community associations for performing the same types of essential services that FEMA reimburses local governments for performing.                              {time}  1715  In many cases, these common interest communities may have been eligible for FEMA assistance if they had entered into agreements with their local governments before the disaster occurred. Unfortunately, many common interest communities are not aware of these opportunities. This bill directs FEMA to provide technical assistance so that these common interest communities know what actions they can take before disaster strikes so that they may be eligible to receive reimbursement from FEMA after the fact.  I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

The people are going to lose their insurance. They are going to pay more. They are going to have lousy insurance because they are not going to have any kind of protections.  We passed the Affordable Care Act because the States were not doing the right thing. People couldn't afford insurance. They couldn't pay for a premium. They were too high.  So what did we do? We expanded Medicaid, and we provided generous subsidies for those people who needed it.

John Muir is one of our Nation's most respected and revered ecologists. His writings have inspired millions, and his activism and advocacy led to the establishment of some of our first and most iconic national parks.  From the moment he set foot in Yosemite Valley, John Muir was consumed with its natural wonder and beauty. He became Yosemite's most vocal champion, but he didn't spend his whole life there.  From 1890 until his death in 1914, Muir lived on a farm not far from San It was from this corner of the bay area that Muir cofounded the Sierra Club and helped lay the groundwork for a century of conservation.  John Muir's tireless advocacy led to the creation of Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, and his spirit and enduring legacy led to the protection of much more.  Passage of H.1719 will contribute to John Muir's legacy and it will help to protect and conserve the place where he found solace and inspiration in his later years.

4569,topic-id,310,"Mr.Speaker, I have seen this bill every step of the way over the short month we have considered it. I was there for the 26-hour meeting we had at the Energy and Commerce We didn't have an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office then either. If you want to accuse us of not wanting to know the facts, that is something that is very basic to know. We would like to have that here. Here we are again on the floor without that analysis.  Through all of that time, the sad thing is that we have not heard one real argument for how this bill would make health care more affordable and accessible for families in my district in San Diego or anywhere in the country.  Now, the healthcare system isn't perfect. There are problems with some insurance markets because they are not providing the choice they should. So let's fix them. But that is not what we are doing. What we are doing is we are on the cusp of passing a bill that is opposed by doctors, nurses, hospitals, patients, seniors, and just about everybody because it would make the problems in our healthcare system worse, not better.  This is a bill that, if it were to become law, would rip health insurance coverage away from at least 24 million That is the Congressional Budget That is not fake news. That is the truth.  The bill would leave many Americans with preexisting conditions with premiums they can't afford or without any coverage at all.  Today's votes take us one step closer to a system where families go bankrupt over an unexpected illness and our emergency rooms are filled with mothers once again seeking basic care for their children.

4415,topic-id,740,"Mr.President, I want to associate myself with the remarks from my distinguished colleague and close personal friend, Senator Crapo, and join him in urging our fellow Senators to quickly confirm Judge  As pointed out by Senator Crapo, this will be the first district judge to be confirmed by this So it should be an honor for Judge Nye, and I am sure he views it that way.  This has been, literally, years in the making. As Senator Crapo pointed out, we have only one active Federal judge right now, and he is handling what is essentially a three-judge load. Some time ago, when this vacancy occurred, Senator Crapo and I went to work on this. Most Americans don't understand how this works, but to become a U.district judge, it takes essentially the concurrence of three people--that is, the President of the United States and the two Senators from that particular State, be they two Republicans, two Democrats, or one of each--because we have what is called a blue slip process, where if any one of the three can and do object to a person, then that person will not be permitted to go forward.  In this particular case, we negotiated with the Obama White House for literally months and months, and it turned into years. I believe we acted in good faith on both sides in trying to find a person who would be the right fit for Again, we literally vetted well over 50 individuals for this position, and for one reason or another, we were unable to get any of those across the finish line.  Finally, we settled on Judge I shouldn't say ``settled'' on him. He had not really applied. After going through the 50 being vetted and not really getting where we wanted to be, we sought out Judge Nye and talked with him about it, and we went forward on that basis. The White House came along, and before President Obama left office, he nominated Judge Nye, pursuant to my and Senator Crapo's request. Unfortunately, that was just about the time that we ran out of time processing judges. The election came and went. President Trump was inaugurated, and we started all over again. I want to personally thank the White House for very quickly renominating Judge Nye for this position, again, at the request of myself and Senator  Too many States have a shortage of judges, and there is a movement afoot right now to attempt to boost the Federal judgeship load, which is in bad need. For instance, in the last seven surveys that the Judicial Conference has undertaken, they recommended that Idaho get a third judge. Senator Crapo and my predecessor before me and, I think, even Senator Crapo's predecessor before him have also been pushing for this judge. We continue to do that, and I am seeing some green sprouts that perhaps we will be moving somewhere in that direction.  In any event, yesterday we had the vote on moving forward on his nomination, and that vote was 97 to 0, which certainly is a testament to Judge Nye himself. I would urge our fellow Senators, when we get to this vote, which will either be later today or midday tomorrow, to proceed with the same kind of vote. It was a bipartisan vote on cloture, and we hope it will remain a bipartisan vote as we move forward on this confirmation.  With that, I want to thank Senator Grassley, who obviously is pressed by everyone who has a vacancy, and Senator McConnell, who has lots of things on his mind these days and is struggling with challenges that come at him from all directions, for choosing Judge Nye at our constant and gentle urging over the recent months and years and moving him to the front of the line. I want to personally thank Senator McConnell for doing that. Of course, I want to thank my distinguished colleague for his work on the Judiciary Committee and moving it through the Judiciary  I think Judge Nye will be a person who will make us all proud.

4420,topic-id,1711,"Mr.President, I have, since the year 2014, come to the Senate floor on numerous occasions, perhaps more than I hoped to, to discuss the developing situation in the nation of  The reason why I have taken such an interest in this issue is because of the impact it has, first and foremost, on my home State of We are blessed in Florida, particularly in my hometown of Miami and in South Florida, to have a vibrant and diverse community with people from across the world and, particularly, from the Western That, of course, includes a very substantial number of people from Venezuela, some who live in Florida for part of the year and some who have made it their permanent home. They have contributed greatly to our economy, to our culture, and to our lives.  It is through their eyes that I have witnessed the tragedy that has unfolded in that nation over the last 5 years. I use the word ``tragedy,'' but I don't use it lightly. Venezuela is one of the richest countries in the world, blessed with natural resources that God has blessed that nation with and the largest crude oil reserves on the planet--certainly, more than the United States and Canada combined, as an example. They have highly educated and capable people and a long tradition of democracy. Venezuela has one of the oldest traditions of democracy in the Western As much as anything else, not only is it a tragedy for the people of Venezuela--what has happened--but it is a tragedy for the hemisphere and, ultimately, for the world. We look at some of the great causes that the world is confronting and think what a democratic and prosperous Venezuela could be contributing, what its extraordinary people could be contributing. But the last 5 to 10 years--particularly the last 5--have largely been taken up by internal strife.  At the end of the day, my interest on the issue of Venezuela has never been the removal of anyone from power. It has been about the restoration of the democratic order so that the people of Venezuela can choose their path forward. We look at the history of our hemisphere, here in the Western Hemisphere, and we see that up until about 25 years ago, most of the nations in the Western Hemisphere were governed by dictators and strongmen on both the left and the right, and few, if any, people in our hemisphere had a role to play in choosing their leaders. Today, but for the exception of a handful of places--predominantly, Cuba and the Caribbean and some others--almost all of the people of the region get to choose their leaders, and that has been the story of Venezuela up until very recently. Sometimes they choose leaders who agree with America, and sometimes they do not. But they choose their leaders.  In the end, we know that democracies very rarely start wars because their peoples do not tolerate it. Democracies always seek stability and prosperity because their peoples demand it, and they get rid of leaders who don't deliver.  So our goal from the beginning--my goal, in particular--has consistently been the restoration of the democratic order and, through that, the respect for basic rights and dignity of all people, particularly in It is sad to see what has happened because I think it is fair to say that the situation today in Venezuela is worse than it has been at any point since 2014.  We saw about a week ago the horrifying images of armed thugs storming the National Assembly--the democratically elected National Assembly--and attacking members of that assembly. It would be the equivalent of protestors storming the Capitol doors and attacking Senators and We saw images of uniformed personnel, some of whom, basically, are the equivalent of our Capitol Police, roughing up the very members of that assembly whom they are supposed to be protecting. We have seen the images of protests in the streets, of national guard troops firing on people with tear gas and rubber bullets and, in some instances, with guns.  We have seen these irregular groups called ``colectivos'' going after people in the streets. By the way, in fairness, we have seen violence on both sides of it, although the vast majority of people in the opposition--the enormous majority--seek a peaceful resolution to this. Anytime you put hundreds of thousands of people in the street, chaos happens.  You think not just of the protestors, but you think of their family members on the other side of it. We forget that these national guard troops, holding up their shields and wearing the uniforms, have sisters and brothers and husbands and wives and loved ones on the other side of that barricade, deeply dividing this proud nation with an incredible history of contributions that it has made.  The situation has now reached what I believe is the tipping point. Later this month, the Government of Venezuela--I should say the executive branch, under its current President--has scheduled an unconstitutional assembly. They call it a constituent assembly. It violates the very Constitution of the country, not to mention that the supreme court has already kind of canceled the democratic order and this adds to that. I just say this with deep[[Page S3906]]sadness. If that goes forward, I think it fundamentally changes the situation permanently.  I had an occasion early this morning to speak to the President on this topic for a few minutes, as I know he is headed overseas. He expressed his continued dissatisfaction with the course of events. I think it should be abundantly clear to everyone that this government in the United States is prepared to take additional significant measures if, in fact, that constituent assembly moves forward at the end of this month--basically, all but admitting to the world what we already know; that is, that the democratic order in Venezuela has ended.  I do believe that there is still a path forward--a path forward that doesn't involve vengeance, that involves reconciliation; a path forward designed to restore the democratic order. I believe deeply that all of my colleagues here in the Senate and in the Congress and the President of the United States are prepared to play whatever role they can to help facilitate that. I think that, obviously, ultimately, it would involve restoring democracy. It would involve respecting its own It would involve holding free and fair elections, internationally supervised, not by the United States but by the United Nations or by neighboring countries. I just left a meeting a few minutes ago with the Foreign Minister of Mexico, a nation that has shown that it is willing to step forward and be constructive and productive in this endeavor.  That is the goal. The goal is to restore peace and order and to restore democracy and to grant amnesty and freedom to those who have been imprisoned because of their political views. Within that space, there are those within the government who themselves perhaps seek the same thing but feel trapped by the circumstances before the nation today.  So I do believe there is a path forward, but I also think it would be unfair if I didn't make clear that the time for that path is running out and the door will permanently close if, at the end of this month, the Maduro government moves forward with this assembly, which is illegal and unconstitutional. At that point, it would be clear for all that they have no interest and no intent of restoring democracy. I fear the consequences of that, not simply because of what the U.Government and the Trump administration might do but what it would mean to those in the streets who are already desperate as it is.  I do think that path is there. I do believe that opportunity is still available, but it will not be around forever. My hope is that cooler heads will prevail. My hope is that patriots in Venezuela--no matter what side of this debate they have been on up to this point--realize it is time to step up and further this process of reconciliation, not with a goal of vengeance or punishment but with a goal of freeing those who have been imprisoned unjustly, with the goal of having free and democratic elections, with the goal of living up to constitutional principles, with the goal of restoring democracy to a great people and a great nation.  I know that I, for one, despite all of my criticisms and all of the speeches I have given and all of the measures we have taken, am prepared to do all I can to be helpful in that endeavor, to help the people of Venezuela take control of their destiny once again and restore the democratic order, the constitutional order in a way that unites the country, not one that further fragments and divides it.  I know the President has expressed a willingness to be involved in that process in whatever capacity is appropriate, knowing that other nations in the region are prepared to lead as well.  I thought it was important on this 11th day of July, as we get closer to that measure--which I think will do irreparable harm to this possibility--that I come here to the Senate floor and express this. In the end, I think all of us in this hemisphere and, ultimately, the world would benefit greatly from a Venezuela that fulfills its potential--the potential of its people, the potential of its economy, the potential of its proud history of democracy. Whatever we can do to be helpful in that endeavor, I know that this Nation is prepared to do in whatever capacity is appropriate in the eyes of the people of  Ultimately, the future of Venezuela belongs to the people of Venezuela, and that is what we stand for.

As an emergency medicine doctor, I urge you to do no harm. I urge everybody to do no harm.  Let's be clear: a vote for this bill is a vote for 24 million people to lose their insurance. A vote for this bill is to add an age tax to those 55 years old and older. A vote for this bill is raise out-of-pocket costs for everyone, with less coverage. A vote for this bill is to take away guarantees for emergency care, medicine, mental health, and maternity care. A vote for this bill is to allow private health insurance companies to drop patients who have a preexisting illness.  How, you may ask? Let's say I see a patient with diabetes who doesn't have health insurance. A private health insurance company can say: No, we are not going to cover you. Why don't you go to the high-risk, high-cost State insurance pool that is way too expensive, with no guarantees that they will cover what they need. Therefore, they won't be able to afford it. They won't have coverage. They are going to go into financial ruin. All of this is in order to give $6 billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest.  I urge everybody to vote ``no.''

So here are five numbers that show just how deadly and dangerous the Republican bill is:  Twenty-four million is the number of children, adults, and veterans whose health insurance will be ripped away.  $880 billion is the size of the cut to Medicaid, threatening health care and long-term care for 74 million people: children, pregnant women, the elderly, and the disabled.  $600 billion is the tax cut that goes to millionaires and billionaires and corporations.  758 percent is the premium increase a 64-year-old making $26,000 a year will pay because of the Republican age tax.  Seventeen percent is the percent of Americans who supported TrumpCare before they made it worse.[[Page H4142]]  The Republicans' attempt to improve TrumpCare is like trying to douse a dumpster fire with gasoline.

4381,topic-id,1011,"Madam President, yesterday my friend the majority leader announced he would be extending this work period by 2 weeks so the Republicans can have more time to finish their healthcare bill. With all due respect, time is not the issue. Two more weeks will not help Republicans fix this bill. Remember, the Republican leadership told everyone they would vote on the bill before July 4. Two weeks have gone by, and they don't seem any closer to having a bill that would actually improve healthcare in They seem even further away.  When you have a rotten product, time is not on your side. The longer you wait, the more people know about it, the fewer people like it, the less popular it is, and the harder it is to pass it. I don't even have to tell my good friend the leader that. He knows it.  I know why our colleagues are not so unhappy about what the leader said. We know why our Republican colleagues don't want to go home. They don't want to face the wrath of their constituents. If I were a Republican, I wouldn't want to go home either. I wouldn't want to face my constituents and try to defend this deeply unpopular and damaging bill.  Now, the most significant change proposed to their legislation over the course of 2 weeks is an amendment by the junior Senator from Texas that would actually make the bill worse. By allowing insurers to sell cutrate plans that cover very few services, the Cruz amendment creates a very dangerous bait and switch. The bait is that the premiums would come down for a bit for some because insurance will not have to cover very much, and the switch is that deductibles and copays go way up to make up even more than the difference. Under the Cruz amendment, you could be paying a monthly premium for a healthcare insurance plan so threadbare, with a deductible so high that you will not get any benefit. For many, a Cruz policy could be worse than none at all. The Cruz policy leads to junk insurance, something nobody really wants, except maybe a few insurance companies.  Ironically, the Cruz amendment would cause exactly the kind of death spiral my Republican friends keep talking about. A group of patient advocates, including the AARP, the Cancer Action Network, and the American Heart Association--these are hardly political groups; these are patient advocates--said that if the Cruz amendment passed, ``younger and healthier individuals would be allowed to purchase non-ACA compliant plans that have lower premiums but fewer benefits.''       Without the younger, healthier people in the risk pool, the      premiums for ACA-compliant plans would rise quickly and      significantly. This same kind of risk pool segmentation      occurred prior to the enactment of the ACA when 35 states      operated high-risk pools . . . In that experience, most of      those states . . . were forced to limit enrollment, reduce      benefits, create waiting lists, and raise premiums and out-     of-pocket costs to the point of unaffordability. Millions of      patients lacked access to care and treatment.  That is not Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, talking. That is the AARP, the Cancer Action Network, and the American Heart Again, those groups said about the Cruz plan that it would ``limit enrollment, reduce benefits, create waiting lists, and raise premiums and out-of-pocket costs to the point of unaffordability,'' because the Cruz plan is very similar to what we had before the Even the conservative American Action Forum said the Cruz amendment is ``the definition of a death spiral.'' Higher costs, less care, waiting lists, death spirals--that is the Cruz amendment in a nutshell. How many are going to vote for that?  That is the most significant change Republicans came up with after an extra 2 weeks on the bill. Imagine, if they have another 2 weeks, what they will come up with.  My friends on the other side of the aisle should have no illusions. They can't distract our attention from this bill by phony complaints over nominations or any other issue. More time is not going to solve their problem on healthcare. It is much deeper than that. The problem is the substance of[[Page S3935]]the bill, which so cruelly exchanges healthcare for working Americans for a massive tax cut for the very wealthy.  The idea is so backward that the American people have revolted against this legislation. Even in the deeply conservative parts of my State, where I have met with my constituents, there is a revulsion to this bill. I am not surprised that some polls say that only 12 percent of Americans support it.  There is no fixing a bill as broken as this one. There is no tweaking a bill as fundamentally flawed as this one. An amended bill that only kicks 15 or 17 or 20 million Americans off their insurance, though less than the last CBO estimate, would still be a moral travesty. An amended bill that gives a slightly smaller tax break to the wealthy while still cutting Medicaid to the bone would still be gravely worse than the status quo. The only answer for my Republican friends is simple: Start over. Abandon cuts to Medicaid, abandon tax breaks for the wealthy, and abandon this one-party approach.  Democrats want to work with our Republican colleagues to actually improve our healthcare system, and, it turns out, that is what the American people want as well.  The Kaiser Family Foundation found that 71 percent of Americans favor a bipartisan effort to improve our healthcare system, as opposed to the Republican's partisan effort. That is, again, that 71 percent favor a bipartisan effort--72 percent of Independents and even 46 percent of Trump supporters.  When will my Republican colleagues start listening to the American people? Start over, drop this partisan process and this devastating bill, and work with us. We are willing to stay 2 weeks, 2 months, or 2 years to get a good healthcare bill for the American people, but we should be included in the process.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-12-pt1-PgS3934-3.txt,1036,PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT AMENDMENT,2017.0,12.0,May
4407,topic-id,1017,"Mr.President, first, I thank my good friend from Florida for his inspiring words. He is always trying to work together on bipartisan solutions. He represents one of the largest and most diverse States in the country--a State that very much depends on having good healthcare. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will heed his words.                        Mississippi Plane Crash  Mr.President, first, I send my sincere condolences to the Marine Corps, which lost 15 of its finest today, as well as 1 Navy corpsman, in a plane crash in It was the deadliest crash in the Marine Corps family since 2005. According to reports, the aircraft that crashed this morning was based at Stewart Air National Guard Base in my home State of New  Our hearts break for the families of these sailors and marines. We mourn their loss and wish comfort to their families and their loved ones in this time of tragedy.  May they rest in peace.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, on an entirely different matter, the majority leader said today that we are going to stay in an extra 2 weeks during the August break. We Democrats are willing to stay 2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years to get a good healthcare bill, but in all due respect to my good friend, the majority leader from Kentucky, it is not time that is the problem here. Our Republican colleagues for 7 years said: Repeal But they had nothing to put in its place. Then President Trump was elected with a Republican majority in the House and the Since January 4, when they deliberately excluded us from all discussions by enacting a reconciliation bill, they have been trying to put together a healthcare bill. They cannot. It is not because of a lack of time. Two weeks is not going to help. The problem is the substance of the bill.  The bill provides massive tax cuts for the wealthy, and, just as bad, if not worse, it puts a dagger in the heart of the Medicaid Program, which has become a program that affects so many With kids--poor kids--is where it started, but now it affects people who have Mom and Dad in a nursing home and who might face thousands of dollars of expenses, those on opioid treatment, those who have kids with disabilities, and many, many, many with preexisting conditions. Those are all helped by Medicaid, and our Republican colleagues here want to slash it.  Just like my colleague from Florida, I was in some very conservative parts in New York State, places that voted for Trump by over 60 percent. The revulsion--``revulsion'' is the word--and the fear that this healthcare bill has put in the hearts of those folks in Republican areas are dramatic.  So I would say to my good friend the leader that we are willing to stay as[[Page S3896]]long as he wants, but he is not going to solve his problem until he abandons tax cuts on the rich, abandons the decimation of Medicaid, and works with us to improve the existing law. His problem and our Republican colleagues' problem is not time. It is the substance of the bill.  I will say one more thing. If I were a Republican, I would not want to go home either. Every time they go home, they are lambasted because the American people have such a negative feeling about the bill. So, of course, they would want to stay here, but that is not the answer. The answer is to change the bill. Work with us. We have been begging, pleading, asking, cajoling for a month or two, when it was clear their bill was going to fail. I would say that is very important.  Mr.President, I heard the majority leader complain about the slow pace of nominations.  Our Republican friends, when they are worried about the slow pace of nominations, ought to look in the mirror. This President has nominated fewer nominees than has anyone else, and seven of the major nominees had to withdraw their nominations. Many of them were brought here to the Senate without the necessary documentation--the paperwork, the ethics reports, the FBI reports. The chaos in the White House is now spreading to the Republican Our President seems to blame somebody else when his administration makes a mess. Let's not do that here.  Again, the number of nominees that this President has submitted is lower than that of any President's in recent memory. My colleague complained about this nominee from He was outraged that he had to file cloture. I would remind the majority leader that this district judge was nominated by President Obama in the last Congress and that he was the majority leader in the last Congress, which was responsible for putting nominees on the Senate calendar. The district court judge is only one of many nominees who the Republicans failed to move in the last Congress--a Congress which confirmed the fewest number of judges of any Congress since the Eisenhower administration. That goes to show how desperate our Republican leadership is to shift blame and attention away from its healthcare bill to hypocritical and preposterous complaints on nominations. It is in order to distract from the healthcare bill. They can try other tactics.  On one more point, I would remind my colleagues that it is the majority leader who has the power to put nominees on the floor. In the Department of Defense, we have been asked about three nominees. Leader McConnell has the power to put them on the floor--instead of this judge from Idaho, instead of the nominee for OMB, and instead of the Ambassador to Japan--tomorrow, if he chose. It is his choice. If he puts them on the floor--these Defense nominees--in regular order next week, they will be approved.  So, again, to deflect from healthcare and the mess our poor Republican colleagues are in, to point falsely at the nomination process, which has been slow-walked by President Trump and many of the committees, is not going to succeed.

4616,topic-id,418,"Madam President, we Democrats sent a letter to our Republican colleagues laying out our principles on appropriations so that Republicans would know exactly where we stand and we could avoid the possibility of their shutting down the government. We have three principles: relief from damaging sequestration cuts, parity between defense and jobs and economic growth funding, and no poison pill riders, like the ineffective border wall. These are the same principles we laid out during the last budget negotiation, which resulted in a strong and bipartisan package.  But on Tuesday--which is why I am on the floor speaking--the House Appropriations Committee released a draft of its Homeland Security bill, which includes funding for an unnecessary, ineffective, and expensive border wall with Mexico, paid for by American taxpayers, breaking the President's promise, repeatedly given, that Mexico would pay for it. The bill also funds an unacceptable deportation force and unnecessary detention beds.  The President's budget calls for funding a new eminent domain strike force--a team of Trump lawyers that the administration wants to send to the border to take private land away from the American people to build this wall. This proposal has met with stiff resistance from homeowners living in border communities. Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the aisle have rightfully come out against this proposal. Not a single border State Republican supports the idea. The Senate should reject it outright.  If House Republicans keep on this path--the path of these poison pill amendments and dramatic cuts in programs that help working Americans--I fear they are steering us toward a train wreck.  Remember, the President said he wanted a shutdown. He tweeted earlier this year: ``Our country needs a good `shutdown' in September to fix mess!'' He wants one. His budget director, Mick Mulvaney, has always been for a shutdown. By including border wall funding in their proposal and dramatically cutting domestic spending, House Republicans, unfortunately, are playing right into their game.  I urge my Republican colleagues, please, let cooler heads prevail. To my Republican friends in the Senate, I would say persuade your colleagues in the House to abandon this dangerous, irresponsible path they put us on, which can only lead to a government shutdown. I guess they want it.

And he made the work fun. He always      lightened the occasion with a song or a poem. We all loved      him so.'' A devoted Catholic, Sheehy attended Mass every      morning and said the rosary every night.

4404,topic-id,1580,"Mr.President, as the leader has very ably pointed out, the Democratic obstruction when it comes to President Trump's nominees is reaching an unprecedented level if you compare it to any past administration. He pointed out the number of nominees President Obama was able to get in and the way in which Republicans here in the Senate cooperated with him on his nominees. This state of affairs here in the Senate really is taking the obstructionism when it comes to trying to block even getting people into the administration, into their positions, to an entirely new level.  Frankly, about the only thing that probably exceeds the pileup of President Trump's nominees who are not getting into his administration is the pileup of bad ObamaCare news stories. Just take a look at a few of the recent headlines.  From the Cincinnati Enquirer: ``Another insurer leaves Ohio health care exchange.''  From Bloomberg: ``Anthem's Exit Creates Obamacare `Crisis' for Rural Nevadans.''  From the Washington Free Beacon: ``Recent Obamacare Insurer Exits Lead to 2 More Counties With No Choices.''  This is another headline from the Washington Free Beacon: ``19th Obamacare Co-Op Folds, Leaving Only 4 Operating in 2018.''  Across the United States, the story is the same--huge premium increases, fewer choices, and a system that is well on its way to complete collapse.  In late May, the Department of Health and Human Services released a report comparing the average individual market insurance premium in 2013, which was the year most of ObamaCare's regulations and mandates were implemented, with the average individual market exchange premium in 2017 in the 39 States that use healthcare.gov. This is what they found:  Between 2013 and 2017, the average individual market monthly premium in the healthcare.gov States increased by 105 percent. That is in the 4-year timeframe since ObamaCare was implemented. On average, individual market premiums more than doubled in just those few years.  In my home State of South Dakota, premiums increased by 124 percent, or $3,588. That is money South Dakota families had to take from other priorities, such as saving for retirement or investing in their children's education. Over the past 5 years, the average individual market yearly premium has increased by $4,800 in Arizona; $8,364 in Alaska; $3,648 in Louisiana; $5,064 in North Carolina; $4,488 in Tennessee; and $5,292 in West  Premium hikes aren't over. In fact, in many cases, they are getting worse. Here are some of the premium hikes insurers are proposing for 2018. In Maryland, one insurer has proposed an average premium increase of 52 percent. An Iowa insurer is seeking an average 43.5 percent premium increase. In North Carolina, an insurer is pursuing an average 22.9 percent hike. A Virginia insurer is looking for an average rate increase of 38 percent. A Delaware insurer is looking for an average rate hike of 33.6 percent. A Maine insurer is seeking an average rate hike of 40 percent. I could go on. Remember, these are rate hikes for just 1 year. The double-digit rate hikes for next year are in addition to years upon years of dramatic Obama premium increases, as I already pointed out.  The ObamaCare status quo is not sustainable. This law was fatally flawed from the beginning, and it is rapidly imploding. The American people need relief. Inaction is not an option.  My colleagues across the aisle seem to want to do one of two things. They either want to do nothing, which would leave Americans even worse off than they are now, or they want to double down on ObamaCare's failures by giving the government even more control over Americans' healthcare and then raising Americans' taxes to pay for it. Neither one of those so-called solutions will provide relief to the American people.  Republicans are committed to providing real help to the millions of Americans who have been hurt by ObamaCare, and we are working on legislation to do just that. My colleagues[[Page S3893]]in the House made a good start, and we are working to build on their bill here in the  We are committed to helping to stabilize the collapsing insurance markets that left millions of Americans with no options. We are committed to freeing the American people from the onerous ObamaCare individual mandate, which requires Americans to purchase insurance that they may not want or can't afford. We are committed to improving the affordability of health insurance, which keeps getting more expensive under We are committed to preserving access to care for Americans with preexisting conditions. We are committed to strengthening Medicaid for those who need it most by giving States more flexibility while ensuring that those who rely on this program don't have the rug pulled out from under them.  The American people have suffered under ObamaCare for long enough. It is time to give them some relief, and that is what we intend to do.                              North Korea  Mr.President, I would like to take a few minutes today to discuss the serious threat posed by a nuclear-capable North  Last week, on the Fourth of July, North Korea leader Kim Jong Un took the latest and possibly most alarming step in his unwavering quest for a nuclear weapon by successfully testing an intercontinental ballistic missile. Estimates suggest that the missile tested had a range of more than 4,000 miles, which means it could reach North Korea has not yet demonstrated the ability to arm these missiles with nuclear warheads, but that day may not be far off.  North Korea's nuclear program has achieved a disturbing number of milestones in this year alone. The United States must do everything we can to prevent a nuclear-capable North Korea, but we must also be prepared should Kim Jong Un put the final pieces together, and that starts with maintaining a credible military deterrence.  This weekend's B-1 bomber flights were but a sliver of the response the United States could bring to bear in direct military engagement.  Terrence O'Shaughnessy, commander of the Pacific Air Forces, said of the exercises:       Let me be clear, if called upon, we are trained, equipped,      and ready to unleash the full, lethal capability of our      allied air forces.  We need to make sure we maintain that lethal capability. Congress has a key role to play here by making sure we adequately fund our military and pass defense appropriations in a timely manner.  While Kim Jong Un has not shown much of an inclination toward rationality, we need to keep emphatically reminding him that his regime would not survive a war on the Korean  A robust and redundant defense is also an important component of the U.and allied response to North A key part of building our defenses should be a rigorous test schedule to inform research and development of anti-ballistic missile technology.  It is true that some U.missile intercept tests have failed, but those setbacks have led to improvements. Some of our best men and women are working to keep us ahead of threats. We must repeatedly and aggressively test intercept systems to ensure that they are effective.  John Hyten, the head of U.Strategic Command, has pointed out that our testing schedule for intercept systems lags behind the pace of North Korea's aggressive missile testing.  Tuesday's successful THAAD missile defense system test against a simulated intermediate-range ballistic missile attack was a timely demonstration of this critical defense capability, and I hope we see further deployment of this promising system. Placing THAAD or the Aegis Shore missile defense system in Japan would bolster frontline defenses against future North Korean missile launches.  We should also increase information sharing and military cooperation in the area around the Korean Peninsula to ensure that sanctions are enforced. The joint maritime operations conducted by the U.Navy and Coast Guard and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force are good examples of this cooperation.  We must also examine how we have gotten to this state. For a so-called hermit kingdom, North Korea has made significant advancements, while evading international sanctions. Those advancements, which build off a legacy of Soviet support, have been facilitated by North Korea's ties with Iran and a passive China providing North Korea with an economic lifeline. Not all the blame rests with China, but we know President Xi has proved largely unwilling to curtail North Korea's agenda.  Late last month, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced sanctions on Chinese entities with financial ties to North This is a positive first step, but more can be done to target banking and front companies that serve as financial conduits for North Increased transparency in Chinese customs and export reporting, for example, would restrict oil and steel exports to North Korea and ensure that China is adhering to its ban on coal imports from North  The United States should also weigh whether new sanctions, both punitive and preventive, could exert additional pressure on China to rein in North I hope the administration will seriously consider such sanctions alongside measures to address other problematic Chinese actions, such as its continued military buildup on disputed reefs in the South China  Kim Jong Un is clearly ready and willing to threaten the United States and its allies, and we should have no illusions that he is planning to reverse course. We need to make sure that we are prepared for any threat he or his regime poses.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

4476,topic-id,1916,"Mr.President, I am happy to be joined today on the floor by Senator Heinrich, who has been a real fighter for healthcare for New Mexicans, and I am looking forward to staying on the floor and hearing him talk about how he feels about this Republican healthcare bill as well.  I rise today for the third time this session to oppose plans by President Trump and the Republicans to gut our healthcare system and to throw millions of Americans off their health insurance.  On May 4 of this year, the day that House Republicans narrowly passed their TrumpCare bill, the President held a celebration at the White House in the Rose Garden and pronounced the bill a great plan.  Well, TrumpCare may be a great plan if you are wealthy and healthy, because if you are wealthy you get big tax cuts and if you are healthy, your premiums may not go up, and may even go down--that is, until you are sick.  TrumpCare is not a great plan if you are over the age of 62, if you are a hard-working family trying to make ends meet, if you live in a rural area, if you have or have not had an illness like cancer or heart disease or diabetes, or if you are a woman. Twenty-three million Americans will be left high and dry--out of health insurance by 2026. They don't think TrumpCare is a great plan. To them, it is a mean plan. Actually, those were President Trump's own words several weeks after the Rose Garden celebration. President Trump came clean with the Senate Republicans, admonishing them that the bill is ``mean'' and needs to be more ``generous, kind, and with heart.'' For the first time since his inauguration, I agree with the President on healthcare.  Since day one of the 115th Congress, Republicans have had the Affordable Care Act in their sights, and so has the They have tried mightily to do away with the rights and benefits under the But there is good news. The American people have rallied. They have called, they have emailed, and they have gone to town halls. They have marched, they have made their views known, and they have shared their stories. So far, they have stopped Republicans from gutting our healthcare system.  Just this past Saturday in my home State, simultaneous rallies in opposition to TrumpCare took place in 20 counties. I say to them: Keep up the fight, and I will continue to fight as hard as I can. We need to do all we can to stop this attack on healthcare.  The consequences of upending our healthcare system are enormous. They are enormous for the 20 million Americans who now have healthcare because of the ACA through private insurance and through Medicaid expansion. TrumpCare hurts the most vulnerable--the elderly, the disabled, and those with fewer resources.  The consequences of gutting the ACA and restructuring Medicaid are enormous for our economy, one-sixth of which is related to healthcare. They are enormous for hospitals that rely on third-party reimbursements under the ACA and Medicaid expansion. These hospitals need those revenues, and even more so for rural hospitals that keep their doors open thanks to the ACA, as well as the Indian Healthcare Service facilities, which have reduced wait times and added services because of the  But the majority in Congress refuses to hold hearings, and they are blocking all public participation. This is unconscionable, and it is undemocratic.[[Page S3628]]  Before Democrats voted on ObamaCare, the Senate held 100 committee hearings, roundtables, and walk-throughs. The final Senate bill included 147 Republican amendments. The majority leader has missed an opportunity for political and moral leadership on one of the most important issues we face. Senator McConnell should have an honest and open process, including Senate committee hearings, with full public participation and a chance for patients to tell Congress how this proposal impacts them--not hidden meanings, not limited debate and a simple majority vote.  Americans deserve an open process from their elected leaders. That is why I introduced a bill last week with my Democratic colleagues called the No Hearing, No Vote This bill would require a public committee hearing for any legislation that goes through the fast-track budget reconciliation process, including the TrumpCare legislation.  Members of Congress were elected to improve lives, not destroy them, and I believe we need bipartisan cooperation to ensure we don't do that.  If we wanted to improve on ObamaCare, we could: No 1, make sure that all Americans have healthcare; and 2, make healthcare more affordable.  So I will tell my colleagues what is really happening here. The American people don't want the benefits they have gained through ObamaCare to be repealed and replaced with an inferior plan. They do not support Only 17 percent of Americans support the House Republicans' current bill. With this degree of public opposition, it is baffling that Republicans keep pushing the bill that kicks 23 million Americans off their healthcare.  But the moral underpinnings of TrumpCare are as bankrupt as Trump's New Jersey casinos. The winners of TrumpCare are the wealthy, and the Republicans are plainly serving those interests. The Republicans can keep trying to hide TrumpCare, but Americans understand that it is just plain wrong.  I want to talk about a few of the ways that it is just plain wrong. While women make up half of our population, no women serve on Senator McConnell's healthcare working group. Yet women are uniquely affected by For example, the range of cost-free preventive services under the Affordable Care Act includes screenings for breast cancer, including mammograms, bone density screenings, cervical cancer screenings, domestic violence screenings and counseling, breast feeding counseling and equipment, contraception, and folic acid supplements. All of these services were critical to maintaining women's health and the health of their babies as well.  New Mexico leads the Nation in the percentage of births that are covered by Medicaid at 72 percent of all births in the So these services that are now available to every woman are essential.  TrumpCare would repeal the cost-free preventive care requirements for the Medicaid expansion population. Not only would this repeal risk the health of women and their babies, but it would result in increased medical care costs overall. Preventive medical services save money in the long run.  The Affordable Care Act requires insurance plans to provide a range of essential health benefits. For women, these required services include maternity and newborn child care. But TrumpCare would allow States to apply for a waiver to define their own essential health benefits beginning in 2020. So States could choose to exclude maternity and newborn care, and women would end up paying more for this care. The result is women not getting the care they need.  TrumpCare would cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood for 1 year. Planned Parenthood provides preventive medical and reproductive health services to women and men, and Planned Parenthood funding provides a safety net to low-income women. According to the CBO, cutting off Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for 1 year would mean a total loss of access to services in some low-income communities because Planned Parenthood is the only public provider in some regions.  Take Elena from Albuquerque, When she was 30 years old and in law school, Elena found out that she had the BRCA gene mutation, which puts her at a much higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer. The treatments for the BRCA gene mutation include a mastectomy and ovary removal--treatments she couldn't afford.  Thankfully, Elena qualified for Medicaid under the expansion. She got her breast cancer screenings and decided to have a mastectomy because of the cancer scare. Elena had three surgeries, costing thousands of dollars, covered by Medicaid, and now the chances of her getting breast cancer are very low. But Elena now worries that if she decides to have her ovaries removed and TrumpCare becomes law, she will not be able to have this potentially lifesaving surgery. If she has had a lapse in Medicaid coverage, her Medicaid expansion coverage will be gone, and because TrumpCare would end the ban against insurance companies denying coverage for people with preexisting conditions, she may never be able to get insurance or surgery.  Public schools and schoolchildren will be hurt by Schools are now eligible to receive Medicaid funds for necessary medical services for children with disabilities. Schools are reimbursed for vision, hearing, and mental health screenings. These services help children get services early so they can be ready to learn.  Right now, New Mexico schools are reimbursed $18 million from Medicaid, but under TrumpCare, States would not have to consider schools' Medicaid-eligible providers, and the costs would be on the public schools. The problem is, New Mexico public schools cannot take on these kinds of costs. That might mean hundreds of schoolchildren each year will go without vision, hearing, and mental health treatment because no one else will be able to provide them.  Lynn McIlroy, superintendent of the Loving Municipal Schools, a rural school district in Southeastern New Mexico, said:       Medicaid funding is vital to our continuum of care and      service to the majority of our students. Often, our school      nurse is the only medical professional our students ever see.  New Mexico has one of the highest percent Native American populations in the country, more than 10 percent of our residents. Even though many Native Americans receive healthcare through the Indian Health Service, IHS has not always been able to provide needed care due to a lack of funding. Medicaid expansion has changed that and changed that dramatically.  Valory Wangler, who works with the Zuni Pueblo, says: Since the Affordable Care Act, patients of Zuni have access to special services that were once difficult to fund and often delayed or denied.  An IHS physician working on the Zuni Reservation had a patient with severe arthritis that was making it difficult for her to stay physically active and work at a local school. She needed knee replacement surgery. Before Medicaid expansion, IHS had trouble funding knee replacements, and the surgery was denied for years because IHS could only afford to pay for life and loss of limb services. This patient is now on the Medicaid expansion. She was able to get a total knee replacement, is working full time, staying fit, and is no longer in pain.  One of the ACA's most popular provisions is the protection from discrimination if you have a preexisting condition. This is one of the most mystifying parts of Republicans would end that protection by allowing States to waive out and set up high-risk pools.  All of us know someone with a serious illness or condition, like Kitt here. Kitt is 4\1/2\ years old and has type I diabetes that will require lifelong care. Her mother Dana is worried about Dana says: It breaks my heart that elected officials are leaning toward dropping the Federal mandate to guarantee affordable health insurance for those with preexisting conditions. Sit down with a child who has an unbearable disease and be their warrior in DC to make everything possible for that special soul and their family to have an easier tomorrow.  I hope we will all be those warriors to protect that healthcare program which has been put in place for them.

My constituents have been asking for relief from this collapsing law for years. They can no longer afford to pay more for less; and refusing to act is not an option.  Under ObamaCare, out-of-pocket expenses have skyrocketed not just for people on exchanges, but for all patients. Premium increases are nearly four times larger than previously projected.  Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr.Speaker, seem content with the current flawed system which puts the government in charge of people's health and promises coverage that is going away.

We learned yesterday, I think most of Iowa now will not have a single insurer left on the exchanges. If you are one of the people out there in the one-out-of-three counties where people only have one option for insurance, what we are trying to do here is fix this market so you actually have insurance to cover you.  We believe that in going forward with this piece of legislation not only do we give more flexibility to States to innovate, they care about the people in their I know my home State of Oregon does. Yet they are facing a shortfall right now that this legislation would provide over $320 million to help fill.  One of their proposals is to kick 350,000 people off of This would help fill the gap: $320 million in the next 2 years to fill an $882 million shortfall they have.  But this is a problem across the country. What we are trying to do here is reform ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, in a way that will work going into the future. Otherwise, people are going to be left with not only enormous rate increases in the premiums, but also you have seen an explosion in the cost of what they have to pay out of pocket.  I have had people in my district say: Look, I am outside of that area where I get a subsidy, and I am paying full price. Our premiums have gone up 50 percent in the last 2 years. My options have gone down from four or five to maybe one or two, maybe three, and it is getting worse. They are threatening to pull out.

4395,topic-id,944,"Mr.President, when he was running for President, Donald Trump laid out a pretty clear vision of how he would deal with Wall He said: ``Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us.'' He claimed he wasn't ``going to let Wall Street get away with murder,'' and he called out Goldman Sachs as the prime example of a big bank that has too much influence over the political process. That was really powerful stuff.  When Candidate Trump became President Trump, he seemed to forget every scrap of his tough-on-Wall Street talk. Within weeks of taking office, he turned over his administration's economic agenda to none other than Goldman His senior strategist, Steve Bannon, spent half a decade at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker. His National Economic Council Director, Gary Cohn, came directly from Goldman Sachs, where he spent 25 years and rose to become President of the bank. His Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving to start his own hedge fund, which brings us to Jay Clayton, President Trump's nominee to run the Securities and Exchange To be fair, Mr.Clayton never worked at Goldman Sachs, he just worked for Goldman Sachs, taking their money and representing them for years as a lawyer at a major New York City law firm.  So here we are, just over 8 years after Wall Street triggered a financial crisis and brought the economy to its knees, and President Trump has put the Goldman Sachs gang in charge of holding Wall Street accountable. Trump's betrayal of his campaign promises on Wall Street is shameful, but it is also dangerous, especially when it comes to picking the person to lead the The SEC is supposed to be the cop on the beat for Wall That is why Congress created it in the 1930s, after fraud and other misconduct on Wall Street led to an enormous stock market crash and the Great Congress gave the SEC the authority to oversee financial markets and to hold companies and individuals accountable when they defrauded investors.  When the SEC doesn't do its job, the consequences can be devastating. Look at what happened the last time the SEC was under Republican control in the years leading up to the 2008 crisis. The SEC was asleep at the switch. While Wall Street flooded the market with dangerous securities and lied to investors, the SEC heard nothing, saw nothing, stopped nothing. The Republican-led SEC did nothing. When the whole market blew up, it was ordinary[[Page S2666]]investors and working families who got asked to bail out Wall  So what kind of SEC Chairman would Mr.Clayton be? Let's start by looking at how he would lead the SEC's enforcement efforts against Wall Street, how he would be as a cop on the beat. Under ethics rules, for the first half of his term, Mr.Clayton cannot participate in any enforcement action that involves one of his former clients. That means he cannot take part in any case against Goldman But there is more. Goldman Sachs is just one of his former big bank clients. Mr.Clayton also can't take action against Deutsche Bank or against UBS or against These are some of Wall Street's biggest and most egregious repeat offenders, and Mr.Clayton would be barred from enforcing the law against them.  That is not all. Ethics rules also prevent Mr.Clayton from participating in any enforcement case against a party that is represented by his former law firm, Sullivan and Sullivan and Cromwell is a premier Wall Street firm, with a long client list that includes big banks like JPMorgan Chase and the credit rating agency Moody's. That means there will likely be even more cases against top Wall Street firms that Mr.Clayton can't work on.  Here is why that matters so much. For most enforcement actions, it takes a majority vote of the five SEC In other words, it takes three people to advance an enforcement action. In a number of recent cases, the two Democrats have voted for stronger enforcement and the two Republicans have voted against it. If the Chairman can't vote--and Mr.Clayton can't vote if some of the biggest and most disreputable banks are involved--then the Commission is likely to come up short of the necessary three votes. You know what that means. It means the banks walk free. Confirming Mr.Clayton to run the SEC will almost certainly result in weaker enforcement against the major players on Wall  Mr.Clayton is also likely to pursue a Wall Street-friendly agenda when it comes to the SEC's rulemaking responsibilities. When he testified before me and before other members of the Banking Committee, Mr.Clayton refused to commit to completing the rules that Congress asked the SEC to write all the way back in 2010 as part of its postcrisis financial reforms. Mr.Clayton even refused to commit to implementing and enforcing some of the postcrisis rules that the SEC has already finalized and put in place.  I don't have any faith that Mr.Clayton will be the kind of tough, independent leader we need at the His nomination is just one more broken promise, one more time that Donald Trump has put Wall Street ahead of the interests of the American people. The last time a Republican President led us down this path, it resulted in the worst financial crash of our lifetime. We can't go down that path again.  I will be voting against Mr.Clayton's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

4410,topic-id,1822,"Mr.President, first of all, I wish to thank Senator Murray, a member of our leadership, for taking this time to talk about accounts from home, what we have heard from those we have the honor to represent, and I think this is exactly what is appropriate at the beginning of this work period.  I just come off of eight open-to-all townhall meetings in my home State of Five were in counties won by President Trump, three were in counties won by Hillary Clinton, and the single unifying issue that dominated each one is that TrumpCare is a loser. Across the political spectrum--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, and conservatives--what I was told is that the Congress ought to set this TrumpCare bill aside, that the one Mitch McConnell has been working on ought to be dropped, and after it is dropped, Democrats and Republicans ought to get together and look for the common ground by trying to show some common sense.  I am going to spend a little time talking about what I heard, what people are concerned about, and then briefly talk about, as Senator Murray said, what we would like to do if our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will drop this ill-advised, ``our way or the highway'' approach and do what the Senate has traditionally done when we are talking about tackling a big issue, which is find common ground.  It doesn't get much bigger than healthcare. We are spending $3.2 trillion each year now on healthcare. It comes to something like $10,000 for every man, woman, and child. We are spending enough money; the real question is whether we spend it in the right place, and this very flawed TrumpCare bill will compound that problem.  During those eight townhall meetings over the past week, Oregonians asked me: When is this flawed TrumpCare bill coming to a vote? How are my frail, not physically well, older parents supposed to get by if this bill passes and they lose their health care coverage?  As I have talked about with Senator Murray, we know that Medicaid picks up the bill for what amounts to two out of three older people in nursing homes. What often is not mentioned is that it also covers home- and community-based services for seniors. I remember from my days as director of the Oregon Gray Panthers that the whole goal was to create this continuum of choices for older people and, as Senator Murray touched on, the older people who need nursing homes and nursing home benefits. She is absolutely right. We also need to protect the Medicaid guarantee for the seniors for whom care is appropriate in other settings, such as home- and community-based services.  At those townhall meetings at community centers and auditoriums, folks knew that I am the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance  We have another talented member from the committee, Senator Bennet, here, as well as my knowledgeable colleague from Oregon, Senator  I have worked on these issues with respect to taxes and healthcare for some time, and I have really dedicated my professional life to trying to find that common ground, show common sense in the areas of healthcare and taxes. But the fact is, this version of TrumpCare is a tax break for some of the most powerful special interests masquerading as a health plan, and when Oregonians heard that, whether it was in a Trump county or in a Clinton county, everybody started nodding.  The secret is out. This is not a plan to fix anybody's healthcare or hold down the premiums; this is one big handout to the most powerful special interests. People heard that Republicans were saying those tax cuts were going to create jobs. That is not very likely when they have made the tax cuts retroactive. What that means--they made the big one retroactive to January 1--is that if you have a capital gain say in March, and if this bill is passed in its present form, if that capital gain is $1 million, you get a tax break of $38,000. That is not creating jobs, it is creating windfalls, and the American people have caught on.  Now that the Senate is back in session, the public is reading about the newest proposal on offer. It is a Hail Mary pass from Senator Cruz and Republican leaders, trying to put together $50 billion for their version of And we know in the Finance Committee, they have billions and billions of dollars that they can use to try to find those extra votes.  I will tell you, this Senator Cruz proposal as it relates to healthcare is a prescription for mayhem in the private health insurance marketplace. It is going to mean misery for so many Americans dealing with illnesses. Forget the talk about bringing costs down. This plan is going to send health expenses into the stratosphere.  The plan tells insurance companies: You are off the hook as it relates to basic consumer protections. You get to bring back annual and lifetime caps on coverage.  Think about that. In the State of Alabama and everywhere else in America under the Affordable Care Act, the 160 million people who get their care through their employer heard about this bill and said: We are home free. It really does not affect us. They got a little extra bonus. The Affordable Care Act gave them a major catastrophic benefit if they had that employer coverage. With this Republican bill, all of those folks who thought they were home free with the employer coverage should know that once again there would be limits on what insurance companies could pay.  I will tell you, for anyone who is listening to this, if someone gets cancer at home, they are going to bust that cap in a hurry. This bill means they are not automatically protected. You can forget about essential health benefits. You get to flood the market with bargain-basement insurance plans as long as you offer one comprehensive option, and you get to price that plan through the roof.  If you pass this bill--the Cruz fantasy proposal--it is going to be a tale of two health symptoms. The young and healthy will opt for the barebones insurance plans that don't cover much of[[Page S3898]]anything, but there are millions of people in the country who can't get by, can't make it with skimpy insurance that covers nothing but stitches and aromatherapy.  There are people who have had a cancer scare or suffer from diabetes or people who get hurt on the ski slopes or slip off a ladder. The only coverage that works for them will come with an astronomical price tag.  By the way, the people between 55 and 64, who can get charged five times as much as younger people, get fewer tax credits under this Republican proposal. They can't get by with skimpy coverage. A lot of them have really serious health problems. Skimpy coverage for them is just a prescription for trouble.  The fact is, this new proposal basically starts marching America back to the days when healthcare was reserved for the healthy and wealthy. What I will say is that there would be plenty of opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to find common ground if this proposal is set aside.  Nobody has said the Affordable Care Act is perfect. What we would do is go to work to stabilize the private insurance market. That would be business 1. We would look at ideas, as Senator Nelson has just thoughtfully outlined, like reinsurance. Then a special priority of mine is to clamp down on skyrocketing prescription drug prices. I think there are a number of ideas that are teed up for both sides to come together.  I recently put in a bill called the SPIKE bill. What it says is that these big drug companies should have to justify their big price hikes. I don't think that is an extreme position to say they ought to have to publicly, justifiably make it part of the public record.  In the last few years, we have had a whole new industry emerge. They represent States and companies and labor unions, and they are supposed to be negotiating a good deal for patients. They are called pharmaceutical benefit managers, but we don't know what they put in their pocket and what they put in our pocket.  I have said: How about some transparency, folks? Sunlight is the best disinfectant.  Those are the kinds of ideas--reinsurance, stabilizing the private insurance market, clamping down on prescription drug prices, particularly using the power in the marketplace--that both sides ought to be able to get together.  The recess is over, but the healthcare debate is far from over. What I will say is what I told my constituents. I see my friend Senator Merkley here. We had rallies at home. I said: Folks, in stopping the McConnell bill before the July break, you proved that political change in America is not trickle-down; it is bottom-up.  For weeks before that July break, Americans of all ages and political philosophies called and texted and wrote and came to rallies and town meetings. They said: This TrumpCare bill is a loser for us. It doesn't work. Drop it and move on to approaches that involve common sense. Look for common ground that both sides could support. It is absolutely vital.  The events of the last few weeks have shown the power of the grassroots. I walked through for my constituents what could have happened if 2 weeks ago the Republican leader had brought his bill to the floor. It was in the morning. I described how the bill could have gotten through the Maybe the House would have stayed in; maybe the House would have passed it; maybe the President would have signed it. One of my constituents said that morning: If that had happened and we had lost the ACA, even though it is not perfect, that morning we would have been in mourning.  Let us show today that we can tackle this in a way that the Senate historically has worked best. Let's block the deeply flawed bill, and then let's turn around immediately to show that we can come together, find common ground.  I see one of our colleagues, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, who has one of the important reinsurance bills here. We have a variety of ideas that we can pursue, that I think would have appeal on both sides of the aisle, but there is a step you have to take before you get on to those commonsense ideas. You have to stop the flawed bill before the U.Senate at this point.  I ask the people of this country to continue what they have done over the last few weeks and show political change, bottom-up rather than top-down.  I yield the floor.
