                              S. Res. 400

       Whereas there are 36 Tribal Colleges and Universities 
     operating on more than 75 campuses in 16 States;
       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities are tribally 
     chartered or federally chartered institutions of higher 
     education and therefore have a unique relationship with the 
     Federal Government;
       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities serve students 
     from more than 250 federally recognized Indian tribes;
       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities offer students 
     access to knowledge and skills grounded in cultural 
     traditions and values, including indigenous languages, 
     which--
       (1) enhances Indian communities; and
       (2) enriches the United States as a nation;
       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities provide access to 
     high-quality postsecondary educational opportunities for--
       (1) American Indians;
       (2) Alaska Natives; and
       (3) other individuals that live in some of the most 
     isolated and economically depressed areas in the United 
     States;
       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities are accredited 
     institutions of higher education that effectively prepare 
     students to succeed in--
       (1) the academic pursuits of the students; and
       (2) the global and highly competitive workforce;
       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities have open 
     enrollment policies, and approximately 15 percent of the 
     students at Tribal Colleges and Universities are non-Indian 
     individuals; and
       Whereas the collective mission and the considerable 
     achievements of Tribal Colleges and Universities deserve 
     national recognition: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the week beginning February 11, 2018, as 
     ``National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week''; and
       (2) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
     groups to observe National Tribal Colleges and Universities 
     Week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to 
     demonstrate support for Tribal Colleges and Universities.
