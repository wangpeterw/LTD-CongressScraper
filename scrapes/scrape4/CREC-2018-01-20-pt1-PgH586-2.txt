                      THE HOUSE REAUTHORIZED CHIP

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, last November, more than 2 months ago, this 
House passed the reauthorization for the Children's Health Insurance 
Program, known as CHIP.
  The House again passed the reauthorization for CHIP this week, but 
last night, in addition to voting ``no'' on CHIP, Chuck Schumer and the 
Senate Democrats voted ``no'' on keeping the government funded, and 
here we are.
  The funding that Senate Democrats rejected last night includes 
funding for our Nation's servicemembers, tens of thousands of whom are 
deployed throughout the Middle East, the Pacific, and Korea.
  They could have voted ``yes'' to the families waiting for the 
Children's Health Insurance Program and ``yes'' to our troops, but they 
did not.
  There is no excuse for this. The issues of Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals and securing our border are being negotiated 
separate and apart from this funding bill and CHIP, and there are 
serious proposals to address these issues.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge Senate Democrats to change course, end the 
Schumer shutdown, and do what is right for the American people: pass 
the government funding and Children's Health Insurance Program that we 
sent over days ago.
