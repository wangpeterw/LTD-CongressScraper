CELEBRATING JEAN GAINES' 40TH ANNIVERSARY AT GENEVA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Jean Gaines for 
her 40 years of service at the Geneva Chamber of Commerce, most 
recently as their president. Under her leadership, the chamber has 
grown substantially, to the benefit of our community and to the State 
of Illinois.
  To those who know Jean Gaines, she is described as intelligent, 
alert, and fun-loving, a good mix of qualities to steer the board of 
directors through many challenges.
  Through hard work, she has developed multiple festivals and business 
activities, including the Festival of the Vine and the opening of the 
Geneva Visitor Center.
  Her contributions have made the chamber of commerce a vibrant 
organization and a model for many other chambers throughout the State 
of Illinois and throughout the country.
  Her family has also had a hand in the chamber's success. Her husband, 
John; daughter, Kristine; son-in-law, Jerry Holtz; son, Mark; and 
grandsons, Jack and Luke Holtz, have all worked in countless events in 
their support of our local business community.
  Jean, congratulations on 40 great years of service. Your hard work 
helps
