                      REMEMBERING DESSEY L. KUHLKE

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Augusta community mourned the 
loss of a legend in the business community--Dessey Landrum Kuhlke.
  Dessey was the most caring and selfless leader I had ever known. As a 
longtime resident of the area, Dessey graduated from Georgia Southern 
University and served in the United States Army from 1959 to 1965.
  I was fortunate enough to work for him and with him during my 35-year 
career in construction and the development industry. I had the 
opportunity to serve alongside him in the Augusta Exchange Club and sit 
in front of him on Sundays at Trinity on the Hill United Methodist 
Church.
  Dessey was a husband, a father, a grandfather, a friend, and a mentor 
to many in our community. He and his wife, Barbara, lost two of their 
children at a young age, and Dessey was the rock that held that family 
together.
  Mr. Speaker, I have recently lost two of my heroes: Arnold Palmer in 
September and Dessey Kuhlke last week. But through the loss, I can't 
help but smile when I think about the possibility of those two getting 
together with family in Heaven and playing a round of golf. Augusta is 
a better place because of Dessey Kuhlke. We will remember him often.
