  SENATE RESOLUTION 131--SUPPORTING THE MISSION AND GOALS OF NATIONAL 
  CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK IN 2017, WHICH INCLUDE INCREASING PUBLIC 
AWARENESS OF THE RIGHTS, NEEDS, AND CONCERNS OF, AND SERVICES AVAILABLE 
     TO ASSIST, VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES

  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Crapo, and Mrs. Feinstein) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 131

       Whereas, in 2015, according to a survey by the Bureau of 
     Justice Statistics--
       (1) an estimated 5,000,000 residents of the United States 
     who were not younger than 12 years of age were the victims of 
     violent crime; and
       (2) households in the United States experienced an 
     estimated 14,600,000 property victimizations;

       Whereas, in 2015, only 47 percent of violent crime and 38 
     percent of property victimizations were reported to police;
       Whereas, as of 2008, the most conservative estimate for the 
     economic losses sustained by victims of property crimes and 
     victims of violent crime was approximately $17,000,000,000 
     per year;
       Whereas the economic cost alone does not fully describe the 
     emotional, physical, and psychological impact endured by a 
     victim of crime;
       Whereas crime can touch the life of any individual, 
     regardless of the age, race, national origin, religion, or 
     gender of the individual;
       Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on 
     individuals, families, schools, and communities by--
       (1) protecting the rights of crime victims and survivors; 
     and
       (2) ensuring that resources and services are available to 
     help rebuild the lives of the victims and survivors;

       Whereas, despite impressive accomplishments between 1974 
     and 2017 in increasing the rights of, and services available 
     to, crime victims and survivors and the families of the 
     victims and survivors, many challenges remain to ensure that 
     all crime victims and survivors and the families of the 
     victims and survivors are--

[[Page S2461]]

       (1) treated with dignity, fairness, and respect;
       (2) offered support and services, regardless of whether the 
     victims and survivors report crimes committed against them; 
     and
       (3) recognized as key participants within the criminal, 
     juvenile, Federal, and tribal justice systems in the United 
     States when the victims and survivors report crimes;

       Whereas crime victims and survivors in the United States 
     and the families of the victims and survivors need and 
     deserve support and assistance to help cope with the often 
     devastating consequences of crime;
       Whereas, each year from 1984 through 2016, communities 
     across the United States joined Congress and the Department 
     of Justice in commemorating National Crime Victims' Rights 
     Week to celebrate a shared vision of a comprehensive and 
     collaborative response that identifies and addresses the many 
     needs of crime victims and survivors and the families of the 
     victims and survivors;
       Whereas Congress and the President agree on the need for a 
     renewed commitment to serve all victims and survivors of 
     crime in the 21st century;
       Whereas, in 2017, National Crime Victims' Rights Week will 
     be celebrated from April 2 through April 8 and the theme, 
     ``Strength. Resilience. Justice.'', will reflect the 
     empowerment and strength of individual victims, the ability 
     of victim assistance organizations to achieve solutions for 
     providing effective services, and a community-based effort to 
     deliver justice and healing to all victims;
       Whereas engaging communities in victim assistance is 
     essential in promoting public safety;
       Whereas the United States must empower crime victims and 
     survivors by--
       (1) protecting the legal rights of the victims and 
     survivors; and
       (2) providing the victims and survivors with services to 
     help them in the aftermath of crime; and

       Whereas the people of the United States recognize and 
     appreciate the continued importance of--
       (1) promoting the rights of, and services for, crime 
     victims and survivors; and
       (2) honoring crime victims and survivors and individuals 
     who provide services for the victims and survivors: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the mission and goals of National Crime 
     Victims' Rights Week, which include increasing individual and 
     public awareness of--
       (A) the impact of crime on victims and survivors and the 
     families of the victims and survivors; and
       (B) the challenges to achieving justice for victims and 
     survivors of crime and the families of the victims and 
     survivors and the many solutions available to meet those 
     challenges; and
       (2) recognizes that crime victims and survivors and the 
     families of the victims and survivors should be treated with 
     dignity, fairness, and respect.
