          LIFT THE RELOCATION BURDEN FROM MILITARY SPOUSES ACT

  (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our resilient 
military families. These families endure countless relocations and 
deployments every couple of years, transitioning to new schools, new 
jobs, and fitting into new communities.
  Military spouses wear their own patches of service and share a true 
sense of duty to our country. They sacrifice a great deal of themselves 
amid strain and the unknown, while providing unyielding support to 
their spouse in uniform.
  Military spouses are often employed in professions which require new 
licensing that vary from State to State, with fees and wait times. To 
alleviate this burden and provide predictability in the lives of 
military spouses and their families, I have reintroduced the Lift the 
Relocation Burden from Military Spouses Act.
  Military spouses serve, too, and my bill will help alleviate 
unnecessary stress and expenses, help make job changes easier, and will 
give these spouses and their families some deserved predictability as 
they serve their Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.
