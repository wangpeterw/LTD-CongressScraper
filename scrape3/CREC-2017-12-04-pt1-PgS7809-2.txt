                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on us this day. Radiate Your 
hope and power through our lawmakers, creating in their hearts an 
expectation of Your best for them, our Nation, and our world. May they 
face their challenges with total confidence in the triumph of Your 
unfolding providence.
  Lord, give our Senators the wisdom to seek ways to work together to 
find creative solutions to the crucial issues of our time. As they seek 
to serve Your purposes for their lives in this generation, may they 
remember the sacrifices of those who fought and died for the American 
dream.
  Lord, change and decay surround us, but You are the same yesterday, 
today, and forever.
  We praise You and pray in Your great Name. Amen.
