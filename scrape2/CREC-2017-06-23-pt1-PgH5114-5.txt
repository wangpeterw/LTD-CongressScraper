                               EVAN'S LAW

  (Mr. TURNER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, sometimes out of loss, a cause arises and 
the lives of others are saved. I rise today to ask for my colleagues' 
support of a bill I introduced today, Evan's Law.
  My bill would require the Department of Defense to make windows in 
military residential housing safe for military families and their 
children by equipping housing units with fall protection and prevention 
devices to protect against unintentional falls by young children.
  We ask our servicemembers to go into harm's way to protect our Nation 
and our way of life. Our servicemembers deserve to live in residential 
housing properly equipped with window fall prevention devices to make 
sure their children are safe in their own homes.
  Mr. Speaker, joining me today in the balcony is Commander Jason 
English; his wife, Ami; and their children, Jason, Luke, Lydia, and 
Joshua.
  Commander English and his family have been tireless advocates for 
residential window safety requirements in the Department of Defense. 
They lost their son Evan. Commander English and his family have worked 
to raise awareness about the danger young children face in residential 
housing.
  I thank the English family for their hard work. I am hopeful that 
Evan's Law will become a part of the National Defense Authorization 
Act. I urge my colleagues to join me in their support.
