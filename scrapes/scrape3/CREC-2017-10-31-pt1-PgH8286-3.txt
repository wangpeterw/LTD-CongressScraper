                  HONORING THE LIFE OF LESLIE AMUNDSON

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory 
of Leslie Amundson from my hometown of Sunnyside, Washington. Les was a 
decorated war veteran, a small-business owner, a farmer, and, truly, a 
pillar of our local community.
  Les served this country honorably. As an Army Air Corps pilot during 
World War II, his plane was shot down over Holland. He and his crew 
spent a month hiding underground and being cared for by the Dutch 
people before being captured by the Nazis. Les served 18 months at a 
prisoner of war camp and earned a Purple Heart.
  His family's roots were only strengthened when Les married and bought 
a farm in Sunnyside where he and his wife, Helen, raised their five 
children. He would often find opportunities to contribute and to help 
those around him, and his appreciation for the community showed in his 
actions.
  Les leaves behind a legacy of devotion to the people of Sunnyside and 
to our Nation.
  My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult 
time, and I ask my colleagues to please join me in remembering my 
friend Les Amundson.
