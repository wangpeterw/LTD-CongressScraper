In 1986, working as a LouisianaState trooper, Bobby Smith, from Buckeye, Louisiana, was shot in the face and blinded in the line of duty. He not only lost hissight, but also lost the career that he deeply loved.  Never one to succumb to adversity, Bobby earned a Ph.D., authoredbooks, and set out on a path of helping others. In 2001, he organized the Foundation for Officers Recovering from This foundation helped provide training and counseling to law enforcement individuals, firefighters, emergency servicespersonnel, and their families going through tough times from various traumatic events.  Bobby's will to help others wouldcarry him through his personal challenges as he traveled across the United States and throughout the world literally sharing hisstory and lifting up others. Before his death in October of this year, Mr.Smith had addressed and touched the lives of over 1million people.  Many who knew Bobby would often hear him say, ``I see. I see.'' Today, as we remember Bobby Smith, let usnot be blinded by our own tragedies, adversities, and obstacles in our lives, but let us also have the courage that Bobby had tolook beyond and see the beauty of life and see the good in others.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgH57-2.txt,2244,OBJECTING TO UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 2334,2017.0,4.0,January

I represent the congressional district with the highest concentration of petrochemical, manufacturing, and refining facilities than any other district in the entire This means that thousands of my constituents have been or are currently employed by these industries. In fact, years ago, I spent some time as a worker in one of these very factories.  With this in mind, you can understand why pushing for reform, transparency, and accountability within the EPA would be very important to me because so many of my constituents' livelihoods are affected by costly and burdensome regulations from the My constituents want to make sure that the EPA's actions, particularly those based on secret science, do not cost them their jobs or their livelihood.  Time and again, the EPA has issued extensive regulations without ever showing the science to back up their claims to justify these regulations. It is like they have a little black box over there. They don't let anyone else look into it, and they just say: Trust us, we have got good science backing up our claims.  I say, if your science is so good, then don't hide it in your little black box. Show us your data.  The HONEST Act simply requires the EPA to open their little black box to public scrutiny. After we pass the HONEST Act, any regulations coming from the EPA must be based on data that is publicly available. What is so offensive about a little transparency?  Most companies and businesses would be happy to comply with the EPA when data shows that their regulations are backed up by clear evidence. But many times, if not most of the time, this is not the case. Instead the regulations are based on secret science that no one but the regulators themselves have access to.

11634,topic-id,380,"Mr.Speaker, this bill is about protecting American jobs and the American economy.  In math class, we were taught to show our work; and when we didn't, we got the problem counted wrong. This bill is about transparency, accountability, and holding the government to the same standard that everyone else is.  According to a poll by the Institute for Energy Research, 90 percent of Americans believe that scientific data used to make government decisions should be available to the public, to the rest of us. That is nearly 100 percent. Not many issues in our current political environment enjoy that level of support. But when it does, Congress should very well listen.  The HONEST Act is a commonsense legislation that I am proud to support.  I include in the Record this letter of support from the American Chemistry                                   American Chemistry Council,                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 2017.     Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House          of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith: On behalf of the American Chemistry      Council (ACC), we want to thank you for introducing H.     1430, the ``Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of      2017'' (or the HONEST Act) to help improve the science      employed by the U.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in      the Agency's regulatory decision making processes.       The proposed legislation would increase the transparency      and public confidence in the EPA's scientific analyses.       Consistency and transparency are key to the regulatory      certainty our industry needs to grow and create jobs. In some      instances, EPA has fallen short of employing the highest-     quality, best-available science in their regulatory decision      making.       It is critical that the regulated community and the public      have confidence that decisions reached by EPA are grounded in      transparent and reproducible science, while ensuring the      protection of confidential business information and      competitive intelligence. By ensuring that the EPA utilizes      high quality science and shares underlying data used to reach      decisions, the HONEST Act can help foster a regulatory      environment that will allow the U.business of chemistry to      continue to develop safe, innovative products that Americans      depend on in their everyday lives.

11636,topic-id,410,"Mr.Speaker, I have several objections to the legislation being considered today. As with the Secret Science Reform Act, the bill would seriously undercut the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to use science to inform their work.  The bill would prohibit the EPA from using any scientific findings when the EPA did not have total access to the underlying data. This would eliminate some of the best available science from being considered by the  Let me be very clear, there is nothing secret nor dishonest about relying on voluminous, peer-reviewed studies published in the most credible scientific journals in the world to make public health decisions.  Equally problematic, the bill would force the EPA to grant full access to any scientific data it does possess, including highly sensitive materials like trade secrets and personal health histories. Much has been made about the ability of the EPA to redact this information, but there is a piece of legislation that says: By simply signing a nondisclosure agreement at the discretion of the EPA administrator, you can have access to all of the nonredacted information.  We talk about the accountability of the What is the accountability of violating a simple nondisclosure agreement? It becomes so easy for these private health information trade secrets to be sold for a small fortune on the black market. It certainly doesn't make sense to provide such an easy avenue to potential bad actors.  I would also like to object to the title of the legislation and the implication that EPA employees and scientists are somehow not honest. Many of those folks live in Virginia, and, frankly, I am tired of Members of Congress bad-mouthing my constituents. These are[[Page H2540]]hardworking public servants who have dedicated their lives to clean air, clean water, and to our good health. And I want to reassure the many wonderful employees of the EPA that, in Congress, we do, in fact, appreciate your good work on behalf of the American people.  Lastly, much like the TrumpCare bill we almost considered last week, there is no CBO cost estimate. The chairman mentions that he has asked the CBO to use a different methodology. The last one they said was going to cost us hundreds of millions of dollars to implement. It is hard to imagine anything where the EPA has been required to fund or acquire data that is not going to be unreasonably expensive relative to anything before.

11643,topic-id,321,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and especially for sponsoring this legislation, the HONEST  As the chairman of the Environment Subcommittee on the Science Committee, I fully support this bill that will require EPA regulations be based on science that is publicly available. The HONEST Act pushes forward the basic principles of the scientific method, which is critically important in instances in which science and Federal Government policy intersect.  Regulations put forward by the EPA impact all Americans, including my constituents in the East Valley of the Greater Phoenix area, the four cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek, and So it is imperative that the citizens of this country be able to see the data that underpin these rules. What is even more important is that the scientific community be able to scrutinize EPA data to ensure that the Agency is using the best available science, regardless of the administration.  Critics of the HONEST Act claim that scientific data underpinning EPA's regulations are already subject to the standards of peer review. While this may be true, peer review of scientific studies is not adequate because this process seldom involves a close scrutiny of the data used in these studies. Peer review rarely double-checks the analysis, and very rarely does it attempt to actually replicate the results of a study. Right now, we can only hope that the individuals conducting the science can be trusted with their results.  The EPA should promote the use of rigorous science, not questionable science. Those who say that peer review is adequate are misguided. The American people deserve better than that, and the HONEST Act ensures that their expectations are met.

11734,topic-id,2707,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the resolution before us, which really ought to be titled the ``Kleptocrat Relief Act.''  My Republican colleagues today are trying to repeal a critical bipartisan rule initiated by Senator Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, and Senator Cardin, a Democrat from It is a critical bipartisan rule to prevent corruption.  This transparency rule is part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. It is one of the best anti-corruption tools that President Trump now has to keep his promise to, in his words, ``drain the swamp'' in Washington and around the world.  But now, in just week 2 of his Presidency, Republicans are racing to use an obscure law called the Congressional Review Act to wipe it out. The CRA was not intended to hand a new President the power to roll back regulations that protect workers, protect the environment, protect investors, and protect consumers.  In this case, Republicans are using the CRA to target rules that have gone through extensive years-long administrative and public review, including on issues that agencies were specifically ordered by this Congress to study and address.  Republicans' unprecedented use of the CRA is not about Congress performing due diligence or agency oversight, it is a gross abuse of power to make their big corporate allies happy. I heard my friend from Idaho talk about the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum That is just a start.  The rule they are trying to repeal protects U.citizens and investors from having millions of their dollars vanish into the pockets of corrupt foreign oligarchs. It does that by requiring all oil, gas, and mineral companies listed on U.stock exchanges to disclose the royalties and the bonuses and the fees and the taxes and other payments they make to foreign governments.  This kind of transparency is essential to combating waste, fraud, corruption, and mismanagement, as Senator Isakson talked about the poverty he sees in these resource-rich countries.  Yet Rex Tillerson, whom this body just, I believe yesterday, confirmed with a pretty much partisan vote--Rex Tillerson and congressional Republicans want to strip it away. Rex Tillerson, in his years as CEO of ExxonMobil--and we will talk about that in a moment--strongly opposed this rule, almost by himself, with ExxonMobil as the head of that company.  At Mr.Tillerson's confirmation hearing, Senator Kaine from Virginia introduced into the record a 2008 report by Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff. That report was the basis--Republican staff, I assume at the behest of Senator Lugar and others--that report was the basis for what eventually became section 1504 of Dodd-Frank, known as the bipartisan Cardin-Lugar amendment to fight corruption in mineral-rich developing countries. That report concluded that many resource-rich countries are poor because their vast mineral resources often breed corruption. That corruption lines the pockets of the kleptocrats--read ``thieves''--increases poverty, increases hunger, and increases instability.  As Senator Lugar said:       Paradoxically, history shows that rather than a blessing,      energy reserves can be a bane for many poor countries,      leading to fraud, corruption, wasteful spending, military      adventurism and instability. Too often, oil money that should      go to a nation's poor ends up in the pockets of the rich or      is squandered on the trappings of power and massive showcase      projects instead of being invested productively and      equitably.  That is called the resource curse. It prevails all over the world today. For example, oil-rich Venezuela is running out of food and medicine. Resource-rich Nigeria is in an economic mess wracked by terrorism and poverty. Armed groups have fought for years[[Page S636]]over mineral wealth in the Congo and elsewhere in  Resource-rich countries in Asia have similar problems. The natural resource sector in so many countries is famously corrupt--the world's single most corrupt industry, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and But oil companies can no longer hide behind the excuse of confidentiality. Increasingly, companies are expected to disclose what they pay in taxes and other payments to governments whose natural resources they extract. That is what this language from Senator Lugar, Senator Cardin, and Senator Leahy did. That is what the rule does. That is what we should do. This Congress wants to undo that. This is now required under the laws of the United States and 30 other countries, as well as international initiatives. In other words, what we did here was followed by 30 other countries, and a number of more responsible energy companies, I would say, passed this language and began to implement these laws.  The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is a global standard that aims to put information about government revenues from natural resource deals into the public domain in 51 countries, including ours. This includes telling us what taxes the companies pay, which is key to ensuring citizens know what benefits they get--from Venezuela or Nigeria or Congo--from their own natural resources.  Let me offer some concrete examples of the kind of corruption we are talking about. This just turns your stomach.  In Equatorial Guinea, according to anti-corruption groups, oil companies, including Exxon, have had a long history of problems on this front. The regime of President-for-life Obiang, who executed his brutal uncle to gain power almost 40 years ago, has been tarnished with allegations of corruption, cronyism, brutal political repression, routine human rights violations, and drug trafficking for years and years.  Years ago, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a report and held a public hearing which revealed that a number of oil companies--again, ExxonMobil; they keep coming up in this--were making direct payments into an account in the name of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea located at Riggs Bank in Washington, Virtually all of the money in the account, tens of millions of dollars, consisted of royalties and other payments from oil companies, primarily--surprise--ExxonMobil, to the country of Equatorial Guinea for the right to explore and produce oil in that country. But instead of paying the money to the government or the national treasury of Equatorial Guinea, the companies sent the money to the account at Riggs That account was controlled by President-for-life Obiang and two of his relatives. The account signatories were the President-for-life, his son, and his nephew. Imagine that. Instead of paying the national treasury, the oil companies made payments into this account in another country, controlled by a dictator and his relatives. I can't believe we in this body support that. How could the citizens of Equatorial Guinea know how much royalty money was coming in for their oil in their country and where it was going when it was in a secret account controlled by a dictator? The answer, obviously, is they couldn't.  The report from the PSI--the committee that investigated--documented that some of the funds from that account were used to make suspicious transactions. The United States then investigated the President-for-life's family finances. Prosecutors noted that President-for-life Obiang's son ``received an official government salary of less than $100,000 a year but used his position and influence as a government minister to amass more than $300 million worth of assets through corruption and money laundering.'' He paid himself $100,000 but found a way to amass $300 million more--all in violation of the laws of his country and our country both.  In 2014, the son settled a case brought by Federal prosecutors. He agreed to sell his $30 million mansion in Malibu, his Ferrari, and various items of Michael Jackson memorabilia he had collected.  The New York Times reported earlier this month that he is still working to delay his trial on corruption charges in France, where prosecutors say he amassed a personal fortune of $115 million, which he used to indulge his tastes.  When he served as Agriculture Minister of Equatorial Guinea, prosecutors say he used his influence over the timber industry--next to oil, the most important export industry in the country--to line his pockets.  Last November, prosecutors in Switzerland seized luxury cars belonging to him, and last month, at the request of the Swiss, the Dutch authorities seized his 250-foot, $100 million yacht named the ``Ebony Shine'' as it was about to sail to Equatorial He said the yacht belonged to his country's government. All the while, his people are starving.  You can't make this stuff up. If the bill before us were adopted, the Obiang family would be celebrating. They would be celebrating in Washington, in California, and in Equatorial  In Nigeria, again according to Global Witness, a major oil deal struck by--surprise--ExxonMobil with the Nigerian Government is being investigated by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, a law enforcement agency that investigates high-level corruption. The probe centers on a protracted and controversial deal agreed to by ExxonMobil and the Nigerian Government in 2009 to renew three lucrative oil licenses, which at the time accounted for around a quarter of Nigeria's entire oil production.  ExxonMobil agreed to pay $600 million to renew the licenses and construct a powerplant at a cost of $900 million to the company, making a total contribution of $1.5 billion. Yet documents suggest that the Nigerian Government may have valued the licenses at $2.5 billion and that the Chinese oil company CNOOC offered to pay $3.7 billion for the same licenses--over six times the amount reportedly paid by  Other incredible and notorious examples abound. It would be reason enough for us to act to try to help the millions of people around the world who are victims of this corporate collusion, but in today's world, the resource curse doesn't just impact far-off countries; it affects Americans every day. It has empowered anti-American dictators in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, situations which cost American lives and American taxpayer dollars. It worsens global poverty, which can be a seedbed and a fertile growing ground for terrorism against us and our allies. It leads to the instability that threatens global oil supplies. It raises gas prices at home.  That is why we need this rule--all of the above--to protect American national security interests by combating the corruption and secrecy, with all these oil companies at the table with them. That has caused conflict, instability, and violent extremist movements in Africa and the Middle As ISIS has demonstrated, nonstate actors benefit from trading natural resources in order to finance their terrorist operations.  Despite all this, the Republican-led House of Representatives, as Senator Crapo said, voted yesterday to repeal this bipartisan initiative--an initiative that holds Big Oil accountable and protects the American people. Today, the Senate Republican leadership is following suit. It is a little ironic in light of the fact that Candidate Trump, at almost every rally in my State, almost every rally in State after State after State where he was campaigning, talked about draining the swamp.  Since the rule's creation, ExxonMobil, led by Mr.Tillerson--now the Secretary of State--and Big Oil allies, such as the American Petroleum Institute, the U.Chamber of Commerce, and the Heritage Foundation, have fought to kill it.  Who else opposes this rule besides Senate Republicans, House Republicans, and President Trump? There are the autocrats in We know about the connections between Russia and the Secretary of We don't know quite enough about the connections between our President and President Putin because we can't get the President's tax returns. We know something is going on. Everybody knows it. Nobody knows quite what.  Who else opposes it? Autocrats in Iran, where Advisor Flynn made some interesting and provocative comments today, autocrats in Venezuela, autocrats in Africa with oil wells, gasfields,[[Page S637]]or copper mines who want to keep their payments a secret. It is working for them. It is working for the autocrats. It is working for Apparently it is working for Republicans in the House and Senate too. I am not sure exactly how, but I know it is working.  More than 30 countries--mostly the United States, Canada, and European nations--have adopted similar anti-corruption standards. Senator Lugar, Senator Leahy, and Senator Cardin's law passed as part of Dodd-Frank, and the SEC is adopting this rule. More than 30 other countries in the world followed our lead, and some of the more responsible oil companies were prepared to comply. So to be clear, with Europe and Canada in the same disclosure system, the playing field is now level. It is working.  Many companies already report such payments under European rules and are doing just fine, so this is hardly causing them undue burdens in the regulatory framework that my colleagues like to talk about. That is why many in industry support the rule, despite the actions of Exxon, the bad actor here, and the CEO of Exxon--now, amazingly, our Secretary of  BP and Shell--two major, large oil companies--have publicly endorsed payment reporting and lining up U.rules with those in other markets. Foreign and state-owned oil companies from China and Brazil, including CNOOC, PetroChina, Sinopec, and Brazil's Petrobras, are required to disclose under U.rules, leveling the playing field for U.companies. Gazprom, Rosneft, BP, and Shell already report under UK rules. The largest mining companies in the world, including Newmont Mining, BHP Billiton, and Rio Tinto, have supported similar reporting. Oil, gas, and mining workers unions, such as United Steelworkers, back the rule.  Notice who doesn't back the rule: Exxon, the American Petroleum Institute, and autocrats in Iran, Russia, and  Investors also support it--including investor groups with $10 trillion under management--so they can better understand and manage the reputational, expropriation, sanction, and other risks facing firms in which they invest. It is supported by the American Catholic bishops, the Presbyterian Church--all kinds of religious groups.  Who is against it? Republicans in the House, Republicans in the Senate, the President of the United States, ExxonMobil, the Secretary of State, who used to be CEO of ExxonMobil, and autocrats in Iran and We get the picture.  All these groups who care about justice, who care about fair play, who care about doing business with predictable and fair rules, like BP and Shell, all of them support it--Global Witness, the ONE Campaign, Oxfam, and Publish What You  We need to be clear on one other thing my friend from Idaho said: This rule won't cost a single American job. Everything oil companies can legally do today is still allowed under the anti-corruption rule. They only have to do one more thing: They have to report their numbers to the Securities and Exchange How can that cost millions of dollars?  The Cardin-Lugar rule makes Big Business and government more transparent, fights corruption, and does it all without hurting taxpayers. It is a creative approach to global problems that our leaders did embrace until we had a President who wants to ``drain the swamp,'' he says--should be embracing, not rejecting at the behest of just a few actors.  Again, who is lobbying to overturn this rule? It is autocrats around the world. It is It is the American Petroleum It is a very small number of companies, when so many people are on the other side.  If we repeal this measure today, shareholders, investors, and poor communities around the world will continue to see their money and natural resources stolen by crooked oligarchs. We will be undoing the moral leadership. This is in so many ways a moral question that Senator Cardin, Senator Lugar, and Senator Leahy brought to us bipartisanly, with broad support by both parties. We will be turning a blind eye to corruption, we will be betraying our principles, and we will be undercutting our allies in Europe and Canada who followed our lead and crafted their own rules based on ours.  Under the terms of the Congressional Review Act, any future ``substantially similar'' rule will be forever prohibited from being written by the That makes no sense.  I hope this effort fails. I know my Republican colleagues understand this because enough of my colleagues recognize the merits of this anti-corruption measure and they refuse to kowtow to the dinosaur wing of Big It is not even all of Big Oil; it is the dinosaur wing of Big oil. It is the autocrats. It is the American Petroleum It is the Chamber of It is  I thank Senator Cardin and Senator Leahy for their work, and I thank former Senator Lugar from Indiana for the important work he did on this measure.

11750,topic-id,3180,"Mr.President, I appreciate the comments of my friend from Alaska--also from Cleveland--and those of my friend from Cincinnati, Senator Portman, about opioids. I appreciate his leadership in my State, the work he has done, and the work we have done together on opioid addiction. It is a tragedy, and I don't go much of anywhere in the State without finding someone who is affected, someone who is addicted in a family, or a close friend who has died.  As Senator Portman said, Ohio has more opioid deaths than any State in the country. We are the seventh largest State, but the State with the most deaths. It is troubling, and clearly we are not dealing with it as well as we should.  Mr.President, I rise to close the debate on this motion today on the Congressional Review Act to wipe out the SEC rule. I rise in opposition to the bill, as a number of colleagues on my side of the aisle have very strong feelings on it. With the exception of my friend from Idaho, the chairman of the Banking Committee, there weren't many Republicans who wanted to come to the floor for this, in part because I think it is just the supporters they have on their side don't make you want to rush to the floor and support them. Some called this the Kleptocrat Relief I will give you a real quick history before I wrap up.  There is a provision in Dodd-Frank to deal with giving the President and others the best anticorruption tools we could have around the world, where countries that have lots of natural resources have been countries with all the wealth from natural resources. They are some of the most corrupt governments with some of the worst poverty anywhere on  This legislation in Dodd-Frank, and the rule that came out of it from the SEC, was going a long way to preventing corruption. What we saw was the support. Thirty countries in the world followed suit from our country. The companies that were affected, with a few very notable exceptions, were beginning to do what they knew they needed to do and should have done and that the rule called for. As a result, we were going in the right direction until this new administration, this new  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record relevant letters from investors.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  August 14, 2013.     Mary Jo White,     Chairman, U.Securities and Exchange Commission,          Washington,       Dear Chairman White: As investors representing more than      US$5.6 trillion in assets under management, we commend the      U.Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its      leadership in producing final rules for the implementation of      Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and      Consumer Protection Act (Section 1504). The[[Page S652]]     rules were carefully considered and reflected investors'      substantial interest in oil, gas and mining industry payment      transparency. The SEC's leadership encouraged the development      of a public global disclosure standard that includes the      European Union Transparency Directive and regulation under      development in       On July 2, the U.District Court for the District of      Columbia made a ruling in American Petroleum Institute et al.      vs. Securities and Exchange Commission vacating the rules for      the implementation of Section 1504 and requiring the      Commission to review them. We encourage the SEC to continue      its vigorous defense of the Section 1504 rules as it responds      to the'U.District Court's decision.       It is in the interest of investors and companies subject to      both the U.and EU requirements that the reporting      obligations in these jurisdictions are as uniform as      possible. Consistent and predictable regulations may lower      compliance costs and enhance the salience of disclosures.      Therefore, we hope that the SEC will take all necessary steps      to ensure that the rules go into effect as early as possible      and that they maintain continuity with regulations in other      jurisdictions. In doing so, the SEC should have due regard to      the lengthy deliberations it conducted before the      promulgation of the rules, and the inputs from diverse      constituencies including many investors.       Payment disclosure regulations, such as Section 1504 and      the European Union Transparency Directive, play a critical      role in encouraging greater stability in resource-rich      countries, which benefits both the citizens of those      countries and investors. The Extractive Industries      Transparency Initiative (EITI) Board Chair Clare Short has      stated that mandatory payment disclosure regulations would      ``strengthen the local accountability EITI provides.'' In      fact, the latest revision of the EITI standard explicitly      made project level payment disclosure contingent on alignment      with SEC and EU regulation. We encourage the SEC to keep the      complementary nature of regulations such as Section 1504 and      EITI in mind as it considers its response to the U.     District       Investors depend on the SEC's leadership and deliberate      consideration of disclosure requirements that protect      investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and      facilitate capital formation. We commend the Commission on      issuing rules for the implementation of Section 1504 that      reflect thorough contemplation of these factors and are      confident the SEC will continue to act in the interest of      investors as it responds to the U.District Court's July 2      ruling in API vs.                                  ____                                                   April 28, 2014.     Mary Jo White,     Chair, U.Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington,           Re: Section 1504 of the Dodd--Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer                              Protection Act       Dear Chair White: We write on behalf of the 34 undersigned      institutional investors to convey our strong support for the      leadership the U.Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)      has shown in producing final rules for the implementation of      Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and      Consumer Protection Act [Section 13(q) of the Securities      Exchange Act of 1934]. This letter follows up on a prior      submission made to the SEC on August 14th 2013 on this      subject and signed by many of the institutions below.       By way of introduction, the signatories of this submission      manage assets that collectively total more than US$ 6.40      trillion, and our mandate is to deliver sustainable long-term      returns to our pensions, insurance and savings clients. It is      in this spirit that we wish to contribute our views on the      value to investors of improving transparency and governance      in the extractives sector through regulations such as Section      1504. We also welcome the parallel submission by Calvert      Investment Management et al, and note the common objectives      our respective groups of signatories share in promoting high      standards of transparency in the extractives sector.       We would like to highlight that we have only belatedly      become aware of the detailed submission made on April 15,      2014 by the American Petroleum Institute (API) on this      subject. Inasmuch as we had produced this statement, and      secured approvals from the undersigned institutions, well      before having had an opportunity to review the API      submission, we wish to draw your attention to a brief      supplementary comment that several of our signatories will      shortly be submitting by way of parallel submission in order      to address any additional points that are relevant to the      API's arguments.       The undersigned signatories strongly support the Extractive      Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). As such, we not      only welcome the US's involvement as an EITI Supporting      Country since the Initiative's inception in 2003, but are      particularly pleased to note its recent admission as an EITI      Candidate We regard the United States' decision as      instrumental in establishing the de facto global standard for      transparency in the extractives sector, and see the steady      progress being made as a critical factor in helping to reduce      volatility in the oil and other vital hard commodity markets,      with beneficial impacts on global financial markets and the      real economy.       In line with our support for the EITI, we also highlight      that we regard the mandatory project-level reporting      provision contained in Section 1504 as entirely consistent      with, and complementary to, the goals of the EFL As such, we      wish to underscore the important revisions made in 2013 to      the EITI Standard that aim specifically to ensure convergence      with the disclosure standard pioneered by Section 1504. These      are now echoed in similar legislation already passed by the      European Union (Transparency and Accounting Directives) and      in progress in Canada (Canadian Mandatory Reporting in the      Extractive Sector).       In short, Section 1504 started a process that has now been      embraced by the world's other key jurisdictions: where      initially it could have placed US listed companies at a      commercial disadvantage, this risk has been reduced. As      institutions based in numerous international jurisdictions,      with both customers and assets spread around the globe, we      welcome this virtuous development, and consider that      regulations favouring not only high, but just as importantly,      globally consistent standards of transparency, are essential      to safeguarding the effective functioning of the financial      markets.       Finally, we highlight that our portfolios have substantial      exposure to the global extractives sector, through both      equity and fixed income instruments, and that many of the      undersigned also invest actively in the sovereign debt of      resource-dependent emerging nations whose fiscal governance      has a direct bearing on the quality of the credits they hold.      It is therefore specifically with a view to safeguarding and      enhancing our clients' portfolio returns that we contribute      the following comments.       Chair White, your fellow SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar      has recently been reported to have voiced the concern that      Section 1504 may have involved a degree of legislative      overreach, by allowing ``special interests, from all parts of      the political spectrum that are trying to co-opt the SEC's      corporate disclosure regime to achieve their own      objectives.'' Commissioner Piwowar raises a valid point that      merits discussion: as investors whose interests are      inextricably bound with the commercial interests of the oil      and mining companies in which we invest, we wish to clarify      that we fully agree that the remit of the SEC is, and should      remain, that of safeguarding the efficient functioning of      financial markets. We also agree that legislative and      regulatory tools aimed at achieving purely social aims      properly belong within instruments other than SEC      regulation.       However, it is our contention that Section 1504, in line      with the broader purpose of the Dodd Frank Act, i.e.      mitigating systemic financial market risk, plays an essential      role in containing behaviours related to extractive sector      activity that contribute to damaging levels of financial and      economic instability.       As you know, Section 1504 calls for the provision of      detailed publicly-available information regarding payments to      government. The purpose of such disclosure is to: a) defuse      suspicions by civil society; b) curb the incidence of      corruption and fiscal mismanagement; c) and thereby reduce      the social and political risk factors that drive high levels      of operating risk in resource-dependent emerging nations. The      latter notably exacerbates the volatility and risk in the      commodities markets. It is precisely because of its role in      helping to counteract these damaging pressures that we regard      Section 1504 as very much in the interests of investors, and      consistent with the basic mission of the       Nevertheless, as investors, we are sympathetic to the      concerns of industry regarding the practical impacts of any      new legislation in terms of potential administrative      complexity and cost burden, particularly in respect of      companies that operate in multiple jurisdictions. As such, it      is imperative that the disclosure regulations introduced by      Section 1504 reflect alignment between the US, EU and      Canada--all key jurisdictions for extractive industry      issuers. Firstly, this would simplify compliance for      extractive companies, particularly for those that already      have dual listings. Secondly, it would lift overall      transparency standards while deterring less scrupulous      issuers from actively seeking out more opaque regulatory      regimes. Such `forum-shopping' would not only harm well-     governed companies through unfair competition, but expose      investors to higher risk, and the general public to greater      systemic risk.       Our strong interest as investors is therefore to achieve      both consistency across competing jurisdictions and high      standards, rather than regarding them as necessarily mutually      exclusive. In this regard, the moves by the EU and Canada to      follow in Dodd Frank 1504's footsteps signal a clear trend      that is now very difficult to reverse: transparency has      firmly taken hold, and it would be a mistake to roll      backwards.       As a large group of diverse investment institutions, we      acknowledge that different investors may make greater or      lesser use of the granular data produced through such      disclosure for individual stock decision purposes, depending      on the nature of their portfolios and investment processes.      However, while individual investment strategies may differ,      we are strongly of the view that disclosure of the type      called for by Section 1504 affords the following benefits to      investors:       Putting such information in the public domain is of major      indirect benefit to investors, thanks to its impact on the      overall quality of the business climate: better transparency      helps to build trust with the citizenry, deter corruption      through better scrutiny of revenues and spending, and reduce[[Page S653]]     the likelihood of contract rescissions. An anonymous      compilation of the submissions required by Section 1504 would      likely not provide the information necessary to serve this      purpose.       The value of such a standard lies in its consistent      application across all global markets: this means that      country exemptions should not be granted in cases where      foreign jurisdictions wish to impose secrecy--otherwise, such      exemptions, often referred to as the ``tyrant's veto'', will      merely serve to encourage such governments to introduce anti-     transparency standards, thereby undermining the very object      of this regulation.       The impact of such disclosure on competitiveness has been      overstated, as demonstrated by the strong support afforded to      Section 1504's Canadian equivalent by the leading trade      associations in the Canadian mining sector (Mining      Association of Canada and Prospectors and Developers      Association of Canada), and the more nuanced position of the      Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers relative to the      American Petroleum We also note that this      information can be easily obtained by purchasing specialist      research--which merely ensures that it is available to      competitors who can afford to pay, but not to citizens who      cannot. More importantly, as investors, we stand to benefit      more from efficient, competitive markets that enable ethical      behaviour than we do from isolated instances of companies      gaining a temporary negotiating advantage through secrecy.       The impact on companies' compliance costs should be given      due consideration, and we would therefore urge that with      regard to the definition of `project', the disclosure      framework in Section 1504 be consistent with best practice      for disclosing disaggregated production information that      references the legal relationship between individual projects      and host governments. Such an approach may be modeled on the      project-level disclosures that have been developed under the      EU Directives and also made by Statoil, the large Norwegian-     based international oil company, as well as Tullow Oil, the      FTSE100 UK oil company. These base their definition, either      implicitly or explicitly, on economic rather than geological      entities (so-called `payment liability'), which we regard as      a cost-efficient way of mirroring internal corporate      reporting. We recommend a single consistent standard in      preference to allowing companies to self-define project      boundaries for two reasons: 1) a multiplicity of reporting      standards would cause confusion and drive up compliance      costs; 2) flexibility for companies would also risk      undermining the aim of the regulation. Such a standard should      also require a consistent and reasonable degree of      disaggregation, as this would meet the aims of the      regulation, namely improving fiscal governance at both      national and subnational level.       In conclusion, we are pleased to signal our strong support      for the SEC's leadership in establishing a mandatory      reporting standard in the extractives sector that is      complementary to the EITI, aligned with equivalent standards      in the EU and Canada, and designed pragmatically to deliver      the very real benefits that we see coming from enhancing      fiscal transparency and accountability in resource-dependent      emerging nations. The SEC has demonstrated great diligence in      appreciating the changing needs of investors through the      implementation of Section 1504. We remain confident that the      Commission will see the process through to a conclusion that      fulfills its mission and advances the interests of all its      stakeholders.       We thank you for your attention to this submission, and      remain at your disposal for any further information or      clarification.                                  ____                                                   April 28, 2014.     Mary Jo White,     Chair, U.Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington,                Dear Chair White: As investors representing more than $2.85      trillion in assets under management, we applaud the U.     Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its leadership      in producing final rules for the implementation of Section      1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer      Protection Act [Section 13(q) of the Securities Exchange Act      of 1934]. The rules the SEC adopted for the implementation of      Section 13(q) on August 22, 2012 would protect investors and      promote efficient capital markets by providing investors with      valuable factual information on risk profiles and company      performance. Delay in implementation of these rules or their      significant revision would continue to deny investors this      valuable information.       The opportunities and challenges of both operating and      investing in the oil, gas and mining industries have changed      significantly in recent decades as companies have been      increasingly compelled to explore and produce in countries      with challenging governance and business environments,      including some with pervasive corruption. We believe that      Section 13(q) creates a chance for disclosure requirements to      evolve in a manner that reflects the changing dynamics of      these industries.       Investors' decisions regarding the oil, gas and mining      industries and the efficient functioning of markets in      general rely on the public disclosure of relevant information      from issuers that is comprehensive and consistent. Therefore,      we agree with the Commission's August 2012 rules for Section      13(q) that require issuer-by-issuer, government-level, and      project-level public disclosures and believe that these are      beneficial to investors.       Issuers' annual public Exchange Act reporting is an      indispensable factor for investment decision-making. It must      be done on a basis that allows investors to make decisions      about the securities of individual issuers. An anonymous      compilation of the submissions required by Section 13(q)      would likely not provide the information necessary to serve      this purpose. It is in the interest of both investors and      issuers that the data disclosed pursuant to Section 13(q)      maintains consistency across each issuer's operations.      Following the enactment of Section 13(q), other jurisdictions      have responded with complementary regulatory efforts, most      notably the European Union Accounting and Transparency      Directives and Canada's commitment to establish mandatory      payment transparency reporting standards. Consistency with      these reporting mandates requires payment information for all      countries in which issuers operate, without exception.       Section 13(q) and its complementing regulations also      require project-level disclosure. It would be most beneficial      to investors if this disclosure were consistent with best      practice for disclosing disaggregated production information      that references the legal relationship between individual      projects and host governments. Such an approach may be      modeled on the project-level disclosures made by Statoil, the      large Norwegian-based international oil company, as well as      Tullow       The SEC has demonstrated great diligence in appreciating      the changing needs of investors through the implementation of      Section 13(q). We also welcome the parallel comment submitted      by Allianz Global Investors et al., and note the common      objectives our respective groups of signatories share in      promoting high standards of transparency in the extractives      sector. We remain confident that the Commission will see the      process through to a conclusion that fulfills its obligations      and advances the interests of all parties.

We have these 30 countries that followed us and passed the rules and the laws the same as we did. We have on our side, the American Catholic Bishops, the Conference of Bishops, the Presbyterian Church, groups like the One Campaign and Oxfam--public interest groups that made their mission trying to end corruption and deal with the economic and social distress and devastation brought on by some of these companies and some of these kleptomaniacal--for want of a better term--governments.

I think that really sums it up, how important it is that we defeat this bill, how important it is that this President, who came to town and has been in office less than about 2 weeks, his second week in office--his campaign was all about drain the swamp, and one of the first things he did, with his Republican House and Senate Members following along like sheep, they have done this. It is just incredible how they moved so quickly to side with the autocrats, to side with the Russians, to side with Big Oil, to side with ExxonMobil and these autocrats in places like Iran and It is not a good commentary on this body. I am sorry to see it.  I ask my colleagues to vote no.  I yield back my time.

11360,topic-id,694,"Mr.Speaker, you can divide this country into two classes of people, not Republican and Democrat but the political class and the rest of the country. The political class is doing better than ever.  Eleven out of 20 of the richest counties in America are in the D.metro area. For every dollar the average family in D.earns, the average family in Davie County, where I live, earns 55 cents.  The political class is alive and doing well for themselves. On the other hand, those who are not oriented to government--doctors, auto mechanics, waitresses, bartenders, factory workers--are still earning exactly what they did 10 years ago. I am not the first person to point this out, but I want to speak about a textbook example of how this dynamic plays out in reality.  I am referring to a recently announced $418 million arms deal between the U.and It is for 12 airplanes that are essentially armed crop dusters. There is only one slight problem with the deal, the defense contractor that was chosen to fulfill the sale doesn't even make these type of airplanes. They have never done it before. In fact, there is an extra $130 million built into this deal to design a whole new airplane.  IOMAX USA, a service-disabled, veteran-owned small business in my district, makes these airplanes. They have been doing it for 7 years. They have got 50 of these airplanes in the Middle These planes have dropped more than 4,000 bombs on They are the only U.manufacturer of this type of aircraft.  They were not even considered for the deal, which was awarded without competition. Nobody got a chance to bid. Nobody knew about it, except for the company that got it and the bureaucrats who were involved.  That is how the D.area got so wealthy. If you know the right people and you have the right lobbyists, you get awards like this from the Federal Government without competition. It doesn't matter if you don't even make the product, they will give you some extra money to design it from scratch if you know the right people.  IOMAX, a small business just like the millions of others in our country, doesn't have those connections. The giant defense contractor involved in this deal does, and so they get the money. Something is wrong with that picture.  The problem lies with a secretive acquisition unit within the Air Force called Big Now, I don't say ``secretive'' lightly.  At one point in 2013, Big Safari's commanding officer told a reporter: Don't be angry or upset when your Freedom of Information Act gets turned down; that is just they way we do business here at Big And the commander's words were true.  I asked for information on this, and they turned me down saying that the information was sensitive, but unclassified, and for official use only. I asked them 19 questions, and they answered only four of them having to do with the very basic elements for the deal that were already public.  Under that secrecy, Big Safari doles out billions in government contracts. I imagine it makes things convenient for when Big Safari employees go to work for the same companies to which they direct these large defense contracts, which we have found that they do with some regularity. You don't even have to go to a different building, in some instances. We have got a confirmed case of a Big Safari employee awarding a contract, quitting, and then going to work on the same program with the same company he has just given the contract to.  The forgotten men in this equation are the employees of IOMAX, mostly veterans, mostly blue collar, who have to compete against a $13 billion defense contractor and a $4 trillion Federal Government that appears to have forgotten impartiality.  We need to shine the light on this deal with congressional oversight, and we need to ask ourselves who exactly the Federal Government is supposed to be working for, the country or for the political class.  Mr.Speaker, we need to fix this.

11446,topic-id,1956,"I thank the Speaker for the recognition.  Mr.Speaker, October of last year, October of 2016, Bill Clinton, speaking in front of a group of people in Michigan, said:       So you have got this crazy system. There are all these      people out there who are busting it sometimes 60 hours a      week, and they wind up with their premiums doubled and their      coverage cut in half. It is the craziest thing in the world.  Mr.Speaker, I don't often agree with former President Bill Clinton, but that quote pretty much sums up why we are here doing what we are doing this week with trying to fix the problems inherent in the Affordable Care  Now, sometimes people turning in and watching these hours must wonder how can it be we are talking about the same thing where one side says it is good and one side says it is not. Mr.Speaker, it may help to set some of the historical context. I would like to do that tonight. I would like to talk about the beginnings of what we now know as the Affordable Care Some people refer to it as  This is a bill that was signed into law 7 years ago this month, but it didn't just spring forth. There was a lot of work involved in bringing it forward and getting it heard and getting it voted on on the floor of this I was part of the Energy and Commerce Committee that summer, as I still am today. The Energy and Commerce Committee did hear what was then H.3100, several hours of markup in the committee, several days of markup. Other committees marked it up, and H.3100 was a 1,000-page bill that left our committee. I didn't vote for the bill. I didn't think it was a good idea, but it did have Republican amendments at the end of that process.  That bill then went to the Speaker's Office--not to the Budget Committee, but to the Speaker's Speaker Pelosi put it together, and when it emerged, it was a 2,000-page bill that really didn't have much to do with the bill that was marked up in the committee. But, nevertheless, the bill came to the floor of this House; and in November of 2009, after a significant amount of debate, a significant amount of anxiety expressed on the Republican side and even some on the Democratic side, the bill was passed by a very slim majority. The bill went over to the Senate, and that was the end of that bill.  What happened next was there were--it was not exactly a bill--several drafts of several ideas that people had over on the Senate side; and the Senate took up a bill that the House had previously passed, H.3590 was the number of that bill, and the Senate debated and passed that bill on Christmas Eve of 2009. You may remember there was a snowstorm that was descending upon Washington, kind of a familiar story, a snowstorm that was coming to town. The Senators wanted to get home before the snowstorm hit, and they passed H.3590.  Remember, back in those days, the Democrats had a 60-vote majority in the They were able to cut off debate and pass the bill on a party-line vote with 60 Democratic Senators voting in favor of that bill.  Then something strange happened. The Democrats actually lost a Senate seat in a special election in the State of Massachusetts that they weren't expecting to lose. As a consequence of losing that Senate seat, now, instead of a 60-vote majority, they had a 59-vote majority, so they actually could not cut off debate. It was not a filibuster-proof majority.  Harry Reid told Nancy Pelosi, who was then the Speaker of the House: Well, I have done everything I can do. You are just going to have to pass our bill as it is. I can't make any changes to it.  Speaker Pelosi wisely said--I am paraphrasing here because I don't remember the exact quote--but I think she said: I haven't got 100 votes for that thing over here in the  I think she was right. But they worked on it, and President Obama worked on it, and 3 months later, in March of 2010, indeed, they did bring that vote up in the House, passed exactly what had passed in the As a consequence, since the Senate bill was actually an amendment to a House bill that didn't have anything to do with health care in the first place, but since it was only an amendment to a House bill that had passed the House, so many as are in favor agree with the amendment to the Senate bill, the number being 218, that bill went down to the President for a signing ceremony that very same week. Thus was born the Affordable Care  Now, what has led us to the point where former President Bill Clinton would say that it is a crazy system? Well, there is a lot of discussion back and forth.  Certainly, Republicans took the majority shortly after that bill was signed into law. I would submit that because that bill was signed into law, Republicans regained the majority in the House of Representatives in 2011 and since that time have had a number of votes either trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act or improve the Affordable Care A number of those votes have, indeed, been bipartisan votes, that is, Democrats have voted with                              {time}  2030  I think the total count is there have been 47 Democratic votes to either repeal, replace, reform, or repair the Affordable Care It really has been a bipartisan effort these past 7 years.  We are where we are today because of the problems that exist in the bill. Despite the talk that we heard in the last hour, people are suffering under this.  There is a gentleman back home in my district. I think he is a plumber by profession. He has previously been diagnosed with bladder cancer. He says, under his Affordable Care Act policy, he gets to go see his primary care doctor once a year. His primary care doctor says, Well, you need to go to a urologist to have your cystoscopy, but his deductible is so high, he doesn't do it. He has got access to insurance, but he doesn't really have access to the kind of care that he needs that could be lifesaving and could prevent him from having a much greater problem down the road.  We can all bring our individual stories out, but the fact of the matter is, access to coverage is not the same thing as access to care.  During the course of the campaign this last fall--and I remember this very specifically because November 1 was the day that the new rates came out--the open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act opened up on November 1, and people got a glimpse of what their marketplace rates were.  As a consequence of those marketplace rates, people started to pay attention. There was still another week to go before election day, and people started to pay a significant amount of attention to what the rates were.  It isn't just the rates. It is the access. One-third of U.counties have only one insurer willing to sell in marketplace in those counties. I think the number is either five or seven States that have entire States with only one insurance company. That is not really choice. That is not really access. That, in fact, is a monopoly.  2017 was a year marked by a sharp rise in premium increases across the country. Seven States saw premium increases of more than 50 percent. Texas was about 25 percent. Some States went up over 100 percent.  The individual mandate, which was part and parcel of the Affordable Care Act, the most coercive Federal legislation passed since the income tax passed 100 years ago--the individual mandate is the reason that the Affordable Care Act has never achieved widespread popularity. But even with the individual mandate--that is, we are going to send the Internal Revenue Service out and make them make you buy health insurance--over 19 million taxpayers elected to pay the mandate penalty or claim a hardship exemption.  There were 6.5 million individuals who paid the penalty and over 12.5 million people claimed a hardship exemption, according to the Internal Revenue Service's own files.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 10.5 million individuals enrolled in an exchange plan through the first half of 2016. More than twice that number chose to either exempt themselves through a hardship waiver or just simply pay the fine and walk away from the obligation to purchase insurance.  I am firmly of the belief that the individual mandate has no place in a free society. The one central thesis of the[[Page H2234]]Affordable Care Act that I long to see repealed is the repeal of the individual mandate. While we are at it, we might as well take care of the employer mandate.  By the way, President Obama delayed the employer mandate for 2 full years, not by a House passed bill, but by administrative fiat. He simply decided, prior to the Fourth of July in 2013: You know what? The employer mandate is going to cause trouble in the next congressional election, so I will just suspend it.  In a blog post put up by Valerie Jarrett on the evening of July 2, 2013, the employer mandate was simply suspended for a couple of years because it was felt to be too onerous and because of the effect that they feared it would have on the midterm elections in 2014.  Time after time, the Obama administration took it upon themselves to delay or turn back a portion of their own law, and there were multiple times where there were votes taken on this floor.  I think of the 1099, the paperwork that was going to be required in the business-to-business transactions; the 1099 forms that were required under ObamaCare that were repealed by this House in a bipartisan fashion because it did pass in the Senate, and the Senate was controlled by Democrats at the time.  Also, the CLASS Act, a particularly onerous part of the community living access ostensibly to provide some help with long-term care, except it really didn't. It was in an actuarial death spiral even before it was enacted. It was one of those things in the Affordable Care Act where you paid for 10 years of taxes and got 6 years of benefits. When they got finished collecting the taxes, it was decided they better do away with the benefit because, in fact, there was no benefit there at all.  Time after time, in a bipartisan fashion, this House has taken action to restrict or remodel or repair or repeal portions of the Affordable Care We are now coming up on a time where significant change is going to occur in the issuance of health care in this country. The change is going to be tough. We always knew it would be, but it is the right change.  The Energy and Commerce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Budget Committee have put together legislation that we will be hearing up in the Rules Committee later this week; the American Health Care Act, which will come to the floor before the end of this week. Let me just make a prediction: it will pass the floor of this  I see that I am joined by a colleague this evening.

11450,topic-id,793,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for participating this evening. It means a lot to me individually that he was willing to come up and stay up late with us tonight yet one more night dealing with the Affordable Care  But the gentleman is quite direct. The journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. It is a three-part program. This was the first part, the first phase that will happen on Thursday night. This deals with some of the more egregious aspects of the Affordable Care Act, those things that can be tackled through Senate rules of reconciliation that only require 51 Senators to get passed. So that is one part of this.  Another part is the administrative part. And our former colleague from Georgia, Tom Price, a physician, who is now Secretary Tom Price for the Department of Health and Human Services, he has an administrative part that is actually already underway. We don't have to wait for that to happen. It is already occurring.  Then there is the third part, the so-called regular order part, the part that will require 60 votes on the Senate side, the part that is, by its very nature, going to be bipartisan. We have reported two rules out of the Committee on Rules tonight, one on the McCarran-Ferguson changes that I think the gentleman is well aware of. There are already additional bills that will be coming to the floor of the House that are separate and apart from this reconciliation bill, which is just the first step in repealing the Affordable Care  I do want to point out that Secretary Price sent a letter to the Governors last week or a week and a half ago now talking about some of the waivers that he is bringing forward right now, the 1332 waivers, which are waivers for parts of the Affordable Care  Quoting from his letter here: ``Under Section 1332 of the ACA, states can apply for State Innovation Waivers and pursue innovative strategies to adapt many of the law's requirements to suit the state's specific needs.''  So many details to receive approval, what a State has to do, but he really stresses in this letter and in one of the last paragraphs: ``We encourage states interested in applying for Section 1332 waivers to reach out to the Departments promptly for assistance in formulating an approach that meets the requirements of Section 1332.''  I know the gentleman hasn't served here that long, but I will just tell you, that is a sea change of difference from the Federal agency which time after time told our Governors: Go back to go. Do not collect $200. You can't do that.  Now we have a Secretary at the agency who is reaching out to the Governors: Governor, we want to help you make this work for you. We are going to provide the flexibility that you need.  One of the things that I think is perhaps most promising is the hybrid, high-risk pool, State-operated reinsurance programs that have been proven in several States already. States that were in a so-called death spiral because of guaranteed issue community rating, the premiums were going up, people were dropping their coverage. And now these States have expanding coverage even without the things that we are providing in the American Health Care Act that we are going to be doing later this week. But already by providing that flexibility at the agency level, States are able to provide some relief for their citizens.  Then, finally, the part three of this. There are going to be some must-pass healthcare bills that will be coming up through our committee. We will have an opportunity to work on those things. We are going to work on the Food and Drug Administration user fee agreement reauthorization. So we will have that, which can happen as a bipartisan exercise in our committee.  I will just stress, the Committee on Energy and Commerce has a history of doing things in a bipartisan fashion. One of the reasons why I enjoy serving on that committee is it is a thoughtful committee and it does do things in a bipartisan fashion. Generally, that is one of the strengths of the committee as it brings legislation to the floor.  This is an important first step. It is a necessary first step. This is the key that gets us through the door of actually making a meaningful impact on cost and coverage in these United It has been 7 long years, but I am anxious and eager to get started on the next part of the process.

11481,topic-id,5327,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, we all know why we are here--the problems that exist within the Affordable Care It is simply not working for the American people--limited choice, costs going up, and millions without access to care. Unfortunately, these are not just talking points, but real issues affecting real  The Affordable Care Act has damaged the individual market. It has driven insurers away from offering coverage. Now, we are seeing one-third of all United States counties with only one insurer. And among the plans that have chosen to remain in the markets, there have been widespread, double-digit premium increases.  The individual markets are a death spiral and are failing to live up to the promises made 7 years ago--that Americans would be able to receive affordable health care. As we knew then, and we know now, this was an empty promise that has left an estimated 19.2 million Americans without coverage. What is worse, these individuals are forced to pay the individual mandate penalty or seek a hardship exemption because of the costs to purchase and use health insurance.  Nine months ago, Mr.Speaker, we began our Better Way plan to save the Nation's healthcare system and to bring relief to the American people. This plan, which served as the blueprint for the American Health Care Act, laid out the policies to stabilize the collapsing insurance markets and to repeal the more burdensome Affordable Care Act taxes and mandates that have hindered innovation and limited access to care. So let's take a look at what the American Health Care Act does.  First and foremost, it provides immediate relief to the State insurance markets. As Republicans, we know that one-size-fits-all works for no one and certainly did not work for the individual markets. The States should have the flexibility to support their insurance markets and ensure that plans can continue to provide options for coverage.  To do this, we relaxed two of the egregious market regulations that were imposed under the Affordable Care Act: the mandate that premiums cannot vary for younger and older Americans by more than a 3-to-1 ratio, and the mandate creating fixed actuarial values for plans.  The mandate limiting a plan's ability to set premiums by age has driven up the cost for coverage for younger and healthier Americans and has pushed away those seeking coverage by the millions. Of the 19.2 million Americans who have sidestepped the individual mandate, it estimated that as many as 45 percent of these individuals are under the age of 35. Without these younger Americans seeking coverage, the markets have further plunged into death spirals, as insurers hike up premiums year after year.  To change this, we are relaxing the ratio to 5-to-1. It will lower premium costs and provide necessary opportunities to stabilize the markets.  Additionally, we are repealing the actuarial values mandate to provide insurers with additional flexibility to offer more coverage options.                              {time}  0930  To further supplement these efforts, we are establishing the Patient and State Stability This fund provides States with $100 billion over 10 years to promote innovative solutions to lower cost and increase access to health care for unique patient populations in each The goal is simple: to provide States with maximum flexibility as to how they address the cost of care for their citizens.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a combination of the Stability Fund and other proposed changes to the market would reduce premiums by 10 percent by calendar year 2026. We all want patients to have access to high-quality, affordably priced coverage. The Patient and State Stability Fund can help to lower costs.  In Medicaid, in addition to supporting the insurance market, the American Health Care Act provides needed reforms to the Medicaid program. Without changes, the Medicaid expansion alone is expected to cost $1 trillion over the next decade. Medicaid desperately needs reform so that States can continue to provide coverage to children, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups.  To address these concerns, the American Health Care Act first phases out the Medicaid expansion, the expansion that has crippled State budgets and limited States' ability to ensure that[[Page H2377]]resources will continue to be available for those vulnerable populations.  Additionally, our bill helps further bend the Medicaid cost curve by shifting programs toward per capita allotments. The per capita allotments, an idea that originated during the Clinton administration, will set limits on the annual cost for growth for per capita expenditures for which the States will receive matching funds from the Federal  The American Health Care Act increases the amount of flexibility that States have in managing their Medicaid programs. The bill scales back the Affordable Care Act mandates that have limited a State's ability to tailor their plans to the needs of their beneficiaries. States can and should be trusted to manage the needs of their beneficiaries, and this bill allows States to do that.  Additionally, the bill before us today furthers the goal of providing the States with greater flexibility in managing their Medicaid programs by providing States with the option to implement two additional opportunities: work requirement and block grants for  This time around we chose to engage our State counterparts in the discussion and listen--listen--to their input as we designed this bill. At the top of their list were the desire to see the work requirement built in and the opportunity to work with Medicaid as a block grant.  We don't tell them what to do. They are given the permission to do what they feel is best for their citizens. Republicans trust the States and trust the Governors and the elected leaders in those  Finally, the American Health Care Act provides additional resources to bolster State safety net providers. The bill provides increases in the community health center funding, offers enhanced funding to support safety net providers in States that did not expand Medicaid, and ends the cuts to the disproportionate share hospital payments.  We are committed, Mr.Speaker, to ensuring that our local providers can continue to deliver lifesaving care. The American Health Care Act turns this commitment into action. For millions of Americans in rural and medically underserved areas, these actions will provide needed relief that was undercut by the Affordable Care  Let me just say, Mr.Speaker, it has been an interesting process. We had a 27\1/2\-hour markup in the Energy and Commerce We have had over 15 or 16 hours in the Rules This bill has been almost talked to death.

Medicare       Our members and older Americans believe that Medicare must      be protected and strengthened for today's seniors and future      generations. We strongly oppose any changes to current law      that could result in cuts to benefits, increased costs, or      reduced coverage for older According to the 2016      Medicare Trustees report, the Medicare Part A Trust Fund is      solvent until 2028 (11 years longer than pre-Affordable Care      Act (ACA)), due in large part to changes made in the We      have serious concerns that the American Health Care Act      repeals provisions in current law that have strengthened      Medicare's fiscal outlook, specifically, the repeal of the      additional 0.9 percent payroll tax on higher-income workers.      Repealing this provision could hasten the insolvency of      Medicare by up to 4 years and diminish Medicare's ability to      pay for services in the future.                           Prescription Drugs       Older Americans use prescription drugs more than any other      segment of the U.population, typically on a chronic basis.      We are pleased that the bill does not repeal the Medicare      Part D coverage gap (``donut hole'') protections created      under the Since the enactment of the law, more than 11.8      million Medicare beneficiaries have saved over $26.8 billion      on prescription drugs. We do have strong concerns that the      American Health Care Act repeals the fee on manufacturers and      importers of branded prescription drugs, which currently is      projected to add $25 billion to the Part B trust fund between      2017 and 2026. AARP believes Congress must do more to reduce      the burden of high prescription drug costs on consumers and      taxpayers and is willing to work with you on bipartisan      solutions.                  Individual Private Insurance Market       About 6.1 million older Americans age 50-64 currently      purchase insurance in the non-group market, and nearly 3.2      million are currently eligible to receive subsidies for      health insurance coverage through either the federal health      benefits exchange or a state-based exchange (exchange). We      have seen a significant reduction in the number of uninsured      since passage of the ACA, with the number of 50-64 year old      Americans who are uninsured dropping by half.       Affordability of both premiums and cost-sharing is critical      to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access      health care. A typical senior seeking coverage through an      exchange has a median annual income of under $25,000 and      already pays significant out-of-pocket costs for health care.      We have serious concerns that the bill under consideration      will dramatically increase health care costs for 50-64 year      olds who purchase health care through an exchange due both to      the changes in age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that      requires uninsured older Americans to pay three times more      than younger individuals) to 5:1 and reductions in current      subsidies for older       Age rating plus premium increases equal an unaffordable age      tax. Our previous estimates on the age-rating change showed      that premiums for current coverage could increase by up to      $3,200 for a 64-year-old, while reducing premiums by only      about $700 for a younger enrollee. Significant premium      increases for older consumers will make insurance less      affordable, will not address their expressed concern of      rising premiums, and will only encourage a small increase in      enrollment numbers for younger persons. In addition, the bill      proposes to change current subsidies based on income and      premium levels to a flatter tax credit. The change in      structure will dramatically increase premiums for older      consumers. We estimate that the bill's changes to current      law's tax credits could increase premium costs for a 55-year-     old earning $25,000 by more than $2,300 a year. For a 64-     year-old earning $25,000 that increase rises to more than      $4,400 a year, and more than $5,800 for a 64-year-old earning      $15,000. When we examined the impact of both the tax credit      changes and 5:1 age rating, our estimates find that, taken      together, premiums for older adults could increase by as much      as $3,600 for a 55-year-old earning $25,000 a year, $7,000      for a 64-year-old earning $25,000 a year and up to $8,400 for      a 64-year-old earning $15,000 a year. In addition to these      skyrocketing premiums, out-of-pocket costs could      significantly increase under the bill with the elimination of      cost sharing assistance in current law. The cost sharing      assistance has provided relief on out-of-pocket costs (like      deductibles and certain benefits) for low-income individuals      who are some of the most financially vulnerable marketplace      participants.              Medicaid and Long-Term Services and Supports       AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act      that create a per capita cap financing structure in the      Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions      could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of      individuals who depend on the essential services provided      through Medicaid is a vital safety net and      intergenerational lifeline for millions of individuals,      including over 17.4 million low-income seniors and children      and adults with disabilities who rely on the program for      critical health care and long-term services and supports      (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily[[Page H2378]]     activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, managing      medications, and transportation).       Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65      and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly      Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults      living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor      or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and      Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost      33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a      relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a      disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid      spending.       Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults      rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and      community based services (HCBS) for assistance with daily      activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home      modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as      hearing aids and eyeglasses. People with disabilities of all      ages also rely on Medicaid for access to comprehensive acute      health care services. For working adults, Medicaid can help      them continue to work; for children, it allows them to stay      with their families and receive the help they need at home or      in their community. Individuals may have low incomes, face      high medical costs, or already spent through their resources      paying out-of-pocket for LTSS, and need these critical      services. For these individuals, Medicaid is a program of      last resort.       In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person,      this approach to financing would likely result in      overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and      families unable to shoulder the costs of care without      sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to      program eligibility, services, or both--ultimately harming      some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens. In terms of      seniors, we have serious concerns about setting caps at a      time when per-beneficiary spending for poor seniors is likely      to increase in future years. By 2026, when Boomers start to      turn age 80 and older, they will likely need much higher      levels of service--including HCBS and nursing home--moving      them into the highest cost group of all seniors. As this      group continues to age, their level of need will increase as      well as their overall costs. We are also concerned that caps      will not accurately reflect the cost of care for individuals      in each state, including for children and adults with      disabilities and seniors, especially those living with the      most severe disabling conditions.       AARP is also opposed to the repeal of the six percent      enhanced federal Medicaid match for states that take up the      Community First Choice (CFC) CFC provides states with      a financial incentive to offer HCBS to help older adults and      people with disabilities live in their homes and communities      where they want to be. About 90 percent of older adults want      to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as      possible. HCBS are also cost effective. On average, in      Medicaid, the cost of HCBS per person is one-third the cost      of institutional care. Taking away the enhanced match could      disrupt services for older adults and people with      disabilities in the states that are already providing      services under       AARP has concerns with the removal of the state option in      Medicaid to increase the home equity limit above the federal      minimum. This takes away flexibility for states to adjust a      Medicaid eligibility criterion based on the specific      circumstances of each state and its residents beyond a      federal minimum standard.       Although we cannot support the American Health Care Act, we      are pleased that the bill does not repeal some of the      critical consumer protections included in the Affordable Care      Act, such as guaranteed issue, prohibitions on preexisting      condition exclusions, bans on annual and lifetime coverage      limits and allowing families to keep children on their      policies until the age of 26. Also, AARP does support      restoring the 7.5 percent threshold for the medical expense      deduction which will directly help older Americans struggling      to pay for health care, particularly the high cost of nursing      homes and other long-term services and supports.       We look forward to working with you to ensure that we      maintain a strong health care system that ensures robust      insurance market protections, controls costs, improves      quality, and provides affordable coverage to all           Sincerely,                                              Joyce Rogers,                                            Senior Vice President,     Government                                  ____                Vote NO to the American Health Care Act       The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on      the American Health Care Act (AHCA).       Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other      populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced      that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and      the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural The      AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural      America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more      uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure      crisis.       Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill will      improve the base bill, including increased tax credits for      Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 who would have seen      their premiums skyrocket under the current plan, the National      Rural Health Association is concerned that the bill still      falls woefully short in improving access and affordability of      health care for rural Additionally, the new      amendments to freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of      1, 2018, and reduce the Medicaid per-capita growth rate will      disproportionately harm rural       The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural      Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved      populations in our nation without coverage, and further      escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to      the Wall Street Journal, the ``GOP health plan would hit      rural areas hard . . . Poor, older Americans would see the      largest increase in insurance-coverage costs.'' The LA Times      reports ``Americans who swept President Trump to victory--     lower-income, older voters in conservative, rural parts of      the country--stand to lose the most in federal healthcare aid      under a Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable      Care Act.''       Let's be clear--many provisions in the ACA failed rural      The lack of plan competition in rural markets,      exorbitant premiums, deductibles and co-pays, the co-op      collapses, lack of Medicaid expansion, and devastating      Medicare cuts to rural providers--all collided to create a      health care crisis in rural However, it's beyond      frustrating that an opportunity to fix these problems is      squandered, and instead, a greater health care crisis will be      created in rural       Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural      health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect      it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain      access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America      are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to      protect rural patients' access to care. Three improvements      are critical for rural patients and providers:       1. Medicaid--Though most rural residents are in non-     expansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are      covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%).       Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is      different and thus requires different programs to succeed.      Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not      `bonus' payments, but rather alternative, cost-effective and      targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for      millions of rural patients and financial stability for      thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal      health care reform must protect a state's ability to protect      its rural safety net providers. The federal government must      not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities      to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to      care.       Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access      to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a      state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a      matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to      create stability among rural providers to maintain access to      care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent      to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers,      a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is      provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued      access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not      limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective      Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian Health      Service providers, and individual rural providers.       2. Market Reform--Forty-one percent of rural marketplace      enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing      70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack      of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums.      Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34      for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan).       Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes,      cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to      participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking,      poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural      Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and      less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance.      Rural communities have fewer health care providers for      insurers to contract with to provide an adequate network to      serve the community.       Any federal health care reform proposal must address the      fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural      markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies      are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for      participation and are currently not obliged to provide      service to markets with less advantageous risk pools.      Demographic realities of the rural population make the market      less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance      company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the      same way that financial service institutions are required to      provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable      insurance companies should be required to provide services in      underserved communities.       3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals--Rural hospitals      serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban),      thus across-the-board Medicare cuts do not have across the      board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad      debt decrease significantly. However, because of unaffordable      health plans in rural areas, rural patients still cannot      afford health care. Bad debt among rural hospitals has      actually increased[[Page H2379]]     50% since the ACA was passed. According to MedPAC ``Average      Medicare margins are negative, and under current law they are      expected to decline in 2016'' has led to 7% gains in median      profit margins for urban providers while rural providers have      experienced a median loss of 6%.       If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to      protect rural patients' access to care, could rapidly be      undone. The National Rural Health Association implores      Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the      nation.                                  ____                                               American Society of                                           Addiction Medicine,                                     Rockville, MD, March 8, 2017.     Kevin Brady,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Richard Neal,     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Greg Walden,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Frank Pallone,     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Brady, Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Neal      and Ranking Member Pallone: On behalf of the American Society      of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the nation's oldest and largest      medical specialty society representing more than 4,300      physicians and allied health professionals who specialize in      the treatment of addiction, I am writing to share our views      on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) that is being      considered by the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce      committees.       ASAM is very concerned that the AHCA's proposed changes to      our health care system will result in reductions in health      care coverage, particularly for vulnerable populations      including those suffering from the chronic disease of      addiction, and we cannot support the bill in its current      form.       More than 20 million Americans currently have health care      coverage due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including      millions of Americans with addiction. This coverage is a      critical lifeline for persons with addiction, many of whom      were unable to access effective treatment before the ACA's      expansion of Medicaid eligibility to low-income adults, and      its requirement that Medicaid expansion plans and plans sold      in the individual and small group market provide essential      health benefits (EHB) including addiction treatment services      at parity with medical and surgical services.       We are concerned that rolling back the Medicaid expansion,      sunsetting the EHB requirements for Medicaid expansion plans,      and capping federal support for Medicaid beneficiaries will      reduce coverage for and access to addiction treatment      services, changes that will be particularly painful in the      midst of the ongoing opioid epidemic. Moreover, while the      AHCA retains the EHB requirements for private plans, it      repeals the ACA's actuarial value requirements for those      plans. We are concerned that this could result in insurers      offering addiction treatment benefits in name only due to      higher costs and/or less robust benefits.       The Medicaid expansion in particular has led to significant      increases in coverage and treatment access for persons with      addiction. In states that expanded Medicaid, the share of      people with addiction or mental illness who were hospitalized      but uninsured fell from about 20 percent in 2013 to 5 percent      by mid-2015 and Medicaid expansion has been associated with      an 18.3 percent reduction in unmet need for addiction      treatment services among low-income adults. Rolling back the      Medicaid expansion and fundamentally changing Medicaid's      financing structure to cap spending on health care services      will certainly reduce access to evidence-based addiction      treatment and reverse much or all progress made on the opioid      crisis last year.       To be sure, ASAM supports flexibility in the Medicaid      program and has supported several states' applications for      1115 waivers to transform their addiction treatment systems      to offer all levels of care described by The ASAM Criteria;      Treatment Criteria for Addictive, Substance-Related, and Co-     Occurring However, ASAM has seen for decades how      states underfund addiction treatment services and waste      federal dollars on inefficient and ineffective care when they      are left to decide how to manage their federal Medicaid      dollars without mandates for parity and accountability to      cover appropriate care. Based on this experience, we      commended the Congress for requiring accountability for the      $1 billion in funding sent to the states to combat the opioid      epidemic authorized by 21st Century This funding is an      additional lifeline to suffering communities, but it will      come to an end while patients will continue to need treatment      for the chronic disease of addiction. When it does, the      Medicaid program must continue to fund appropriate addiction      treatment at parity with medical and surgical services.       ASAM has long advocated for broad access to high-quality,      evidence-based, individualized and compassionate treatment      services for persons suffering from the chronic disease of      addiction. The critical need for access to this type of care      has been heightened and highlighted by our nation's ongoing      epidemic of opioid addiction and related overdose deaths. The      ACA's Medicaid expansion, EHB requirements for addiction      treatment coverage, and extension of parity protections to      the individual and small group market have surely reduced the      burden of this epidemic and saved lives. As you consider this      legislation, we hope that parity protections will continue to      apply individual, small and large group plans as well as      Medicaid plans through the transition. Finally, throughout      this process, we implore you to keep in mind how your      decisions will affect the millions of Americans suffering      from addiction who may lose their health care coverage      entirely or see reductions in benefits that impede access to      needed treatment.           Sincerely,     Jeffrey Goldsmith, MD, DLFAPA, DFASAM,       President, American Society of Addiction                                  ____                                 American Medical Association,                                      Chicago, IL, March 22, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Due to projections      that enactment of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) will      result in millions of Americans losing health insurance      coverage, the American Medical Association (AMA) must express      our opposition to the proposal currently before the House of      The need to stabilize the individual      insurance market and make other improvements in the      Affordable Care Act is well understood. However, as      physicians, we also know that individuals who lack health      insurance coverage live sicker and die younger than those      with adequate coverage. We encourage all members of Congress      to engage in an inclusive and thorough dialogue on      appropriate remedies. We cannot, however, support legislation      that would leave health insurance coverage further out of      reach for millions of       Earlier this year, we shared with Congress key health      reform objectives that we believe are critical to improving      the health of the nation. Among these objectives are ensuring      that those currently covered do not lose their coverage,      maintaining market reforms, stabilizing and strengthening the      individual insurance market, ensuring that low and moderate-     income patients are able to secure affordable and adequate      coverage, and ensuring that Medicaid and other critical      safety net programs are maintained and adequately funded.      While we appreciate that the bill's authors have made efforts      to maintain some market reforms and that regulatory efforts      are underway to strengthen the individual insurance market,      as a whole the legislation falls short of the principles we      previously outlined.       Health insurance coverage is critically important. Without      it, millions of American families could be just one serious      illness or accident away from losing their home, business, or      life savings. The AMA has long supported the availability of      advanceable and refundable tax credits, inversely related to      income, as a means to assist individuals and families to      purchase health insurance. The credits proposed under the      AHCA are significantly less generous for those with the      greatest need than provided under current law. The reduced      purchasing power with the AHCA tax credits will put insurance      coverage out of reach for millions of       We also remain deeply concerned with the reduction of      federal support for the Medicaid program and the resulting      significant loss of coverage. Medicaid expansion has provided      access to critical services, including mental health and      substance abuse treatment, for millions. Not only will the      AHCA force many states to roll back coverage to these      millions of previously ineligible individuals, but the      significant reduction in federal support for the program will      inevitably have serious implications for all Medicaid      beneficiaries, including the elderly, disabled, children, and      pregnant women, as well.

11487,topic-id,365,"Mr.Speaker, 7 years ago yesterday, the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, became law. Since then, this law has resulted in canceled plans, higher premiums, fewer choices, increased deductibles, and less freedom for the American people.  Don't just take my word for it. Former Democratic President Bill Clinton said this about ObamaCare:  `` . . . the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half, and it's the craziest thing in the world.''  I tend to agree with President Clinton on this. ObamaCare is crazy. But for far too many Americans, it is the crazy reality they face every day.  So today is about a rescue mission. Today is about bringing relief to the families who are struggling under this failed law. Today it is about passing the American Health Care  ObamaCare is on a collision course with disaster. If Congress were to sit back and do nothing, ObamaCare would implode. This would leave millions of Americans with no insurance and the overall insurance market in a dangerous condition for the rest of us. So Congress must act.  That is where the American Health Care Act comes into play. This bill repeals ObamaCare along with its costly taxes and burdensome mandates. By doing this, we can lower premiums for hardworking  Most importantly, this bill gives Americans the freedoms, choices, and control they desperately want and deserve.  So, Mr.Speaker, the vote today is for the family in Monroeville who can't afford their premiums. The vote is for the small-business owner in Daphne who had his plan canceled. The vote is for the mother in Mobile whose deductible is too high. The vote is for the people in southwest Alabama and across all of America who are struggling under  This is our chance.

11738,topic-id,4017,"Mr.President, let me thank Senator Leahy for his comments. Ten years ago, I was privileged to be elected by the people of Maryland to represent them in the U.I came to the Senate with Senator Brown at that time. It was our first year. Senator Brown had the opportunity to serve on the Banking I had the opportunity to serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Today I hold the position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Senator Lugar held when I first went on the committee; that is, the ranking member of the committee.  I remember one of the very first hearings we had in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on resource, curse or blessing. It was a matter of concern to every single member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Democrats and We saw the faces of people from nations in Africa who had a resource wealth, but they had the resource curse. The people were living in horrible poverty. Yet the country had mineral wealth--gas and oil--that was being exploited but not for the benefit of the people. It was being used to obtain income for their leaders to funnel corrupt practices. Senator Lugar, in October of 2008, authored a committee report of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee entitled ``The Petroleum And Poverty Paradox: Assessing U.And International Community Efforts To Fight The Resource Curse.''  We went through the regular legislative process as to how we could deal with the circumstance that we knew the United States must exercise leadership. As Senator Brown has pointed out the whole history and the importance of it--and all of the details--I just want to fill in some of the details as to how this came about because we were looking for a way in which we could turn the wealth of a nation to its people and cut off the corruption that it funded. The corruption was not just the obscenity of wealth being used by their leaders--as Senator Brown pointed out in Equatorial Guinea--it was also the fact that this wealth that was coming to these leaders was also being used for criminal activities, to finance illegal drug activities and to finance terrorism.  I take issue with my friend from Oklahoma and his comments. There has never been an effort in this legislation to affect the supply of any source of energy here or anywhere around the world. That is being done. The question is, Where does the money go that is being used to exploit these resources? Do they go to the people of the country where the resource is located or do they go for corruption? That is what we attempted to do--Senator Lugar and I and others. I thank Senators Leahy and Durbin, who was on the floor earlier and was one of our early leaders, Senators Menendez and We did this not only in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time I was chairman of the Senate U.Helsinki Commission--the Helsinki Commission, and Senator Wicker was helping, we worked in that organization to see how we could deal with transparency and how the American leadership could help the international effort to end the resource curse. As a result, legislation was authored and introduced in order to try to deal with this issue. Senator Lugar and I authored a bill, a bill that said we want to know where the money is going so we can track the money. We wanted to be able, for the people of that nation, to say: We know money is coming in now. Our leaders show us where the money is going.  That legislation was introduced. It was debated. It became part of the Dodd-Frank law. Quite frankly, it was supported in a rather bipartisan way, and it became law. Ever since its enactment, it has been fought by the American Petroleum I am not sure why because today other countries have adopted similar standards. This information is readily available as far as the way it is compiled by companies. Many oil and mineral companies today are supplying this information with no complaints, no problems, but it was fought.  Tonight we are debating the use of the Congressional Review It was pointed out earlier tonight that before today, it only had been used once since its 1996 enactment. The reason is because it is a sledgehammer approach to dealing with issues that should be dealt with by a scalpel, but here is the real abuse. We are using the Congressional Review Act--which is supposed to be used when an agency goes rogue, when they start to do things that were never intended by Congress, were never authorized by Section 1504 was passed by Congress, and it has taken the SEC almost a decade to get the rules out. And we are saying they abused their power? Maybe they abused their power by delay, but they certainly haven't abused their power with what they have come forward with. They are carrying out congressional mandate as they should. It was never the intent of the CRA to be used for this type of a process. So I just urge my colleagues to recognize that this is not the right way we should be proceeding.  In September 2009, with Senator Lugar's help, I introduced legislation. It was bipartisan. Senators Merkley, Wicker, Schumer, Leahy, Durbin, Feinstein, Menendez, and others joined in that effort. The SEC was directed to develop rules on oil, gas, and mining companies as to how the disclosures could be made on the U.stock exchange so they could disclose their rights and payments made to foreign governments. That is what we mandated. Why do we want to know that? Because these royalties and payments were basically bribes to government leaders because it never went to the people. It was in the U.interest, not only because of how those funds were used against our principles and not only did it finance illegal activities, but it could have been a source for stable governments, which was important for U.interests that we have stable governments. It helps us in our foreign policy and national security. It also gives us a stable source of oil, gas, and minerals. Investors have the right to know. They have the right to know in what countries their companies are investing their stockholder investments.  It was a reasonable request by One of my colleagues indicated that it was held to be inappropriate by our courts. That was on a process issue. It was not on a substantive issue. That[[Page S640]]was corrected. A new rule has come out, and now we are using a CRA in order to block it. The rule, as it is currently worded, provides for a reasonable period for enforcement. So it is not even going into effect immediately because we are allowing the companies to have ample time in order to comply with the rule.  I just want to make this point. It creates a level playing field. It does not put American companies at a disadvantage. This is a level playing field. Thirty countries already require this. The EU requires this. Canada requires this. Do you want to know why they did it? Because the United States led. We passed the law. I met with the I met with the They said: This is a good bill. You are our leaders. You are doing it. We are going to do it also so they did it. It is in effect in these countries. Oil companies and mineral companies have complied with it. They are fine. Guess what. It wasn't difficult. Shell, BP, France's Total, Russian's Rosneft, Lukoil, Gazprom--their huge giant--all have reported. It has not caused any competitive problems. They are not losing any proprietary rights, as has been suggested. There has been no harm done.  When I listen to the cost-benefit analysis and listen to our distinguished chairman talk about the data is not really available, the reason the data is not available is because we don't have disclosure. If we get the information, then we will be able to tell exactly how we can deal with the problems in Ghana or Nigeria or in Equatorial Guinea or problems in so many countries where the people are hurting with some of the worst poverty rates in the world. We will be able to find that information out, but if we don't know what is being paid by U.companies, how do you do a cost-benefit analysis? I don't know how you could possibly do it.  I heard the numbers, the cost of compliance, and I would challenge that. I would challenge the cost of compliance numbers because this information is already available. Companies know where their money is going. It is a normal business issue. I heard it is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars of contracts. I don't want to minimize the cost, but as a percentage of the business they are doing, it is minor. The benefit we get if the money can go to the people and deal with these horrible conditions that we see in these resource-wealthy countries, then it is certainly worth the effort. That is part of our effort in dealing with other countries, to try to lift up the standard of living in so many of these countries.  So when we look at, again, what is at stake--what is at stake? And that is to allow the wealth of a country to go to its people for its stability. I have heard my colleagues say: Well, we are not against this. The law is still there. All we are talking about is this regulation. Once we pass this CRA, we are going to go back to work with the SEC and bring in a new rule. Do you really believe that? Do you really believe that if we pass this CRA, that we are going to see a new rule come out of the SEC? It has taken us 9 years to get to where we are right now. Do you really believe that with the law saying that the SEC cannot bring out a rule that is substantially the same in form, unless authorized by a subsequent law of Congress--do you really believe that will not be challenged in the courts with lengthy litigation before we will ever see another rule take effect?  Let us be clear about this. I am going to continue to do everything I can to make sure that the people of these nations get the wealth of their country. I am going to do everything I can. I am going to work with all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I really do believe in the sincerity of my colleagues, that they believe in this transparency. It is going to be tested. I am going to come back and see where we can make sure that 1504 is enforced because if I heard my chairman--and I respect him greatly, we work on a lot of issues together--when the chairman says that he is going to make sure the SEC complies with all congressional mandates--this is a congressional mandate--and it is our responsibility to make sure the SEC complies with Section 1504. If our colleagues pass this CRA--and I hope you don't--it is our responsibility to make sure the SEC complies with 1504. I am going to be here urging in every way I can to make sure that happens.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement from Publish What You Pay, which talks about a lot of the different aspects and myths that have been said, be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Publish What You Pay United States    Myth Busting: The Truth About the Cardin-Lugar Anti-Corruption                                Provision       The Cardin-Lugar Provision requires US-listed oil, gas and      mining companies to publicly disclose the project-level      payments they made to the U.and foreign governments for      the extraction of oil, gas and minerals.       The Cardin-Lugar provision is a landmark piece of      bipartisan legislation. The final anticorruption rule      implementing the Cardin-Lugar provision passed by the SEC in      June 2016 significantly advances international efforts to      curb corruption and has been applauded by investors,      companies and governments around the world. However, a great      deal of misinformation has been spread about the rule. Below      you will find evidence correcting the most glaring      inaccuracies put forward.       But before getting into the myths, here are some hard      facts.       Research concludes that increased transparency resulting      from the disclosures required by the Cardin-Lugar Rule could      lower the cost of capital for covered companies by $6.3      billion to $12.6 billion.       The international norm of resource sector payment      transparency, built on strong American leadership, is      estimated to have increased predicted global GDP by $1.1      trillion.       Investors representing nearly $10 trillion in assets under      management support of the Cardin-Lugar       Between 2011-2014 conflict linked to corruption in Libya      led to five U.S.-listed companies missing out on an estimated      $17.4 billion due to production disruptions.       Myth 1: Compliance costs for disclosure could reach as high      as $591 million per year.       Facts: The only comprehensive cost analysis submitted to      the SEC concluded that the total aggregate compliance cost to      industry in the first year would amount to $181M and would      not exceed $74 million per annum in subsequent years.       The $591 million number comes from an outdated SEC estimate      from the 2012 version of the final rule. The reason the      number is so high is because API claimed that there were      countries that prohibited disclosure and if companies were      forced to disclose they would have to hold a `fire-sale' of      all of their assets in that country--this number comes from      the assumption that every company would lose their assets in      these countries where disclosure was supposedly prohibited.      It is (1) disingenuous to quote this cost estimate from the      2012 regulation, instead of quoting form the 2016 regulation,      and (2) irrelevant because the SEC now allows for companies      to apply for an exemption if they believe disclosure is      prohibited in a country, therefore the above estimate is      wildly inaccurate.       Myth 2: U.companies are at a competitive disadvantage      because non-U.companies do not have to make the same      disclosures, and the rule applies only to public companies.       Facts: The U.law covers all oil, gas and mining      companies listed on U.stock exchanges not simply companies      based in the United Thus, the rule covers all      companies filing an annual report with the SEC both foreign      and domestic. This includes foreign oil majors BP, Shell, and      Total as well as leading state-owned oil companies from China      and Brazil, such as PetroChina and But a      significant number of foreign companies are already required      to make the same type of disclosures under the rules in other      jurisdictions.       Since the passage of Cardin-Lugar in 2010, important U.     allies have followed our leadership in payment transparency      and now 30 countries have adopted their own mandatory      disclosure rules for companies listed on their stock      exchanges. And while in many ways, the Canadian and EU      requirements are more stringent (and also cover private      companies), the laws in all jurisdictions have been deemed      equivalent by the Companies are allowed to submit the      same reports in all jurisdictions. These laws already cover      the vast majority of companies that compete with American      firms including Russia's state-owned companies, Gazprom and      Rosneft which are required to report in the       Myth 3: The SEC rule is burdensome.       Facts: The Cardin-Lugar Provision is a reporting      requirement, which is not onerous and does not limit the      operations of oil, gas, and mining companies; the rule simply      requires companies to publicly report payments that companies      would track in the normal course of doing business The rule      is a straightforward requirement to make that data      transparent and usable by investors and citizens. Leading      global oil and mining majors such as Shell, BP and Total,      along with Russian state-owned companies, are entering their      second year of reporting under EU rules without any negative      impact or reported issue. In fact, many major companies have      publicly endorsed this type of reporting[[Page S641]]     and have called on the U.to ensure our rules are      harmonized with those other markets.       Myth 4: The rule requires companies to disclose proprietary      information that could help foreign competitors.       Facts: The SEC rule requires companies to disclose payment      information; it does not mandate the disclosure of      proprietary, confidential or commercially sensitive      information by companies. Numerous companies are already      reporting under the similar rules in other markets, such as      Shell and BP, and none have reported any competitive harm      from payment transparency. However, the SEC's rule      nonetheless contains safeguards. To the extent a company      legitimately believes that disclosure will risk exposing      proprietary information, they can apply to the SEC for      exemptive relief on a case-by-case basis.       Furthermore, a competitor cannot use payment data to      ``reverse engineer'' a company's return on investment or the      contract terms of a specific project. Complex factors such as      access to technology and finance determine a company's      success in winning bids with host governments--not      transparency of payments. Extractive companies that are      covered by payment disclosure requirements in other      jurisdictions have continued to win bids.       Myth 5: This rule was not properly vetted by       Facts: The Cardin-Lugar Amendment enjoyed bipartisan      support and was subject to extensive review in both the House      and Senate, and it was unanimously supported in conference.      It is based on underlying legislation with a long      Congressional history that was the subject of multiple      hearings in both the House and In fact, the first      precursor was a Republican House resolution on oil and mining      transparency from 2006. For this reason, propositions to      repeal the rule signify an inappropriate use of the The      intent of the CRA is to address midnight rules, not rules      like 1504 that have undergone years of extensive regulatory      development.       Myth 6: The SEC rule will cause companies to lose out on      foreign contracts.       Facts: Opponents of the Cardin-Lugar anti-corruption      provision have claimed that companies could be placing      themselves at odds with legal or contractual prohibitions on      reporting in countries like Angola, China, Qatar, and      Cameroon and may subsequently lose out on business in those      countries due to the transparency rule. In the six years      since this law was passed, no company has produced evidence      that any country prohibits this type of disclosure, and      numerous submissions to the SEC have demonstrated no such      prohibitions exist. The experience of companies already      reporting under the parallel disclosure rules in other      countries likewise confirms the absence of any prohibition on      reporting; companies like BP and Shell have disclosed      project-level payments made in Angola, China, and Qatar with      no repercussions. Nor have these companies lost out on bids      because of payment disclosure requirements. Nonetheless, the      Cardin-Lugar provision contains safeguards to ensure that      companies that face a legitimate problem can apply for an      exemption from disclosure on a case by case basis.       Myth 7: The Cardin-Lugar provision has nothing to do with      the SEC or investors.       Facts: It is important to note that the SEC extractives      transparency rule is not a case of agency overreach. Congress      specifically mandated the SEC issue this rule in Section 1504      of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, and by issuing the 2016 rule the      SEC complied with the will of Both Senator Cardin      and Senator Lugar, the original sponsors of the bill, along      with Senators Leahy, Durbin, Brown, Warren, Baldwin, Markey,      Coons, Shaheen, Whitehouse, Menendez and Merkley, expressed      explicit support for the SEC's interpretation of Section 1504      during the rulemaking process.       The rule has significant benefits for investors. Throughout      the rulemaking process, investors worth nearly $10 trillion      of assets under management repeatedly emphasized their      support for payment disclosures under the rule. The rule      provides investors with critical information for assessing      risk in the often murky and unstable oil, gas and mining      sectors, with positive follow-on impacts for firms that      benefit from increased investor confidence and certainty. The      increased transparency resulting from this provision has been      estimated to lower the cost of capital for covered U.S.-     listed firms by $6.3 billion to $12.6 billion.       Myth 8: We don't need Cardin-Lugar because we have the      Foreign Corrupt Practices       Facts: While the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)      remains an important statutory tool critical to fighting      global corruption, its scope is confined to bribery. Bribery      is only one tool used to facilitate corruption. All too      often, it is the legal payments made to governments that are      misused, or siphoned off to the bank accounts of a country's      corrupt elites. However, the fact that companies are already      subject to the FCPA does mean the burden of reporting      payments to comply with the Cardin-Lugar rule is minimal;      companies are already required to collect and track payment      information as part of the books and records provision of the      In this way, the two laws work very well together in      creating a strong regulatory foundation to prevent      corruption.       Myth 9: This rule is the same as the one sent back to be      revised by the courts in 2013 and did not incorporate the      Court's or industry concerns.       Facts: The American Petroleum Institute filed suit to      challenge the original rule issued by the SEC in 2012,      despite its largest member companies claiming to support      transparency. The earlier version of the rule was vacated by      the court and sent back to the SEC in 2013 on narrow      procedural grounds, not on the substance of the rule. Since      then, the SEC has had another two years of public      consultations and internal analysis, resulting in an even      more robust record with substantial evidence supporting each      aspect of the 2016 rule. That evidence also includes the      experience of companies already reporting on their payments      under similar rules in other jurisdictions. The SEC's final      rule strikes an appropriate balance by requiring the level of      transparency Congress intended, while also accommodating      industry concerns by providing companies with the opportunity      to apply for case-by-case exemptions when they face reporting      challenges and a generous phase-in period. Reporting will      only begin at the end of 2018.       Myth 10: Sections 1504 (extractives transparency) and 1502      (conflict minerals) are the same thing/substantially similar.       Facts: Section 1504 requires U.S.-listed oil and mining      companies to annually disclose the company's major payments      made to the U.and foreign governments. It is simply a      financial disclosure of payments companies already track.       Section 1502 mandates that a certain set of companies using      tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold in their products undertake      supply chain due diligence and report annually to the SEC      regarding the source of the minerals used in their products      and whether the minerals are sourced in conflict areas in the      Democratic Republic of       Myth 11: The Cardin-Lugar rule poses a security risk for      American companies and their employees working abroad.       Facts: There is no evidence justifying the claims that the      Cardin-Lugar rule would have any negative impacts on      security. In fact, all available evidence points to the      contrary. The United Steelworkers explicitly argue that the      Cardin Lugar anti-corruption rule will enhance employee      safety. Generally, 1504 helps protect U.national security      interests by preventing the corruption, secrecy, and      government abuse that has catalyzed conflict, instability,      and violent extremist movements in Africa, the Middle East      and beyond. As ISIS demonstrated, non-state actors can      benefit from trading natural resources in order to finance      their operations; project level reporting will make hiding      imports from non-state actors more difficult, thereby      limiting their ability finance themselves with natural      resource revenues.       Myth 12: This law increases prices at the pump and takes      capital away from other business opportunities.

We are living today in a world with skyrocketing costs, plummeting choices, and broken promises across the board.  When you talk about the situation with respect to women in particular, when you talk about what is going to happen with maternity care and with child care, Mr.Speaker, there is a fundamental difference between what they believe on that side of the aisle and what we believe over here.  What we believe over here is that every American--every individual, and in that, we Republicans include women--we think women ought to have the right to make their own choices and their own decisions about care. We know that the kinds of insurance--the so-called insurance--that has been provided under ObamaCare means that women have been denied access to things like maternity care. When you can only get a policy with a $6,000 deductible, that is not care and that is not insurance.  This bill today is fundamental to being able to keep our promises to the American people, to being able to ensure that we have returned authority, we have returned power, and, yes, resources into the hands of individuals so people in Wyoming--in my home State--and all across this country can make their own healthcare decisions and no longer be forced to purchase things they don't want, don't need, and can't use to get coverage.

We do get along up here, amazingly enough. People think that we all just fight all the time and we have nothing no common. There are some big issues that do divide us, and that is why you have competitive elections with two parties and two different debates. But most folks up here get along, and are friends, and we do have legislation that we can work on, and this is one of those places where Mr.Collins and Mr.Goodlatte and other members of the Judiciary Committee worked with me and others to bring this bill to the floor.  The Equal Access to Justice Act will allow Americans to recover attorneys' fees and costs when they win a lawsuit against the Federal This will enable ordinary citizens, veterans, seniors, small business owners, advocates for clean air and clean water, et cetera, to fight unfair or illegal government actions without fear of having to pay court costs and without fear of having attorneys' fees that they otherwise might not be able to afford.  The law has been a success. However, in 1995, an important reporting requirement was removed from the law, and it made it harder for the public to see how much money the government had awarded. Our bill, H.1033, the Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act, restores the law's tracking and reporting requirements of payments awarded so the American people can have access to this important information. It will do this by requiring the group called ACUS, an acronym, which we have too many of up here, but this one is the Administrative Conference of the United States, a highly respected nonpartisan agency which was greatly championed by Justice Scalia, to post in an online database the fees and costs awarded in these cases. The database would also include the number and nature of the claims involved. The availability of this information will help keep the public informed and help Congress to conduct better oversight.  I thank my Judiciary Committee colleague, Doug Collins from Georgia, for his partnership on the bill. I would like to thank Representatives Schrader and Collin Peterson for their support for this bill on our side of the aisle, as well as Jason Chaffetz, Liz Cheney, Paul Gosar, and Raul Labrador on the Republican side, as well as Chairman  And I would like to recall the work of our former colleague, Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis, who had this bill in the past, and we worked together to try to make it a bipartisan effort and pass it.

11492,topic-id,4716,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his remarkable leadership in this important debate.  Seven years ago, I was on this floor and I heard that, if you liked your plan, you could keep it. I heard, if you liked your doctor, you could keep that doctor. And I heard that healthcare costs were going to drop by $2,500 per family. None of it was true.  I sit here now and look at my State, and I know what is happening next year. The rates on the ObamaCare exchanges are going up by 69 percent. We are down to a single provider. That is what 7 years ago brought us.  Today we have a chance to do something different, and everybody from my State will do something different. They will vote for a plan that actually does what it says it is going to do. Number one, they will be able to actually have plans that are designed by Oklahomans, not by bureaucrats in Washington, D.They will be able to have a tax credit, if they are not already insured under Medicaid or Medicare or from their employer. They will be able to have an individual tax credit to purchase a plan that they design, that they like. They will be free of the mandates of ObamaCare, free to make their own decisions, free of the mandates that require them to buy insurance products that they simply don't need.  I have got a lot of people in my district that are in their fifties and sixties. Some of them might like to have children again, but they are not likely to have children again, and they mostly don't want maternity care.  So it is a pretty simple choice for us. It is a choice to be free and make our own decisions. It is a choice to design our own plans. It is a choice to have Federal assistance where we need it, but to be used under our direction. It is an easy choice.  I urge the passage of this rule, and I urge the passage of the underlying legislation.                              {time}  1000  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from NETWORK, the lobby for Catholic Social Justice; a letter from the National Alliance on Mental Illness; a letter from the Mental Health Liaison Group; and an article in the New York Times entitled ``Late GOP Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover Aromatherapy but Not Chemotherapy.''       Dear Representative: NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social      Justice urges you to vote NO on the American Health Care Act      (AHCA). This legislation fails to protect access to quality,      affordable healthcare for vulnerable communities. It would      widen the gaps in our society by making massive cuts to      Medicaid, giving large tax breaks to the very wealthiest      families and corporations, and threatening the health      security of American families.       Our faith teaches that access to healthcare is an essential      human right that is necessary to protect the life and dignity      of every person. The bill would drastically increase the      number of people without health insurance--and I know that      behind those numbers are millions of stories of families      facing medical bankruptcy, forgoing treatment, and losing      loved ones who could have been saved by preventative care.       The AHCA cuts Medicaid spending--an essential source of      care for millions of children, seniors, people with      disabilities, and people experiencing poverty in our nation--     and a per-capita cap would force states to ration care. The      legislation would also increase costs for older and sicker      patients and burden low- and moderate-income families with      much higher premiums by cutting $312 billion of financial      assistance for people purchasing health insurance on the      individual market. This is far from the Gospel mandate to      care for our most vulnerable sisters and brothers.       For any replacement to the ACA to be sufficient, it must      meet these 10 conditions--a Ten Commandments of Healthcare if      you will--and the AHCA breaks nine of 10 commandments:[[Page H2383]]         1. Thou shalt provide affordable insurance and the same      benefits to all currently covered under the Affordable Care      AHCA fails.       2.

Thou shalt ensure that insurance premiums and cost      sharing are truly affordable to all. AHCA fails.       4. Thou shalt expand Medicaid to better serve vulnerable      people in our nation.

Thou shalt continue to ensure reasonable revenue is in      the federal budget to pay for life-sustaining healthcare for      all. AHCA fails.       At its heart, this bill has lost sight of community and the      common good. Its biggest problem is that it lacks the      awareness that it is community which makes healthcare      effective. Healthcare is not just about the individual--it is      a communal good. The hyper individualism evident in the AHCA      is sucking the life out of our nation. Just focusing on one's      individual self is contrary to our Catholic faith and      contrary to our We will track the vote and      score it in our 2017 voting record.

Re The American Health Care     Greg Walden,     Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Frank Pallone,     Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: NAMI is      the nation's largest grassroots mental health organization      dedicated to building better lives for the millions of      Americans affected by mental illness. On behalf of our      nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, I am writing to express      our views on the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which seeks      to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).       The mental health crisis in our nation is well documented.      Half of all Americans with mental illness go without      treatment. Last year, Congress passed significant bipartisan      legislation to address the crisis in our nation's mental      health system. However, addressing the mental health needs in      our country relies on a foundation of affordable, quality      health coverage with fair and equal coverage of mental health      and substance use conditions. Thus, the importance of      Medicaid and insurance safeguards for individuals living with      mental illness cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, the      proposed reforms in the AHCA threaten to undermine the      historic progress being made to improve mental health and      substance use care.          Restructuring Medicaid Threatens Mental Health Care       Medicaid is the single largest payer of mental health and      substance use services in the United Medicaid is also      the largest funding source for the country's public mental      health system. One in five of Medicaid's nearly 70 million      beneficiaries have a mental health or substance use disorder      diagnosis.       NAMI is deeply concerned with proposed provisions to      convert Medicaid financing into a per capita cap model. This      would limit federal funding to a lump sum for all enrollees      and, instead of providing more flexibility, would shift      financial risk for health care costs--including unexpected      costs, such as promising new innovations in treatment--to      states. Current estimates are that the per capita cap      provisions would shift an alarming $370 billion in Medicaid      costs to states over the next ten years. In the face of      budget shortfalls, states will be forced to cut people from      coverage, reduce health benefits and access to care, and/or      reduce already low provider payments, escalating our nation's      healthcare workforce crisis.       The AHCA would set per capita caps for Medicaid at current      funding levels, adjusted for medical inflation. Funding for      mental health and substance use services is already      inadequate in Medicaid programs and, under this model, could      not be improved without cutting other health care. Further,      the deep reductions in federal Medicaid funding would mean      that people with mental illness will face even more desperate      circumstances when trying to access critical mental health      care.             Freezing Medicaid Expansion Puts Lives at Risk       Nearly 1 out of 3 people covered by Medicaid expansion      lives with a mental health or substance use condition.      Medicaid expansion has proven to be a lifeline that helps      people with mental illness who typically fall through the      cracks. Medicaid expansion provides coverage to people with      mental health conditions who are too sick to navigate the      traditional Medicaid application process, who are just stable      enough not to qualify for disability (often because they are      coming out of a psychiatric hospital), or who have first      symptoms of a serious mental illness.       NAMI strongly urges the Committee to take further steps to      preserve enrollment in Medicaid expansion, rather than the      proposed end to new enrollment in 2020. Expanded eligibility      has brought mental health treatment and the hope of recovery      to millions affected by mental illness. It is helping keep      people healthier and productive in their communities.      Congress should not abandon this important means of improving      coverage for and access to critical mental health treatment.       NAMI also urges the Committee to reject provisions in the      AHCA that would lock enrollees out of Medicaid expansion      should they experience a lapse of coverage of more than one      month. This is a high price to pay for forgetting to pay a      premium while in the hospital or experiencing severe symptoms      of mental illness. Denying coverage only serves to further      de-stabilize lives with costly consequences for individuals,      families and communities.       Finally, NAMI is very concerned that the AHCA removes the      requirement for Medicaid expansion plans to cover essential      health benefits, including mental health and substance use      treatment. Congress' significant commitment to mental health      and substance use services in recent legislation should not      be jeopardized by making these vital services optional in      Our country can ill afford to weaken coverage at a      time when the need for mental health and substance use      treatment is so high.             Continuing Insurance Subsidies and Protections       To help Americans afford quality health insurance, NAMI      strongly urges the Committee to continue current levels of      federal support, tied to income, to purchase health care      coverage. Without assistance tied to income, more people with      mental illness will be unable to afford coverage for mental      health care. This threatens their overall health, resulting      in more costly and difficult-to-treat conditions and denying      people the chance to reach and maintain recovery and a stable      life in the community.       NAMI appreciates that the Committee included essential      insurance safeguards in the These safeguards include      protecting Americans from losing or being denied coverage      because of pre-existing health conditions. This also includes      continuing to allow young adults to remain on their parent's      health insurance plans to age 26 and banning annual and      lifetime caps for insurance coverage.       Cutting corners in health coverage will keep people from      getting the treatment they need and will push people with      mental illness into costly emergency rooms, hospitals and      jails. Making the investment early in affordable, quality      mental health care promotes recovery and reduces the high      long-term financial burden to taxpayers in avoidable      disability, criminal justice involvement and hospital care.       NAMI urges the Committee to maintain coverage and services      for people with mental illness by preserving financial help      based on income, removing the proposed per capita cap      financing model for Medicaid and protecting expanded Medicaid      eligibility. We appreciate the challenges in reforming      America's health coverage and look forward to working with      you to improve mental health coverage and care for children      and adults throughout our nation.           Sincerely,                                             Mary Giliberti, J.D.,     Chief Executive Officer,                                  ____                                  Mental Health Liaison Group,                                                   March 17, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     House Minority Leader,     House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The Mental      Health Liaison Group (MHLG) wishes to express our serious      concerns about the provisions of the American Health Care Act      (AHCA) that would restructure the Medicaid program and end      the Medicaid expansion, as well as provisions of that      legislation that would significantly reduce the Federal      premium assistance that enrollees receive from the Federal      government to maintain continuous insurance coverage, and      impose a significant penalty for not maintaining continuous      coverage. We are also very concerned that the legislation      would eliminate required coverage for prevention and      treatment of mental illness and substance use disorders under      state Medicaid managed care and alternative benefit programs,      as Medicaid is the major source of Federal funding in every      state for mental health and substance use services.[[Page H2384]]       The MHLG is a coalition of dozens of national organizations      representing consumers, family members, mental health and      substance use treatment providers, state behavioral health      agencies, advocates, payers, and other stakeholders committed      to strengthening Americans' access to mental health and      substance use services and programs.       The elimination of Medicaid expansion under the AHCA would      leave without coverage the 1.3 million childless, non-     pregnant adults with serious mental illness who were able,      for the first time, to gain coverage under Medicaid      expansion. It would also leave uncovered the 2.8 million      childless, non-pregnant adults with substance use disorders      who also gained coverage under expansion for the first time.      These are populations that Congress promised and worked to      serve with the passage of 21st Century Cures and the      Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016,      respectively. And it is important to remember that untreated      mental health and substance use disorders intensify and serve      to increase the number of co-morbid medical conditions in      those populations, thereby multiplying total Medicaid program      costs.       Medicaid is the single largest payer for behavioral health      services in the United States, accounting for about 26      percent of behavioral health spending, and is the largest      source of funding for the country's public mental health      system. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the      Medicaid provisions of the AHCA would reduce Medicaid funding      over 10 years by $880 billion, or about 25 percent. With an      estimated 14 million people--one in five of Medicaid's 70      million enrollees--living with mental illness or substance      use disorders and depending heavily on Medicaid services,      allowing states to determine whether those services should be      covered could very well leave many low-income Americans      without access to medically necessary prevention and      treatment services.       Medicaid covers a broad range of behavioral health services      at low or no cost, including but not limited to psychiatric      hospital care, case management, day treatment, evaluation and      testing, psychosocial rehabilitation, medication management,      as well as individual, group and family therapy. In three      dozen states, Medicaid covers essential peer support services      to help sustain recovery. Additionally, because people with      behavioral health disorders experience a higher rate of      chronic physical conditions than the general population,      Medicaid's coverage of primary care is critical to help this      population receive needed treatment for both their behavioral      health and physical health conditions.       In states that have expanded Medicaid and which have been      particularly hard hit by the opioid crisis, such as Kentucky,      Maine, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, Medicaid pays      between 35 to 50 percent of medication-assisted treatment for      substance use disorders. CARA and 21st Century Cures were to      increase payment for those services, but the elimination of      mandated coverage under Medicaid would likely result in state      cost shifting, so that CARA moneys (should they be      appropriated) and moneys provided under 21st Century Cures      for prescription opioid addiction prevention and treatment      services would supplant, rather than supplement, the existing      Medicaid coverage of services in the states.       Similarly, converting Medicaid into a per capita cap block      grant program or a simple block grant program will shift      significant costs to states over time. Ultimately, states      will be forced to reduce their Medicaid rolls, benefits, and      already low payment rates to an already scarce workforce of      behavioral health providers. Mental health and substance use      disorder treatments and programs will be at high risk      because, even though they are cost-effective, they are      intensive and expensive. Furthermore, the elimination of the      ACA's required Medicaid managed care coverage of mental      health and substance use disorder services and the long-term      reduction of real funding dollars will leave states and      managed care plans no alternative but to reduce or eliminate      services in order to balance state Medicaid budgets and      operate within managed care organizations' capitated rates.       In addition, these cuts will hit children with serious      emotional disorders, as well as adults with mental illness.      Fifty percent of Medicaid beneficiaries are children.      Seventy-five percent of mental conditions emerge by late      adolescence. The loss of Medicaid-covered mental and      substance use disorder services for adults would result in      more family disruption and out-of-home placements for      children, significant trauma which has its own long-term      health effects, and a further burden on a child welfare      system that is struggling to meet the current demand for      foster home capacity. In addition, we estimate $4 to $5      billion in Medicaid assistance will be lost by schools for      specialized instructional support services, including mental      and behavioral health services.       More directly, the rollback of the maximum eligibility      level for children ages 6 to 19 from 133 percent of the      Federal Poverty Level to 100 percent FPL will undoubtedly      have the result of reducing access to mental health and      substance use disorder services, and critical Early and      Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT)      services, for those older children. This is a particularly      problematic change since 5 percent (1.2 million) of      adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 had substance use      disorders in 2015 and EPSDT screening is the most effective      early identifier for emergent mental health issues.               ahca changes to private insurance coverage       If Medicaid is not to provide the avenue for recovery for      individuals with mental illness or substance use disorders,      then the private insurance market may have to serve as an      alternative, but the $2,000 to $4,000 refundable tax credits      provided under the AHCA to subsidize insurance premiums      constitute a significant reduction in the advance premium tax      credits paid under the ACA, which averaged 72 percent of      gross premiums. Further, the 30 percent premium surcharge      required under AHCA to be imposed for a failure to maintain      continuous coverage will likely hit hardest the lowest-income      enrollees who will be struggling to maintain premium payments      for coverage. It will be particularly destructive for those      enrollees whose serious mental illness or substance use      disorders may render them cognitively impaired and thus      unable to maintain premium payment schedules until they      recover, when the sizeable surcharge will leave them unable      to pick up coverage. For the foregoing reasons, these      provisions of the AHCA leave us very concerned for the      continued well-being of the individuals with serious mental      illness and substance use disorders we have been better able      to serve since the implementation of the ACA's expanded      coverage.       We urge you to continue to protect these vulnerable      Americans' access to and coverage of vital mental health and      substance use disorder care and services, and to not reverse      the recent progress made with the enactment of key mental      health and substance use disorder prevention and treatment      reforms under the 21st Century Cures Act and           Sincerely,       American Art Therapy Association, American Association of      Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, American Association for      Marriage and Family Therapy, American Association for      Geriatric Psychiatry, American Association on Health and      Disability, American Dance Therapy Association, American      Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Nurses      Association, American Psychiatric Association, American      Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA), American Psychological      Association, American Society of Addiction Medicine, Anxiety      and Depression Association of America, Association for      Ambulatory Behavioral Healthcare, Association for Behavioral      Health and Wellness, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law,      Campaign for Trauma-Informed Policy and Practice, Children      and Adults with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder      (CHADD), Clinical Social Work Association, Clinical Social      Work Guild 49-      Depression and Bi-Polar Support Alliance, Eating Disorders      Coalition, EMDR International Association, Global Alliance      for Behavioral Health and Social Justice, International      Certification & Reciprocity Consortium (IC&RC), The Jewish      Federations of North America, Mental Health America, National      Association for Children's Behavioral Health, The National      Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental      Disability Directors (NACBHDD), The National Association for      Rural Mental Health (NARMH), National Association of Social      Workers, National Association of State Mental Health Program      Directors (NASMHPD), National Alliance on the Mental Illness      (NAMI), National Council for Behavioral Health, National      Disability Rights Network, National Federation of Families      for Children's Mental Health, National Health Care for the      Homeless Council, National Register of Health Service      Psychologists, No Health Without Mental Health (NHMH), School      Social Work Association of America, Trinity Health of      Livonia, Michigan, Young                                  ____                [From the New York Times, 23, 2017] Late G.O.Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover Aromatherapy But Not                               Chemotherapy                        (By Margot Sanger-Katz)       Most Republicans in Congress prefer the type of health      insurance market in which everyone could ``choose the plan      that's right for them.''       Why should a 60-year-old man have to buy a plan that      includes maternity benefits he'll never use? (This is an      example that comes up a lot.) In contrast, the Affordable      Care Act includes a list of benefits that have to be in every      plan, a reality that makes insurance comprehensive, but often      costly.       Now, a group of conservative House members is trying to cut      a deal to get those benefit requirements eliminated as part      of the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act      moving through (The vote in the House is expected      later today.)       At first glance, this may sound like a wonderful policy.      Why should that 60-year-old man have to pay for maternity      benefits he will never use? If 60-year-old men don't need to      pay for benefits they won't use, the price of insurance will      come down, and more people will be able to afford that      coverage, the thinking goes. And people who want fancy      coverage with extra benefits can just pay a little more for      the plan that's right for them.       But there are two main problems with stripping away minimum      benefit rules. One is that the meaning of ``health      insurance''[[Page H2385]]     can start to become a little murky. The second is that, in a      world in which no one has to offer maternity coverage, no      insurance company wants to be the only one that offers it.       Here is the list of Essential Health Benefits that are      required under the Affordable Care Act:       Ambulatory patient services (doctor's visits)       Emergency services       Hospitalization       Maternity and newborn care       Mental health and substance abuse disorder services,      including behavioral health treatment       Prescription drugs       Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices       Laboratory services       Preventive and wellness services, and chronic disease      management       Pediatric services, including oral and vision care       The list reflects some lobbying of the members of Congress      who wrote it. You may notice that dental services are      required for children, but not adults, for example. But over      all, the list was developed to make insurance for people who      buy their own coverage look, roughly, like the kind of      coverage people get through their employer. A plan without      prescription drug coverage would probably be cheaper than one      that covers it, but most people wouldn't think of that plan      as very good insurance for people who have health care needs.       Under the Republican plan, the government would give people      who buy their own insurance money to help them pay for it. A      20-year-old who doesn't get coverage from work or the      government, for example, would get $2,000. If the essential      health benefits go away, insurance companies would be allowed      to sell health plans that don't cover, say, hospital care.      Federal money would help buy these plans.       But history illustrates a potential problem.       In the 1990s, Congress created a tax credit that helped      low-income people buy insurance for their children. Quickly,      it became clear that unscrupulous entrepreneurs were creating      cheap products that weren't very useful, and marketing them      to people eligible for the credit. Congress quickly repealed      the provision after investigations from the Government      Accountability Office and the Ways and Means Committee      uncovered fraud.       Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management at the      Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who tends      to favor market solutions in health care, said that while the      Obamacare rules are ``paternalistic,'' it would be      problematic to offer subsidies without standards. ``If      they're going to offer a tax credit for people who are buying      insurance, well, what is insurance?'' he said, noting that      you might end up with the government paying for plans that      covered aromatherapy but not hospital care. ``You have to      specify what's included.''       A proliferation of $1,995 plans that covered mostly      aromatherapy could end up costing the federal government a      lot more money than the current G.O.plan, since far more      people would take advantage of tax credits to buy cheap      products, even if they weren't very valuable.       There's another reason, besides avoiding fraud, that health      economists say benefit rules are important. Obamacare      requires insurers to offer health insurance to people who      have pre-existing illnesses at the same price as they sell      them to healthy people, and the Republican bill would keep      this rule. But if an insurance company designs a plan that      attracts a lot of sick people, it will be very expensive to      cover them, and the insurance company will either lose money      or end up charging extremely high prices that would drive      away any healthy customers.       Sherry Glied, the dean of the Robert Wagner Graduate      School of Public Service at New York University, who helped      work on the essential health benefits in the Obama      administration, raised the example of mental health benefits.      Parents of adolescents with schizophrenia will be sure to buy      insurance that covers only mental health services. Other      parents won't care about that benefit.       The result: Any company offering such benefits will end up      with a lot of customers requiring expensive hospitalizations,      while its competitors that drop them will get healthier      customers who are cheaper to insure. If mental health      services are optional, no insurance company will want to      offer them, lest all the families with sick children buy      their product and put them out of business.       And then healthy people who develop mental illness, or drug      addiction, will also learn that their illness isn't covered.      The result could be a sort of market failure: ``If you don't      require that these benefits are required, they often just get      knocked out of the market altogether,'' she said.       Before Obamacare passed, there were few federal standards      for health insurance bought by individuals, and it was not      uncommon to find plans that didn't include prescription drug      coverage, mental health services or maternity care. But plans      tended to cover most of the other benefits. That was in a      world where health insurers could discriminate against sick      people. In that era, insurers in most states could simply      tell the mother of a mentally ill child that she couldn't buy      insurance. That made it less risky for insurers to offer      mental health benefits to everyone else.       David Cutler, a professor at Harvard who helped advise the      Obama administration on the Affordable Care Act, said he      thinks the kind of insurance products that would be offered      under the proposed mix of policies could become much more      bare-bones than plans before He envisioned an      environment in which a typical plan might cover only      emergency care and basic preventive services, with everything      else as an add-on product, costing almost exactly as much as      it would cost to pay for a service out-of-pocket.       ``Think of this as the if-you-have-rheumatoid-arthritis-     you-should-pay-$30,000 provision,'' he said. Such a system      would mean that Americans with costly problems--cancer,      opioid addiction, H.I.V.--would end up paying a substantially      higher share of their medical bills, while healthy people      would pay lower prices for insurance that wouldn't cover as      many treatments.       There is most likely a middle way. Republican lawmakers      might be comfortable with a system that shifts more of the      costs of care onto people who are sick, if it makes the      average insurance plan less costly for the healthy. But      making those choices would mean engaging in very real trade-     offs, less simple than their talking point.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.Visclosky).

11764,topic-id,518,"Mr.Speaker, last week, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of two important measures. First, the resolution provides for consideration of H.428, the Red River Gradient Boundary Survey The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee, and provides for a motion to recommit.  In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of H.42, providing for congressional disapproval of a rule issued by the Department of Labor with regard to drug testing. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, and provides for a motion to recommit.  Mr.Speaker, H.428 is a product of months of negotiation between the States of Texas and Oklahoma and the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Tribes in my district. I am happy to have been able to work with my friend Mr.Thornberry to come up with a fair and equitable solution which all interested parties have agreed to.  As you may know, the Red River serves as the State line separating Oklahoma and Over time, the river has moved, as much as a mile in some areas, causing landowners' properties to be affected. Instead of working to resolve this, for nearly a century, the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, has been unwilling to survey a small portion of the Federal land along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River between Oklahoma and H.428 would direct the survey to be completed, using the gradient boundary survey method that was mandated by the Supreme Court, so that ownership of the land, which has been under dispute, can be effectively resolved.                              {time}  1315  In addition, Mr.Speaker, the rule provides for the consideration of another Congressional Review Act resolution, which would overturn a Department of Labor rule related to drug testing for those applying for unemployment insurance.  In 2012, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made a number of reforms to the unemployment insurance program, including overturning a 1960s-era Department of Labor ban on the screening or testing of unemployment applicants for illegal drugs. The 2012 provision allowed, but did not require, States to test unemployment insurance applicants who either, one, lost their jobs due to drug use or, two, who were seeking new jobs that generally required new employees to pass a drug test. Unfortunately, after 4 years and a now finalized rule, States are no closer to being able to implement this sensible policy. Instead, because of the Department of Labor's overreach, three States which have enacted necessary State law changes to implement this commonsense policy are actually now precluded from moving forward with this sensible, bipartisan policy.  Mr.Speaker, most States already limit unemployment insurance benefits or individuals who refuse to take or fail an employer drug test or who have previous employment issues with drugs. We should empower States, employers, and prospective employees who are looking for work and overturn this onerous regulation.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1145.txt,2259,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,14.0,March
11766,topic-id,1127,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Obviously, the gentleman and I have some disagreement here, but let's talk for a minute about the form of what we are doing.  The gentleman is correct in that this rule covers two different pieces of legislation that don't have anything substantive in common. However, the legislation itself will be debated separately. We will have one debate on the Oklahoma-Texas issue, which involves the boundary between those two States and the tribal interests that are also intimately part of that. We will have a separate debate on the rule. That is the appropriate way to proceed. There is no reason to have a separate rule for each one of these debates, but it is appropriate, as the gentleman suggested, to have two different debates because they are two different subjects.  I am going to disagree with him--and I am probably being parochial in this sense--for, if you live in Oklahoma, we actually think the border between Oklahoma and Texas is pretty important. This is an issue that, frankly, was dealt with legislatively last year. This body did not vote out the bill. I actually opposed it last year because it did not take care of the tribal interests involved and they had not been suitably dealt with. We amended the bill. Actually, I should say it was brought up, but it was not taken up by the We changed it, but we kept working for many months. Chairman Thornberry is the person who deserves most of the credit here of trying to bring the parties together.  Also, just by way of explanation so everybody is clear, this does not settle the issue. This doesn't force anything on the Federal Government or the two States or the tribes. It simply creates a common database. The two States have been asking for a complete survey of the contested area for many years. The BLM has refused to do that. You simply can't sort through this problem of a shifting border--set well over a century ago--with conflicting tribal interests if you don't have a common set of data here. So that is all that is being done here.  I can assure you that, certainly, the tribes in question would not have consented to go forward if they had thought they were having a solution imposed on them. What they think they are getting is a database that will allow them to determine exactly what their interests and rights here are and, hopefully, negotiate that with the two States in question; but, if necessary, they will litigate the issue.                              {time}  1330  So we see this as a reasonable effort to bring parties together where there is a great deal of confusion through nobody's fault. And we think the BLM has been lax here and, frankly, may well be claiming things beyond its authority. But the survey, again, will hopefully take care of that. So I hope that eases the concerns that people have.[[Page H1147]]  In terms of the drug rule, we see this as an issue where Congress made its intent in 2012 very clear, that is, we wanted States to have options to make these decisions for themselves. We think the Department of Labor rule made that more, rather than less, difficult.  We can argue over the merits of any individual treatment of people that have used illegal drugs or what the appropriate testing measure is or whatever. I happen to think those decisions are best made at the State level where you have got interested parties that are more knowledgeable about local conditions than us dictating a one size fits all. So we just simply disagree on that.  Finally, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Hastings) mentioned some concerns about the speed with which we are acting and also the form with which we are acting. The form, frankly, is basically dictated by statute.  The Congressional Review Act dictates the manner in which we can bring these items on rules to the floor, the timetable which we can operate under. If we alter that over here, then, frankly, we lose privilege status in the Senate and the chances of succeeding actually diminish pretty greatly.  We think, in this case, the issues are pretty clear. These aren't really things that need to be amended. We need to decide whether or not the regulation is appropriate or not. If you think it is, you should vote in favor of keeping the regulation as it is and against this effort.  If, on the other hand, you would like to see decisionmaking devolve down to the States and where we think better decisions will be made, then, you should vote in favor of the rule and the underlying legislation.  So, again, I don't think these issues are overly complex. I do think this is an important time to deal with them. Again, we have a limited period of time on the Congressional Review We have a certain format. We think we are abiding within both that timeframe and that format.  On the Oklahoma-Texas border issue, it is a knotty issue. It has been around for decades. There have been multiple efforts to deal with it. Most of them have faltered because we have not had the various parties arguing from a common database as to what their positions are. We have asked the Bureau of Land Management repeatedly to survey the affected area. They decided they didn't want to do that.  In this case, Congress says: Look, we have two sovereign States and three sovereign Indian tribes here that have a concern. We want them to be able to work it through. We want them to draw on a common set of data. So we are going to essentially make sure that that happens and hopefully we can avoid a protracted court case between the States and the Indian tribes and actually resolve an issue that needs to be had.  There are literally thousands of people along this border that are not certain whether or not they own the land that they have actually been farming, in some cases, for generations. There are three Indian tribes that have historic rights to this land that predate, frankly, the existence of Texas as a State and certainly the existence of Oklahoma as a They want to make sure their mineral rights issues and their land issues are appropriately handled, and they want to preserve their rights going forward if they want to litigate. Again, they need this kind of data to make those sorts of determinations.  I commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Thornberry). I, again, look forward to working with my good friend from Florida (Mr.Hastings) on these issues.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

11769,topic-id,408,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Actually, I listened with a great deal of interest to the debate from my friends on the other side. None of it had very much to do with the rule or with the underlying legislation that we are going to discuss shortly, so I don't pretend to be an expert on the issues.  I do point out, simply in passing, that it really is up to the President of the United States as to whose advice he or she wants to take. Frankly, you know, to say that there aren't ``political people on the National Security Agency,'' with all due respect to a Chief of Staff that I admire profoundly, I think Leon Panetta is one of the great Chiefs of Staff to ever serve any President, but I would tell you that he is a pretty political guy. He was in this body, and one of his jobs was to help make sure the President of the United States was reelected. So there was a political dimension to what he did.  I don't know Mr.I have never met him. I don't pretend to be familiar with him or his thinking. I do know that he is a valued adviser to the President of the United And if the President of the United States is going to seek advice from somebody--and it may be in these areas of national security--frankly, personally, I would prefer them to be part of the National Security Council, simply to have the educated debate of some of the very best professionals that we have and so that their opinion, when they advise the President, is fully formed. Again, I see this as the President's decision, not some enormous departure.  On occasions, Mr.Axelrod, who was not a chief of staff who was primarily a political counsel, did sit in on national security meetings at the request of the So, again, we can have this argument. I am not sure it is particularly relevant to the legislation. But at the end of the day, I want anybody advising the President of the United States--and he gets to make that choice--to get the best information they can possibly receive so that that advice is well-informed.  Mr.Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Carter), who is here to offer some important thoughts about some of the issues that are involved in the underlying legislation.

11772,topic-id,413,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I just want to point out for the record, Mr.Speaker, that actually this rule that we are trying to repeal, the measure we are trying to instate, doesn't force drug testing on anybody; and that is not going to happen in any State, unless the people in the State decide that that is something they want to do. I am quite content to let people in any State make that decision.  I think in my State, I am pretty certain that the people who I am privileged to represent would be very upset if they thought somebody was receiving unemployment compensation while they were on drugs, because they think[[Page H1149]]that is going to make it pretty hard for that person to ever get back into the workforce, and they want to be able to identify that. They don't want to incentivize it.  Other people may have a different opinion, and that is legitimate. It is a big country. That is why our Founding Fathers adopted a Federal system, so I wouldn't begrudge another State that saw it differently.  What we are trying to avoid here is a one-size-fits-all or this body and any administration dictating to every State what they ought to do.

But let's not have a bureaucracy decide that it will circumvent the will of the Congress of the United States and write a rule that is clearly meant to undo the intent of a legislation that was passed across this floor with bipartisan support.

Mr.Speaker, I just want to point out again that, while my friend is correct, we have two different pieces of legislation under a single rule, and those legislations, as my friend points out, are not particularly related. As a matter of fact, they are not related to one another in any way. Each piece of legislation will receive a separate debate and a separate vote on the House floor. There was simply no reason to have two rules when one would suffice for two bills that basically need to come into the same format, in our view.  I also point out that, when we are talking about the vote under the Congressional Review Act, we are actually following a form prescribed in statute, and we are moving at a pace that the law dictates and that, frankly, is necessary in order to retain the privileged status of the legislation in the United States So nothing unusual here, other than we are actually being pretty productive and undoing a lot of rules that, frankly, we think were misguided and rushed into the final days of the last administration.

On the Oklahoma-Texas issue, and that is something I know a little bit about since it affects my district, last year, when we considered this legislation, we actually did have an amendment. It was my amendment, and my amendment that probably made it unacceptable in the But I was indulged by my chairman of the Rules Committee, and for the very important reason that we actually make sure that the tribes have an opportunity to be at the table. In this case, they do.  Mr.Thornberry has worked very hard, and so there is no dispute between the delegations in Oklahoma, the delegations in Texas, the interests of the various Indian tribes. Everybody agrees that we need a common set of information, a common survey that we can all trust to, frankly, work out the differences here that have multiplied over a century as the border has literally shifted. So that is the appropriate thing to do. We don't need a lot of amendments on that.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule. H.428 is a fair and equitable solution which all interested parties have agreed upon and which can provide certainty that many landowners have sought along the Oklahoma-Texas border.  In addition, H.42 undoes a regulation that should have never been made in the first place. By preventing implementation of this regulation, we can ensure that those actively looking for work are provided with the support necessary to reach that goal.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I want to take a point of personal privilege. This is the last time my good friend and my staff member, Mr.Waskiewicz, will be on the floor with me. He has been with me for 6\1/2\ years. He has made a smart career move and is moving on to the Budget Committee, a more august position.  But I have had the good fortune, as I know my friends have and we all have, to have very many wonderful staff members over the years. I have never had a better staff member than Steve Waskiewicz, never had a better friend, never had a harder worker, never had anybody who was more selfless in putting the interests of our office and the constituents whom we are privileged to represent ahead of all else. So I want to commend and thank him publicly and on the record for his wonderful service.  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1145.txt,2259,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,14.0,February

11365,topic-id,3830,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.238, the Commodity End-User Relief  The Commodity End-User Relief Act is a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to makemuch-needed regulatory reforms, and, most importantly, to make statutory changes to protect end users and give them access tothe tools they need to manage their risks.  Over the past 4 years, the House Committee on Agriculture has held almost two dozen hearings that have examined theCommission and have investigated the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act on derivatives markets. Our witnesses, many of whom weremarket participants who were struggling to comply with burdensome rules and ambiguous portions of the underlying statute, wereconsistent in their call for relief. To address their concerns, H.238 makes reforms that fall into three broad categories:customer protections, Commission reforms, and end-user relief.  Title I of the bill protects customers and the margin funds they deposit at their Futures Commission Merchants by codifyingcritical changes made during the collapse and bankruptcies of MF Global and Peregrine Financial  Title II makes meaningful reforms to the operations of the Commission to improve the agency's deliberative process. In doingso, it also requires the Commission to conduct more thorough and robust cost-benefit analysis to help get future rulemakingsright the first time. While the CFTC is already required to consider costs and benefits of the rules it proposes, its work hasbeen called into question by the CFTC's inspector general, who reported the Commission staff seemed to view the process as moreof a legal one than an economic one.  End users are the businesses that provide Americans with food, clothing, transportation, electricity, heat, and much more.Companies that produce, consume, and transport the commodities that make modern life possible use futures and swaps markets toreduce the uncertainty that their businesses face. Farmers hedge their crops in the spring so they know what they will get paidin the fall. Utilities hedge the price of energy so they can charge customers at a steady rate. Manufacturers hedge the cost ofsteel, energy, and other inputs to lock in prices as they work to fill orders.  The fact is that no end user played any part in the financial crisis, and no end user currently poses a systemic risk toU.derivative markets. Yet, as the Agriculture Committee heard in countless hours of testimony, today it is more difficult andmore expensive for them to manage their risks than it was for them 5 years ago. Some of these challenges are the result ofambiguities and oversights in the text of the Commodity Exchange Act, and some of them result from overzealous rulemakings bythe Commission itself.  Today's legislation fixes statutory problems, like section 304, which amends the definition of ``financial entity'' toensure that some end users don't lose their clearing exemption simply because a hedging strategy makes up for losses in aphysical transaction; or like section 315, which makes small changes to the swaps' core principles to align them withconventions in the swaps industry, rather than the futures industry, easing compliance burdens for these newly regulatedentities.  It also fixes problems that have grown out of the CFTC's own rulemakings. For example, section 308 sets aside a Commissionrule that would automatically lower the transaction threshold triggering registration as a swap dealer. This costly, complexregistration process was intended for large financial institutions, but because this registration threshold was set arbitrarily,it has swept up some commodity firms as well.  If the limits fall by 60 percent next year, it could sweep up to 100 more firms into the reach of Dodd-H.238 wouldfix the level at its current $8 billion unless the Commission proposes a new rule with evidence of a needed reduction.Similarly, section 313 exempts religious pension plans and university endowments from a new rule that requires them to registeras commodity pool operators simply because they use standardized hedging products.  What H.238 does not do is roll back a single core tenet of title VII of Dodd-It does not change the execution,clearing, margining, capital, or reporting frameworks set up by that                              {time}  1245  In fact, not a single witness who appeared before the House Committee on Agriculture ever asked us to fundamentally upendthese principles. These are concepts that have been part of the swaps markets long before the financial reform happened. TheCommittee, the Commission, and the industry will continue to grapple with the details of these core tenets, seeking to providethe right mix of flexibility and oversight.  Before I close, I would like to thank members of the Agriculture Committee who sat through all these hearings and all themarkups on this issue. Chairman Austin Scott and Ranking Member David Scott, two of my cosponsors on this legislation,have led most of the Committee's hearings on these issues, and they have done great work.  Together, we have put forward a bipartisan bill that makes narrowly targeted changes to provide relief from regulatoryburdens on American businesses. The Commodity End-User Relief Act offers meaningful improvements for market participants withoutundermining the basic goals of title VII of Dodd-Frank, and it does so by providing the right relief to the right people.  I urge support of the Commodity End-User Relief Act with all its amendments, and I include for the Record letters ofsupport from over 30 groups.

Some, but      certainly not all, of the bill's important provisions      include:       Sections 101-103--Codify important customerprotections to      help prevent another MF Global situation.       Section 104--Provides a permanent solution to the residual      interestproblem that would have put more customer funds at      risk--and potentially driven farmers, ranchers and small      hedgers out offutures markets--by forcing pre-margining of      their hedge accounts.

Section 308--Requires the CFTC to conduct a study and issue      a rulebefore reducing the de minimis threshold for swap      dealer registration in order to make sure that doing so would      not harm marketliquidity and end-user access to markets.       Section 311--Confirms the intent of Dodd-Frank that      anticipatory hedging isconsidered bona fide hedging activity.

Mike Conaway,     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,     House of Representatives, Washington,      Dear Chairman Conaway: The American Gas Association (AGA)      supports the Commodity End-UserRelief Act (H.238), a bill      to reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) that would      improve Commodity Future TradingCommission (CFTC) operations      and provide much-needed marketplace certainty and regulatory      relief for natural gas utilities andthe American homes and      businesses to which they deliver natural gas.       The American Gas Association (AGA), founded in      1918,represents more than 200 local energy companies that      deliver clean natural gas throughout the United There      are more than72 million residential, commercial and      industrial natural gas customers in the U.S., of which 95      percent--just under 69 millioncustomers--receive their gas      from AGA members. AGA is an advocate for natural gas utility      companies and their customers andprovides a broad range of      programs and services for member natural gas pipelines,      marketers, gatherers, international naturalgas companies and      industry associates. Today, natural gas meets more than one-     fourth of the United States' energy needs.       H.R.238 will benefit our industry by exempting end-user      physical contracts from ``swaps'' and ``options'' regulation      more applicableto sophisticated financial derivative      transactions. Specifically, HR 238 would clarify that      contracts containing delivery termswith volumetric      optionality, but intended to result in the physical delivery      of natural gas, will not be treated by the CFTC asswaps.      Currently, the CFTC has provided some guidance on how      physical natural gas contracts with volumetric optionality      are tobe reviewed for regulatory treatment, but considerable      confusion and uncertainty still exists. This uncertainty has      causedconcern regarding the impact on the willingness of gas      suppliers to offer flexible delivery volume terms, leaving      gas utilitieswith fewer delivery options and more expensive      contracts--costs ultimately passed to the consumer. HR 238      provides neededregulatory certainty to the physical natural      gas marketplace, as requested by AGA and other industry      stakeholders for severalyears.       H.238 will also help the CFTC become a more responsive      and well-equipped regulator by subjecting its rulemakings      toadministrative process reforms and judicial review. Current      CFTC administrative rulemaking procedures are vague and      provideinsufficient avenues for the public to participate in      and seek guidance on rulemakings. This bill would require the      CFTC tocomply with the Administrative Procedures Act to      ensure public notice-and-comment on rules or guidance that      have legally-bindingeffects.       Finally, H.238 would allow the federal appellate courts      to directly review CFTC[[Page H407]]     rules, replacing theprotracted and expensive trial court      process currently in effect as the default rule for judicial      review. This change will notincrease litigation nor will it      disrupt the Rather, it will incentivize the CFTC to      write better rules and avoid challengealtogether. Also, any      inevitable legal challenges will be more swiftly decided by      appellate courts, benefitting the regulatorand the regulated      community. All of the key federal rulemaking agencies are      subject to direct appellate review--including theSecurities      Exchange Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory      There is no logical justification to treat the            Congress certainly did not intend to provide the CFTC a      large new regulatory mandate without giving it thenecessary      guidance and authority to do its job. Furthermore, Congress      did not intend for the CEA to constrain liquidity in      thephysical natural gas marketplace, create business-changing      impacts on regulated natural gas utilities, or increase the      costs ofreliable service for natural gas consumers. As such,      AGA supports the Commodity End-User Relief Act because it      provides the CFTCwith the tools necessary to be a responsive      regulator and restores the regulatory confidence that natural      gas utilities rely onto procure natural gas supplies at the      lowest reasonable cost for the benefit of America's natural      gasconsumers.

Michael Conaway,     Collin Peterson,     Committee on Agriculture, House ofRepresentatives,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson: On      behalf ofthe American Public Power Association (APPA), I am      writing in support of H.238, the Commodity End-User Relief      Act (CERA) of2017. The legislation includes important relief      for public power utilities and other end-users seeking to use      swaps to hedgecommercial-operations risks.       Community-owned, not-for-profit public power utilities      power homes and businesses in 2,000communities --from small      towns to large cities. They safely provide reliable, low-cost      electricity to more than 49 millionAmericans, while      protecting the environment. These utilities generate or buy      electricity from diverse sources. They employ93,000 people      and earn $58 billion in revenue each year. Public power      supports local commerce and jobs and invests back into      thecommunity.       Public power utilities use swaps, options, forward      contracts and other tools to manage commercial      operationsrisks. As not-for-profit entities, their goal is to      provide affordable and reliable power to customers. APPA      supports the marketclarity and oversight provided by the      Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), and supports appropriately      funding the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission (CFTC). To      date, however, implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act      amendments to the CEA shows clear short-comings.       CERA would address these concerns, for example, by      codifying CFTC rules allowing public power utilities to      enterswaps with the full array of counterparties to swaps      needed to hedge their commercial operations risks. CERA would      also addressissues related to the definition of ``bona fide      hedging,'' swap reporting in illiquid markets, and forward      contracts withvolumetric optionality. These provisions would      help public power utilities and other commercial end users.

Thank for your time andconsideration.           Sincerely,                                                   Susan Kelly,     President &                                  ____                                        Chamber of Commerce of The                                      United States ofAmerica,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.       To the Members of the U.House of Representatives:The      U.Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.238, the      ``Commodity End-User Relief Act.'' H.238 would reauthorize      theCommodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and enact      a number of important reforms to provide regulatory relief      for endusers of the derivatives market. It would also promote      accountability at the CFTC and protect Main Street businesses      fromonerous and unintended consequences of derivatives      regulation.       The Chamber supports several amendments being offered to      H.R.238. Specifically, the Chamber supports Congressman      Lucas' amendment to provide relief to Main Street businesses      by clarifyingthe treatment of interaffiliate swaps. The      amendment would drive down the cost of using derivatives by      end-users and help MainStreet businesses employ safe and      effective risk management strategies on a more cost-effective      basis.       The Chamber alsosupports the amendment sponsored by      Congressman Duffy and Congressman Scott to clarify that the      CFTC shall not have theauthority to access proprietary source      code without a subpoena. Their amendment would protect highly      sensitive intellectualproperty, which would respect      established due process rights and ensure that proprietary      source code does not fall into thewrong hands as a result of      a cyberattack or wrongdoing.       Finally, as the bill moves forward, the Chamber urges      considerationof how best to address the cross-border      regulation of derivatives. We strongly believe that H.238      should appropriatelyreflect the potential impact of punitive      or excessive cross-border rules on Main Street businesses      seeking to prudently hedgetheir commercial and market risks,      both in the U.and abroad. We look forward to continuing to      work with the sponsors of H.R.238 on this issue as the bill      moves forward.       The Chamber commends the House of Representatives for      prioritizing regulatoryreform in the 115th Congress and urges      the House to approve H.238 and the amendments listed above      as expeditiously aspossible.           Sincerely,     Jack                                  ____                                               ChurchAlliance,                                                  January 9, 2017.                                             Michael Conaway,     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,     House of Representatives,Washington,       Dear Chairman Conaway: On behalf of the Church Alliance, I      write to thank you foryour leadership on H.238, the      ``Commodity End-User Relief Act.''       The Church Alliance is a coalition of the chief      executiveofficers of 37 church benefit programs. It includes      mainline Protestant denominations, two branches of Judaism,      and Catholicdioceses, schools and institutions. The benefit      programs (``church plans'') provide retirement and health      benefits to more than1 million clergy, lay workers, and their      family members.       H.238 contains a provision expanding the church plan      exemptionfrom the commodity pool operator (``CPO'') and      commodity trading advisor (``CTA'') rules under the Commodity      Exchange Act(``CEA'') to include church plan-related      accounts, such as endowments or foundations of churches and      church-controllednonprofits. The provision was included by a      bipartisan, broadly-supported amendment during the House      Agriculture Committee'sconsideration of CFTC reauthorization      legislation in the 114th       Under current law, church plans are generally exemptfrom      the CPO and CTA requirements; however, the exemption does not      include church plan-related accounts. Church benefits      boardsoften use investment managers or advisers that engage      in commodities transactions for the purposes of      diversification andhedging. Church benefits boards also have      the ability to pool plan assets with other church-related      funds purely for investmentmanagement purposes for the      benefit of the church. This reduces investment fees for      church-related entities, as well as benefitplan participants      by providing economies of scale.       In contrast to the CEA and implementing regulations, the      securities lawscontain necessary exemptions for church plans      and church plan-related accounts for the same reason noted      above. Under theselaws, church plans are not required to      register or report as investment companies, register      securities held, or discloseinformation about the securities      they hold.       H.238 similarly exempts church plans and church plan-     related accounts from thecommodity pool definition and from      CTA registration requirements. The exemptions would provide      parity between securities andcommodities laws concerning      church plans and church plan-related accounts. Additionally,      the exemptions would reduce the cost tochurch plans and would      ensure they have the full benefit of commodities investments      that provide diversification, opportunitiesto hedge, and      returns. The ultimate benefit would be to clergy and church      lay worker participants in the retirement and welfareplans,      who have devoted their lives to the work of the church.       We respectfully urge the enactment of CFTC      reauthorizationlegislation which includes much-needed relief      for church plans and church-plan related accounts from the      CPO and CTArequirements, along the lines of H.238, as soon      as possible. Thank you for your leadership and support on      this importantissue.           Sincerely yours,     Barbara                                  ____                                     Commodity MarketsCouncil,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.

I rise today in strong support of H.238, the Commodity End-User Relief For the last 2 years, as a member of theAgriculture Committee, I have worked continuously to improve the operations of the Commodity Futures Trading  Through a great deal of bipartisan hearings, members were able to hear from everyone at the table--the regulators, marketparticipants, and end users alike. When discussing how to ensure robust markets, consumer protections, and relief for end users,H.238 truly represents a true agreement. After all, the end users are our customers. They are the whole reason for thislegislation and this entity to begin with.  Another important provision included in this bill is language I had previously introduced, the Public Power Risk ManagementAct, which ensures that 47 million Americans who rely on public power for electricity will not see their rates increase due tounintended consequences of Dodd-                             {time}  1315  There are 2,000 publicly owned utilities across this country, including one in my own district in the city of Redding, whohave used swaps to manage their risk for years, and this bill safeguards their ability to do so while protecting taxpayers fromhigh, unnecessary costs.  Our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers--again, the end users--and other businesses who pose no systemic risk to our financialsystem and did not cause the financial crisis should not have to face costly red tape from policies meant to protect them in thefirst place.  I want to thank, again, Chairman Conaway for leading on this issue and for the hard work in committee, all theconversations, all the background it takes to get this done and put the light on the practical effects of the unintendedconsequences on the actual customers, the end users.

While wemay vote differently on this bill, he and I generally work well together on a myriad of issues that face not only productionagriculture, but rural America as well, and I thank him for his work, even though we may not vote exactly the same way today.  Over the past 4 years, the Committee on Agriculture heard dozens of witnesses about the upheaval end users have been facingwhile trying to use derivative markets in the wake of the post-crisis financial reforms. While this Congress took affirmativesteps in Dodd-Frank to protect end users from harm, today it is clear that there is still work to be done. have been facing while trying to use derivative markets in the wake of the post-crisis financial reforms. While thisCongress took affirmative steps in Dodd-Frank to protect end users from harm, today it is clear that there is still work to bedone.  It isn't enough to simply raise these issues and hope that the CFTC will take care of them for us--for one, sometimes theycannot. There are numerous small oversights in the statute that have big implications for end users that we must correct in thislegislation.  Currently, the CEA defines some utility companies as financial entities, stripping them of their status as end users. TheCommission can't fix this.  The core principles for SEFs, which were added to the CEA by Dodd-Frank, were lifted almost word for word from the coreprinciples for futures exchanges, even though swaps exchanges and futures exchanges operate completely differently and SEFscannot perform many of the functions of a futures exchange. The Commission cannot fix this.  Certainly, the Commission can and has tried to paper over these problems, issuing staff letters explaining how it will dealwith incongruities in the law. But that isn't good enough. We know the problems. We should fix them, and fix them now.  Sometimes, though, the problem isn't the statute. There are a number of end-user issues that we have heard testimony aboutwhich the CFTC will not fix, because the Commission simply disagrees with Congress about how to apply the law. We know theseproblems also.  The Commission has promulgated a rule that reduces the transaction threshold to be considered a swap dealer from $8 billionto $3 billion, a 60 percent decline, while it is still studying the matter. We should require that the CFTC complete the studyand have a public vote on that matter.  The Commission has proposed a new method of granting bona fide hedge exemptions that is significantly narrower than thecurrent method, upending longstanding hedging conventions for market participants. This proposal has the added disadvantage ofbeing dramatically more labor intensive for the We should insist that historic hedging practices be protected.  The Commission has issued a new rule on ownership, control, and reporting that it knows isn't working. They have delayed itsimplementation for over 3 years by continuing to parcel out temporary reprieves. We should insist the Commission amend the ruleso that market participants know definitively what their compliance obligations are.  The definition of swap does not exclude transactions that are wholly contained within a single company and not marketfacing. Regulators have used this leeway to require businesses and financial institutions to follow rules that are, quitefrankly, inappropriate for risk management purposes and costly for the companies to use them. We should amend the statute, tomake it clear that inter-affiliate transactions should not be regulated the same way as publicly transacted swaps.  The challenges facing businesses who hedge their risks in derivatives markets are real. Today we have an opportunity to fixsome of those problems. Every dollar that a business can save by better managing its risk is a dollar available to grow thatbusiness, pay higher wages, and lower costs to consumers or protect investors.  Over the past week, over 30 organizations representing thousands of American businesses have voiced their support for theimportant reforms in the Commodity End-User Relief Businesses from farm country to major manufacturers, to public utilitiesneed every tool available to manage their businesses and reduce the uncertainties they face each day in today's global economy.

Notably, this      legislation reauthorizes the CommodityFutures Trading      Commission (CFTC), which has been without statutory      authorization for almost four years. In addition      toreauthorizing the CFTC, Congress has historically taken the      opportunity of reauthorization to periodically review and      enhancethe CFTC's authorities. This is essential in a      regulatory environment where the marketplace is extremely      dynamic. Given theconstantly evolving structure to which      these regulatory authorities apply, it is prudent for      Congress to consider updating thestatute in response to      market changes. We commend the House Committee on Agriculture      for efforts to build upon previous work andadvance this      legislation.       H.238 contains prudent internal risk controls to      safeguard market data and improved customerprotections sought      by the market participants who rely on derivatives to manage      their risks. These are examples of policyenhancements that      have garnered tremendous favor in recent years as evidenced      by the bi-partisan support they have received inprevious      Congressional sessions.       As noted above, the constant evolution of the markets      regulated by the CFTC has advancedeven since the last time      the House of Representatives passed similar legislation,      which warrants the introduction of newstatutory updates      expected to be offered as floor amendments. In particular,      FIA would like to lend our support to the bi-partisan Duffy/     Scott amendment protecting critical intellectual property      that is key to the innovative culture in the      Additionally, we commend Congresswoman Hartzler for her      amendment recognizing the need to improve the quality      ofinformation submitted for the Commission's surveillance and      large trader reporting programs.

We are      particularly supportive of section 313 of the bill which      provides for the exemption of qualified      charitableorganizations from designation and regulation as      commodity pool operators.       JFNA is the national organization that representsand serves      149 Jewish Federations across the United States and North      In their communities, Jewish Federations andrelated      Jewish community foundations serve as the central address for      fundraising and support for an extensive network of      Jewishhealth, education and social services in their area.      Part of the charitable mission of Jewish federations and      Jewish communityfoundations is to help grow the endowment      assets of their organizations as well as those of related      Jewish agencies andsynagogues who have entrusted their      endowment funds with them. This is accomplished through      pooling investment assets tomaximize financial return,      minimize cost and risk, and take advantage of investment      expertise and economies of scale. Increasedendowment dollars      translate into more current support of essential program      activities as well as helping to assure the long-     termviability of Jewish organizations and institutions. The      enactment of H.238 will harmonize the registration      exemptions betweensecurities and commodities laws and      regulations and exempt qualified charities from registering      their pooled funds as commoditypools or as commodity pool      operators. This exemption will eliminate confusion, spare      needless legal costs, and ensure that suchorganizations as      Jewish federations and foundations can continue to invest in      widely diversified instruments in order tomaximize returns to      their beneficiaries who use such investment income to provide      additional social services to the most needyamong us.

NRECA is the national service organization representing      over 900 not-for-profit, member-owned, ruralelectric      cooperative systems, which serve 42 million customers in 47      states. NRECA estimates that cooperatives own and maintain2.5      million miles or 42 percent of the nation's electric      distribution lines covering three-quarters of the nation's      landmass.Cooperatives serve approximately 18 million      businesses, homes, farms, schools and other establishments in      2,500 of the nation's3,141 counties.       Electric cooperatives are commercial end-users and not      financial entities. NRECA believes that      Congressionaloversight is essential to help ensure that the      CFTC is implementing the Dodd-Frank Act as Congress intended.      To that end, NRECAsupports H.238 as a means to ensure that      resources at the CFTC are prioritized to protect against      systemic risk to ourfinancial system, and to regulate swap      dealers and large traders, and not fruitlessly focused on the      everyday commoditytransactions with which end-users hedge      commercial risks arising from ongoing business operations.       Importantly, H.238amends the Commodity Exchange Act      (CEA) in a very narrow but critical way: to clarify      Congressional intent that the CFTC shallnot regulate as      ``swaps'' nonfinancial commodity contracts that are intended      to be physically settled, whether those contractsare forward      contracts or commodity trade options. Our members use these      physical contracts to manage supply and demand forenergy      resources, and to keep the lights on for American businesses      and consumers. NRECA is also particularly interested in      H.R.238 language that reduces onerous recordkeeping      requirements, as well as a codified resolution to the utility      special entityrequirement that would otherwise negatively      impact such utilities and their customers.       NRECA appreciates the Committee'scontinued work on CFTC      reauthorization legislation this Congress, and urges Members      of Congress to support H.238 when it isconsidered by the      House of           Sincerely,                                                     Jim Matheson,                                                        CEO,NRECA.[[Page H414]]                                       ____                                                       SIFMA,                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2017.

11410,topic-id,594,"Mr.Chairman, the amendment I offer today will clarify amendments made to the Commodity Exchange Act by Dodd-Frank and require the CFTC to actually determine that position limits will, in fact, help reduce excessive speculation beforethey implement those new rules.  This past fall, my colleagues and I all ran for reelection promising to reduce government regulation and eliminate rulesthat needlessly burden the economy. As we consider the CFTC's ongoing work, we should look no further than the position limitsrulemaking to begin that task.  Position limits are a tool that have merit and purpose in regulating the commodities market. Today, designated contractmarkets core principle V requires every U.exchange to impose, as is necessary and appropriate, position limits or positionaccountability levels on the contracts they offer.  Further, there are several agricultural contracts that have long-established and well understood federally mandated positionlimits. My amendment will not change any of those existing position limits regime.  Prior to Dodd-Frank, the law was clear: if the Commission wanted to impose position limits, it first had to make adetermination that such limits would diminish, eliminate, or prevent the burdens of excessive speculation. Post-Dodd-Frank, thecourts have ruled that additions to the statute have rendered it ambiguous.  Chairman Massad and I have disagreed for the past 3 years about how to read the statute. So today, my amendment fixes theambiguity by affirmatively requiring the Commission to determine that position limits will serve to reduce the burdens ofexcessive speculation before they put them in place.  It is important that the Commission affirmatively determines the need for position limits because limits are an unmistakableburden on market participants.  The current position limits proposal will cost market participants substantially in time and money to comply with. Mostimportantly, it fundamentally changes the way hedgers can seek relief from the rules.  Agricultural producers and processors, power companies, and other commercial hedgers may have fewer bona fide hedges. Whatis more, they might get a hedge exemption, only to get a call from Washington telling them their hedge is invalid and they mustliquidate their position.  The proposal also imposes new recordkeeping and reporting obligations on Futures Commission Merchants, exchanges, and marketparticipants. Less well understood, but no less important, is the impact that position limits in later months might have onmarket liquidity.  Position limits do not have anything to do with the long-term price of commodities. The price of oil, no matter how high itclimbs or how low it falls, is driven by supply and demand.  Congress itself recognized this when it characterized the burdens of excessive speculation as the sudden or unreasonablefluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price of a commodity. There is nothing sudden about a year's-long run-up or a year's-long decline in commodity prices.  That said, I agree there is a role for position limits to play in the management of our commodity markets, especially inmanaging the convergence of prices at the expiration of a contract. But limits are a regulatory tool to promote orderly markets,not a silver bullet to lower commodity prices for consumers.  As a tool, they need to be calibrated to the unique characteristics and historical patterns of each commodity. We cannotimpose them in blind faith that more regulation automatically improves markets.  My amendment is agnostic about the merits of position limits, but it is clear about the need for the government to justifyits rules that restrict economic activity.  As this Congress sets about reducing regulatory burdens, it is important that we start by requiring the CFTC to make adetermination about the need for further regulations before they act.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH404-6.txt,1805,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 428, RED RIVER GRADIENT BOUNDARY",2017.0,12.0,January

11415,topic-id,238,"Mr.Chairman, the CFTC prepared a draft report this past year. Quoting from page 142 of that draft, it says theMasters Hypothesis, which my colleague--who I do have great respect for--said the mere presence of passives distorts themarketplace, that is what Masters Hypothesis said. The CFTC found there are no reputable economic studies which fully endorsethis view of how the commodity futures markets work.  I would like to close with this comment from another study by the chief economist: ``Comment letters on either sidedeclaring that the matter is settled in their favor among respectable economists is simply incorrect. The best economists onboth sides of the debate concede that there is legitimate debate afoot. This analysis paper documents that the academic debateamongst economists about the magnitude, prevalence, and pervasiveness of the risk of outsized market positions has reputable andlegitimate standard-bearers for opposing positions.''  I agree with that in full.

11413,topic-id,795,"Mr.Chairman, I thank Mr.Peterson and Mr.Conaway, with whom I did serve on the AgricultureCommittee with for a number of years, and I recall well some of the discussion and debate as Chairman Gensler appeared beforethe committee on article 7 of the Dodd-Frank  Although, I didn't author that position, former-Senator Dodd is a constituent of mine. So I guess that is close enough tothe work that was done creating this section.  Again, let's be very clear about what this amendment does. It is not about clarifying anything. It is about stripping fromthe law article 7 of Dodd-Frank, which was a congressional mandate to establish position limits for speculative trading.  Again, this was not done in a vacuum. It was done because there has been an explosion of speculative trading that is takingplace in commodities markets. We had testimony in the Congress back in 2010 that it had grown from 22 percent to 67 percentspeculation on Wall Goldman Sachs--when, again, we were dealing with close to $4 a gallon for gas--had a report which saidthat 27 percent of that price was due to speculation. So, Congress appropriately instructed CFTC to come back with a regulatoryplan to limit speculative positions in a reasonable way.  Again, no one quarrels with the fact that end users, whether it is farms, ranchers, airlines, or businesses of all sorts,should be able to exercise options in market swaps.                              {time}  1345  In those instances, these are firms and businesses which actually take physical possession and control of the commodity.Again, what Goldman Sachs and other analysts had demonstrated is that what has been a burgeoning trend is that firms werebeginning to take dominant position in markets that, again, were not even close or remotely involved in the actual production,processing, or use of the commodities that were in question.  So again, CFTC has begun an arduous, painful process of trying to craft a rule. In fact, just a few weeks ago, on December5, the CFTC voted unanimously to again move that process along and come up with a draft of a balanced, reasonable rule, so it isnot a dead-end situation.  As has been reported, what they basically were looking at was a fundamental or a basic limit of roughly about 25 percent ofa commodity could not be controlled by one firm. The end users that I spoke to, as this rule has been making its way, actuallythink that the CFTC is being too generous in terms of allowing an individual firm to control up to 25 percent of a market. Ithink a lot of Americans would understand that that kind of position really would provide for an opportunity to manipulatemarket prices.  In fact, there are some end users who think the rule should be very simple, that you have to take actual physical possessionof the commodity in order to be able to hedge a position or engage in a future option. Again, the CFTC did not go to thatradical extreme. Again, they tried to listen to the thousands of comments--Chairman Gensler, Chairman Massad--to try to fashion arule that allowed a healthy market but did not allow situations which were occurring during high gas and oil prices.  In Connecticut, we had home heating oil suppliers who were describing situations where the price of the heating oil by thetime the truck left the garage and came back was going up 10, 15 cents just during that short period of time for no reason atall. There wasn't like a refinery explosion or some incident that was happening overseas. It was, again, the movement on WallStreet of people who were profiting not from use of the commodity but, in fact, just from the movement on the price. That isreally what CFTC has been hard at work doing.  This amendment will basically shut that down. It is not a clarification. It basically takes away what was Congress'instruction to  Again, I respectfully oppose this amendment. I think we should allow the Commission, which is going to have a RepublicanChairman in a few weeks, to continue to work on this issue and to provide protection for the true end users, the people whoactually use the commodities, as well as consumers. Whether it is those who get their home heating oil tank full, their gas tankfull, whether it is farmers and ranchers who are dealing with things like feed costs, we should have a healthy system of makingsure that individuals or firms cannot have a dominant position in terms of controlling commodities.  This is not an arcane, esoteric issue for This affects bread-and-butter issues in terms of how much they pay foressential goods and commodities for them and their families. I would strongly urge the Members to not accept this amendment. Iurge a ``no'' vote.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

11726,topic-id,519,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the regulatory burden imposed by the SEC's extractive resource rulemaking and offer my support for the resolution to disapprove it.  I will take a few minutes to talk about the complicated history of this rule and then about the concerns with the way it was formulated.  The SEC originally adopted the rule in 2012 and was challenged in court by the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum In 2013, the U.district court threw out the regulation, contending, among other things, that the SEC misread the requirements of the statute. The SEC did not appeal the decision, acknowledging that it needed to rewrite the rule.  The SEC's proposed timetable for a new rule was delayed several times, and in 2014, Oxfam America sued to compel the SEC to move forward on a new rulemaking. The court ordered the SEC to file an expedited schedule and, as a result, a new rule was proposed in 2015 and finalized last year.  As one can see, this rule and its various iterations have been fraught with controversy for many years. Advocates of the rule have said that it will combat corruption in resource-rich nations. The SEC's final rule raised doubts about this. The final rule stated several things, including: The direct causal relationship between increased transparency in the extractive industry and social benefits is ``inconclusive.'' In fact, it noted that ``research and data available at this time does not allow us to draw any firm conclusions.'' Unlike the potential benefits, though, the costs are reasonably certain.  The SEC estimated up to $700 million in initial costs and up to $590 million in ongoing annual costs. Put another way, each company would endure between $560,000 and $1.6 million in initial costs, and between $224,000 and $1.3 million in[[Page S635]]additional costs each year. We cannot view these costs as affecting only the largest companies, but must consider the plight of the smaller ones.  Just under half of all companies covered by this rule are considered smaller companies, and they would be disproportionately impacted by millions of dollars in fixed costs--money that could be better spent on jobs and growth.  Finally, the President's statement of administration policy also endorses this resolution. Some of the reasons it highlights include:       In some cases, the rule would require companies to disclose      information that the host nation of their project prohibits      from disclosure or is commercially sensitive.       The rule would impose unreasonable compliance costs on      American energy companies that are not justified by      quantifiable benefits.       Moreover, American businesses could face a competitive      disadvantage in cases where their foreign competitors are not      subject to similar rules.  I have repeatedly stressed the need for the U.financial system and markets to remain the preferred destination for investors throughout the world, and this rule harms this status.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to preserve the integrity of our securities laws and capital markets.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to at this time enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Georgia, Senator  The PRESIDING Is there objection?  Without objection, it is so ordered.

11369,topic-id,333,"Mr.Chairman, 5 years of bipartisan committee work has contributed to the drafting of H.238, the CommodityEnd-User Relief It is time we passed it for the sake of businesses across the United States who need greater certainty inmanaging their risk.  In advance of writing this legislation to reauthorize the CFTC, the House Committee on Agriculture held 22 hearings on thefuture of the Commission and the state of the derivatives industry. I mention the number 22 to highlight how extensive the datacollection and deliberation has been.  To make this reauthorization as complete and thorough as possible, those 22 hearings collected feedback and testimony fromevery segment of the futures and swaps markets, from end users to regulators. We have used the testimony to draft legislationthat will make derivatives markets work better for those who need them most: businesses trying to manage their risk.  But not only is this reauthorization language exhaustively researched, it has also already been approved by this Chambermultiple times, starting in the 113th  In the 113th Congress, the Committee completed H.4413, which passed the House with strong bipartisan support. In the114th Congress, we put forward the Commodity End-User Relief Act of 2015, which was very similar to H.4413, and also passedthe House with support from both parties. Now, not only is H.238 virtually identical to the reauthorization bill, whichpassed the House last Congress, H.238 also includes the amendments that were adopted on the House floor during debate.  I will turn my focus toward the people that this tested and proven language will help, largely end users. Although end usersare not investors, speculators, or risk takers, they have borne the brunt of many of the consequences of new regulations.  Derivatives are used by a huge swath of businesses for risk management purposes, including manufacturers, farmers, ranchers,and other businesses that buy or sell products overseas, pension funds, insurance companies, and others who face risks that theprices for their business inputs and outputs frequently fluctuate.

It is no surprise that Ty learned to make good use of his own talents and Montana's abudance of trees in order to become a successful homebuilder.  Shortly after graduating from Terry High School in Prairie County, Ty moved west along the Yellowstone Valley and started building homes in the Billings area. He helped build his first home when he was 19 years old. After a few more years of honing his craft, Ty teamed up with Greg Schmidt, and they launched their own company in 2003. Ty's Montana work ethic helped him to discover, develop, and deploy his talents in a way that literally helped to build a better community.

Charles is a member of the Montana Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 214, out of Helena,  On November 16, 2016, Charles was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout at his Eagle board review. Charles' Eagle Scout Service Project involved the planning, building, and installation of three wheelchair ramps at the YMCA Camp Child where children and families grow, learn new skills, and have fun in Montana's outdoors. He made the ramps out of treated lumber and composite planks and installed them at the camp's main lodge and in the girls' and boys' respective shower houses. The installation of these ramps will provide access to those with disabilities for many years to come, making Camp Child a more inclusive place.

When traveling along the many roads in Big Sky Country or stopping in at a local watering hole for a bite to eat, if you are in earshot of a radio and that radio is tuned to local sports, there is a good chance that Rocky is on the other end of the broadcast.  Rocky grew up on his family's wheat farm in the small McCone County community of After high school, he studied telecommunications at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Shortly after completing his degree, Rocky returned to eastern Montana and began to provide Montana sports fans with high quality commentary. Rocky's distinguished broadcasting career began in the early 1980s and continues today. This past weekend, he was calling the play by play for the Montana High School State Basketball Championship tournament games. Rocky's Montana sports program is broadcast daily on 40 stations, and he has been recognized by his peers as the ``Montana Sportscaster of the Year'' on nine separate occasions.

Unfortunately, the resolution that passed the Security Council resolution without our veto was exactly that. It was one-sided.  The resolution contained no fewer than five provisions on Israeli settlement activity. It calls the Jewish neighborhoods of Jerusalem illegal, and it characterizes Jews praying at the Western Wall as being in flagrant violation of international law.  But even if you choose to accept every provision on settlement activity, the resolution included only one very general statement about violence. The U.N., which is historically biased against Israel, could not even condemn Palestinian terrorism against Israel as an obstacle to peace. It is, and the U.must acknowledge it. That is not balanced. It is one-sided.  Today's resolution clearly supports the goal of two states: a Jewish democratic State of Israel living next to a demilitarized Palestinian state as it stands against one-sided U.resolutions to take us further than this goal.

Mr.Speaker, for what may or may not be their good intentions, this resolution and its authors undermined the security of families here and in This ``go it alone'' approach with the current Israeli Government--defying a unanimous vote of 14 countries and ignoring the concerns of many of our allies--is not a path to peace. We will not protect ourselves or our allies in Israel if we pursue the path of isolation.  For decades, we have enjoyed a bipartisan commitment to two states living in peace and security next door to one another. It has been a difficult goal to achieve, but now is not the time to give up on it. There are, sadly, some in Israel and some among the Palestinians who wholly reject this commitment. They believe it is all theirs. They believe in a divine entitlement to every piece of land west of the Jordan Their idea of a reasonable negotiation is that the other side gets next to nothing.  Few people who have worked on this difficult issue and have tried to overcome such zealotry and achieve a just resolution have done as much as Secretary of State John Despite the insults and the intransigence, he has made near Herculean efforts to achieve peace.

11418,topic-id,361,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate the support of the gentleman from Texas and his insight in this amendment. I was aprosecutor in a former life, and we care a lot about due process, making sure that the government can't take something from aprivate individual just because they want to take it.  As an American, I know that protecting intellectual property is a cornerstone of our free enterprise system. That is why Iam concerned about the CFTC's rule on automated trading,[[Page H425]]which takes the unprecedented step of requiring a wide array ofmarket participants engaged in algorithmic trading to maintain a source code repository and make it available for inspection bythe CFTC or the Department of Justice without a subpoena.  Now, this is highly sensitive source code. This is intellectual property that helps the functionality of our marketplace,and to think that this kind of sensitive data can be taken by the Federal Government without a subpoena should shock ourconscience. There are times when the government should get this information; but if they should have it, they should be able touse a subpoena and lay out the cause and the case for why they need to have it.  That is not just my only concern. But the CFTC is potentially going to be taking this source code from all different marketplayers and holding it in a warehouse or a repository, and so we have a concern for hacking. It has been a big conversation asof late. But instead of a foreign entity hacking in to individual companies, they just have to hack the CFTC and they get allthe source code. Just think of the malicious things that can happen if you have the source code of market players, how you candisrupt it, how you can take it down. It is absolutely frightening.  So I think we should have great pause, take a little time to reflect on our Constitution, and continue to respect andsupport due process, which means, if the government wants this information, they should have a subpoena, lay out their case, andthat is the avenue by which they get it, not just because they want it.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Mr.Mr.Chairman, my amendment is a simple, straightforward one, bringing clarity to the law and relief,again, to the end users, such as farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers that use swaps to hedge commercial risks associated withtheir business, including volatile markets and price fluctuations on a day-to-day basis. This critical financial tool allowsthem to do their jobs and provide products in an affordable and accessible manner, keeping consumer costs low.  Discussing Dodd-Frank, Congress always intended that these end users should not have to clear the swaps entered to hedgethese commercial risks and provide the end-user exemption to that end.  The Commodity Exchange Act defines as a financial entity a person predominantly engaged in certain financial activities. TheFed's rulemaking when defining financial activities repeatedly states the rule is for the purpose of title I; therefore,bringing it in to title VII was something they did not have in mind when issuing their definitions of predominantly engaged forfinancial entities. Therefore, financial entities cannot rely on this end-user exception.  However, because of a catchall in the definition of financial entities, end users who engage in successful hedging programscould be regarded as financial entities, thereby creating barriers and unnecessary restrictions to their business operations.This completely turns the concept of being an end user in title VII on its head.  My amendment today ensures end users will not lose their ability to rely on the end-user exception, which is a clearingrequirement due simply to the position performance of a transaction entered into solely to mitigate commercial risk.

Since joining ABC 7's ``Eyewitness News'' in 1991, its newscast was and remains the most watched TV news in On Charles's 25th anniversary at the station, he said: ``I am very blessed to have worked here and like to think that my efforts have had something to do with that success.'' As an avid viewer, I am here to say it has. His unique perspective and keen ability to tell stories make him invaluable to any newsroom.

For more than a quarter century, Charles has covered the biggest stories in the country--the OJ Simpson Trial, Oklahoma City bombing, Rodney King trials, Great Chicago Flood, and the election of the first African-American President, to name just a few.

His remarkable career has taken him to every State in America and five continents, and he leaves with no regrets.

Charles Thomas has had an amazing career. His work earned him two Emmy awards for reporting in 1983 and 1992. Although he is retiring, Charles is not done telling stories. He plans to explore digital storytelling focusing on the African-American community, celebrating positive stories often missing in local and national broadcasts--what a noble and necessary endeavor.

11742,topic-id,910,"Mr.President, during my time in the Congress, I have had the privilege of visiting many other nations, often fragile or new democracies struggling to meet the needs of growing numbers of youth and emerging middle classes.  For example, many of the fastest growing economies are in the developing nations of Africa and In fact, a few years ago, the World Bank said Africa was on ``the brink of an economic take-off.''  Such economic gains should be welcome news for lifting millions out of poverty, providing better basic services such as education and health care, and improving the lives of women.  They are also opportunities to create more markets for our goods and services, to add to our global allies, and to reverse the conditions that lead to violent extremism.  But for those of us who have visited many such nations, we are also aware of a major impediment to realizing these improvements--namely effective and clean government.  You see, too often, endemic corruption--frequently around lucrative extractive oil and minerals--robs untold sums from generation after generation in many of these nations.  Just look at such oil rich nations as Angola, Venezuela, Nigeria, or Equatorial Guinea, where government after government squandered and stole the oil wealth from its own people, far too many of whom still live in terrible squalor.  Some of you may remember the devastating column Nicholas Kristof wrote in 2015, ``Deadliest Country for Kids.'' Here is how he describe Angola: ``This is a country laden with oil, diamonds, Porsche-driving millionaires and toddlers starving to death. . . . this well off but corrupt African nation is ranked 1 in the world in the rate at which children die before the age of five. . . . Under the corrupt and autocratic president, Jose Educardo dos Santos, who has ruled for 35 years, billons of dollars flow to a small elite--as kids starve.''  He continues: ``There are many ways for a leader to kill his people, and although dos Santos isn't committing genocide he is presiding over the systematic looting of his state and neglect of his people . . . Let 's hold dos Santos accountable and recognize that extreme corruption and negligence can be something close to a mass atrocity.''  In 2008, Republican Foreign Relations Committee staff, under then-Senator Richard Lugar, released a report on this scourge, ``The Petroleum and Poverty Paradox.''  The report from Lugar discussed the ``resource curse'' which is a ``phenomenon whereby large reserves of oil or other resources often negatively affect a country's economic growth, corruption level and stability.''  Why is this important? Let me quote from the report: ``This `resource curse'[[Page S644]]affects us as well as producing countries. It exacerbates global poverty which can be a seedbed for terrorism, it dulls the effect of our foreign assistance, it empowers autocrats and dictators, and it can crimp world petroleum supplies by breeding instability. . . . This report argues that transparency in revenues, expenditure and wealth management from extractive industries is crucial to defeating the resource curse.''  Wise words from a wise man.  And so, this report became the basis for a very thoughtful, bipartisan law that I was proud to support which tried to tackle this issue in a very commonsense manner.  It simply required that the SEC issue a rule requiring all oil, gas, and mineral companies listed on the U.Stock Exchange to disclose royalties, bonuses, fees, taxes, and other payments made to foreign governments as a transparency tool for fighting corruption.  The U.law became the catalyst for others: all 28 European Union member states have enacted similar legislation, followed by Norway and then Canada, who are key players in extractive industries--further establishing an international norm.  Moreover, a study conducted by business professors at George Washington University and Catholic University found that increased transparency resulting from disclosures required under the rule lowers the cost of capital for covered U.listed firms by up to $12.6 billion.  So claims that this is burdensome and will result in competitive harm to American firms are unfounded and simply untrue.  So here we are, 4 months since our intelligence services disclosed that a former KGB official led a cyber act of war on our Nation and democracy--and what is the priority of the Republican majority?  Establishing an independent commission to look into the Russian attack?   Taking up bipartisan legislation to tighten sanctions on Russia for its attack on our Nation?   In fact, not a single Republican has even come to the Senate floor to discuss these grave matters of national security.  Ronald Reagan, who understood the Russian mentality so well, must be turning in his grave to see this abdication by his party.  Instead, what is the majority party's priority?  Well, repealing health care from millions without an alternative--and, now, trying to strip this good governance anticorruption law--one led by a member of their own party and subject to years of debate and input--aimed at addressing corruption that robs so much from the world's poor--not exactly draining the swamp.  This isn't an onerous rule. It is simply a matter of disclosure, transparency, and good governance. It is hard to understand opposition to greater transparency.  As such, I will vote against his measure and I urge my colleagues, especially my Republican colleagues who have made helping the world's poor one of their endeavors to do the same, don't vote to put more money in the pockets of the world's worst autocrats at the expense of the world's most vulnerable.

The Security Council resolution is highly critical of Israel yet asks nothing directly of the That is biased, that is unfair, and that is not balanced. Again, we should have opposed it. We should have vetoed it.  The language about Jerusalem is not new but it remains deeply offensive to Jews, whose holiest site lies on the Temple Mount in East The Kotel, the Holy Western Wall, is simply nonoccupied territory. And it is offensive to hear that.  So in the measure the House is considering today, we repudiate this flawed Security Council resolution. And at the same time, we will say once again that we support a two-state solution, that the only way to reach that goal is through direct negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and that this shameful Security Council resolution put that goal further out of reach.  Mr.Speaker, the international community faces the longest suppressing issues: mass killings in South Sudan, a crisis in Yemen, a humanitarian disaster in Syria, Russia's illegal occupation of the Ukraine, and North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Yet, rather than deal with those critical problems, the member states of the U.have chosen instead to use the international body to embarrass It is outrageous. This House Resolution that I am cosponsoring with Mr.Royce rightfully says that it is outrageous.  I think it was a mistake for the current administration to abstain on this vote in the U.I have been very clear about that, but I want to be fair. Before anyone turns this into another attack on President Obama, we should be aware of the history of this issue.  This is the first time in 8 years the Obama administration has allowed a resolution, opposed by Israel, to go forward. The George Bush administration allowed it to happen 6 times; the Clinton administration, 3 times; the first Bush administration, 6 times; and the Reagan administration, 10 times, including voting for one strongly condemning Israel for its ``premeditated and unprecedented attack of aggression'' when it wisely destroyed Iraq's nuclear weapons reactor in 1981.  But regardless of that history, it doesn't justify these latest abstentions. My mother used to say that two wrongs don't make a right. And she was right. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now.  I think allowing governments to bully Israel and the U.is a mistake, no matter who is in power. Instead, let's focus on what we should be doing when it comes to advancing the two-state solution.  This resolution calls for us to get back to the policy that many of us support: one, standing with Israel and the United Nations; two, stopping one-sided resolutions; and three, supporting direct negotiations as the only way to move toward a two-state solution.  This resolution says all that. Every one in this Congress should be voting for it because it is balanced. I am pleased to support this resolution, and I urge all Members to do the same.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH146.txt,344,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1628, AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF",2017.0,5.0,January

11637,topic-id,2292,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the so-called HONEST Whether in its incarnation last Congress as the Secret Science Act or in this year's incarnation as the HONEST Act, let us be clear, this Orwellian-named bill is clearly designed to suppress certain scientific research that has been the foundation for essential health and environmental regulations.  In addition to hindering scientific advancement, this bill risks violating people's privacy by exposing sensitive patient data, and it is harmful to public health.  The clear aim of the HONEST Act is to undermine EPA's efforts to take action in a variety of areas, such as climate and air pollution.  Let me also be clear, in my State of Connecticut, we rely on those regulations to deal with the asthma crisis we have based on power plants in other parts of the country blowing polluted air into my  The so-called HONEST Act accomplishes this objective by excluding legitimate, peer-reviewed research from the policy process. If this bill were to become law, EPA would have no choice but to lean increasingly on industry-funded studies instead.  At my recent townhall meeting in Waterbury, Connecticut, one American after another stood up and expressed their fear and outrage at the attempts made in this House and by the new administration to take science out of public policy.  My constituents want genuine scientific research guiding our efforts to protect our environment and safeguard public health. They don't want agenda-driven studies funded by fossil fuel companies determining the EPA's actions on climate policy.                              {time}  1415  While the majority attempted to alleviate some of our privacy concerns with this bill, the reality is that any person whom EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt deems worthy will have access to sensitive patient information.  Why is this a problem?  Because fewer people will be willing to participate in the studies that are necessary to understand air and water quality issues.  Who can blame them?  No one wants their medical records shared with strangers, or worse, made public.  The result is that the EPA will have to rely on incomplete science to issue lifesaving regulations.  Sadly, Mr.Speaker, this bill is yet another example of the political crusade against science that we are seeing coming from both Congress and the new administration.  We should be confronting the economic and environmental realities of our changing climate. But just yesterday, President Trump issued an executive order that would have us pretend that climate change does not exist.  Only weeks earlier, the EPA Administrator himself said, without evidence, that he disagreed with the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary contributor to global climate change.  In my home State of Connecticut, we are downwind from these power plants that are burning dirty coal. We see elevated rates of asthma, higher rates of cardiopulmonary issues. If this bill is passed, many longitudinal, scientific studies like the ones that establish the link between air pollution and asthma, would be excluded from playing a role in the EPA's actions.  Mr.Speaker, let's allow the EPA to do its job. I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided bill.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in opposition from the Union of Concerned Scientists and from the Environmental Defense                                Union of Concerned Scientists,                                                    March 9, 2017.       Dear Representative: The Union of Concerned Scientists,      with 500,000 members and supporters throughout the country,      strongly opposes H.1430, the misleadingly named Honest and      Open New EPA Science Treatment Act (HONEST Act) of 2017. The      proposal shows that supporters of this legislation have a      fundamental misunderstanding of the process by which science      operates and is ultimately a solution in search of a problem.       This legislation would require that all raw data, models,      code, and other materials from scientific studies be made      available to the public before a federal agency could use it.      But, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) already is      exhaustingly transparent and the science it relies on to make      decisions is made available to the public.       The true intention of this bill is not to increase      transparency in agency use of science in policymaking, but      rather to handcuff the EPA from ever using critical      information necessary to follow through on statutorily      required rulemaking for popular legislation like the Clean      Air Act and the Clean Water The additional restrictions      imposed by this proposed bill would make it almost impossible      to base public protections on the best available scientific      information. In particular, if enacted, the language appears      to indicate that the EPA would be inhibited by the following      challenges:       The EPA wouldn't be able to use most health studies. It      should be expected that any agency tasked with protecting      public health should be able to use public health data. The      confidentiality of such data is usually protected by      institutional review boards[[Page H2541]]     (IRB) to insure the privacy of the participants; thus, the      data could not be made publicly available as demanded. Since      many EPA rules are health-based standards, this rule would      severely restrict the ability of the agency to base rules on      science.       The EPA wouldn't be able to draw from industry data      sources. The agency would be prevented from using data      provided by industry to the agency. Since information from      industry sources is often not publicly available, to protect      proprietary data from their competitors, a law requiring as      such would prevent the agency from utilizing industry data, a      source of information that often provides otherwise unknown      data to inform EPA rulemaking.       The EPA wouldn't be able to use new and innovative science.      New scientific methods and data may be restricted by      intellectual property protections or industry trade secret      exemptions. This bill doesn't include protections for      intellectual property, and it makes industry trade secrets      available upon request to anyone who signs an agreement. If      researchers and industry knew that sharing their science with      the EPA meant that their intellectual property would be      exposed to the world, they might opt out. This would limit      EPA's ability to rely on the best available science including      novel approaches that may not yet be publicly available.       Long-term and meta-analyses would be unavailable. Many of      the public health and safety issues facing the nation cannot      be measured within a small timeframe. The EPA needs long-term      exposure studies that assess the link between chronic      diseases/mortality and pollutants; or on meta-analyses that      include many different studies and locations to provide a      more robust look at the science. In H.1430, the provision      that studies be conducted ``in a manner that is sufficient      for independent analysis and substantial reproduction of      research'' may prevent use of these vital studies by the EPA,      as it is unclear whether such spatially and temporally      comprehensive studies would be considered ``sufficient for      substantial reproduction.''       The CBO estimates exorbitant costs. The attempt to      implement this law would also make the EPA process much more      costly. For past iterations of this legislation, the CBO has      estimated it may take up to $250 million annually for the EPA      simply to comply, and that doesn't even account for the lost      benefits from delaying the protections themselves. Compounded      with the cuts to EPA's budget that are being proposed, this      would just further prevent the agency from being able to do      its job.       H.1430 makes a token attempt to address some of the      criticisms about privacy concerns for personal medical      information and trade secrets. But in practice, the challenge      of identifying and redacting all protected and privileged      information sets up a series of hurdles and complications      that will deter agencies from using the best scientific      analysis to inform their work.       Small, cosmetic tweaks do not change the fact that this      bill is based on a flawed premise and that the authors of the      legislation do not understand the scientific process.      Furthermore, the burden imposed on the EPA to redact      documents would ultimately place limits on the amount of      actual scientific work the EPA can do. The EPA does not exist      in a world of infinite resources.       When this bill was introduced in the 114th Congress as the      ``Secret Science Reform Act,'' it received a veto threat from      the Obama administration, which noted that it would      ``interfere'' with the EPA's ability to protect public      health, safety, and the environment. The worry is that now,      with an administration that has shown zero interest in using      science to enact safeguards, this legislation could cripple      the agency.       I strongly urge you to oppose H 1430, the so-called      HONEST The only honest thing about this legislation is      that it truly opens the window into the real intentions of      the supporters of the bill, and that is to stop the EPA from      fulfilling its science-based mission to protect public health      and the environment. H.1430 is a wolf in sheep's clothing,      purporting to increase public accessibility to data used in      rulemaking, while actually crippling the EPA's ability to use      the best available scientific and technical information to      protect public health and the environment.       Agencies protecting our public health should be able to use      public health data and attempts to undermine agencies      shouldn't be cloaked in false transparency. This Trojan-horse      transparency bill would inhibit the EPA's ability to carry      out its science-based mission to protect human health and the      environment. It does not deserve your support.           Sincerely,     Andrew Rosenberg, Ph.D.,       Director, Center for Science and Democracy, Union of      Concerned                                  ____                                                   EDF Action,                                                    March 8, 2017.     Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,          Washington,     Eddie Bernice Johnson,     Ranking Member, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: The      Environmental Defense Action Fund strongly opposes the      ``Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of      2017'' and the ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of      2017''.       Despite their benign-sounding titles, these bills would      have devastating effects on public health and the      Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ability to consider      and use sound science.       The HONEST Act, a rebranded version of the ``Secret Science      Reform Act'' from prior sessions of Congress, is framed as a      measure to increase transparency by requiring that EPA only      use studies that are publicly available online and      replicable. Yet, as testimony before your Committee has made      clear, these requirements would in many cases prevent the EPA      from using the best available science for public health      decision-making.       Many epidemiological studies--for example a study on the      causes of breast cancer--rely on health data that are legally      confidential. This legislation suggests that EPA will be      given the authority to disclose confidential medical      information on breast cancer patients to anyone willing to      sign a confidentiality agreement. EPA would also be      responsible for identifying and redacting any information      that should not be made broadly publicly available in the      first place. Not only is this not an appropriate role for      EPA, it could severely restrict both the number of studies      EPA can use and the willingness of participants to be part of      vital health studies.       In addition, the Act's requirements for replicability mean      that critical longitudinal studies that follow health      outcomes of individuals or groups over years, even decades,      could not be used because--       (1) they are inherently not replicable (e.g., a study that      follows health outcomes of first responders following a      single event such as the tragic 9/11 attack); or       (2) where they are replicable, it would take years to show      that the results could be reproduced (e.g., a study that      examines the impacts on intelligence at childhood from      environmental exposures that occurred in utero).       Furthermore, even if, say, a longitudinal study that      follows a cohort of individuals over 20 years could in      principle be reproduced, there are practical and ethical      reasons why it couldn't or shouldn't be. The same goes for a      long-term environmental monitoring study, or data collected      from a one-time event like the Deepwater Horizon       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has found that      previous iterations of this legislation would impede the      number of studies the EPA can rely on--by their estimate,      reducing the number of studies by half. Restricting EPA to      just some of the existing scientific literature will prevent      the agency from using the latest and most accurate science      when developing regulations. Moreover, the tremendous      resource burden of making data publicly available (CBO's      central estimate was $250 million a year) would create a      strong incentive to reduce the amount of scientific data and      analysis considered as part of decision-making. The net      effect would be to undermine EPA's ability to rely on the      best available science and unnecessarily put the public at      greater environmental and health risk.       Similarly, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of      2017 undermines scientific integrity of the Contrary to      longstanding practice, the bill allows individuals with      financial conflicts of interest to serve on the EPA Science      Advisory Board (SAB) so long as those conflicts are      disclosed. This would permit an infusion of special corporate      interest into what should remain an objective scientific      review of EPA work products.       Incredibly, at the same time, the bill makes it more      difficult for academic experts to participate on the The      bill considers an expert's research on a topic covered by the      Board to be a conflict of interest, when in fact the      academic's expertise would make them more, not less,      valuable. In addition, receipt of EPA research grants and      contracts, standard for universities, would be construed to      constitute a conflict of interest for a scientist or expert.      And a SAB member would be precluded from accepting any such      grant or contract for three years after serving on the board      which may deter qualified experts from serving on the       The ``Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST)      Act of 2017'' and the ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act      of 2017'' would block the use of sound science by EPA in      developing public safeguards. For these reasons, EDF Action      strongly opposes these bills.

Instead, Justice Scalia simply understood the Constitution, as the Founders understood it.  Judge Scalia's passing marked a watershed moment for the future of our country.

Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to attend the ceremony at the White House and listen to Judge Gorsuch accept his nomination. I was impressed by his humble respect for the law and for his commitment to service. I was particularly struck by his recognition that ``it is for Congress, not the courts, to write new laws'' and that a Justice should make decisions based on what the law demands, not the outcome that he or she desires.  I also appreciate his experience as an appellate court judge. This experience has given him a firm understanding of a properly functioning Federal circuit. As someone who has tried to reform an oversized and overworked Ninth Circuit, I really appreciate that insight.  Judge Gorsuch is an accomplished, mainstream jurist with a judicial philosophy worthy of Judge Scalia's seat. We can be confident that he will read the law as written and not attempt to legislate from the bench, but if we allow rigid partisan and ideological calculus to seep into our confirmation process, I fear that no President will ever be able to get a Cabinet or Supreme Court pick confirmed.  A favorite line of our former President is that ``elections have consequences.'' Indeed, they do. Like it or not, the winning party governs. That is democracy, and we have a responsibility now to govern.  My hope is a return to the longstanding traditions of bipartisan cooperation on this Supreme Court nomination.

11648,topic-id,573,"Mr.Speaker, for years Americans across the country have struggled under a government takeover of health care. Because of ObamaCare, insurance markets are collapsing, healthcare costs are soaring, and patients' choices are dwindling. Simply put, the flawed healthcare law is failing. It is hurting hardworking men and women across the country, and the American people deserve better.  That is why Republicans promised to deliver the healthcare solutions Americans desperately need. This week, we are making good on that promise and moving forward with an effort that will provide a better way on health care.  After a thoughtful and collaborative process, members of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee recently unveiled a legislative plan that will repeal and replace The plan, the American Health Care Act, includes a number of positive, commonsense reforms that will help create more choices, lower costs, and give control back to individuals and families.  These reforms will create a new and innovative fund giving States the flexibility they need to design programs that fit the needs of their communities. They will responsibly unwind ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion in a way that protects patients and strengthens the program for future generations.  The plan will also dismantle ObamaCare taxes and mandates--including the individual and employer mandate penalties and taxes on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, health insurance premiums, and medical devices. It will expand health savings accounts to empower individuals and families to spend their healthcare dollars the way they want and need. It will provide tax credits to those who don't receive insurance through work or a government program, helping all Americans access high quality, affordable health care.  At the same time, we on the Education and the Workforce Committee are working to advance additional reforms that will help expand coverage, make health care more affordable, and promote a healthy workforce.  One legislative proposal will empower small businesses to band together to negotiate lower healthcare costs on behalf of their employees. Another will protect the ability of employers to self-insure, providing greater access to affordable, flexible healthcare plans for their workers. The third will give employers the legal certainty they need to offer employee wellness plans, helping to promote a healthy workforce and, again, lower healthcare costs.  These three legislative proposals reflect a few shared principles. Families should have the freedom to choose the healthcare plan that meets their needs. Americans need more affordable healthcare options, not fewer. Healthcare decisions should rest with patients and their doctors--not government bureaucrats. Instead of prescriptive mandates, we should ensure employers have the tools they need to help their employees afford health care.  These proposals--along with those in the American Health Care Act--are exactly the kind of free-market, patient-centered reforms Republicans promised, and they reflect the priorities of President Trump and his administration. They are the products of a careful process that took into account the ideas and concerns of men and women from all walks of life, and they will now be considered through an open, transparent process that provides policymakers on both sides of the aisle an opportunity to share their views and offer their ideas.  I encourage everyone--my colleagues in Congress, as well as all Americans--to join in this process. Visit readthebill.gop. See for yourself the plan we have laid out, and help us move forward with these positive solutions.

It is a handout to insurance and pharmaceutical companies that literally pulls the rug out from those who are most needy and most vulnerable in our communities.  While corporations rake in over $600 billion in tax breaks, many low-income Americans will see their coverage drop completely.  Medicaid, a program that one in five Americans depend on for basic care, would be slashed by hundreds of billions of dollars, shifting costs to already-strained State and local governments.  Our kupuna, our seniors, could see their premiums increase up to five times more than young, healthy people under these new age rating rules in this bill.  Simply put, we need a healthcare system that puts people before profits. I urge my colleagues strongly to vote ``no'' against this legislation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO score for the underlying bill and the first four manager's amendments. We just got it last night, and it is already out-of-date given the fifth manager's amendment that was just submitted late last night.                                                    U.Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,                Dear Mr.Speaker: At your request, the Congressional Budget      Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)      have prepared an estimate of the direct spending and revenue      effects of H.1628, the American Health Care Act, as posted      on the website of the House Committee on Rules on March 22,      2017, incorporating manager's amendments 4, 5, 24, and 25.       As a result of those amendments, this estimate shows      smaller savings over the next 10 years than the estimate that      CBO issued on March 13 for the reconciliation recommendations      of the House Committee on Ways and Means and the House      Committee on Energy and The estimated effects on      health insurance coverage and on premiums for health      insurance are similar to those estimated for the committees'      recommendations.                     Effects on the Federal Budget       CBO and JCT estimate that enacting H.1628, with the      proposed amendments, would reduce federal deficits by $150      billion over the 2017-2026 period; that reduction is the net      result of a $1,150 billion reduction in direct spending,      partly offset by a reduction of $999 billion in revenues (see      Tables 1 and 2). The provisions dealing with health insurance      coverage would reduce deficits, on net, by $883 billion (see      Table 3); the noncoverage provisions would increase deficits      by $733 billion, mostly by reducing revenues.       Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the      legislation would affect direct spending and revenues. CBO      and JCT estimate that enacting the legislation would not      increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of      the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027.                  Effects on Health Insurance Coverage       CBO and JCT estimate that, in 2018, 14 million more people      would be uninsured under the legislation than under current      law. The increase in the number of uninsured people relative      to the number under current law would reach 21 million in      2020 and 24 million in 2026 (see Table 4). In 2026, an      estimated 52 million people under age 65 would be uninsured,      compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year      under current law.                          Effects on Premiums       H.1628, with the proposed amendments, would tend to      increase average premiums in the nongroup market before 2020      and lower average premiums thereafter, relative to      projections under current law. In 2018 and 2019, according to      CBO and JCT's estimates, average premiums for single      policyholders in the nongroup market would be 15 percent to      20 percent higher under the legislation than under current      law. By 2026, average premiums for single policyholders in      the nongroup market would be roughly 10 percent lower than      under current law.                 Uncertainty Surrounding the Estimates       The ways in which federal agencies, states, insurers,      employers, individuals, doctors, hospitals, and other      affected parties would respond to the changes made by the      legislation are all difficult to predict, so the estimates in      this report are uncertain. But CBO and JCT have endeavored to      develop estimates that are in the middle of the distribution      of potential outcomes.                 Comparison With the Previous Estimate       On March, 13, 2017, CBO and JCT estimated that enacting the      reconciliation recommendations of the House Committee on Ways      and Means and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce      (which were combined into H.1628) would yield a net      reduction in federal deficits of $337 billion over the 2017-     2026 period. CBO estimates that enacting H.1628, with the      proposed amendments, would save $186 billion less over that      period. That reduction in savings stems primarily from      changes to H.1628 that modify provisions affecting the      Internal Revenue Code and the Medicaid program.       Over the 2017-2026 period, modifications to provisions      affecting the Internal Revenue Code that are not directly      related to the law's insurance coverage provisions would      reduce JCT's estimate of revenues by $137 billion. Reducing      the threshold for determining the medical care deduction on      individuals' income tax returns from 7.5 percent of income to      5.8 percent would reduce revenues by about $90 billion. Other      changes include adjusting the effective dates and making      other modifications to the provisions that repeal or delay      many of the changes in the Affordable Care Act, which would      reduce revenues by $48 billion.       A number of changes to the Medicaid program would reduce      CBO's estimate of savings by $41 billion over the 2017-2026      period. The reduction would result from revising the formula      for calculating the per capita allotments in Medicaid to      allow for faster growth of the per capita cost of aged,      blind, and disabled enrollees. The effects of changing that      formula would be offset somewhat by the effects of three      other provisions that would increase savings: reducing the      per capita allotment in Medicaid for the state of New York in      proportion to any financing the state receives from county      governments; providing states the option to make eligibility      for Medicaid conditional on satisfying work requirements for      enrollees who are not single parents of children under age 6      or who are not pregnant or disabled; and allowing states to      receive a block grant for Medicaid coverage of children and      some adults instead of funding based on a per capita cap.       Other smaller changes resulting from the manager's      amendments would reduce savings by an estimated $8 billion      over the period.       Compared with the previous version of the legislation, H.     1628, with the proposed amendments, would have similar      effects on health insurance coverage: Estimates differ by no      more than half a million people in any category in any year      over the next decade. (Some differences may appear larger      because of rounding.) For example, the decline in Medicaid      coverage after 2020 would be smaller than in the previous      estimate, mainly because of states' responses to the faster      growth in the per capita allotments for aged, blind, and      disabled enrollees--but other changes in Medicaid would      offset some of those effects.       The legislation's impact on health insurance premiums would      be approximately the same as estimated for the previous      version.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them.

On the floor of this House in 2011, the President of the United States promised the American people ``to reduce barriers to growth and investment . . . when we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them.''  But, Mr.Speaker, those were just President Obama's words. His actions were starkly different. Throughout the entire 8 years of the Obama administration, a flood of new, major regulations has been burying America's job creators and households at record levels; and to make matters worse, when Congress declined to legislate the President's misguided policies for him, he increasingly resorted to unilateral regulatory actions to legislate by executive fiat.  It is time to say, ``Never again.'' The REINS Act, in one fell swoop, puts a stop to abuses like President Obama's and assures that Congress--the body to which the Constitution assigns the power to legislate--has the necessary tools to block the most overreaching[[Page H173]]regulations and mandates on the American people.

I begin by thanking Representative Doug Collins of Georgia and the Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee Ranking Member Steve Cohen of Tennessee for introducing this important government transparency legislation.  Every year, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, the Federal Government, through settlement or court order, pays millions of dollars in legal fees and costs to parties to lawsuits and administrative adjudications that involve the Federal  However, despite the large amount of taxpayer dollars paid out each year, the Federal Government no longer comprehensively keeps track of the amount of fees and other expenses awarded pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, nor does the government compile and report on why these fees and expenses were paid and to whom these costs were awarded.  This is because, in 1995, Congress repealed the Department of Justice's reporting requirements and defunded the Administrative Conference of the United States, the agency charged with reporting this basic information.  The Administrative Conference was established in 2010, but the requirements to report on fee and cost payments have not been reenacted. Accordingly, there has been no official governmentwide accounting of this information since fiscal year 1994, over 20 years ago.  This lack of transparency is troubling, given that the Equal Access to Justice Act is considered by many to be the most important Federal fee-shifting statute. Fundamentally, the act recognizes that there is an enormous disparity of resources between the Federal Government and individuals and small businesses who seek to challenge Federal actions.                              {time}  1715  Congress enacted the Equal Access to Justice Act to provide individuals, small businesses, and small nonprofit groups with financial incentives to challenge the Federal Government or defend themselves from lawsuits brought by the Federal As the Supreme Court has noted, the act was adopted with the specific purpose of eliminating for the average person the financial disincentive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.  But how can we know if the act is working well toward this end if we have no data on awards?

That, of course, is very unfortunate, as well as being ridiculous--in other words, saying you are going to filibuster somebody before you even know who the nominee is. But of course, given[[Page S642]]how the minority has treated the President's Cabinet nominees so far, it is not exactly surprising that they would say this before the President even nominated somebody for the  Then, of course, this week the President announced his nominee. Judge Gorsuch, of course, was confirmed by the Senate in 2006 without a single ``no'' vote and is universally respected as one of the finest and most fairminded judges in the country. In fact--get this--one of President Obama's Solicitors General called him ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our Nation over the last century.''  Now, if an Obama Solicitor General says that and that is not mainstream enough, I don't know what is. After the President's announcement, something very interesting happened. Right out of the gate, there were a number of Senate Democrats calling for ``a hearing and a vote.'' Well, that certainly sounds very encouraging. The press picked up on these comments, and one newspaper even reported that after learning who the nominee was, there were already seven Senate Democrats opposed to filibustering this nominee.  At first glance, it appears those Democrats were trying to be consistent with their stance from last year that a nominee deserves a hearing and an up-or-down vote. But of course, now they conveniently seem to have dropped the up-or-down portion of that stand.  Now, isn't that a nice trick, a new trick. Take, for example, one of my colleagues, who last year said: ``The Constitution says the Senate shall advise and consent, and that means having an up-or-down vote.'' But oddly, just yesterday, that same colleague said: ``I support a 60-vote margin for all Supreme Court nominees.''  That is a very nice sleight of hand. But most of the Senators are not that gullible. The Washington Post Fact Checker certainly took notice of their wordsmithing. That has earned them two When you look at the facts, a 60-vote threshold has never been a standard, as the minority leader said yesterday. Otherwise, we would not have two of the current justices sitting on the Supreme  Of course, my colleagues tried unsuccessfully to filibuster Justice The Senate voted 72 to 25 to invoke cloture. He was then confirmed 58 to 42 on an up-or-down vote.  Justice Thomas, now on the Supreme Court for 25 years, was confirmed 52 to 48. There was no cloture vote on Justice Thomas's nomination. In fact, the Senate did not set any sort of a requirement that there be 60 votes for 7 of the 8 justices serving on the So, if there has been any sort of requirement or practice in the Senate on Supreme Court nominees, it has, in fact, been that the nominee does not need 60 votes, although many of them received that kind of support.  We already know some Members have pledged to filibuster the nominee. This minority leader stated that part of the ``fair process'' is a 60-vote threshold. I suppose that if you are already committed to attempting a filibuster on a Supreme Court nominee before you even know who that person might be, then you might consider that part of a fair process.  Of course, we all know--all Republicans and Democrats know--that launching a filibuster against a Supreme Court nominee is not part of a fair process. It never has been. But I suppose we should cut our colleagues just a little bit of slack. They are having a hard time figuring out how to make good on their promise to attack the nominee no matter who it is, when they have now been presented with a nominee with impeccable credentials as well as broad bipartisan support.  This brings me to the second brief point that I want to make. Judge Gorsuch had barely finished speaking at the White House, and there were already attacks on the nominee by some on the left. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had already taken to the Senate floor to attack and mischaracterize Judge Gorsuch's record. Though we expected it, these scurrilous attacks are untoward and obviously misplaced. After all, those on the left trot out the same tired arguments against every Republican nominee.  Now, you know, going back a few years--maybe, too far for some of you younger Members--they attacked Justice Stevens because he ``revealed an extraordinary lack of sensitivity to problems that women face.''  They called Justice Kennedy a sexist who ``would be a disaster for women.'' They said there was ``ample reason to fear'' Justice Of course, you know what turned out. Justices Stevens and Souter turned out to be favorites of the left, and too often Justice Kennedy has ruled the liberal way.  This morning, the Washington Post editorial board noted that, while we argued last year--meaning the paper argued last year--that the President should not fill a Supreme Court vacancy that occurs during a Presidential election year, Senate Republicans--quoting the Post--``refrained from tarring Mr.Garland personally.''  Now, in contrast, the paper noted that this dissent is unwarranted this early by writing this: ``Trashing Mr.Gorsuch as an outlandish radical, despite his impeccable credentials, the wide respect he commands in his field, his long service as an appeals court judge and the unanimous voice vote he received the last time the Senate considered him for the Federal bench is, at the very least, premature.''  Our friends on the other side of the aisle would do well to take note of the Washington Post's observation. So I would like to make this point. If the process we have witnessed for the President's Cabinet nominees is any guide, I am quite confident that we will hear all manner of reasons and arguments about why we should delay a hearing on Judge  But as my friend and former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, often noted, Supreme Court nominees don't have the opportunity to respond to personal attacks outside of their confirmation hearing. So I am going to consult with the ranking member on timing for the hearing. But I can tell you what we are not going to do. We are not going to delay this hearing, especially in the face of all of these attacks on his record and character, which, both for the record and for his character, are unjustified.  So I will conclude with this. I had the good fortune of meeting one-on-one with Judge Gorsuch yesterday. He is as impressive a person in person as he is on paper. I expect that as my friends on the other side of the aisle meet Judge Gorsuch and actually review his record, they will find him to be an imminently qualified and universally respected judge, whose decisions faithfully applying the text of the law place him well within the judicial mainstream.  Now, maybe people that say they want a mainstream judge wanted an activist judge who will read the text the way the judge wants it read for their own personal views, as opposed to the intent by But Judge Gorsuch is doing what any judge should do reading the law. He said: If any judge likes every decision he makes, then he is not a very good judge.  Now, this is what we are going to do. We are going to do our due diligence, and we are going to send a questionnaire to Judge Gorsuch in the next day or so. I will expect he will answer that questionnaire promptly, and then we will do what I said before the election, before we knew who was going to be the next  In fact, we thought it was going to be Secretary When I say we, the country as a whole had that in their mind. There was no doubt about it. So I said before the election, as the one responsible for not having a hearing on the previous nominee, that, whoever was elected President, this process was going to move forward.  So we will have that hearing where Members can ask this nominee any questions they deem appropriate. We will vote on him in committee, and the full Senate will vote on his nomination. But given his exemplary record and the facts as we know them, I expect this nominee to be confirmed.  I yield the floor.

I will be in Washington late that evening because the event that I am going to is on January 21. It is the Women's March on  You can get more information on Facebook, which is how I heard about it, or should I say, how my wife, Soraida, heard about it.

And she told me about the Women's She said: You and I are going together.  Now, I can already hear the phones ringing in my office with people calling to say: Oh, you Democrats are sore losers and you just hate  I went to George Bush's inauguration and I work with Republicans all the time. Just read Breitbart, which seems to write an article anytime I even glance favorably at a Republican colleague.  But this is different. I knew that George Bush and I would disagree on many issues from trade to health care, to the war in Iraq, but I never thought that George Bush was trying to make my own country hostile to me personally, to my wife, to my daughters, to my grandson. I never felt he was a threat to the Nation that I love so deeply and have served now for more than a quarter of a century.  The reason that I am not going is that I cannot bring myself to justify morally or intellectually the immense power we are placing in that man's hands.  I could not look at my wife, my daughters, or my grandson in the eye if I sat there and attended as if everything that the candidate said about the women, about the Latinos, the Blacks, the Muslims or any of the other things he said in those speeches and tweets, and that all of that is okay or erased from our collective memory.  We all heard the tape when Donald Trump was bragging--bragging--about grabbing women by their private parts without their consent. It is something I just can't unhear, bragging to that guy on TV that he would grab women below the belt, as if that was hitting on them. It is never okay. It is never just locker room talk. It is offensive and, if he ever actually did it, it is a crime.  I hang out with Republicans, with Republican-elected officials in an actual locker room in the Rayburn Building, and if they ever started talking like that, I wouldn't just walk away. I would tell them to their faces that they are wrong, and I wouldn't allow it to go unnoticed or dismissed as normal or excusable. I don't know a Republican colleague of mine in this body who would let that type of comment just slide as if it were just okay.  So that is why I will hold hands with my wife and march with the women on January 21 in D.And that is why I am calling on all of my progressive allies to come and march with the women as well. If you care about a living wage, come and join the women. If you care about the environment, come and join the march. We know as a society that when women win, we all win. So I plan to be there.  It is deeply personal and deeply patriotic to march, to make my opinions known by walking with my allies arm in arm. I want to be able to look at my two beautiful Latina daughters and my beautiful half-Puerto Rican, half-Mexican, but 100 percent American grandson, Luis Andres, in the eye with a clear conscience.  When the new President denigrates Latinos or Mexicans or immigrants as drug dealers and criminals, I want to be able to say that I did not condone or allow that type of speech to go mainstream. That was not normalized on my watch.  Because the future President said that the American-born children of immigrants were not capable of being American judges, I cannot sit there as if this inauguration is okay and I forgave him.

11662,topic-id,1063,"Mr.Speaker, my commitment to the State of Israel is steadfast, but my first loyalty is to peace--peace that is protected by genuine self-determination.  I know in my heart that the only path to peace is to have two separate, sovereign states that peacefully coexist. The two-state solution is at the heart of American foreign policy, and every President and every Congress since I got here in 1993 put the two-state solution at the heart of what America wants for her friend  As I said on the House floor on December 6, if we are ever going to achieve the permanent peace that allows Israel to exist without fear and Palestine to exist without occupation, we must continue to fight for the two-state solution. But under the current strongman government in Israel, all pretenses and illusions are being stripped away. From settlements, to water, to restricting the Muslim call to prayer in Jerusalem, it seems that anything goes.  Today, as America embarks on its own experiment with strongman politics, this Congress is falling in line. This Congress that allowed our Chamber to be used for an Israeli campaign rally and TV commercials is bending to pressure from abroad and pressure here at home.  Mr.Speaker, I do not doubt the commitment to peace of the American people, so I urge my colleagues to vote with their hearts and minds and defeat this House resolution.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record my remarks on the floor of December 6 in support of a two-state solution.    Two State Solution Is Still The Path To Peace In The Middle East            [Luis Gutierrez Floor Remarks, 6, 2016]       Mr.Speaker, I am very concerned about what is going on in      Israel and I think it has implications both for U.foreign      policy and for domestic policy and for our great ally,            As the right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu      consolidates power and becomes in many ways the one-party      rulers of Israel, a number of things are changing that should      be of concern to all       Specifically, the increasing dominance of the Likud Party      as the one-party in Israel jeopardizes the two state solution      that I and many others in the United States and Israel feel      is the only way to achieve long-term peace in the Middle            There is a retrenchment of hard line policies--aimed at      solidifying alliances with smaller religious and hardline      parties that keeps Likud in power--that will make it harder      for Israelis and their allies in America--and anyone who      seeks a lasting peace--to maintain progress towards a two      state solution.       Right now, the Knesset is considering legislation to      legalize all Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory on      the West Bank, even those constructed on private Palestinian      land.       Boom, 400,000 people in settlements across the West Bank,      it's all legal because they say it is legal. But it's not.       And Israel is destroying Palestinian homes at a pace faster      than we have seen before.       It is provocative, sweeping, and designed to make it harder      to ever reach an agreement with the       The plan to restrict the Muslim call to prayer in Jerusalem      has been revived, again to placate hardline religious      constituents, by Prime Minister       There is no clearer statement to people of the Islamic      faith that they do not matter, they do not belong, and they      will not be tolerated than to restrict the Muslim call to      prayer in Jerusalem, a city that has heard the Muslim call to      prayer for thousands of years.       I think what is going on in Israel with Prime Minister      Netanyahu presents a cautionary tale about the consequences      of following a political strongman. The strongman has to keep      proving that he is a strongman over and over.       Like other strongmen who ride fear into leadership--when      you base your political career on injecting fear and      resentment into political affairs--when you use the backdrop      of terrorism and the understandable fear of the Israeli      people as a political tool for years and decades--this is the      kind of policy that results.       There is an appetite for constant escalation of what you      are doing to stand up to the enemy you have constructed--an      enemy based on, but not the same as the enemies that fight      against the state of Israel and tolerance and peace in real      life.       Strongmen construct a foil--in this case based on the      Palestinians, but sometimes exaggerated beyond recognition--     and they need to feed the thirst for more and more action to      attack the caricature that has been constructed.       But strongman politics in Israel have the impact of making      a long-lasting solution that brings peace to the Middle East      harder to achieve.       The fundamental rights of Palestinians to have their own      state, a state alongside the Israeli state where they have      the basic rights and dignity to govern themselves and raise      their families in peace--that is what many Israelis, many      Palestinians, and many around the world have been fighting      for.       If we are ever going to achieve the permanent peace that      allows Israel to exist without fear and Palestine to exist      without occupation, we must continue to fight for the two      state solution.       When I was just a freshman, almost 25 years ago, we      celebrated the accomplishments of Rabin and Arafat and      President Clinton to build towards a peace that recognizes      the rights and dignity of Israelis and the rights and      dignities of the Palestinian people.       For decades, the United States--under different leaders in      different parties from Carter to Reagan to Bush and Obama--     have recognized that peace will only come with mutual respect      and tolerance.       That is what we have based our foreign policy on and should      continue to base our foreign policy on.       Having talked with average people and with leaders on both      sides of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict--I am convinced      that it is the only path to peace.       America has been a catalyst--a constructive influence from      outside--a nation based on religious freedom and democracy      that has served as a model for both Palestinians and      Israelis--and we have worked towards helping parties continue      to move in the direction of two separate but mutually      respectful countries, two nations that are not at war with      each other or subservient to one another.       I fear, Mr.Speaker, that Israel herself is moving away      from the two state solution as a goal and that we as her      closest ally must remind her--and ourselves--of what is at      stake if we lose sight of this important goal.

11714,topic-id,893,"Mr.Speaker, I have spoken here before about the surge in demand for citizenship we are seeing in the Fourth Congressional District of Thousands who are eligible are taking the step to become citizens because they feel threatened by a President and administration that does not seem to think of immigrants, refugees, Muslims, or Latinos as human beings. So the one way to protect oneself and to protect one's family is to apply for citizenship if you are eligible.  Some days they are lined up out the door of my office. So full are our daily appointments, we had to add a Saturday citizenship workshop to accommodate all of the people who wanted to apply, and we will be adding additional workshops. At one workshop a couple of weeks ago, staff and volunteers worked with families to fill out the paperwork, assemble all of the evidence and fees for the application. In one day we helped 260 people fill out their citizenship applications.  I discovered something very important. People keep coming back to me and asking: What can I do to fight back? What can I do to help immigrant communities who are under siege by President Trump, ``President'' Bannon, and all the rest of the people who want to drive immigrants out of the country?  So I told them they could help others apply for citizenship, and they came in droves--hipsters with funky facial hair, women with pink knit hats they made for the Women's March, environmental and LGBTQ activists, union members, and just plain old folks from my district who are not themselves immigrants but who feel the solidarity with immigrants in their community.  You know what? This new group, after getting a little training, sat for a few hours with immigrant families, going over their histories, their stories, their reasons for being here, and their reasons for applying for U.citizenship. And they were pretty good at filling out government forms. They formed a bond. They got to know each other. They were helping each other accomplish a mutual goal, which is standing up to xenophobia and the Trump-Bannon era.  The citizens and the applicants to become citizens are both worried about Republicans taking away their health care and eliminating the environmental laws that have made the water we drink and the air we breathe so much safer. They worry about where women and girls will get healthcare services in cities like Chicago if Trump and his buddies defund Planned Parenthood, or what happens after the courts are stacked with judges who are so out of step with the modern era on gender and civil rights, consumer protections, women's health, and any of the other issues people care about.  Anyone who walked out of that citizenship workshop where 260 new citizenship applications were completed felt a sense of community and interconnectedness with one another. Now, it is sad to report that thousands of my constituents can't spend a Saturday morning applying for citizenship. Many of them are at legal clinics or law offices filling out papers to address the very fear that they will lose their homes, their savings, and their families if Trump's deportation force knocks on their door.  They are filling out, by the thousands, power of attorney documents and child custody papers in case they are grabbed off the street, in their homes, or, worse yet, in their places of worship. It is heartbreaking. Moms and dads are making decisions about who their kids will go to live with if they get picked up and deported. Which relative, neighbor, or older sibling will be in charge if mom and dad are taken away?  Believe me, these kids know what is going on. The 5 million U.citizens who have parents at risk of deportation know that their government is a threat to their safety and their security. Their own government could come to the door and upend their lives at any moment, and their parents are preparing for the worst.  It is the humanity, the love, their striving for a better life that comes through in these parents who want[[Page H2292]]what is best for their children and what was unavailable to them in some far-off country. These are very real people who have no legal avenues that allow them to live and work here legally, who have no options other than to hide or leave, who have been cut off from fully integrating into our society as citizens because Congress has been fighting over immigration reform. These are the people that Mr.Bannon, Mr.Sessions, and Mr.King have been working together for years to get out of what they call their country so that our erratic new President can point to deportations and say that he is making America great again.  What is clear from the citizenship surge and all those who want to help is that America is not only great, not only kind, not only dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, but there are Americans and those who want to be Americans willing to stand up and resist when leaders take us in the wrong direction.  Mr.Speaker, you will see millions of Americans and aspiring Americans marching together in American cities across our great Nation on May 1, and when you do, you will see this bond and this shared humanity this coming May 1.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2291-4.txt,478,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,22.0,February

11437,topic-id,463,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to bring certainty to farmers, agricultural cooperatives,and grain elevators across Missouri and the country that are having problems complying with burdensome reporting requirements atthe Dodd-Frank never intended to regulate end users like independent grain elevators who work on behalf of Missourifarmers to help manage their price risk. My amendment works to correct this oversight and provide a stable environment for allplayers in the industry.  My amendment is simple. It would require the Commission to address three outstanding concerns to the Ownership and ControlReports rule, better known as the OCR rule, before the Commission can begin enforcement, which, by the way, the CFTC is notenforcing presently. This industry currently is operating under a no-action relief letter, meaning the OCR rule is not beingenforced due to the inability of the industry to meet the stringent requirements of the CFTC regulations. That could change, andthe problem needs to be addressed.  Specifically, my amendment does three things. First, it increases the threshold from 50 to 300 contracts per day percommodity for those market participants that need to comply with this rule. This will exempt low-volume entities like grainelevators and small agricultural cooperatives from the reporting requirements for large trading firms and major players in thesemarkets. Even with the new threshold established by my amendment, the CFTC will still gather ownership and control informationon the major players and midsized traders.  Second, my amendment removes a small but very burdensome portion of the long list of reporting requirements under the finalOCR rule. My amendment removes the natural person controller requirements which require farmer cooperatives and grain elevatorsto report specifically personally identifiable information on individual employees. The CFTC has never required such granularinformation for many of my constituent businesses, and such requirements are making Futures Commission Merchants much lesswilling to work with small and medium-sized entities in the countryside. Even with the small changes made by my amendment, theCFTC will still be properly equipped to track ownership and account control data across the market.  Finally, this amendment will require the CFTC to ensure that current regulations do not conflict with current foreignprivacy laws. Having a large, open, liquid market is important to managing risk, and operating on an international basis is avaluable aspect of a commodity market. The CFTC should be responsible for dealing with other governments on privacy concerns. Itis inappropriate to push that burden onto the firms and customers that it regulates.  This amendment is supported by a wide range of industry and farmers groups, and I encourage my colleagues to support myamendment to provide relief from the regulatory burdens of this rule on small cooperatives, grain elevators, and farmers who aremerely hedging their legitimate market risk and serving their customers' interests.

11482,topic-id,536,"Mr.Speaker, today is a sad day for this institution.  Why are we here? Well, after 13 hours at the Rules Committee on Wednesday,[[Page H2380]]did we report to the floor the Republicans' replacement to the Affordable Care Act?  And why not? Because the legislation was not extreme enough. It didn't hurt enough people. It didn't make enough people uninsured. It didn't give a large enough tax break to the wealthiest among us.  That 13-hour exercise yielded nothing except to reveal the callous depths of the Republican Party's attempt to deprive health care from 24 million people.  So after my friends on the other side of the aisle added yet another manager's amendment, bringing the total to five, and after stripping away essential health benefits, we are here this morning to push this extreme, dangerous, and callous bill under martial law.  But why are we really here? Is this bill actually about improving health care in this country? By my estimation, and by the analysis of virtually every healthcare group--Mr.McGovern has introduced some of them: hospitals, medical organizations, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--the answer is a flat-out, resounding no.  Premiums are going to rise. Millions upon millions of people will lose health coverage. Essential benefits will be stripped away, and 400 of the wealthiest Americans will get a substantial tax cut, while Medicaid is being cut by $880 billion.  Mr.Speaker, during that 13-hour marathon meeting that yielded nothing but a rule allowing Republicans to continue to ram this measure through Congress, I quoted from Scripture, from the King James Bible, Matthew 25:45. It says:       Then shall He answer them, saying, Verily, I say unto you,      inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you      did it not to me.  My friends on the other side of the aisle often cite Scripture in their legislative motivations. I ask them now: How does cutting the benefits from the least among us, while showering more wealth upon the wealthiest among us, square with these teachings?  In addition, Mr.Speaker, I noted to them that we hear from them all the time about liberty. So I noted that, in the Preamble to the Constitution, the document that guides our great Nation and that we all swear an oath to uphold, that we are entrusted to also, and I quote from the Preamble, ``promote the general welfare.'' I also note for you that this charge is placed before the first mention of the word ``liberty.''  Does stripping away of essential health benefits, which include maternity and newborn care, pediatric services, and emergency services, promote the general welfare?  Does cutting $880 billion from Medicaid promote the general welfare?  Does ensuring that, by 2026, 56 million people under the age of 64 will be left without coverage promote general welfare?  Finally, Mr.Speaker, in the debate at committee on this shameful bill, I answered the Republican charge that this bill was about freedom when I quoted a verse from Janis Joplin's ``Me and Bobby McGee.''

11765,topic-id,1282,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding to me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  I rise to debate the rule for consideration, which bundles together two completely unrelated pieces of legislation. One is a joint resolution disapproving of a Department of Labor rule that relates to the drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants. The other, as the gentleman just described, is the Red River Gradient Boundary Survey  There are many more important issues, in my opinion, that face this country at the moment, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out why my colleagues across the aisle think that ceding Bureau of Land Management survey authority over federally owned land to the States and impugning the integrity of those who rightfully seek unemployment insurance are on the same list of important matters this body should be addressing.  First, I would note the odd events that brought us here today as we operate, once again, under a closed rule. I just heard the debate on the previous rule, and I was illuminated by the gentleman from Alabama, on the other side, who indicated that the rule wasn't closed because we had a debate in the Rules Committee yesterday for 1 hour. A closed rule is a closed rule. It means that other Members of this body do not have an opportunity to have their amendments heard and/or made in order. We are now entering our 13th of these closed rules in a body that claimed that it was going to have open rules and regular order.  On February 3, Congressman McClintock wrote to Chairman Sessions, asking that the Red River Gradient Boundary Survey Act be heard under a structured rule, which still isn't an open rule. An amendment deadline was set, and two germane amendments with no budgetary issues were submitted. Nevertheless, my Republican colleagues shut down the process and reported a closed rule. As of today, two-thirds of all of the rules issued this session by the Rules Committee have been closed rules. We should not be conducting the people's business this way.  I call on my Republican colleagues to put their unfounded fear aside and let this body operate under regular order, under open rules, or, at the very least, under structured rules.[[Page H1146]]  I am dismayed to see, even when the Republican chairman of a subcommittee asks the Republican chairman of the Rules Committee for a structured rule, that the Republican leadership sees fit to ignore that request and continue this closed process--stifling ideas and debate before they can even get started.  It is this kind of shifting decisionmaking that sows distrust and disappointment in the American people when they survey how business is conducted in their However, it is not just this kind of duplicitous behavior that undermines this institution, but, as I mentioned moments ago, a complete lack of an ability to get our priorities straight.  We still have plenty of folks who are looking for jobs. We have plenty of people who are terrified that they will soon lose the health care that keeps them and their children living healthy and productive lives. We have plenty of people who are understandably concerned that our immigration policy has taken a deep dive into the shallow end. But we don't come here to address these important issues. Instead, my Republican colleagues bring to the floor, week after week, legislation to undermine well-thought-out agency rules and make it increasingly difficult for our agencies to carry out their duties.  The fact that we need to come here today and discuss the efficacy of having the Bureau of Land Management manage our Nation's land is beyond me. For nearly 100 years, the Bureau of Land Management has conducted uncontested surveys, and now we are supposed to believe that, all of a sudden, the agency is not following the appropriate standard. If folks don't like the survey methods or think the wrong standard is being used, then one needs to go through the court system. One does not engage in the unprecedented measure of ceding to the States the Federal Government's legitimate authority over Federal land.  The second completely unrelated resolution, H.42, overturns a Department of Labor rule regarding the drug testing of Americans who apply for unemployment compensation. Under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, States were given the authority to conduct drug tests on unemployment insurance applicants under two circumstances: if the applicant were terminated from a previous job due to unlawful drug use or if the only available, suitable work were in an occupation that regularly conducts drug testing.  The rule in question clarifies that occupations that ``regularly conduct drug testing'' include occupations that are specifically identified in State or Federal law as requiring an employee to be tested. Put another way, if a State thinks a job warrants a drug test, all it needs to do is add the job to a list. The rule strikes a balance, preserving deference to States while providing commonsense clarity to the law. This is how things should be done--that is, the regulations that were in force until now, at least.  Unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, common sense is not put to much use around here these days. Republicans want to repeal the rule because, one would have to assume, it does not go far enough in embarrassing those people who are simply trying to obtain unemployment insurance during a difficult time. Let us be crystal clear in that the only purpose this repeal can serve is to embarrass folks, because there is no evidence linking those who seek unemployment insurance to increased rates of drug abuse. Be that as it may, Republicans still insist on expanding expensive and offensive drug screenings.  Today, once again, we see the Republicans engaging in the Trumpian exercise of creating alternative facts. In today's example, we have a resolution that is based on the blanket assumption that unemployed Americans use drugs. It further implies that Americans who apply for unemployment benefits are to blame for being unemployed. This implication is as unfounded as it is offensive to those hardworking Americans who find themselves unemployed due to no fault of their own.  And what do these hardworking Americans get for their troubles--a Congress dedicated to ensuring that new and well-paid jobs are there for them tomorrow?  Not at all. Instead, they get a Republican-led Congress that is bent on subjecting them to unconstitutional, offensive, and expensive drug tests.  Like it or not, facts still matter. Here is one: a conservative estimate by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration puts the cost of drug testing at $25 to $75 per test. Because Federal law prohibits charging applicants for these tests, States would have to absorb the cost of testing thousands of unemployed workers. In the State of Texas, for instance, that would translate to, approximately, $30 million for a single year of testing. A while back, we spent a lot of time around here talking about unfunded mandates, and somehow or another, this one, I guess, doesn't fit in that category.  Mr.Speaker, arbitrarily testing Americans who apply for unemployment compensation runs contrary to our Constitution and is a solution in search of a problem. Being unemployed is not a sufficient reason to be subjected to a government-operated drug test. Proposals like this blame unemployed Americans for being unemployed. It is illegal and it is a huge waste of money. We have got some real problems that we need to address in this At some point, this Congress will need to get to work.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1145.txt,511,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,14.0,January
11767,topic-id,311,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  While we are discussing these matters that my colleagues want to discuss that I don't think are paramount or issues that are vital to America's security, there are a plethora of issues that we could be discussing, and rightly should be. Toward that end, one of the things that the minority is given as an opportunity is to offer a previous question to the matter that is on the floor at this time.  So I exercise that prerogative by asserting that the National Security Council was established in 1947 to encourage candid discussions between the Federal agencies charged with keeping America safe to ensure they would provide the President with the best policy advice possible. For this very reason, security experts on both sides of the aisle agree that partisan politics have no place in the Council's deliberations.  With this in mind, it is deeply troubling that President Donald John Trump would promote Steve Bannon, his chief political adviser, to a full seat on the Council's Principals Committee, while simultaneously relegating the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence to a lower status. At the very least, this sends the very dangerous signal that the Trump White House intends to let political calculations influence its decisionmaking on the life-and-death matters of national security.  Mr.Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Stephanie Murphy's bill to prohibit political advisers from regularly attending National Security Council meetings.

Although we are entering a period of one-party government, bipartisan support for Israel remains a strategic asset, and those who support Israel need to be careful not to jeopardize that.

11735,topic-id,935,"Mr.President, I know that President Obama is gone now, but his War on Fossil Fuels is alive and well. However, they are not winning that.  Back in Oklahoma, they ask me the question sometimes: If all of the liberals are concerned and if they are all opposed to fossil fuels--and to nuclear, I might add; coal, oil, gas, and nuclear--if coal, oil, gas, and nuclear are responsible for 89 percent of the power it takes to run this country, how do you run the country without those? Those are the kinds of questions we get.  I appreciate and--I know it is a very popular statement that was made by my friend from Ohio; unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the issues we are looking at right now.  Back during the time Dodd-Frank was considered, it was dealing with banks and financial institutions. It had nothing to do with energy. Yet section 1504 was put in there. Part of section 1504 required that information be provided during the course of a competitive situation for some kind of a project.  I will give you an example. We have a private sector in our oil and gas. For China, that is a government project. If we are competing with them--let's say for some cause that is in Tanzania or someplace--they said, so that there is a safeguard and there can't be corruption, so that if we should win--I say ``we,'' but I am talking about the private sector in the United States of America--then they have to report the information to the SEC, which in turn makes it published. Their intent was not to have to break down everything that was in that offer. It is the bottom line.  What is the total cost that goes to these countries? What are the total costs? That is all they care about because if that money went to Tanzania--and there are some corrupt officials there and they might steal some of the money, but to keep that from happening, we want to report what the cost was in the winning party. You don't have to have all that information.  In fact, in 2013, the court struck this down because they said that was not the intent. The intent was to have the total figure, so they said, even suggested--and our intent at that time was to vacate that, as the court did vacate that rule and send it back and have the SEC redo it in such a way that it would affect only the amount of money that would go that might cause some corruption at some time. That is what it was all about. Unfortunately, they put together another one that was very similar and required a lot of information that was not necessary.  I would like to correct something on the CRA that the Senator from Ohio said. The CRA is there because when an unelected bureaucrat comes out with some kind of an unreasonable rule that is very costly to the people of this country and it is done by someone who is not an elected official, the elected official says: Look at this. Wait a minute. This is something that people are complaining about when I go home.  They love that because they can say: This wasn't me. This wasn't me. This was an unelected bureaucrat that put these rules in.  What a CRA does is make us in the House and in the Senate more accountable because we have to then stand up and vote on something, saying that we endorse this rule or we don't endorse this rule. That is what it is all about.  Anyway, we have an opportunity here to go ahead, and I am certainly[[Page S638]]hoping that we will do this and change this rule so that it would make as a requirement nothing but the amount of money that is paid by the winning party in a situation where they are competing with each other.  If that happens, then we will know how much money that was, and we will be able to go to the party and find out if they are stealing some of this money. Why is it necessary to have all of the components of competition when you have the private sector in the United States of America competing with countries like China where it is a government-owned institution?  That is all this is about. All we want to do is to be able say we want to report so that the public knows how much the total bid or, in this case, the total amount was, not all the components that went into the calculation of that.

I am rising to return to the topic of the effort of the CRA to roll back transparency in the oil and gas industry, and I will speak briefly. I know my colleague from Arizona is here and wants to speak too.[[Page S643]]  The issue has been described. It is an SEC rule requiring energy companies to disclose the payments they make to foreign governments for natural resources. The reason is that many countries with abundant natural resources are run by dictators, and there has been a long history of payments by oil companies--American and others--to those dictators that don't get to the people and actually further the corruption of the country.  Just one example: An IMF report stated that in just 1 year, 1998, the Government of Equatorial Guinea received $130 million in oil revenue, and $96 million of that went directly into the personal bank account of the dictator, Teodoro Meanwhile, hunger in that country is rampant, and that is what led to this.  I am on the Foreign Relations In preparation for our hearing on the nomination of Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, for Secretary of State, I read a wonderful report that was done by Senator Lugar when he was the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations  October 2008: Report to members of the Foreign Relations Committee from the ranking member. The title was ``The Petroleum And Poverty Paradox: Assessing U.And International Community Efforts to Fight The Resource Curse.'' I read this. I read the book ``Private Empire,'' a recent history of ExxonMobil written by journalist Steve Coll, to prepare for my examination of Rex Tillerson for Secretary of  This particular report was the basis for the 2010 law that was described by Senator Cardin, and it was sponsored in a bipartisan way. It didn't prohibit any company from doing anything. It only required companies that pay foreign governments to disclose those payments.  I voted yesterday against Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State because I believe a public official's duty--especially Secretary of State--has to be to the country. I was worried, based on three areas of his testimony, that Rex Tillerson could not set aside his loyalty to  He refused to answer questions that I asked him about ExxonMobil's knowledge of climate science, yet their efforts to convince the public that the science was not settled. He told me he wouldn't answer my questions.  He did not demonstrate to the committee's satisfaction, in my view, that he could be independent in For example, he said that ExxonMobil had not lobbied against sanctions against Russia, when we actually have the lobbying forms to suggest they had.  In both of those areas, I found his responses wanting, and I voted against him.  I will be honest. I asked him about the resource curse question, and today I kind of feel like I got snookered.  I said: There is a lot of concern about these countries that let resource wealth go to dictators and further corruption. What are you going to do about it, as the Secretary of State, working on development, for example, of some of these poor nations? And he talked about high-minded values and virtues of the things the United States could do that would battle corruption and increase transparency.  He didn't tell me that he had been personally involved in an effort to defeat the legislation that passed Congress in 2010. Now there is press out suggesting that is the case, and he didn't tell me that apparently there was an effort underway to undermine the transparency statute that was so important.  I have to put it on the record. Within 1 day--within 1 day of the Senate approving Mr.Tillerson for Secretary of State, the Trump administration has relaxed sanctions on That happened today. And now, apparently, we are going to vote to eliminate a law that requires transparency among companies like  I kind of feel like I got snookered at the hearing. What public interest is at stake in rolling this back? I don't think there is any.  Some say: Well, look, it is about leveling the playing field. The United States shouldn't be at a competitive disadvantage, but U.companies are at a disadvantage. Companies listed on the U.stock exchange--wherever they are from--are required to do this transparency, these disclosures, and many are already doing it. Because we have led, the European Union and Canada have said this is a great idea, and they are doing it too.  It would be a horrible thing if the United States pulled away from its leadership.  In conclusion, I am concerned that in the opening 2 weeks of the Trump administration--despite a lot of promises about what they would do in the economy--what has the administration done about the economy?  On day one, they entered an Executive order retracting an FHA mortgage reduction, thereby requiring homeowners with FHA loans to have to pay more for their monthly mortgages. They have done a Federal hiring ban that falls disproportionately on veterans because the Federal workforce is a veteran-heavy workforce. They have done the immigration rules that we have discussed which not only affect immigrants but have a dramatic negative effect on America's technology industry.  And then in the first two uses of the CRA procedure since the 1990s, they have eliminated a rule to allow more pollution of streams in poor areas where coal is produced, and now this--allowing companies to escape transparency and make the very kinds of payments that lead to corruption in foreign governments, corruption so severe that a former Republican Member of this body was compelled to write a superb report in 2008 and have bipartisan legislation passed.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the CRA repeal of this rule.  ",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgS634-5.txt,2176,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 428, RED RIVER GRADIENT BOUNDARY",2017.0,2.0,January

The UN resolution reaffirms that Israel's settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are a ``major obstacle'' to peace, which has been long-standing US policy. 11 states that the Obama Administration took an unprecedented step by abstaining from the vote when in fact the decision is not unique.

11737,topic-id,1390,"Mr.President, Republicans in both Chambers have introduced a resolution to permit oil, gas, and mining companies to continue making secret payments--involving billions of dollars--to corrupt foreign governments in exchange for access to their countries' natural resources.  This resolution would overturn legislation on which I worked closely with former Republican Senator Richard Lugar and Senator Cardin and was included as section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to provide greater transparency when such payments are made and help better inform investors and combat massive corruption in the process.  One would think that everyone here would support a commonsense rule that will protect investors and make it a lot harder to get away with the theft of billions of dollars in public funds in some of the poorest countries of the world. But apparently, that is not a concern, at least not to the sponsors of this resolution or those who intend to support its passage.  Some Republicans and their friends in the oil and gas industry say this rule creates unacceptable burdens. That is utterly without merit, as I will explain in a moment.  But even assuming there were a grain of truth to that, rather than proposing to amend the underlying legislation, which would require bipartisan support, this resolution is being advanced under the Congressional Review Act, to enable a simple majority vote to completely dismantle the rule with minimum debate.  Keep in mind that the rule is simply the product of the U.Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, implementing bipartisan congressional intent and would not take effect until the end of 2018. Despite what some have claimed, the SEC has not twisted the statute in any way when they developed this rule. But if this rule is overturned, the SEC will be prevented from issuing any substantially similar rule, potentially in our lifetimes.  In other words, what we are doing here is, for all practical purposes, the death knell for global efforts--involving most of our closest allies--to combat massive corruption resulting from the extraction of natural resources and help investors assess risk in the often murky and unstable oil, gas, and mining sectors. This is an issue on which the United States, until now, has been a global leader.  I mention this because the sponsors of this resolution have said that they support the goals of this rule, and all they want to do after overturning it is make some minor adjustments to it. That is the epitome of disingenuous. The rule does not take effect until the end of 2018. If that was what they really wanted to do, they would propose an amendment, and we could discuss it. Their real purpose, even if they are reluctant to say so, is to prevent disclosure.  This rule has two primary purposes. First, it is to protect investors. Investors whose combined net worth exceeds $10 trillion, support this rule and its equivalency with the rules adopted by some 30 other governments. And second, to protect the public.  The practical effect of overturning this rule is that U.and foreign companies will be able to continue to make secret payments to corrupt foreign autocrats like Vladimir Putin and kleptocracies in Africa like the governments of Angola and Equatorial By doing so, these companies will be aiding and abetting those kleptocrats when they pocket the proceeds for their personal use. We have seen this for years. The people of those countries barely survive on $1 or $2 per day, while their leaders drive Mercedes, fly private jets to vacation homes on the French Riviera or in Santa Monica, and pay off the armed forces to keep themselves in power.  And where does the money come from that pays for that grotesque flaunting of wealth? From the royalties paid by U.and other foreign companies.  Do we really want to be complicit in that kind of thievery and immorality by shielding it from public scrutiny? Do we really think that the American people want to be tarred with it indirectly through the shady activities of American companies? Do we really want to hide important information from investors who are trying to assess risk in the companies they invest in? Of course not.  Anyone who reads this rule and pays the slightest attention to the estimated $1 trillion lost to crime, corruption, and tax evasion in these countries and the millions of deaths attributed to corrupt practices where these extractive companies operate will recognize the fallacy of the baseless attacks by those who oppose it.  The sponsors of this resolution claim that this rule puts American businesses at a competitive disadvantage. What are they talking about? The rule applies to both U.and foreign companies and complements existing laws elsewhere in the world. In fact, Chinese state-owned companies, like PetroChina and Sinopect, are covered by the U.law. Great Britain, the EU, Canada, and Norway are just four examples of governments that have adopted similar rules, with Russian state-owned companies like Rosneft and Gazprom covered in the U. I challenge the sponsors of this legislation to provide any objective facts to support the argument that U.companies are disadvantaged by this rule. That is a pernicious myth.  The sponsors have also repeated the self-serving claims of the petroleum industry that complying with this rule would unacceptably increase their cost of doing business. While that has become the predictable complaint of the business community whenever such a rule is promulgated, in this instance, they base it on an outdated and discredited analysis. The irony is that, even if one were to agree with their most farfetched, worst-case scenario, it pales compared to their immense profits.  If we overturn our rule, what prevents others from doing the same? And then we are right back where we started. Once again, we will have paved the way for secret payments and billions of dollars stolen from the public treasuries and squirreled away in Swiss bank accounts by the Robert Mugabes of the world.  There is another aspect to this that no one has talked about, and that is the connection between corruption and terrorism, particularly in Terrorist groups flourish where government corruption contributes to incompetent, corrupt military forces. Terrorists benefit when revenues from these[[Page S639]]activities are kept in the dark, enabling them to radicalize and recruit an impoverished and resentful population. By overturning this rule, Senators should know that violent extremists, terrorists, and other criminal enterprises will be among the beneficiaries.  Corruption is among the most corrosive forces that breed instability and violence, and then countries like ours end up trying to feed and shelter the innocent people who bear the brunt of it.  It not only wreaks havoc on the people of those countries; it hurts American companies trying to do business there, and it hurts Americans who invest in these risky companies. If the norm is nondisclosure, then bribery becomes an unavoidable and accepted way of doing business.  That is what companies from countries like Russia and China that compete with American companies would prefer because corruption is what they are best at. But this rule requires those foreign companies and others to similarly disclose their profits. Are the sponsors of this resolution even aware of this? This rule will enhance U.competitiveness. This rule protects investors and the public.  When it was first passed, section 1504 put the United States at the forefront of transparency and government accountability efforts. And as I have already said, that leadership paid off. Other countries have followed our example. This resolution will jettison a decade of work here and abroad. There is no excuse for it. There is no need for it. If there are legitimate concerns about section 1504, then let's talk about ways to amend it and improve it.  But let's not, by overturning this rule, tell the world that we don't believe in transparency and good governance, that we will turn our backs on the theft and misuse of payments made by U.companies, that we do not care about the people of those countries who suffer the consequences, and that we do not care about American investors who deserve this critical information so they can have confidence in the companies they invest their hard-earned money in.

11691,topic-id,343,"Mr.Speaker, any measure that seeks to promote a peaceful resolution to tensions between Israelis and Palestinians--whether coming from the United Nations or from this Chamber--should provide a balanced picture of the facts on the ground and the challenges confronting both sides. The recent UN Security Resolution on Israeli settlements failed that test by blaming Israel almost solely for impeding a two-states solution for peace and by using prejudicial language that places an unfair burden on Israel in depicting the basis for future negotiations. Calling any settlement activity by Israel since 1967 a major obstacle to peace, as the UN resolution does, ignores the reality that geographical adjustments will have to be made as part of any two-states solution reached by parties through direct negotiations.  However, the resolution before us today is also not balanced in that it too ignores conditions on the ground. Expressing the sense of Congress to repeal the UN Resolution does not focus on the increasingly fragile state of the two-states solution, and on conditions that make its potential achievement increasingly difficult to obtain. Prime Minister Netanyahu has called his government the most pro-settlement in history. President-elect Trump further diminishes chances for the two-states solution by choosing envoys who undercut the prospects for peace by expressing support for major settlement expansions, and whose opposition to a two-states solution reinforces opposition within the Israeli government. These positions threaten to continue to move momentum dangerously away from the possibility of a two-states solution.

This amendment works to provide much-needed reliefand certainty for American companies by clarifying how the internal risk reducing transactions amongst the businesses' ownaffiliates are regulated. Many businesses of all types and sizes in our country use derivatives to manage the risks they facewithin their daily operations. Interaffiliate swaps are a commonly used and effective internal risk management tool thesebusinesses rely upon.  Unfortunately, derivatives reforms implemented under Dodd-Frank fail to distinguish the difference between interaffiliatetransactions and transactions executed between unaffiliated third parties. Such internal transactions ensure firms to centralizetheir risk management activities between affiliate counterparties and do not create additional counterparty exposure outside ofa corporate group. This amendment, therefore, clarifies that interaffiliate swaps are not subject to the same regulatoryrequirements as external, market-facing swaps between third parties.  In addition, this amendment is consistent with the CFTC's attempts to provide similar relief through rule exceptions and no-action letters.

When I think about going back into the nineties, it was Bill and Hillary Clinton that put forward a healthcare plan. My colleagues on the other side had the goal of stopping it. And they did. We had nothing.  For 6 of the 8 years that I was here--from 2000 until 2006--they controlled both the House, the Senate and the Presidency, and they did nothing in reference to health care. It took 2008 and Barack Obama to come up with the Affordable Care Act, which gave 20 million Americans health care that didn't have it. It made sure that those that had a preexisting condition could continue to make sure that there was no discrimination against women and girls, so as to make sure they had equal health care. It also made sure that you removed the caps so that Americans would not be caught, as they were beforehand, going bankrupt, disturbing families and separating families who did not know how to make it until tomorrow. It was the Affordable Care  Yet, here, history will record that our colleagues are prepared to vote on Thursday to take those 20 million Americans that did not have access to health care away from health care and back to the bad, old days.

11746,topic-id,3044,"Mr.President, I appreciate my colleague from Hawaii, both on the substance of the issue and on the Congressional Review Act and how it is an unsuitable tool in a situation like this because of how it bars the door for a simple way to replace or modify a regulation.  I am coming to the floor tonight to share my concerns about a basic challenge we have in the world. This basic challenge is that when you get a ruler of a country who is corrupt, they forge contractual relationships, particularly if they are rich in minerals or oil, and they pocket the money and they spread the corruption. It makes it virtually impossible for the interests of the people of that country to be represented by their government because whatever governing body they have keeps making decisions based on those corrupt payments.  Now, we are a nation that values government by the people--of, by, and for the people. That is the vision of our Nation, but that vision would not be fulfilled if the Members of this body were being paid by foreign companies to serve the interests of the foreign companies instead of the interests of the people. We can understand from our own perspective our own desire to have a government that serves our citizens and that other nations want to have a government that serves their citizens. That is what this particular bill and the regulation that flows from it were all about. It was section 504 of Dodd-Frank, the resource extraction rule, that was passed now 7 years ago.  It took quite a while to get the regulation into place. The first version came out in 2012, after a tremendous amount of consultation was struck down in court because it was challenged by one of the companies that did not want to have transparency in international payments. Then folks went to work again and produced a rule that went into effect this last year. Unfortunately, we are about to strike that down.  I was thinking about how one of the champions for this was Senator Dick Lugar of I was so impressed by his thoughtfulness when I came to the He had been here quite a while, and he worked to really understand issues, and he worked to solve problems. He didn't work to obstruct an administration because it was of a different party. He didn't work to sabotage the work of this body because one party or the other was in the majority. He worked to solve problems. He had really a deep understanding of the challenges in the world.  He could see this from his considerable experience. He was on foreign relations for a very long time, and he served as its chair. He knew from his own work in that committee, from his own studies, from his own travels, and his own conversations--overseas conversations with foreign governments and conversations with our State Department and our Defense Department--that we had a significant issue in which contracts with large companies are used to defeat government of, by, and for the people in nations around the world. He wanted to do something about it. He had partnerships, and Members of our own body who are still serving here today were deeply involved in this.[[Page S647]]  It was a tremendous provision, but the American Petroleum Institute wasn't happy about it because it has worked really well for oil companies to not disclose and to make deals with ruling dictators and ruling families or ruling governing groups, whether they be in a so-called elected form or unelected form.  Well, finally, last year the rule was completed in They crafted a rule that, for the most part, made various stakeholders happy and it won broad international support. Dozens of other countries--including Canada, Norway, and countries of the European Union--followed American leadership. They adopted similar laws. So our particular law made it clear that if a company was listed on our stock exchange--on any of our exchanges--and it made a significant payment--$100,000 or more--it had to disclose that payment. That wasn't just U.companies. It wouldn't just have been U.companies. It was any company listed on our exchange, no matter where it was based. Other companies followed suit. So companies based in other countries were affected. So, basically, it was a vision that in short order took over the entire world, with developed countries coming together and saying that we are going to stop this process that destroys governments for the people in so much of the world.  It isn't just kind of a theoretical question of some liberal vision of how governments work. We are talking about the difference between the decisions of dictators to stash billions of dollars overseas or build health care clinics. We are talking about the difference between dictators buying hundreds of the world's most expensive sports cars or developing an education system in their countries. We are talking about the fundamental quality of life for millions and millions of people around the world. This provision, this resource extraction rule, went in an enormous direction in terms of making the world a better place. Shouldn't that be what we are about?  This challenge of foreign contracts with money diverted into the pockets of the dictators and the ruling class--the money that should go to the development of the country--is particularly a problem in resource rich countries with weak institutions. They have weak courts. They have weak investigative branches to find corruption. They have courts that essentially exorcise the ability to try people for which there is evidence, who should be charged and should be convicted. So the same corruption that affects the decisions that are made protects those who make those decisions. This means that if you have someone who grows up in this country and says: We have hundreds of billions of dollars of resources and nothing to show for it; so let's change that system; let's change that system and enable the people of this country to benefit from schools and health care and transportation; let's develop our nation, they are stymied by this complex web of undisclosed corruption. So that is what this bill is all about, and that is what this rule stemming from the section of the bill is all about.  Let's take, for example, a poster child for this resource curse. In many countries, it is known as the oil curse. Oil is a particularly prominent case. But the Democratic Republic of the Congo has not just some oil but a lot of minerals. It is a significant producer of the world's cobalt, diamonds, tin, gold, and other minerals. This problem of a corrupt dictator goes way back to decades ago. His name was well known around the world: Mobutu Sese He ruled from 1965 to 1997, so 32 years, three decades. It is estimated that he diverted from the country $4 billion to $15 billion. That is a lot of roads being built in a poor country. That is a lot of food for people who are near starvation. That is a lot of public school education. That is a lot of health care clinics. So one very rich man was stashing money in Swiss bank accounts rather than that money going to the government to do fundamental responsibilities for the people. The country has an estimated $24 trillion in mineral deposits. When we think about that, the $4 billion to $15 billion doesn't sound like very much.  Often, the way it works is these corrupt payments enable companies to get contracts far below cost, which is not a good thing, obviously, for these impoverished nations, to be essentially giving away their money because they are being bribed to do so.  So that is extremely disturbing to me, this particular issue being done here late in the evening, with very few of my colleagues here--mostly colleagues who are trying to fight this rule. Those who are supporting the multilateral corporations, the multinational corporations that don't like to have disclosure, they are not here to talk about how this is damaging the lives of millions of people in the poorest countries around the world. Maybe we need to have a rule in the Senate that if you are going to damage the lives of millions of people, you have to actually be here to hear the debate.  This debate is limited to just 10 hours, 5 hours on either side. If one side gives back their time, it is just 5 hours. There are not a whole lot of conversations. Maybe we could limit the conversation to 20 minutes a person or 10 minutes a person so we get a lot of voices in.  Before we go about the process of destroying the lives of millions of people all around the world, maybe, instead of just listening to the lobbyists for a multinational bank in your office, you should be here on the floor to have a conversation about the damage you are contemplating doing. Maybe then we would have an actual debate here in the U.Senate--a place that used to be a place where people did come and listen to each other debate issues. Perhaps there are good arguments to the contrary that I haven't heard because my colleagues aren't here presenting them. And maybe out of that mutual exchange, we would find a path to do something other than using this crude and destructive tool to strike down this very important provision.  There are three groups who benefit from this disclosure rule. The first group who benefits is the investors in a company who want to invest in companies that have responsible practices. The disclosure gives them the ability to have that information.  The second group who benefits is consumers who want to buy products from companies that engage in responsible practices, and disclosure enables them to do that.  The third group, though, really is the most important group, and that is a group of citizens in the country who are being corrupted by these payments because when they hear that a company has a contract and has paid X amount of billion dollars for that contract, then the newspapers of that country and the citizens of that country can try to get additional information: Did you take the percentage of that that was supposed to go to the regional government and actually get it disbursed to the regional government? Did you take the percentage of that that was supposed to go to the local city or province and did it get there? They can start to see that there is this lump of money that is supposed to be serving the citizens, and they can ask questions about how it serves the citizens. What bank account did it go into--so they can follow the money and track the money. But they have no ability to do that if these payments are hidden. That is what this is about.  So it is about investors who want to do the right thing, consumers who want to use their marketing and purchasing power to do the right thing, but it is really about the citizens of that country not having their resources diverted when they desperately need the fundamental things, such as transportation and education and health care.  Well, Senator Lugar said recently that if we allow this rule to be repealed, it would be ``a real tragedy for democracy and human rights.''  I agreed with Senator Lugar when he said, ``It is hard to believe that this would be such a high priority right now.'' We have a lot of issues in the world that we are challenged by, including security issues. We have a lot of nominations to address and debate. Why is it such a high priority at this moment to tear down a provision that improves the quality of life for millions of people in some of the poorest countries in the world? Why is it so important at this moment to tear down a law that reduces corruption in governments around the world? Why is it so important right now to destroy this provision that helps create an opportunity for ``we the people,'' a government that we profess to believe in?[[Page S648]]  It is well known that the CEO of ExxonMobil traveled to Washington to personally lobby Senator Lugar on this section. He wanted this provision scrapped, and that individual is now our Secretary of That certainly disturbs me, that the day after he became Secretary of State, the provision he lobbied for as an oil executive is being accomplished here on the floor.  Because of his testimony in committee, there was some hope that he would stand up and fight for the fundamental visions of our country, the fundamental values and principles of our country, and if so, he would be sending out information right now saying: Stop what you are doing because I know how this works around the world and how it destroys ``we the people'' governments, and we shouldn't be doing it; that is, we should keep the provision we have right now.  Nigeria is another nation that has had a resource curse or oil curse. Last year, a deal was struck between ExxonMobil and the Nigerian Government--or it came under investigation last year by that country's anti-corruption and law enforcement agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes The investigation surrounds a 2009 agreement where an Exxon subsidiary and the Nigerian Government agreed to renew a 40-percent share in three new oil licenses. Exxon reached a deal to pay $600 million for those licenses, and it built a powerplant at a cost of $900 million, so it made a $1.5 billion investment. So a $1.5 billion investment--that sounds like a pretty high sum for a contract.  However, an outside group who was investigating corruption found that the Nigerian Government had valued those contracts at $2.15 billion--in other words, $1 billion more than what Exxon was paying. Furthermore, they found that wasn't just in theory because another bidder offered $3.75 billion, and that is more than twice what Exxon paid. But the Exxon deal was chosen.  Isn't there some sense that something is wrong when a government rejects a payment that is $2.25 billion more than the offer that was accepted? That is what happens with corrupt payments between powerful companies and dictators. That is what destroys government of, by, and for the people around the world.  It is estimated that over time--that is, since 1960, so after the last 57 years--$400 billion of Nigerian oil revenues have disappeared due to corruption--$400 billion disappeared. What would $400 billion do to improve the lives of Nigerians?  That is why transparency in these payments is so important. It affects impoverished people all over the world. We can have all of our aid programs, we can have our Food for Peace Program, we can have our Millennium Corporation, but this type of deal does so much more damage than all the good we do through our programs that we budget for and put money into.  If we enable, if we promote corruption around the world, we do enormous damage. That is why a bipartisan group of Senators, including Dick Lugar leading it, took this on.  How about Equatorial It is one of Sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil producers, and it, like many other oil countries, has the oil curse. President Obiang has been in power since he ousted his uncle in a military coup in 1979 and declared himself President for life. Let's just say what he is: He is a dictator. His government has been known to detain arbitrarily and torture critics, to disregard elections. It has been prosecuted for using oil profits for financial gain of the President's family. The result is, although this country is one of the wealthiest African nations per capita, the majority of the Nation's citizens survive on less than $2 a day. Let me clarify that. It is one of the richest African nations per capita, but a large percent of the citizens survive on less than $2 a day because President Obiang and his extended network--his extended corrupt network--are stealing the resources of the country, and they are doing it often through contracts with oil companies like Exxon, which happens to be a major partner in exploiting the resources of Equatorial  Less than half of Equatorial Guinea has access to clean drinking water, a fundamental need and a fundamental factor in health. Twenty percent--that is one out of every five children--die before reaching the age of 5. This is because of the corruption that is facilitated by undisclosed sums, reinforcing a dictator--a dictator whose family owns fleets of fancy sports cars, luxury yachts, private jets, massive properties in Europe, massive properties in Brazil, and properties right here in the United But one-fifth of the children die before age 5. That is why this is so important.  Let me conclude by saying that what we are doing here tonight in putting this forward with no real debate because my colleagues are not here--a few colleagues are here to give speeches like I am giving to say ``Stop, this is wrong,'' but our colleagues are not here to hear us. What is happening tonight is an enormous travesty. It is an enormous blight on the United States, which led the world in taking on this problem and now is abandoning not just that leadership but is abandoning the principle. The world is worse off for it.  I hope that my colleagues will somehow come to an inspiration or a revelation, that those who are not here listening to this will come to an understanding that something is wrong with this and will oppose this effort to repeal this very important provision. But I know that the heavy hand of corporate lobbying is behind the fact that this is on the floor tonight, and I am not optimistic. That saddens me a great deal.  Let us strive to have a process that honors the importance of the issues before us. This short debate, with virtually no one present, does not honor it and does enormous damage, and it is just wrong.

11693,topic-id,329,"Mr.Speaker, I remain committed to a two-state solution, where a Jewish state of Israel and a Palestinian state can co-exist in peace. The best path to ultimately achieving this peace is through direct, bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, not imposed solutions by international organizations. Instead of this Administration concluding its strong Israel record with the single largest pledge of military assistance in U.history, it chose to end on a perplexing note by choosing not to veto United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334.  The expansion of settlements in occupied territory has been long recognized on a bipartisan basis and in U.policy for decades as doing little to improve the confidence of Arabs that a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiated. United Nations action does not help advance the cause of peace, nor does it bring about direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians so they might resolve their complicated differences and find a much needed, lasting two-state solution, which I have supported my entire career.  Any action, whether coming from the United Nations or the Congress, must provide a complete picture of the facts on the ground and full appreciation for the challenges confronting all sides.

11642,topic-id,861,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the ranking member and my friend, the chairman of the committee.  We often agree on things in the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, but there are times when our disagreements are huge, and this is one of those times.  So, Mr.Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.1430. We have seen this bill in the last Congress, when it was called the Secret Science Reform It was a lousy bill then, and it is still a lousy bill today.  Let's start with the name of this bill, Mr.Speaker, the HONEST Act, but it really should be called the dishonest act. That is because this bill improperly describes what is going on at the EPA, which is looking to protect our environment from extreme weather events that we have in Colorado, throughout the country, and around the world.  The EPA is working to protect our clean air and our clean water, and has demonstrably improved our communities and the health of America since 1970.  I wish I could say these attacks today and tomorrow on the EPA and scientific research are isolated, but unfortunately they are not. Earlier today, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee held a hearing on climate science. I was astonished at what I heard from the majority Republican Party calling into question whether climate change is happening, and whether it is caused by humans. All this serves is to attack scientific research and jeopardize the progress we have made to combat climate change and protect our communities.  Just yesterday, President Trump issued an executive order to further roll back progress that we have made over the last 8 years. The executive order tries to dismantle the Clean Power Plan and many other important protections from the Obama administration which were worked on based on the best available science and through an open and deliberate process, gathering millions of comments along the way. The fact is, investing in clean energy and reducing emissions is good for our national security, good for our environment, and good for jobs.  I believe we can do both--improve our energy independence and create good-paying jobs--at the same time. Colorado has been a leader in reducing harmful emissions, improving energy efficiency, and investing in clean energy, and we have realized substantial economic benefits for Colorado through innovation, research and development, and the creation of good-paying jobs.  Mr.Speaker, we need to do better. This House and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee need to take their heads out of the sand and stop ignoring what is going on across the country and across the world.  I urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter dated March 8, 2017, from the American Geophysical                                   American Geophysical Union,                                                    March 8, 2017.     Lamar Smith,     Washington,     Eddie Bernice Johnson,     Washington,       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: On behalf      of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and its more than      60,000 members, I am writing to express concerns about the      Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017 (HONEST      Act) and the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.      We encourage you and your colleagues to take additional time      to evaluate the unintended consequences of these bills before      the bills move forward.       Although we appreciate the HONEST Act's protections for      confidential information, we remain concerned about several      provisions in the bill. For example, requirements in the bill      for the use of ``best available science,'' ``data,'' and      ``reproducible'' do not have uniform applications across all      disciplines.       With respect to reproducibility of research, some      scientific research involves longitudinal studies that are so      large and of great duration that they could not realistically      be reproduced. The same may be true for scientific data from      a one-time event (e.g., Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill)      where the data is gathered in real time. We're concerned that      in these situations the EPA could be constrained from using      important or relevant research in making decisions.       The legislation could also impose costs on recipients of      federal research grants where the research results are      expected to be ``relied on to support a covered action.'' The      bill is not clear on whether it is the EPA's or the research      institution's responsibility to cover the costs associated      with sharing and archiving this information.       We are also troubled by the implications of the EPA Science      Advisory Board Reform As an organization that represents      scientists from broad backgrounds and expertise, we      appreciate the attempt to ensure a diverse panel of      scientific knowledge and perspectives, and support the bill's      goal of increasing accountability and transparency for      scientific advisors. However, because the bill would exclude      some scientists with substantial expertise in their fields      from the Science Advisory Board (SAB), the SAB would suffer      from the exclusion of valuable insight. The purpose of the      SAB is to review the quality and robustness of scientific      data that informs EPA's regulatory process. It is imperative      that the SAB comprise the most expert, independent scientists      and technical advisors to best fulfill that mission.       AGU looks forward to working with you on these critical      issues in the future.

I urge Members to consider this whendeciding how to vote on the amendments that will be debated here on the floor.

On top of that, this bill caps the agency's yearly budget at $250 million for the next 5 years, and it does this when everysingle witness before the Agriculture Committee last year told us that the agency needs more resources to do its work. Well,maybe that is the whole point--that this bill will leave the agency to not doing much, and I think that would be a mistake. Wetried that once before, and we found ourselves in a real mess.  Since we last discussed reauthorization, the market situation has changed, and the CFTC has addressed many of our concernsthrough rulemaking. Yet, the Agriculture Committee wasn't given the chance to consider these issues before the bill was rushedto the floor here today. So we are moving forward, once again, without regular order.

The burdensome requirements in this legislation and the lack of appropriate funding are nothing more than a misguidedattempt by Republicans to make it more difficult for the Commission to function--to make it harder to protect consumers and makeit more difficult to rein in the abuses of Wall  I strongly object to the authorization level in this legislation.

Now, Republicans say they don't like regulation, and it seems they especially don't like any regulation on Wall Havethey forgotten the recent financial crisis that nearly destroyed our economy? Have they forgotten who was primarily responsiblefor that crisis? Apparently, they have. Now, I am not for endless and unnecessary regulation. Nobody is. But I do think it isappropriate for us to create commonsense rules that protect our markets and protect our constituents' hard-earned dollars.  I find it troubling the Republican leaders in this House don't want to provide necessary resources to the Commission topatrol Wall Without cops on the beat, who will ensure Wall Street actors aren't gaming the system and putting theeconomy at risk for another meltdown. I ask my Republican friends: When will Main Street take priority over Wall Street?  I also take issue with the various provisions of this bill that will both slow the agency's work and create new avenues forcostly and lengthy legal battles.  By the way, implementing these provisions will cost the Commission an additional $45 million over the next 5 years and willrequire an additional 30 full-time employees. So in addition to underfunding an already overworked agency, we are creating asituation where even more resources will be needed to satisfy burdensome and unnecessary requirements. Now, that means fewerdollars for the Commission to carry out its core mission of combating abuse and fraud in our markets and ensuring end users,investors, and the public are protected.  Now, Mr.Chairman, our constituents didn't send us to Washington to ignore bad actors in our financial markets. Theycertainly didn't send us to Washington to create a regulatory environment that could put us on a path toward another downturn.So who are we here to represent, the Wall Street banks or our hardworking constituents who deserve elected Representatives whodo everything in their power to prevent another financial crisis?

11439,topic-id,313,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment contains several troubling drafting--some people call them--errors or, I guess,questions. It prevents the CFTC from enforcing noncompliance with the final rule that includes more forms than were targeted.  When we did our part of the Dodd-Frank bill, one of the things that I thought was really not controversial was that we weregoing to try to find out, once and for all, who owned all of these swaps; who was on what side of positions. This is what causedthe problem in the first place with the financial meltdown. When Lehman Brothers went down and we allowed them to go broke, itcreated this big panic, AIG didn't know if they could cover their swaps or not, and it was going to unravel the whole situationbecause these firms that were trading didn't know who held what and what was going on. That was the underlying problem. So whatwe were trying to do is get some understanding of where everybody was in this market. When we were doing the bill, we made itvery clear, and I put in the legislation, that end users were not covered. That shouldn't have been an issue.  The problem with this amendment is it looks like it is going to include more than just that. So, I guess, again, this is afinal example in this bill of a process moving too quickly and a lack of regular order.  Finally, it contains a section on foreign privacy laws that could result in the agencies seeing a reduced scope of market intheir surveillance activities that may not be the intention.

This new bill, H.238, has new mandates and steps in it which will force the Commodity Futures Trading Commission toredirect funding from its core mission to satisfy some of the new mandates within this rule.  H.238 sets a flat reauthorization level of $250 million per year for the next 5 years, despite the annual average budgetrequests of the agency of well over $300 million since passage of Dodd-Freezing the funding level makes the new rulesalmost impossible to enforce.

11748,topic-id,2729,"Mr.President, I rise tonight to talk about a problem that is affecting every single one of the States represented in this Chamber and every one of our communities. It is one that folks back home are, unfortunately, experiencing and, frankly, we don't talk enough about this in It is this epidemic of heroin and prescription drug abuse.  How bad is it? We just learned very recently that for the first time in 23 years, life expectancy in the United States has gone down, and there is no question that the surge in heroin and prescription drug addiction is one of the reasons. In fact, the demographic that saw the biggest drop in life expectancy was among middle-aged White women--the very group that has been hardest hit by the heroin and prescription drug epidemic in overdoses and overdose deaths. Unbelievably, this epidemic is actually driving down life expectancy in our great country.  It has been pretty dramatic. The number of heroin users in the United States has tripled since 2007, and the number of heroin overdoses has tripled just since 2012. It has gotten to the point where we are now losing one American life about every 12 minutes to this epidemic. So during this talk today, which will be about 12 minutes, we expect another American to die of a heroin overdose.  Congress has begun to act, and I applaud the House and the Senate for that. We have acted over the last year to do a couple things. One is that, in the appropriations bill that passed at the end of last year, we put more money aside for treatment. So States are now receiving grants--$500 million this year, $500 million next year. These grants are needed. It is going to the hardest hit It is going to States based on their need, which I think is very important, because some States are hit harder than others. My colleague from Ohio is here on the floor, and he has been very involved in this issue as well. My State has been one of those States hardest hit. Some think that Ohio now has the highest number of overdoses when we add prescription drugs, heroin, and synthetic heroin, like fentanyl.  Second, last summer Congress took what I think is the biggest step we have taken in decades in terms of fighting this issue when we passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery The President signed it into law. It is already helping with regard to providing more prevention efforts, treatment, and long-term recovery. It is also helping our law enforcement and other first responders to be able to handle this growing crisis.  We fully funded this Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--also called CARA--this year, and now we need to ensure that the new administration that has just come in continues to effectively implement this program as quickly as possible.  Just in the last few weeks, three of CARA's grant programs got up and running. One is funding for drug courts. Those who are involved with drug courts back home already know this, but it is a very effective way to take those who are in the criminal justice system because of a drug issue--prescription drug and heroin issues in particular--and get them into a diversion program where they can get treatment, with the risk of going back to incarceration if they do not stay clean. This is really working well in some of our communities in They are also using interesting new techniques, including a medication called VIVITROL, to keep people off of their addiction.  Second, we have just put in place for the first time ever programs for recovery support services. Again, in this legislation, CARA, we funded long-term recovery. So it is not just a detox center, not just a treatment center that might be short term, which they usually are, but longer term recovery, including getting people into sober housing, providing them with people who will support them and encourage them. That, we have found out, keeps people from relapsing and is incredibly powerful.  Third, there has been a grant to empower States and local governments to help fight this epidemic.  This is all-important. It is real progress. But our work is far from done. In fact, there are five more CARA grant programs yet to be implemented.  Again, I call on the new administration to do so urgently. I know they are focused on this issue. We just need to get these programs up and going to help our communities right now.  Near my hometown of Cincinnati, OH, the Winemiller family of Wayne Township had a pretty tough They were missing a son and a daughter because of heroin. Over Easter weekend last year, Roger Winemiller found his daughter Heather dead of a heroin overdose in their bathroom. She left behind an 8-year-old son. Then, just 5 days before Christmas, Heather's brother Gene--a father of three children under 18--died of a heroin overdose. Gene started abusing painkillers when he was in his early twenties. He became addicted, and when the pills were too expensive, he switched to heroin, which is cheaper and, really, more accessible.  Unfortunately, this is a fairly common story in my home State and around the country. We are told this is how four out of five heroin addicts in the United States started on heroin--prescription drugs.  Heather and Gene both got clean several times. Heather was clean for 3 years before she relapsed and died. These were vibrant people; they loved life. Heather loved gardening, and she was a huge Ohio State Buckeyes fan. Gene loved rock music, hunting, and fishing. But they both made the tragic mistake of trying these drugs, and it changed their lives forever.  Gene Winemiller's funeral took place at Blanchester Church of Christ in Blanchester, I know Blanchester, OH, pretty well. It is a small community of about 4,000 people. The very next day, there was another funeral in that same church in this small town of 4,000 people for a heroin overdose. As Gene's dad Roger puts it, ``I can't emphasize enough: No one--no one--is immune from this epidemic.''  Unfortunately, he is right. It knows no zip code. It is in the rural areas. It is in the suburban areas. It is certainly in our inner cities. It is everywhere.[[Page S650]]  Take Cleveland, in Northeast Ohio, for example. Cleveland medical examiner Thomas Gilson said that ``2016 was an unprecedented year.'' The number of overdoses in Cleveland doubled in 2016 compared to 2015--doubled. Overdoses are happening all over the Cleveland area. More than 150 heroin overdose deaths happened in the city and another 150 happened in the suburbs, kind of evenly split. It is everybody, every group, every age group--African American, White,  Take Dayton, OH, in Southwest Ohio, as another example. In Dayton last year, there were more than 2,500 overdoses, about 7 a day. About half of the victims were men, and about half were women--some in the cities and some in the suburbs, with 60 percent in their thirties and forties and 40 percent who were either younger or older than that. So this is happening all over our State and all over our country--in cities, suburbs, inner cities, and rural areas and to rich and poor, old and young alike.  In 2015, Ohio statewide experienced a record 3,050 drug overdose deaths, which is a 20-percent increase from 2014, and more than quadruple the number of overdose deaths in 2000. In 2015, we lost an Ohioan every 3 hours to this epidemic. Sadly, the toll was even higher in 2016. We don't have the final numbers yet.  One of Ohio's economic assets, of course, is our location. We are centrally located. It is great for transportation. They say half of America's consumers are within 1 day's drive from Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Unfortunately, that central location also makes us very vulnerable to drug traffickers.  Last year, Ohio State troopers confiscated nearly 160 pounds of heroin. Depending on the potency, that could be equivalent to more than $50 million--or more than 180,000 injections--of heroin. That is nearly triple the amount of heroin seized the year before. The Ohio State Highway Patrol also confiscated a record-level number of illegal painkillers and methamphetamines last year.  We have to thank our law enforcement officers because they are saving lives every day by keeping this poison out of our communities, certainly, but also helping to reverse the overdoses with this miracle drug called naloxone or In 2015, the last year we have numbers for, Narcan was administered 16,000 times. Think about that: 16,000 people were saved who could have died of an overdose, thanks to our first responders and their professionalism. We don't have numbers yet for 2016, but, again, it is going to be, unfortunately, far higher than that.  The Washington Post recently published a report on the heroin epidemic in Chillicothe, OH, where there were more than 300 overdoses last year, and where a single police officer, Officer Ben Rhodes, says that he used naloxone to reverse an overdose more than 50 times. One church in Chillicothe, Zion Baptist Church, recently had funerals for three overdose victims in 1 week. I know It is a small town of about 21,000 people.  Heroin and prescription drug painkillers are flooding our communities to meet a rise in demand. CARA, this legislation I talked about, will reduce that demand by increasing access to treatment for those who need it and preventing new addictions from starting in the first place through better prevention and education efforts.  After CARA became law, I introduced bipartisan legislation to take another step. This is called the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, or the STOP Again, it builds on CARA because it helps reduce the supply of drugs coming into our communities.  Some of the deadliest drugs coming into Ohio are synthetics--drugs such as fentanyl, carfentanil, or U4, essentially synthetic heroin that is made in a laboratory somewhere. Guess where these drugs are coming from: overseas. Boy, they are incredibly powerful. Fentanyl can be more than 50 or even 100 times as powerful as heroin. According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, it takes about 2 milligrams to kill you. Carfentanil is even more powerful than that--up to 10,000 times as powerful as morphine. It is so powerful that it is used primarily as a tranquilizer for large animals like elephants.  Heroin bought on the street today in Ohio and elsewhere is often laced with these drugs to make it more potent. Roger Winemiller, the Dad I talked about a few moments ago who lost his two kids, compares buying heroin to playing Russian roulette because you never know the potency of the drug that you are buying. Many of these spates of overdoses in our urban areas in Ohio are because of the mix with fentanyl and carfentanil.  These fentanyl deaths in Ohio have increased nearly fivefold in the last 3 years. Three years ago we had about 1 in every 20 overdoses in Ohio because of fentanyl. Now it is one in five. We expect it soon to be one in three. You can see where this is going.  I talked a minute ago about the trafficking of drugs on our interstate highways. That is a serious problem, but so is the problem of traffickers shipping these drugs through our mail system to our communities to meet this growing demand.  Just yesterday the U.S.-China Commission released a report about the trafficking of Chinese fentanyl into this country. The report says:       The majority of fentanyl products found in the United      States originate in . . . Chinese law enforcement      officials have struggled to adequately regulate the thousands      of chemical and pharmaceutical facilities [laboratories]      operating legally and illegally in the country, leading to      increased production and export of illicit chemicals and      drugs. Chinese chemical exporters . . . covertly ship drugs      to the Western hemisphere.  That is from a report just yesterday. Right now these drugs are difficult to detect before it is too late. Part of the reason is that, unlike private carriers such as UPS or FedEx, the Postal Service does not require information about packages. If you are a private carrier, you have to have electric customs data for packages coming into the country, saying where it is from, what is in it, where it is going. This means the U.Postal Service is a more attractive way for traffickers to get these dangerous drugs like fentanyl or carfentanil into our country. It shouldn't be this way. It doesn't have to be this way.  The STOP Act would close that loophole and make the Postal Service require advanced electronic data. Where is it coming from? What is in it? Where is it going? That information on these packages before they cross our borders would be incredibly helpful. It is common sense. It would help stop these dangerous synthetic drugs from being trafficked into the United States, and it would save lives. That is what our law enforcement officials are telling us.  I know the scope of this epidemic is daunting. It is in your State of It is in my State of Its consequences are hard to even think about because it is about the overdose deaths, but it is far more than that. It is about people not being able to live out their dream. It is about higher costs for law enforcement. It is about crime. It is about our workforce and people not being able to go to work and not being able to find workers who are drug free. It is about so much that affects our communities.  Yet there is hope. We have to work here in Congress to continue to promote legislation and policies that will help us to achieve the dream of turning this tide around. The STOP Act that I talked about is going to help keep some of that poison out of our communities and increase the cost of heroin. That is good.  These synthetic heroin increases are really concerning. Treatment is incredibly important, and it can work. I have met so many people across Ohio who have beaten their addiction--people who are now back on their feet, back with their kids, back with their families. It is hard, but with treatment and a supportive environment, particularly this longer term recovery, it can be done.  Last year I met with Aaron Marks in Columbus, OH, at a conference held by the Ohio Association of County Behavioral Health Aaron is from Cleveland, a suburb called He began using prescription painkillers as a freshman at Beachwood High He was just 13 years old.  Again, it is a story that is all too common. Often because of an accident or injury, people start using these pain pills.  He was smart, had good grades. He got into the University of Cincinnati, a great school. One day at UC he ran out[[Page S651]]of pills. A fellow student who was living in the same dorm room offered him something else. He said: It is cheaper; it is called heroin.  He tried it. Soon, he had sold virtually everything he owned to buy more. Finally, with the help of Glenbeigh treatment center in Cleveland, OH, Aaron got clean and has stayed that way for more than a decade. Aaron is now a successful manager of business development at American  We can have a lot more success stories like Aaron's if we all engage--all of us. Washington, DC, is not going to solve this problem. It will be solved in our communities. It is going to be solved in our families. It is going to be solved in our hearts.  Washington, DC, can play a more constructive role. In passing this legislation, it makes sense to give people the tools they need to be able to fight this scourge. The role is put the right policies in place, like the STOP Act, like fully funding treatment, like fully funding CARA in the coming months. We can then bring down the demand for these dangerous drugs, and we can keep these poisons from coming into our communities and build on the progress that Congress has made over the past year. Let's not let up until we finally turn the tide of this epidemic and begin to save lives.  I yield back.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgS634-5.txt,924,OBJECTING TO UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 2334,2017.0,2.0,January
11584,topic-id,716,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.1033, the Open Book on Equal Access to Justice  Mr.Speaker, I want to begin by echoing the praise that the chairman offered to Mr.Collins and Mr.Cohen for their leadership on this important legislation which I support for several reasons.[[Page H1335]]  To begin with, it strengthens the Equal Access to Justice Act, a crucial law that has helped senior citizens, veterans, the disabled, and not-for-profit groups vindicate their rights against unreasonable or arbitrary governmental action.  Now, as the chairman stated, under the so-called American rule, parties to adjudicative matters typically pay their own litigation costs, subject to certain statutory exceptions; and one of these exceptions is the Equal Access to Justice Act, which allows a party to be reimbursed for litigation costs when he or she is victorious against the Federal Government under specified conditions.  But if the U.can show that its position was substantially justified, or that special circumstances would make an award unjust, then the prevailing party is not entitled to be reimbursed for his or her litigation costs.  In addition, only certain parties are eligible to be reimbursed for their litigation costs under the act, based on their net worth or tax exempt status, among other factors that are built in to the statute.  Whether these restrictions still make sense is an open question, as Congress simply does not have the adequate information to assess the continuing effectiveness of the act. This is because there has been no comprehensive Federal report on the total amount of fees awarded under the act since 1995, and, as a result, all we have is conjecture and extrapolation.  Fortunately, H.1033 addresses this problem by requiring annual reports on the amount of fees paid under the act to prevailing litigants against the government. As a result of this legislation, Congress will know now, on an annual basis, the agencies required to reimburse parties for their litigation costs; the claims that first gave rise to the litigation; and the amount of awards made under the act, as well as the basis for them.  With this information, Congress will be in a much better position to assess the ongoing implementation of the act and the performance of the agencies as litigants.  Another reason why I support this legislation is that it respects the privacy interests of the parties who are reimbursed for their litigation costs pursuant to the act. Unfortunately, prior versions of this legislation were unnecessarily intrusive.  Organizations, like the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives and the Paralyzed Veterans of America, expressed their serious concerns that prior versions of the bill might ``infringe the privacy of vulnerable people who have applied for Social Security and veterans' benefits.'' These are serious concerns, especially given the fact that the bill requires the information collected to be made available to the public and transparent through posting on the internet.  As currently drafted, however, H.1033 strikes the proper balance between encouraging transparency and respecting the legitimate privacy interests of parties that have been raised as an issue in the past. The bill specifically provides that the annual reports required to be made publicly available may not reveal any information the disclosure of which is prohibited by law or court order.  Finally, I support H.1033 because it recognizes the important role that the Administrative Conference of the United States has historically played in helping Congress identify inefficiencies among the Federal agencies and ways to save taxpayer dollars through the proper economies. I am particularly pleased that the current version of this legislation reflects various thoughtful suggestions shared by the Administrative Conference with our staffs.  Given the excellent work and scholarly analysis that have been the hallmarks of the Administrative Conference of the United States, I expect its report and its attendant findings will be an invaluable aid to  As the Judiciary Committee is the authorizing committee for the Conference, I encourage our friends on the Appropriations Committee to ensure that the Conference has adequate funding to implement this very important legislation.  Like the Administrative Conference, H.1033 requires only a modest investment that will result in a very valuable return for all Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Contrary to the U.resolution that we are condemning today, which condemns the settlements that are taking place in Israel, the new settlements that the Israelis find themselves permitting are not undermining the cause of peace. Let's get this straight. This is what we just hear over and over again that the settlements are undermining peace.  What undermines peace is when the Palestinian people continue with their policies of terrorism, both attacking with missiles and rockets, as well as stabbings, as well as the Palestinian people and their leaders unwilling to stand up and recognize that Israel exists. They don't have a right to flood into that country with a right of return. That is what undermines the peace.  The settlements wouldn't be taking place, except the Israelis and the United Nations and the supporters of the Palestinians have made a mockery of the deal that was made.  The Israelis withdrew from control of the territory. They withdrew, and they permitted the Palestinians to establish authority there with two promises: number one, they wouldn't use the territory to attack Israel; and number two, they would recognize Israel's right to exist, and this right of return permitting them to flood into Israel and eliminate it that way did not exist.  The Palestinians have given up nothing. The Israelis have given up territory and made themselves vulnerable to the type of attack that leaves Israelis dead every day from terrorist attacks.

The United States alliance with Israel is absolutely critical, and this is not the time to sow uncertainty about the state of our relationship.  This resolution does a number of important things, but the most important is that it reaffirms Congress' longstanding support for a bilateral settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and objects to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334. Paragraph 5 of that resolution is reminiscent of a recent U.Human Rights[[Page H152]]Council resolution that established a database of companies in the settlements, facilitating a boycott.

But opposition to the building of settlements on land belonging to Palestinians before the 1967 war--with the exception of the land, of course, that is going to be swapped, agreed to by both parties--has been the official U.policy for many decades, contrary, again, to the assertions of 11.  It has also been the policy of the United States to recognize that the only long-term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--the violence, the loss of life--is to create two states: one for the Palestinians and one for A two-state solution is the only way Israel can continue as both a democratic and a Jewish state, living in the peace and security that has eluded her from the very beginning.

11745,topic-id,1350,"Mr.President, back on the topic of the evening: the Congressional Review Act action to overturn the SEC's rule.  I am just kind of at a loss for words. There are people back home asking how politics is going, and they have a certain set of assumptions about the way Congress works. They watch ``House of Cards.'' They watch movies about politics. They have watched other TV shows on Hulu and Netflix, whatever it may be. I submit to you that what we are doing right now is so corrupt, so grotesque, so obvious, so trite that it wouldn't even make the cut as a plot for a TV show about politics because who would believe that the Republican Congress, as one of their first acts, would pass a law prohibiting the implementation of a rule that requires oil companies to disclose what kind of foreign payments they are making for the privilege of extracting resources.  So what does that mean? You have oil companies that in order to extract resources in places like Africa and elsewhere--mostly poor countries around the globe--they have to cut a deal with whoever is in charge of the government in order to have access to that resource. Whether it is in Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Africa, Myanmar, or elsewhere, they cut a deal with the governing despot, usually. That money very often makes it directly into the pockets of the family of the people who run the country. This is what Senator Cardin was elucidating, as was Senator Leahy and the ranking member, Senator  But this issue was new to me, and I came to the floor not as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but as a citizen. I can't believe we are doing this. This is one of the stinkiest pieces of legislation that I have seen in my now 5 years in the Senate and my 8 years in the Hawaii State Legislature, in my life in politics. I can't believe that we would have the gall to put a bill on the floor to prevent us from disclosing what kinds of foreign payments--that is a euphemism--are being made to despots and autocrats around the planet. These are American companies traded on the stock exchange, American companies making foreign payments, euphemistically, for the privilege of extracting primarily oil. Our ability as a country to be the world's lone superpower--as Madeleine Albright called us, ``the indispensable nation,''--to be the superior country when it comes to money, morals, and might is now in question. Everywhere you look, it seems like America is ceding global leadership.  China is set to outshine the United States on climate change policy--[[Page S646]]Germany's Prime Minister is explaining international conventions on refugees to the President of the United We have insulted some of our closest allies in the fight against ISIS with a Muslim ban.  Now we are alienating ourselves from Australia, a country that has stood with the United States in every major conflict since the beginning of the 20th century. It is hard work to offend You have to go out of your way in a phone call between the United States and Australia to have it go sideways.  So the world is asking if the United States will still lead in the fight against The world is asking if the United States will still keep its word, and they are asking if the United States is still the moral leader for the world.  I think everyone in the Congress would agree that the answers to these questions should be a resounding yes, but somehow one of the first orders of business in this Republican Congress is not a bill that demonstrates American leadership but one that concedes it, because that is exactly what we would do if we overturn the Cardin-Lugar amendment.  If we diminish our moral compass, the rest of the world stops looking at the United States as the leader among nations. The law we are voting to repeal set a new international standard in the fight against corruption. It requires oil and mining companies that are listed on the U.Stock Exchange to report any payments they may make to foreign governments. The idea is that the companies won't bribe dictators in mineral rich countries because they know they will have to disclose the payments.  After the United States passed this law in 2010, some 30 countries followed our lead, but we never got to implementing it. So today, more than one-third of the world's oil and gas companies have strong legal incentives to do business the right way. If Republicans get rid of this disclosure requirement, it will be bad for American consumers.  In 2004, a Senate subcommittee uncovered that oil companies, including ExxonMobil, have paid hundreds of millions of dollars to the President of Equatorial Guinea, which is an oil-rich country in That money didn't go to the businesses and citizens. It went directly into the pockets of the President who has been called Africa's nastiest dictator. Instead of buying food or roads for people--by the way, most people who live there live on less than $1 a day--the President and his family bought real estate in Paris, luxury cars and life-sized statues--plural--of Michael  Getting rid of this amendment will also be bad for national security. Senator Lugar is one of the Republican Party's most distinguished foreign policy voices and the former chairman of the Foreign Relations He understood the risk. He understood how corruption fuels insecurity, poverty, and oppression in other countries and how that can contribute to the condition that breeds violent extremism. That is why he fought for the level of transparency required by this rule and to make it harder for dictators to steal from their own citizens. That means that getting rid of the Cardin-Lugar amendment is also bad for investors. If a company is operating in a risky, corrupt, unstable country, investors have the right to know. If a company is perhaps even adding to the region's insecurity, investors have a right to know that too. But that right is now in jeopardy.  The way Republicans are going about this, we won't be able to revisit this once it is all said and done. This is an important point. I said it last night on the stream protection rule, and I think it bears repeating. If you do a CRA action--we are now on the third in American history, and the second was yesterday. The first was sometime in the eighties, about ergonomics. The reason this never gets done is because, when you overturn a regulation using the Congressional Review Act, it is an incredibly blunt instrument. What happens under law is that the rule can't be promulgated again. You can't tweak this thing.  As to the concerns that were expressed by some of the Members on the Republican side about the modifications they would like, if we want to legislate, let's legislate. But what they are going to do is overturn this rule and the Securities and Exchange Commission from doing anything ``substantially similar'' ever again. Everybody who understands the CRA under the law understands that, basically, we can't touch this topic again. So this isn't about fixing a reg or being a check on runaway bureaucrats. These so-called bureaucrats, these civil servants in the Securities and Exchange Commission, had a statute. They were told to do something. Now, they took forever to do it, but that is not running away and going rogue. That is going a little slow, I will grant you, but they did the right thing pursuant to the law.  Now--I don't know why, but I have my suspicions; I don't know why, but I have my suspicions--we are overturning both a rule and a law that requires the disclosure of payments to foreign governments made primarily by oil companies. It is one of the most awful things I have seen done in the Congress--not just when I have been here but as I have observed it over the last 20 years.  I yield the floor.

11579,topic-id,1015,"Now, on another matter, the pending nominations of the President's Cabinet, again, we are in[[Page S611]]unchartered waters with this administration. They have not proposed a normal This is not even close to a normal  I have never seen a Cabinet this full of bankers and billionaires, folks with massive conflicts of interest and such little experience or expertise in the areas they will oversee. Many of the nominees have philosophies that cut against the very nature of the Department to which they were nominated.  Let me give you two examples this morning: Betsy DeVos, the nominee for the Department of Education, and Andrew Puzder, nominee for the Labor  First, Betsy When you judge her in three areas--conflicts of interest, basic competence, and ideology, views on education policy--it is clear that Betsy DeVos is unfit for the job of Education  In all three areas, ideology, competence, and conflicts of interest, she rates among the lowest of any Cabinet nominee I have ever seen. At her hearing, she didn't seem to know basic facts about Federal education law that guarantee education to students with disabilities. She didn't seem to know the basic facts of a long simmering debate in education policy measuring growth proficiency. And in her ethics agreement, which was delivered to the committee after her first hearing, it was revealed that she would keep interests in several companies that benefit from millions of dollars in contracts from the Department of Education, which she would oversee.  There was a rush to push her through--one round of questions, 5 minutes each. Why? Why did someone generally as fair as the chairman of that committee do that? My guess, an educated guess: He knew how incompetent this nominee was, how poorly she fared under normal questions, and the idea was to rush her through.  Well, that is not what we should be doing on something as important as this. And if the nominee can't withstand a certain amount of scrutiny, they shouldn't be the nominee.  The glaring concerns have led two of my Republican colleagues, the Senators from Maine and Alaska, to pledge a vote against her confirmation, leaving her nomination deadlocked at 50 to 50. I believe both of them cited the fact that in their State, charter schools are not the big issue; it is public schools. How are we going to treat public schools? Particularly in rural areas, as I am sure my friend the Presiding Officer knows, there is not a choice of schools outside the major metropolitan areas, the major cities. If you don't have a good public school, you have nothing. So particularly people from the rural States should be worried, in my judgment, about our nominee's commitment to public education.  For the first time ever, we have the chance that the Vice President and a pending Cabinet nominee, the nominee for Attorney General, Senator Sessions, are casting the deciding votes on a controversial Cabinet position for Betsy Mr.President, this has never happened before.  The White House will, in effect, get two deciding votes in the Senate on a nominee to the President's Cabinet: the Vice President and the nominee for Attorney General, our friend Senator  It highlights the stunning depth of concern this nominee has engendered in Republicans and Democrats alike. It is clear now that Senators of both parties agree she is not qualified to be Secretary of And I would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--this is such an important position; the nominee is so laddered on issue after issue after issue that we could get someone better. I don't think it will be that hard. It will be President Trump's nominee. It will not be us deciding, but it will be someone who has basic competence, fewer conflicts of interest, and, above all, a commitment to public education.  So I urge my Republican colleagues, friends, to stand up and reject Betsy DeVos, as the Cleveland Plain Dealer urged in an editorial this morning.  This is not a normal nominee, once again. In my view, when I dipped into her record and how she performed in her brief hearing, she has not earned and should not receive the Senate's approval.  Second, the nominee for the Department of Labor, Andrew The hearing for his nomination has now been delayed four times because he still hasn't submitted key paperwork laying out his disclosures and detailing a plan for divesting, if necessary, to avoid conflicts of interest. But that might be the least of the Senate's concerns.  This is a nominee who is being sued by dozens of former employees due to workplace violations. This is a nominee who has repeatedly attacked the minimum wage, opposed the overtime rule, and advocated for more automation and fewer jobs. He talked about--I think in very positive terms--robots and how they may run the fast food industry. This is a nominee for Secretary of Labor who not only wants workers to earn less, he wants fewer workers.  For several of these Cabinet positions, it seems the President has searched for candidates whose philosophies are diametrically opposed to the very purposes of their For Education, pick someone with no experience in public schools and has spent her career advocating against them. For Labor, pick someone who has spent his career trying to keep the wages of his employees low and advocated against policies that benefit workers.  Again, I repeat: This is not your typical This is highly, highly unusual.  So when my Republican colleagues come to the floor every day to complain about delays and holdups, I would remind them that this is very serious. These Cabinet officials will have immense power in our government and wield enormous influence over the lives of average Americans: their wages and the education of their children, for instance.  To spend a few more days on the process is well worth it. And if they prove unfit for the austere and powerful roles they are about to take up, then it is our responsibility, as Senators who advise and consent, to reject their nomination.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgS610-4.txt,1036,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1628, AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF",2017.0,2.0,February

A special prosecutor, by the Department of Justice rules, would be free of day-to-day supervision by anyone at the Department of Justice, would be free to follow the investigation where it leads, and would be subject to an increased level of congressional oversight. Moreover, it is the right thing to do to ensure that this investigation remains impartial, nonpartisan, and truly gets to the bottom of the matter. The bottom line is very simple. The special prosecutor can only be fired for cause, but a line person in the Justice Department could be fired at will. We saw that happen when President Trump didn't like what Sally Yates said about his Executive order. He simply fired her.  Mr.Rosenstein is a very fine man, an excellent, longtime prosecutor in the Justice Department, but this is when we call for a special prosecutor. It is not an aspersion against him in any way. We are worried the White House will not let an investigation within the Justice Department, without the insulation of a special prosecutor, go forward.  So if Mr.Rosenstein is unwilling to commit to naming a special prosecutor or says he needs to be confirmed, and in his position he can make an assessment, that is insufficient. The need for a special prosecutor is clear enough today to make that call.  Of course, we don't need to wait for Mr.Mr.Boente, the Acting Deputy Attorney General, can make the call today, but if neither will commit to a special prosecutor, Congress will have to consider bringing back a narrower independent counsel law to see that this investigation is conducted properly.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1608-5.txt,1036,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,7.0,February

Nearly one-third of all U.counties currently have only one insurer offering plans on their State's exchanges. That is a government-created monopoly, Mr.Speaker, and that kills the free market, meaning no choices for the American people and higher costs are what the American consumer and the healthcare market are finding.  And it is only continuing to get worse. As more and more insurers leave the marketplace, prices will continue to rise, forcing healthy individuals to make economic decisions not to purchase health care, creating a self-defeating spiral of rising costs and less options. That is why we must act, and act today, which is what we are doing.  It is no wonder that in such a government-controlled system that premiums have increased by an average of 25 percent on the ObamaCare exchanges this year alone. And it is no wonder that some 19.2 million taxpayers chose to outright pay the individual mandate penalty or claimed an exemption. What this means is that ObamaCare is not a good option to these 19.2 million people.  Mr.Speaker, the American people, I believe, sent us to Washington, D.C., to fix this issue. They are telling us directly: this must be fixed now. And people certainly outside of Washington resent the Federal Government telling them how to purchase health care and what that healthcare marketplace would look like. But we really do not have to tolerate this. We do not have to agree that we will accept the status quo.  Mr.Speaker, I believe the American people are smart. I believe the American people want independence, they love freedom, and they want to know that they can make their own choices, because they believe they make better choices than a one-size-fits-all plan out of Washington, D. What brings us here today, however, most assuredly, is a broken system. So, Republicans offer today H.1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017, which will eliminate Washington's one-size-fits-all healthcare policy for the American people. It dismantles the disastrous ObamaCare taxes that are strangling the working middle class and diminishing America's economic prowess. We will end this with the opportunity to vote today to change the status quo.  It eliminates the onerous employer and individual mandates. It prohibits health insurers from denying coverage and helps young adults access health care by getting back into the marketplace while stabilizing and restoring the free market opportunities for all  Mr.Speaker, the American people are counting on Washington getting it right this time. What does getting it right mean? Getting it right means giving them the opportunity to exit a bad system and to have a better chance at a new system.  This rule provides House Republicans with the opportunity to restore exactly that--a better healthcare plan to provide the middle class and low-income families who have been left behind on either side of the aisle, and it gives them an opportunity to have tax advantages in the employer marketplace.  Mr.Speaker, today, we will be dissecting this into three separate areas. We will have Members of the Republican majority here to explain that and the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Sessions), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, the majority is rushing to congratulate itself for finally having a bill to repeal the Affordable Care For 7 years, Republicans had nothing to actually replace the law with, but that didn't stop them from making one empty political promise after another.  And after all that, what do we have in front of us today? This bill will take away health care from 24 million hardworking It forces families to pay higher premiums and deductibles, increasing out-of-pocket costs. It is a crushing age tax, forcing Americans age 50 to 64 to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy they are. Not to mention the $880 billion cut to Medicaid or the fact that it steals from Medicare, shortening the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years and ransacking funds that seniors depend on to get the long-term care they need.  I don't see anything there to be excited about. But then again, I come from the old-fashioned school of thought that we should actually take care of our fellow citizens as they grow older, rather than tossing them off the ship without a life preserver.  It is no wonder that after developing such an ill-conceived and far-reaching bill on the fly, the majority has had to try and jam this legislation through our  First, they rushed this bill through the committee process without holding a single hearing, and without the benefit of a nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office score outlining its costs and impacts.  Then the majority came out of a back room somewhere and filed four managers' amendments in the dark of[[Page H2376]]night to try to appease the conservative and moderate holdouts, including the infamous Buffalo bribe. The Republican leadership has been trying to strong-arm their conference into voting for this bill all week, and nobody knows how today's vote will go. The only thing we do know is that this is a terrible bill that is only getting worse, not better.  This thing has been a mess from beginning to end. Now, I know our President prides himself on his negotiating skills, but this seems more like the art of no deal to me, no matter what the final vote tally looks like.  That brings us to this early morning, when we met at 7 a.m. in the Rules Committee to report out this rule, which rewrites the bill to make it far worse.  Last night, we were presented with a provision, concocted in some back room, that boggles the mind with its cynicism. So what is this mysterious grand bargain that will appease the Republican Conference and finally buy Speaker Ryan enough votes to pass this disaster of a bill? Well, Mr.Speaker, it is so cartoonishly malicious that I can picture someone twirling their mustache as they drafted it in their secret Capitol lair last night.  Republicans are killing the requirements that insurance plans cover essential health benefits--essential health benefits. Now, perhaps you are wondering: What are these so-called essential benefits? Well, I will give you a partial list: emergency room trips, maternity care, mental health care and substance abuse treatment, and prescription drugs. These are the types of exotic, extravagant benefits that Republicans apparently don't think are important for working Americans to be able to afford.  It would be literally unbelievable if we weren't here considering it right now, Mr.Now, I have been awake since before dawn--thanks to our Rules Committee meeting--so I know that this isn't a nightmare. We are actually voting on a bill with a backroom deal, made in the dark of night, that would take away any guarantee that plans would cover these basic essential benefits.  And, of course, we have no idea what the costs will be or how many people it will affect. We can't know those things until we get an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which, obviously, we will not have before we vote on this reckless legislation.  And that is the real problem. Because every time you come out of a back room, this bill gets worse. For the sake of our country, maybe we should consider putting locks on the back rooms you huddle in.  President Trump keeps talking about crowd size. My colleagues across the aisle keep talking about page size. This morning, in the Rules Committee, Republicans kept saying that the fifth manager's amendment is only 4 pages long. How bad could it be?  Well, they need to stop worrying about size and pay more attention to how this bill will affect regular, working These 4 pages are the worse 4 pages on this planet because of the terrible consequences it will have on real people. It will be devastating for millions and millions of  So, Mr.Speaker, instead of rushing this horrendous bill, patched together with backroom deals, to the floor and voting on it just hours after seeing the final product, we should be working together in a bipartisan way to improve people's lives, and certainly not putting them at risk. My colleagues seem too concerned about winning at any cost to stop and think about the consequences for millions upon millions of This is a lousy bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

11484,topic-id,690,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Florida very much. In fact, the gentleman is correct. We had an opportunity to quote the Bible, Janis Joplin, and ZZ Top when we were doing our hearings. We had so much time with each other, and I enjoyed the hours and hours that we had to debate these essential items.  But the other side of the story is essential health benefits are not being done away with. They are being transferred entirely to States have asked for the ability to manage their own money, and manage their own people's benefits of what would be required in the So in no way should a person take away, well, we just did away with it. In fact, we transferred the authority and the responsibility of essential health benefits to the States because Governors have been asking for this.  Mr.Speaker, I want to take just a moment to explain what I believe is at the heart of the legislation and really, in reality, the key to fixing health care. It is the second part of this.  We heard the gentleman from Lewisville, Texas, Burgess, speak about the Energy and Commerce portions. I now would like to take a minute to talk about the portions that come directly out of the Ways and Means  The gentleman, Mr.Brady, from The Woodlands, Texas, today, spoke about many of these; but at the heart of it, 170 million Americans currently receive their health care through an employee-employer tax advantage or tax benefits, an untaxed benefit whereby people who have an employer who can provide their health care, it is not taxed--pretaxed to the employee, allowing them to have a good healthcare system. Well, all the while, millions of Americans pay higher premiums out of their pockets in the individual market. Those are people that do not have an employer who is able to help them. So that is not fair. That does not help these people.  What we are doing here is putting together an addition of, really, a great Republican idea; and it takes the important step to provide the same tax-free benefits for those employer-sponsored plans that we will give to regular employees, and it is called a tax credit. This tax credit is going to work because it allows every single American that does not receive the tax benefit at work to get it for themselves.  Who is this? Well, quite honestly, it is small-business owners; it is low-income workers; it is entrepreneurs. It includes, really, a lot of real estate agents and people that work for a small business, maybe heating and air-conditioning systems like we have all across this country. It will give their families an opportunity.  How much money? Well, we will provide them between $2,000 and $14,000 a year for their families to be able to have these opportunities to purchase a nongovernment healthcare plan, meaning that, as they would go to the marketplace, we are going to help these people through a tax credit available January 1, providing them with an opportunity to purchase health care on a benefit basis.  Why is this important? It saves money because what it does, it creates two things: a family then has an insurance plan, including a healthcare component that goes to the hospitalization; and secondly, it gives them an opportunity to have their own doctor or healthcare plan that they choose. This is important because many of these people end up in the hospital in the most expensive kind of way we can provide health care: at the emergency room.  So this gives these families parity in the marketplace. We believe that that is important and is another part of this Republican healthcare plan.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 87 patient and provider organizations, including the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, which is strongly opposed to this bill.                                                   March 20, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,       Dear Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: The undersigned      organizations write to express grave concern about proposals      put forth in the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to alter the      fundamental structure and purpose of Medicaid, a vital source      of health care for patients with ongoing health needs.       We feel compelled to speak out against proposals to phase      out Medicaid expansion and implement per capita caps, which      threaten the ability of Medicaid to provide critical health      care services to many of our most vulnerable citizens. These      proposals aim to achieve cost savings of approximately $880      billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, at the      expense of tens of millions of patients who rely on Medicaid      for life-sustaining care. While we appreciate the      opportunities we have had to work with your staff, we cannot      support the Medicaid provisions in this bill and cannot      accept policies that prioritize cutting costs by limiting      patients' access to care.                   Medicaid is Critical for Patients       Medicaid is a crucial source of coverage for patients with      serious and chronic health care needs. Pregnant women depend      on Medicaid, which covers roughly 50 percent of all births      including many high-risk pregnancies. Medicaid covers cancer      patients: nearly one-third of pediatric cancer patients were      enrolled in Medicaid in 2013 and approximately 1.52 million      adults with a history of cancer were covered by Medicaid in      2015. Over fifty percent of children and one-third of adults      living with cystic fibrosis rely on Medicaid to get the      treatments and therapies they need to preserve their health.      Nearly half of children with asthma are covered by Medicaid      or CHIP and adults with diabetes are disproportionally      covered by Medicaid as well. The patients we represent are      eligible for Medicaid through various pathways, including      through income-related and disability criteria.                         Reject Per Capita Caps       The proposal to convert federal financing of Medicaid to a      per capita cap system is deeply troubling. This policy is      designed to reduce federal funding for Medicaid, forcing      states to either make up the difference with their own funds      or cut their programs by reducing the number of people they      serve and the health benefits they provide.       For patients with ongoing health care needs, this means      that Medicaid may no longer cover the care and treatments      they need, including breakthrough therapies and technology.      In order to save money, the per capita caps are set to grow      more slowly than expected Medicaid costs under current law.      As the gap between the capped allotment and actual costs      increases over time, states will be forced to constrain      eligibility, reduce benefits, lower provider payments, or      increase cost-sharing. Moreover, by capping the federal      government's contribution to Medicaid in this manner, states      will be less able to cover the cost of new treatments. This      could be devastating for people with serious diseases, for      whom groundbreaking treatments represent a new lease on life.      For people with cystic fibrosis, cancer, and other diseases,      new therapies can be game changers that improve quality of      life and increase life expectancy. In fact, we have already      seen Medicaid programs respond to current budget constraints      by using clinically inappropriate criteria to restrict access      to therapies old and new. A per capita cap will only      exacerbate the downward pressure on Medicaid budgets and will      further reduce access to these therapies for patients.       Pairing financing reforms with increased flexibility, as      has often been proposed, would further undermine Medicaid's      role as a safety net for patients. Without current guardrails      provided by federal requirements--coupled with reduced      federal funding--states will have the authority to reduce      benefits and eligibility as they see fit and to impose other      restrictions, such as waiting periods and enrollment caps.      These policies have serious implications for patients--for a      person with cancer, enrollment freezes and waiting lists      could mean a later-stage diagnosis when treatment costs are      higher and survival is less likely. For a person with      diabetes, this would risk the ability to adequately manage      the disease. Many of our patients rely on costly services      that will be quickly targeted for cuts if states are given      such flexibility, so it is imperative that current federal      safeguards remain in place.                      Maintain Medicaid Expansion       While the AHCA has been described as preserving Medicaid      expansion for those already enrolled in coverage, we are      concerned that estimates show that eliminating the enhanced      match for any enrollee with even a small gap in coverage      would actually result in millions of people losing      coverage. By eliminating the enhanced federal match for      any enrollee with a gap in coverage, eventually states      will be on the hook for billions of dollars to continue      covering this population--an insurmountable financial      hurdle. Additionally, seven states have laws that would      effectively end Medicaid expansion immediately or soon      thereafter when the expansion match rate is eliminated.      Nearly half of adults covered by the Medicaid expansion      are permanently disabled, have serious physical or mental      conditions--such as cancer, stroke, heart disease,      arthritis, pregnancy, or diabetes--or are in fair or poor      health. Repealing Medicaid expansion will leave these      patients without coverage they depend upon to maintain      their health.       The proposed financing reforms are a fundamental shift away      from Medicaid's role as a safety-net for some of the most      vulnerable members of our society. Repealing Medicaid      expansion would leave millions without the health care they      rely on. Our organizations represent and provide care for      millions of Americans living with ongoing health care needs      who rely on Medicaid and we cannot support policies that pose      such a grave risk to patients.       We hope that we can continue our dialogue as you move      forward in this process to arrive at solutions that provide      all Americans with high-quality, affordable care regardless      of an individual's income, employment status, health status,      or geographic location.

This process has been awful. But this is even a sadder day for the American people.  I remind my colleagues that we are supposed to care about one another, especially the most vulnerable in our society. In this era of Trump, Washington has become a mean place. It is a place where it has become unfashionable to worry about the poor, about older Americans, and about those who struggle.  There is absolutely no justification for giving huge tax breaks to billionaires--$1 trillion in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, and at the same time throwing 24 million people off of health care and denying millions more essential healthcare protections.  Twenty-four million people--my Republican colleagues have lost their human ability to feel what that means. That is the entire population of  Mr.Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues, but when I look at this bill and I read this bill, I have to wonder: What are you thinking? How could you do this?  I have come to the conclusion there are only two reasons--there are only two ways you can vote for this bill. One is you don't know what is in the bill; or two is you have to have a heart of stone, because this bill is shameful. It is going to hurt people. It is going to hurt your constituents.  Withdraw this bill or vote ``no'' on this bill, but this bill cannot become law. The health care and healthcare protections for the American people are too important.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all my colleagues--both Democrats and Republicans--reject this. Vote ``no.''  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I want to begin by thanking our colleagues, the gentleman from Massachusetts leading the Rules Committee, and his ranking members as they came from each of the committees, some 50 hours' worth of hearings and markups, including some 16 hours in the Rules Committee to not only talk about and vet, but to understand more clearly what we would be voting on.  Mr.Speaker, today is a bill that is a compromise bill, no doubt about it. I had my own plan and I had my own ideas. I took 2 years to get involved in this process. It is difficult to write a healthcare bill. But it didn't have to be my bill; it had to be a bill that we could all work together on.  President Trump has been a part of that. President Trump took time out of his schedule to do this. It is important to the American people. President Trump, more than any single Member of Congress, gave the message to the American people about what was necessary and what he would do. He is going to live up to that, and we should, too.  Mr.Speaker, the bottom line to this whole thing is we are going to present a Republican plan, and we are going to stand behind what we sell. It is better for the American people. But make no mistake about it: we are transferring power, authority, and responsibility not just to States, but also to the American people. It will be up to them to make determinations about their own health care because, for the first time, we will allow some 50 million Americans to have a tax equity, an opportunity to use tax credits that will be available to families anywhere from $2,000 for an individual to $14,000 for a family.                              {time}  1030  This will empower people who have not found a fair shot at the tax advantages it will give them: small-business owners; the American people; the average worker in this country, including those who work two or three different jobs; as well as those who are uninsured.

11658,topic-id,179,"Mr.Speaker, let's look at the historic timeline. The Reagan administration and other administrations have failed in the past to veto anti-Israel resolutions, and that failure has not been helpful to the cause of peace. Over the last two decades, Israel has frozen or removed settlements in an effort to negotiate peace, all to no avail.  On November 29 of last year, this House unanimously urged our U.Ambassador to veto any U.resolution that sought to impose peace settlement terms. But a month later, our U.Ambassador ignored the input of this House and allowed the U.to adopt a one-sided resolution that sought to impose peace terms on the parties.  Worse yet, that U.resolution equates the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, with outposts deep in the West Bank that are illegal under Israeli law.  Today we consider a House resolution that has over 30 Democratic cosponsors. It is not a pro-settlements resolution. It strongly and repeatedly reaffirms our support for a two-state solution, achieved through direct negotiations, and it objects to a U.resolution that set back the cause of peace. Vote ``yes.''

But where does the money go? $592 billion in tax cuts for the rich. That is where it is going.

Here are the top five reasons why:  Number one, TrumpCare cuts It creates block grants to States that will lead to less care, including forcing seniors out of nursing homes and reducing health care for the poor.  Number two, TrumpCare eliminates healthcare subsidies. In its place, it creates substandard tax cuts that will ensure millions of Americans can no longer afford health insurance.  Number three, TrumpCare favors the rich. It provides a tax giveaway for the rich, while leaving the middle class with less access to care.  Number four, TrumpCare hurts our hospitals. It kicks people off of insurance, guaranteeing hospitals, employer plans, and taxpayers will ultimately foot the bill.  Number five, TrumpCare defunds Planned This will leave millions of women without health care.  In summary, TrumpCare doesn't care, and it won't work.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1544-7.txt,99999999999999,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1628, AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF",2017.0,7.0,February

The opioid epidemic that is happening is something we all have to work together on, but we have hope, as Senator Portman said. I believe we have hope because of communities, because of brave Americans like those he is talking about.  We also have hope because of guys like Rob Portman, and we would be a lot less further along in this country in turning around this epidemic and highlighting it for Americans if it weren't for him. I really want to commend my colleague from He has done such a great job and is so passionate about this issue.                        Tribute to Andrew Kurka  Mr.President, in the last few weeks I have come to the floor to recognize an exceptional Alaskan--someone who spends time giving back to our community by sharing their time and talents up north. There are thousands of these people, of course, in my great State, and I would love to recognize every single one of them. They do so much for all of us.  We Senators are not humble about our I certainly believe my State is the most beautiful place in It is probably the most beautiful place in the world. I ask anyone who is watching to come visit us, you will love it--guaranteed.  It is the people that make my State so special--kind, generous people, full of rugged determination, full of patriotism, full of compassion. Many of them are willing to go the extra mile, literally, in some of the most difficult terrain and extreme conditions of the world to help friends and neighbors and use their strength and skills to inspire us all.  I wish to tell you a little bit about Andrew Kurka, an extraordinary Alaskan from Palmer, which is a beautiful community about 45 miles outside of In his younger years, Andrew was a wrestler. He put his heart into it. For his efforts, he was very successful. He was a six-time Alaska State champion in freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling.  When he was 13, he suffered a spinal cord injury in a four-wheeler accident. His physical therapist urged him to keep going, to keep trying, to stay active, and actually paid for his first skiing lesson with a group called Challenge Alaska, a nonprofit Paralympic sports club.  According to an article in the Alaska Dispatch News, Andrew is ``willing to give just about anything a try--bodybuilding, water-skiing, ultra-marathon, handcycling.'' He even raced in the Arctic Man ski and snow machine race in Alaska--a race that is not for the faint of heart. It is one tough race.  It is in sit skiing where he truly excels. He has been a longtime member of the U.Paralympic team and has won numerous medals. Just last month, he won three medals, including the Gold for the men's downhill race at the World Para Alpine Championships in Italy--the Gold for the whole world.  His accomplishments are amazing enough, but his willingness to serve and be a role model for others is what makes him a true Alaska treasure. He is involved in numerous organizations for great causes, and he travels all across Alaska and the country, visiting with children with medical problems and urging them to dream big the way he has.  ``I have spent my life hoping to be an example to others,'' Andrew said. ``Having the chance and being put in a position where I can make a difference means the world to me.'' That is  For his determination against all odds, for his accomplishments, for his compassion, and for making the United States and Alaska proud last month in Italy at the World Para Alpine Championships, Andrew Kurka is this week's Alaskan of the  Congratulations, Andrew, from all of your supporters.

11639,topic-id,2085,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.1430, the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment  I have serious concerns with this bill that the majority has offered. This bill pretends to improve scientific integrity and transparency while, in reality, they would stop the EPA from doing its critical job, its critical mission of protecting the American people.  Many credible organizations have opposed the HONEST Act, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Union of Concerned Scientists, American Institute of Biological Sciences, American Lung Association, American Public Health Association, the League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Environmental Defense Action  Two others that I include in the Record, the copies that I hold in my hand, in opposition, have been received from the Consortium for Ocean Leadership, and the other from the Environmental Data and Governance                                                    Consortium for                                             Ocean Leadership,                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the Consortium for Ocean      Leadership, which represents our nation's leading ocean      research and technology institutions (from academia,      industry, and aquaria), I am writing to express concern      regarding the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment      (HONEST) Act of 2017 (H.1430). Sound science must underpin      the rulemaking process at all our nation's federal agencies,      the Environmental Protection Agency included. I am concerned      about the practical implications of this bill and what it      means, not only for the rulemaking process, but for the      health, security, and prosperity of our nation and its      citizens. While I ardently support efforts to ensure the      continued use of sound science, I urge you and your      colleagues to consider unintended consequences of this bill      before bringing it to the House floor.       While reproducibility is a fundamental assumption of      science, that should not be conflated with the idea that all      non-reproducible science is incorrect. There are many cases      where reproducibility is simply not possible, but that does      not negate the importance of the conclusions that have been      reached. In 1994, the comet Shoemaker-Levy collided with our      celestial neighbor Jupiter, providing a first-hand look at      cosmic collisions and insight on both the comet and the      planet. The devastating Deepwater Horizon disaster in the      Gulf of Mexico has provided untold insights into everything      ranging from ecosystem responses to oil to impacts on      communities' physical and mental health. Because studies      stemming from these one-time incidents are not reproducible,      it does not mean that their methodology and results are      flawed. Additionally, longitudinal studies, especially in the      public health arena, are often too large and take so much      time (e.g., a study following a cohort for multiple decades)      that they could not realistically be reproduced but are      instead replicated through statistical modeling. Under the      current language of the HONEST Act, similar studies within      EPA's purview would be excluded from the agency's use,      potentially keeping the agency from making a proposal or      disseminating information and limiting the amount of good      science from which the EPA can makes decisions.       The bill also requires scientific and technical information      used to make federal regulations be posted online. While the      language specifies that personally identifiable information      used in these studies be redacted (unlike in the bill's      predecessor, the Secret Science Reform Act), the HONEST Act      goes on to state that personal information could be disclosed      to anyone who signs a confidentiality agreement with the      administrator. If federal regulations are made that impact a      specific industry, the same industry could access the      personal records of those who participated in the study.      Knowing that their personal information could be made      accessible to anyone would likely reduce the number of      willing participants in such a study, again limiting the best      science available to the agency.       Additionally, redacting information from documents is a      costly and time-consuming process that often requires the      work of an entire office. The EPA's limited resources, rather      than being spent fulfilling its mission ``to protect human      health and the environment'' would instead be spent      redacting, potentially hundreds of thousands of documents.      Conversely, the bill does not define who would make this      information publicly available online (and make appropriate      redactions) if the EPA were relying on a published, peer-     reviewed study performed by another entity, such as an      academic research institution. This would potentially impose      unexpected costs on the institution.       Rather than improving the quality of science used by the      agency, this bill would instead limit the amount of ``best      available science'' available for decision-making and would      require significant time and manpower. Such an impact would      threaten the health, not only of our nation, but of our      country's citizens who rely on the EPA to protect their well-     being. The unintended consequences from this bill are myriad,      and the ocean science and technology community stands ready      to help you evaluate them before considering this legislation      on the House floor.           Respectfully,     Jonathan White, RADM (Ret.), USN,       President and CEO, Consortium for Ocean                                  ____                                                Environmental Data                                      & Governance Initiative,                                                   March 27, 2017.       Dear Representative: The Environmental Data & Governance      Initiative (EDGI) has analyzed the potential effects of the      Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017 (H.     1430) and determined that the bill would obstruct the EPA's      use of scientific studies in essential agency work. EDGI is      an organization comprised of non-profit employees and      academics that promotes open and accessible government data      and information along with evidence-based policy making. As      researchers invested in robust environmental data governance,      EDGI members are concerned that this legislation would force      the EPA to make determinations without certain categories of      crucial evidence-based research it needs to make the best      decisions for the health and welfare of the public and the      environment.       H.1430 is just the latest iteration of the proposed      Secret Science Reform Acts of 2014 and 2015. These bills      would have prevented the EPA from relying on a large number      of validated and pivotal scientific studies in its decision-     making processes. Similarly, in its words, H.1430 would      ``prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from      proposing, finalizing, or disseminating regulations or      assessments based upon science that is not transparent or      reproducible.'' Proponents claim that H.1430 would improve      transparency in scientific decision-making and public data      accessibility, efforts that EDGI supports. However, as EDGI's      analysis shows, H.1430 instead places important validated      science off limits to the       The data access requirements in H.1430 would obstruct      public protections critical to human safety and health. Any      studies that utilize confidential medical records--including      many human health studies--would be nearly impossible for the      EPA to use because personally identifiable medical data      cannot be released to the general public. For instance, the      EPA would not be able to use epidemiological studies that are      critical for linking exposure to toxics with certain types of      diseases in the creation of standards that ensure our safe      drinking water and healthy air.[[Page H2543]]       Additionally, the proposed legislation would bar studies      that cannot be reproduced from use by the Blocking the      EPA from using studies that are hard to reproduce impedes the      EPA's ability to protect the public from future health      hazards. Some of the nation's best evidence of public health      risks comes from long-term analyses, assessments of chronic      effects of exposure to toxic substances, studies based on      natural and human-caused catastrophes, and other studies that      we cannot reproduce.       Specific examples of current protections and programs that      would have been difficult, if not impossible, for the EPA to      issue had H.1430 been in place include:       Standards that protect children from lead-based paint      hazards in their homes and schools. The EPA creates standards      that protect children from the adverse neurological effects      of exposure to lead in paint, dust, and soil. The agency      bases these lead protections on long-term studies of children      who have suffered lead exposure in the past. Because EPA      regulations have effectively reduced lead exposure in      children, reproducing these long-term epidemiological studies      would be nearly impossible, as the cohort of study subjects      no longer exists. Prohibiting the EPA from using historical      reports like these would make continuing regulation of lead      much harder.       Safeguards that protect people from exposure to radioactive      contaminants in drinking water. The EPA's standards for the      permissible quantity of certain radionuclides, such as      uranium, found in drinking water are based on data from      radiation exposure studies that use confidential patient      information from a cohort of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic      bomb survivors, which could not be used under this bill.      Long-term epidemiological studies conducted on this cohort      are also unreproducible, rendering these studies, and others      like them, nearly impossible for the EPA to use under H.     1430's provisions.       Measures that improve safety at industrial facilities and      protect and assist first responders and emergency authorities      during accidents. The EPA improved its risk management      regulations following several catastrophic events involving      chemical plants, including an explosion at the West      Fertilizer Company facility in Texas that killed 14 people,      ten of them first responders. The studies that result from      chemical explosions like these cannot be reproduced and would      not be available for the EPA's use under H.1430,      preventing the agency from properly protecting first      responders and the public from future chemical disasters.       Plans that ensure best practices in cleaning up major oil      spills and other hazardous waste spills that affect wildlife      health and habitats. After the Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran      aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989,      the EPA developed a restoration program to clean up the 11      million gallons of oil that had spilled into the Sound and      affected over 1,000 miles of shoreline. This cleanup program      would have been impossible without field studies of Prince      William Sound and other historical oil spills. Given the      large scale of these catastrophic spills, these studies      cannot be reproduced and thus would be barred from use by the      EPA by H.1430.       The EPA would be hampered from implementing these vital      protections and programs under H.1430. While the bill      contains a provision that pretends to skirt some of these      legal obstacles by only divulging protected materials to      people who sign confidentiality agreements, this provision is      illusory because medical data, trade secrets, and other      privacy-protected data cannot be released to the general      public, regardless of whether they sign a confidentiality      agreement. The EPA cannot issue confidentiality agreements on      behalf of third party researchers, so H.1430 would inhibit      the EPA's ability to use many important scientific studies      despite this confidentiality agreement provision.       Further, H.1430 limits the EPA to spending only $1      million a year to comply with these new requirements, yet the      CBO estimated that past versions of this legislation would      have cost the EPA up to $250 million annually to implement      the data access provisions required in the bill. The added      obligations specified in this legislation, coupled with a      lack of adequate funding to implement the law, would prevent      the EPA from fulfilling its hazard prevention and      environmental safety protection responsibilities.       Agencies tasked with protecting human health must be able      to rely on all available scientific data. Currently, the EPA      goes to great lengths to ensure that all of the data it      relies on is thoroughly reviewed and accessible. The EPA uses      several processes to ensure quality and relevance of data,      such as internal and external peer review and review by      scientific advisory boards.       When the EPA is prohibited from utilizing the most optimal      data, it puts the health and safety of citizens at risk.      Protecting safe drinking water and healthy air depends on the      EPA's ability to incorporate the best available evidence from      all scientific fields of study into its risk assessments and      regulation drafting processes. EDGI's analysis and research      shows that the passage of H.1430 would block the EPA from      using the data it needs to fulfill its mission of protecting      public health and the environment.

Twenty-four separate Federal agencies have developed scientific integrity policies to date. This legislation would also codify and strengthen these policies within a common framework.

11743,topic-id,618,"Mr.President, President Trump made bold claims about his intention to ``drain the swamp.'' But here we are, debating a measure that would do the exact opposite. The Senate is actually voting to kill an anticorruption regulation.  This regulation was the result of bipartisan effort led by Senator Dick Senator Lugar was my mentor when I first joined the He helped me better understand the role and traditions of this body; and he showed me what it meant to be a statesmen.  Senator Lugar was one of the most thoughtful foreign policy experts to serve in the He chaired the Foreign Relations Committee, and he was deeply respected on both sides of the aisle.  He understood the ``resource curse.'' How developing countries with billions of dollars in oil, gas, or other valuable minerals often had the worst poverty, how the governments of these countries made deals with huge corporations to sell their resources, but the citizens of those countries never saw the benefits. Instead, corrupt leaders would enrich themselves, rather than use the funds to pay for healthcare, education, infrastructure, or housing.  Senator Lugar, with Senator Cardin, developed legislation to address the resource curse, to bring transparency to an opaque system. The result was section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank It directed the SEC to issue a rule requiring all oil, gas, and mineral companies listed on U.stock exchanges to disclose the payments they make to foreign governments.  This allows the citizens of those countries to hold their leaders accountable. It shines a light on corruption. And when citizens can demand that this money is used for their benefit, it reduces their need for foreign aid.  Opponents of this rule claimed it would put American companies at a disadvantage. In fact, it made the U.a leader. Other countries followed suit and passed similar requirements.  The Cardin-Lugar rule became the global standard for transparency. Today, 80 percent of the world's largest publicly listed oil, gas and mining companies--including state-owned companies from Russia, China, and Brazil--are subject to disclosure rules.  This resolution of disapproval is just one of many misguided efforts by Republicans to use the Congressional Review Act to kill regulations that protect the most vulnerable.  The CRA was enacted in 1996 as part of the radical deregulatory and anticonsumer actions by shepherded by Newt Before now, the CRA has successfully been used to overturn only one rule.  There is a reason it has only been successfully used once. The CRA is a blunt weapon. It is a poorly written law that comes with unintended consequences. The CRA allows Congress to strike down a rule in its entirety with only an hour of floor debate in the House and without the ability to filibuster it in the  This flawed process can undo years of careful work by stakeholders and Federal agencies. Work done through an open, thoughtful rulemaking process. The Cardin-Lugar rule took years to finalize. Republicans want to kill it in a day.  And let's be clear--it does kill the regulation. Earlier today, Leader McConnell mischaracterized this effort. He said, ``Let's send the SEC back to the drawing board to promote transparency.''  But that is not what the CRA does. It doesn't send the agency ``back to the drawing board.'' What it does do is prohibit the agency from issuing another regulation that is ``substantially the same,'' unless Congress specifically authorizes the agency to do so through subsequent legislation.  The courts have not yet determined how different a new regulation must be so that is not ``substantially the same.'' This discourages an agency from issuing a new similar regulation once a rule has been blocked.  This is not going back to the drawing board. This is going back to corruption.

I am especially concerned that the American Health Care Act will jeopardize the health care coverage of the over 429,000 Hoosiers currently enrolled in Indiana's expansion of Medicaid, also known as the Healthy Indiana  Further, I believe it is especially disingenuous that if this bill passes today, this institution will have pushed the financial cuts to programs like the Healthy Indiana Plan conveniently until after the next congressional election.  The Act before us also would negatively impact the health of millions of women and men who receive the medical services provided by Planned Additionally, it would not improve the well-being of our nation's elderly by allowing providers to charge older enrollees up to five times as much as younger individuals.  Finally, I would note with great concern that a provision was just added to the American Health Care Act today that would remove the requirement that insurers cover life-saving, essential health benefits, including maternal and pediatric services, rehabilitative therapy, and mental health and substance abuse treatment.  Congress should work to improve the Affordable Care Act and address important health concerns facing ordinary Americans, such as the rising cost of prescription drugs. But today's bill does no such thing.  It is unacceptable and I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.  ",CREC-2017-03-24-pt1-PgH2374-7.txt,1188,A.M. TOMORROW,2017.0,24.0,January
11747,topic-id,766,"Mr.President, for the first time in more than a decade, the Republican Party controls the House, the Senate, and the White This week they are starting to roll out their legislative agenda.  So now that they have complete control of the agenda, what do the Republicans have in store? Something to bump up wages for working families or something to create more jobs? Something to tackle the student debt crisis? Maybe something to deal with all the jobs that get shipped overseas? No, one of the Republican Party's first orders of business is a giveaway to ExxonMobil that will help corrupt and repressive foreign regimes and make it easier to funnel money to terrorists around the world.  Here is the problem. Big corporations like Exxon--or other oil, gas, and mining companies--often pay millions of dollars to foreign governments to access natural resources located in these countries. Many of these foreign regimes are corrupt, and Exxon's massive payouts regularly end up in the pockets of government officials rather than in the hands of the people. These corrupt officials get filthy rich while their citizens face punishing poverty and dangerous working conditions. Worse still, some of these undisclosed payments can end up financing terrorists.  Just over 6 years ago, Congress passed a bipartisan provision to help tackle this problem. With the strong support of Senator Dick Lugar, the leading Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Congress required oil, gas, and mining companies to disclose any payments they make to governments to extract natural resources. Republicans and Democrats agreed that shining a light on these payments would help combat corruption and terrorism around the globe and help citizens in some of the very poorest nations in the world hold their own governments accountable.  Disclosing these foreign payments also helps investors right here in the United States so they can make more informed investment decisions. Some investors may want to stay away from companies that could face expensive lawsuits for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws. Other investors, quite frankly, may just prefer not to invest in companies that could be helping prop up corrupt foreign governments or indirectly financing terrorism.  Congress directed the Securities and Exchange Commission to write the rule, and the SEC spent years soliciting input from investors, from human rights advocates, from anti-corruption experts, and from oil, gas, and mining companies. The agency ultimately issued a ruling last year, and it[[Page S649]]worked. The rule gained the support of faith groups, human rights groups, development organizations, and anti-corruption advocates all around the world. The rule also earned the support of investors who collectively controlled more than $10 trillion in assets, and--we should really be proud--it set an international standard, with the European Union, Canada, and other countries adopting similar standards for companies in their own countries.  But it didn't go down well with everyone. A handful of powerful oil and gas companies have been after this requirement from the start, and Exxon has been leading the pack on this. In fact, Rex Tillerson, the CEO of Exxon at the time, personally lobbied against the requirement back in 2010. His reason? What was his objection? The foreign payments rule would undermine Exxon's ability to do business in Listen to that again. If Exxon has to tell the world about the millions of dollars it hands over to the Russian Government, Exxon wouldn't be able to do as much business in So now the Republican Congress wants to rush in to help out poor Exxon so they can keep the secret money flowing to these Russian officials.  This Exxon giveaway shows just how bankrupt the Republican agenda is. They don't have any ideas for helping working families. It is just one corporate giveaway after another--making their big business donors happy and keeping the campaign contributions flowing for the next election. But the economic lives of our working families, our moral leadership in the world, the safety of our financial system, and the water we drink and the air we breathe--all of those--are just afterthoughts to the corporate wish list.  If you are a corrupt foreign dictator, Republicans rolling back the rules is great for you. If you are an oil company executive, Republicans rolling back the rules is great for you. But if you are anyone else, you should be outraged that the Republican Congress is so willing to throw you under the bus to please these groups.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote against this resolution.  I yield the floor.

Instead, this bill does not move forward. It goes back.  Number one, 24 million Americans will lose their health care.  Number two, Americans who have been living a life of toil and effort all of their lives from the ages of 50 to 64--at a time when they need health care the most--are in danger of losing it with the excessive tax that is being imposed on them by this bill.  Number three, our community hospitals, from the prairies of Nebraska to the hills of Vermont, those are critical institutions providing care. They have gone from red ink to black ink as a result of the Affordable Care Every single one of those is in jeopardy, and that is going to deprive our citizens in those communities of access to affordable health care.

11685,topic-id,385,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time, and I thank our chair of the committee and our ranking member.  I am here to stand with The question of the best way to do that is one of legitimate debate. It is a debate that we are having here in the It is a debate that the folks in Israel are having there. There is no question that the resolution before us is not the one that everyone would have written, or the one that was before the U.was the one everyone would have written. There is no question that there is fault on the side of the Palestinians with respect to coming to the table for peace.  But here is the question that is starting to really make an impact on the possibility of achieving the two-state solution that both sides by and large believe is essential, and that is something that is within the control of the Israeli Government: Will it continue to intensify the support for settlements in the West Bank? If it does, as it has been, there are 600,000 settlers now between the West Bank and east If it continues to do that, it makes as a practical matter it virtually impossible the land-for-peace swap that we know is essential to get to a two-state solution. That is the practical challenge that we have.  We are all friends of All of us here believe in a Jewish state and a democratic state.  The second issue of major concern that is discussed in Israel as well as here is the fact that demographics are going to catch up and cause a real crisis in Israel to maintain that Jewish identity and that democratic tradition. There are 4.5 million Arabs who live between the West Bank and in Israel proper. There are 6.5 million Jewish citizens. If there is not some resolution, at some point a decision has to be made to maintain the Jewish character at the expense of democratic ideals or compromise democratic ideals in order to maintain that Jewish identity.  The Israeli State has a proud, strong tradition of being democratic, of being reliable, of standing up for civil and human rights. Many there, and some of us here, believe settlements are an impediment to that tradition.

11490,topic-id,1012,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate all the hard work the Rules Committee chairman has done in this bill. Mr.Speaker, I have the great pleasure of serving on the Rules Committee, but I am the designee to the Budget  This whole process that we are going through is a Budget Committee process. It is called reconciliation. And as folks have talked about it, they have talked about what the Ways and Means Committee has done and what the Energy and Commerce Committee did. But then those two bills come together in the Budget Committee, and we move the process forward.  I can't help but notice my colleagues' frustration with the amendments that have been made to this bill along the way. Generally, we celebrate amendments that are made along the way because they improve the work product. We do them together.  I point here, Mr.Speaker, to a tweet that the President sent out the day the healthcare bill was introduced. The President said:  ``Our wonderful new HealthCare Bill is now out for review and negotiation.''  And that was true. It was out for review so everyone could read it, and it was out for negotiation so that everyone could improve it.  We did that in the Budget We had four motions to instruct that passed in the Budget Committee to provide Medicaid flexibility, to make sure the tax credits were targeted to the right populations, to ensure that able-bodied, working Americans had those incentives to both get health care and be able to go back to work.  Now, every committee didn't have that experience. As my colleagues have asked for a bipartisan process, you will remember that the Energy and Commerce Committee spent 10 hours debating the title of the bill. They spent 10 hours debating Democratic amendments to change the title of the bill. Folks, we have opportunity after opportunity to make things better, but it is incumbent upon us to choose that opportunity to make things better.  So often we get wrapped around the partisan action. Folks let that opportunity slip away. I am glad that we didn't do that.  Mr.Speaker, when I talk about what we did in the Budget Committee to make it better, I am talking about focusing on the real problems. There is not a member in this body that doesn't understand that what is contributing to the ObamaCare death spiral is that young people are not enrolling. Young people are not enrolling.  More Americans rejected ObamaCare and filed for an exemption or agreed to pay the penalty than enrolled in I don't care how big your heart was when you passed the bill, you have to concede that wasn't what you intended. And we can do better.[[Page H2382]]  My friends are talking about the essential health benefits plan today. Young people are particularly sensitive to that. They are price sensitive in that way. We are talking in the Budget Committee about how to preserve that flexibility for States to design plans that are right for them.  How many times today have we heard folks say that prices are going to increase for Americans between the age of 54 and 64?  I have heard it at least a dozen times. At the same time, my friends are demanding that every healthcare plan in the State of Georgia cover maternity benefits for those women between the age of 54 and 64. At the same time, my friends are demanding that every plan in Georgia cover pediatric benefits for those empty nesters between 54 and 64. That doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. We in Georgia know it doesn't make sense, and we can do better.  Mr.Speaker, 45 percent of the almost 20 million people who rejected the Affordable Care Act and agreed to pay the fine or file an exemption instead were under the age of 35. There is not a serious thinker in this room who believes we can solve the insurance crisis in this country without getting these folks back into the marketplace. And that is what we did in the Budget That is what we have done throughout this entire amendment process, and that is what the amendments we considered in the Rules Committee this morning did as well.  Mr.Speaker, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, many States have had to pass a lot of legislation in order to conform their plans to new one-size-fits-all Federal mandates. But that is not the story. The story is that, at the same time, States were passing their own benefit mandates to serve their constituency better.  Mr.Speaker, Chairman Session's State of Texas passed a mandate that orally administered anticancer medication be covered. The gentleman from Texas has seen those groups in his office. He has seen those families struggling. And what Texas said is: To respond to our people, we are going to require every plan sold in the State of Texas cover these issues.  In my home State, Mr.Speaker, we created a commission to look at annually how to add more benefits, change those benefits, make sure we are being responsive to folks in the best way that we can.  The gentleman from Colorado, his State did the very same thing. They required coverage for acupuncture services. They required the selling of child-only plans. They required coverage for fetal alcohol syndrome. We do these things collaboratively, and we do these things together.  Mr.Speaker, I urge passage of the rule and passage of the underlying legislation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I notice the gentleman from Georgia relied on a tweet from Donald Trump for his facts in explaining the bill. I might suggest a more scholarly source, maybe, like, beginning with the Congressional Budget Office, which says that 24 million people will lose their health coverage as a result of the bill.  I will also point to the Quinnipiac poll that says only 17 percent of the American people approve of what my Republicans friends are doing. Seventeen percent is lower than Trump's rating. That is quite an accomplishment.

11671,topic-id,9646,"I thank my colleague.  Mr.Speaker, as a strong supporter of a two-state solution, as a Jewish Member of Congress and as someone who has been to Israel and has seen the settlements firsthand, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution.  Settlements are an impediment to peace between Israelis and This resolution only provides ammunition to those who oppose a two-state solution--the approach that is our only hope for lasting peace. We all agree that the incitement of violence and terrorism must end, which U.Security Council Resolution 2334 discusses. But as Secretary Kerry so eloquently stated in his speech on December 28:       Some seem to believe that the U.S.' friendship means the      U.must accept any policy regardless of our own interests,      our own positions, our own words, our own principles--even      after urging again and again that the policy must change.      Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and      friendships require mutual respect.                              {time}  1815  Well, my friends, Israel must end settlement expansion, close their outposts, and get to the negotiating table. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not treated the Obama administration with respect, and this resolution does not offer the American people the honest, true debate we should be having about this critically important issue.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the Obama administration, especially Secretary of State Kerry, for their dedication in trying to find a path forward for a two-state solution. It is my hope that the principles laid out in Secretary Kerry's December 28, 2016 speech will help guide serious negotiations in the days ahead. To ensure that his remarks are a part of this debate, I will now read his entire statement.  Secretary Kerry said: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. Thank you. (Coughs.) Excuse me. Thank you for your patience, all of you. For those of you who celebrated Christmas, I hope you had a wonderful Happy And to everybody here, I know it's the middle of a holiday week. I understand. (Laughter.) But I wish you all a very, very productive and Happy New  Today, I want to share candid thoughts about an issue which for decades has animated the foreign policy dialogue here and around the world--the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Throughout his Administration, President Obama has been deeply committed to Israel and its security, and that commitment has guided his pursuit of peace in the Middle This is an issue which, all of you know, I have worked on intensively during my time as Secretary of State for one simple reason: because the two-state solution is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and It is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors. It is the only way to ensure a future of freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people. And it is an important way of advancing United States interests in the region.  Now, I'd like to explain why that future is now in jeopardy, and provide some context for why we could not, in good conscience, stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace.  I'm also here to share my conviction that there is still a way forward if the responsible parties are willing to act. And I want to share practical suggestions for how to preserve and advance the prospects for the just and lasting peace that both sides deserve.  So it is vital that we have an honest, clear-eyed conversation about the uncomfortable truths and difficult choices, because the alternative that is fast becoming the reality on the ground is in nobody's interest--not the Israelis, not the Palestinians, not the region--and not the United  Now, I want to stress that there is an important point here: My job, above all, is to defend the United States of America--to stand up for and defend our values and our interests in the world. And if we were to stand idly by and know that in doing so we are allowing a dangerous dynamic to take hold which promises greater conflict and instability to a region in which we have vital interests, we would be derelict in our own responsibilities.  Regrettably, some seem to believe that the U.friendship means the U.must accept any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own positions, our own words, our own principles--even after urging again and again that the policy must change. Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect.  Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations, who does not support a two-state solution, said after the vote last week, quote, ``It was to be expected that Israel's greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share,'' and veto this resolution. I am compelled to respond today that the[[Page H155]]United States did, in fact, vote in accordance with our values, just as previous U.administrations have done at the Security Council before us.  They fail to recognize that this friend, the United States of America, that has done more to support Israel than any other country, this friend that has blocked countless efforts to delegitimize Israel, cannot be true to our own values--or even the stated democratic values of Israel--and we cannot properly defend and protect Israel if we allow a viable two-state solution to be destroyed before our own eyes.  And that's the bottom line: the vote in the United Nations was about preserving the two-state solution. That's what we were standing up for: Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living side by side in peace and security with its neighbors. That's what we are trying to preserve for our sake and for theirs.  In fact, this Administration has been Israel's greatest friend and supporter, with an absolutely unwavering commitment to advancing Israel's security and protecting its legitimacy.  On this point, I want to be very clear: No American administration has done more for Israel's security than Barack Obama's. The Israeli prime minister himself has noted our, quote, ``unprecedented'' military and intelligence cooperation. Our military exercises are more advanced than ever. Our assistance for Iron Dome has saved countless Israeli lives. We have consistently supported Israel's right to defend itself, by itself, including during actions in Gaza that sparked great controversy.  Time and again we have demonstrated that we have Israel's back. We have strongly opposed boycotts, divestment campaigns, and sanctions targeting Israel in international fora, whenever and wherever its legitimacy was attacked, and we have fought for its inclusion across the UN system. In the midst of our own financial crisis and budget deficits, we repeatedly increased funding to support In fact, more than one-half of our entire global Foreign Military Financing goes to And this fall, we concluded an historic $38 billion memorandum of understanding that exceeds any military assistance package the United States has provided to any country, at any time, and that will invest in cutting-edge missile defense and sustain Israel's qualitative military edge for years to come. That's the measure of our support.  This commitment to Israel's security is actually very personal for me. On my first trip to Israel as a young senator in 1986, I was captivated by a special country, one that I immediately admired and soon grew to love. Over the years, like so many others who are drawn to this extraordinary place, I have climbed Masada, swum in the Dead Sea, driven from one Biblical city to another. I've also seen the dark side of Hizballah's rocket storage facilities just across the border in Lebanon, walked through exhibits of the hell of the Holocaust at Yad Vashem, stood on the Golan Heights, and piloted an Israeli jet over the tiny airspace of Israel, which would make anyone understand the importance of security to Out of those experiences came a steadfast commitment to Israel's security that has never wavered for a single minute in my 28 years in the Senate or my four years as  I have also often visited West Bank communities, where I met Palestinians struggling for basic freedom and dignity amidst the occupation, passed by military checkpoints that can make even the most routine daily trips to work or school an ordeal, and heard from business leaders who could not get the permits that they needed to get their products to the market and families who have struggled to secure permission just to travel for needed medical care.  And I have witnessed firsthand the ravages of a conflict that has gone on for far too long. I've seen Israeli children in Sderot whose playgrounds had been hit by Katyusha rockets. I've visited shelters next to schools in Kiryat Shmona that kids had 15 seconds to get to after a warning siren went off. I've also seen the devastation of war in the Gaza Strip, where Palestinian girls in Izbet Abed Rabo played in the rubble of a bombed-out building.  No children--Israeli or Palestinian--should have to live like that.  So, despite the obvious difficulties that I understood when I became Secretary of State, I knew that I had to do everything in my power to help end this conflict. And I was grateful to be working for President Obama, who was prepared to take risks for peace and was deeply committed to that effort.  Like previous U.administrations, we have committed our influence and our resources to trying to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict because, yes, it would serve American interests to stabilize a volatile region and fulfill America's commitment to the survival, security and well-being of an Israel at peace with its Arab neighbors.  Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state solution is now in serious jeopardy.  The truth is that trends on the ground--violence, terrorism, incitement, settlement expansion and the seemingly endless occupation--they are combining to destroy hopes for peace on both sides and increasingly cementing an irreversible one-state reality that most people do not actually want.  Today, there are a number--there are a similar number of Jews and Palestinians living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean They have a choice. They can choose to live together in one state, or they can separate into two states. But here is a fundamental reality: if the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic--it cannot be both--and it won't ever really be at peace. Moreover, the Palestinians will never fully realize their vast potential in a homeland of their own with a one-state solution.  Now, most on both sides understand this basic choice, and that is why it is important that polls of Israelis and Palestinians show that there is still strong support for the two-state solution--in theory. They just don't believe that it can happen.  After decades of conflict, many no longer see the other side as people, only as threats and enemies. Both sides continue to push a narrative that plays to people's fears and reinforces the worst stereotypes rather than working to change perceptions and build up belief in the possibility of peace.  And the truth is the extraordinary polarization in this conflict extends beyond Israelis and Allies of both sides are content to reinforce this with an us or--``you're with us or against us'' mentality where too often anyone who questions Palestinian actions is an apologist for the occupation and anyone who disagrees with Israel policy is cast as anti-Israel or even anti- That's one of the most striking realties about the current situation: This critical decision about the future--one state or two states--is effectively being made on the ground every single day, despite the expressed opinion of the majority of the people.  The status quo is leading towards one state and perpetual occupation, but most of the public either ignores it or has given up hope that anything can be done to change it. And with this passive resignation, the problem only gets worse, the risks get greater and the choices are narrowed.  This sense of hopelessness among Israelis is exacerbated by the continuing violence, terrorist attacks against civilians and incitement, which are destroying belief in the possibility of peace.  Let me say it again: There is absolutely no justification for terrorism, and there never will be.  And the most recent wave of Palestinian violence has included hundreds of terrorist attacks in the past year, including stabbings, shootings, vehicular attacks and bombings, many by individuals who have been radicalized by social media. Yet the murderers of innocents are still glorified on Fatah websites, including showing attackers next to Palestinian leaders following attacks. And despite statements by President Abbas and his party's leaders making clear their opposition to violence, too often they send a different message by failing to condemn specific terrorist attacks and naming public squares, streets and schools after terrorists.  President Obama and I have made it clear to the Palestinian leadership countless times, publicly and privately, that all incitement to violence must stop. We have consistently condemned violence and terrorism, and even condemned the Palestinian leadership for not condemning it.  Far too often, the Palestinians have pursued efforts to delegitimize Israel in international fora. We have strongly opposed these initiatives, including the recent wholly unbalanced and inflammatory UNESCO resolution regarding And we have made clear our strong opposition to Palestinian efforts against Israel at the ICC, which only sets back the prospects for peace.  And we all understand that the Palestinian Authority has a lot more to do to strengthen its institutions and improve governance.  Most troubling of all, Hamas continues to pursue an extremist agenda: they refuse to accept Israel's very right to exist. They have a one-state vision of their own: all of the land is Hamas and other radical factions are responsible for the most explicit forms of incitement to violence, and many of the images that they use are truly appalling. And they are willing to kill innocents in Israel and put the people of Gaza at risk in order to advance that agenda.  Compounding this, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, exacerbated by the closings of the crossings, is dire. Gaza is home to one of the world's densest concentrations of people enduring extreme hardships with few opportunities. 1.3 million people out of Gaza's population of 1.8 million are in need of daily assistance--food and shelter. Most have electricity less than half the time and only 5 percent of the water is safe to drink. And yet despite the urgency of these needs, Hamas and other militant groups continue to re-arm and divert reconstruction materials to build tunnels, threatening more attacks on Israeli civilians that no government can tolerate.[[Page H156]]  Now, at the same time, we have to be clear about what is happening in the West The Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state solution, but his current coalition is the most right wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements. The result is that policies of this government, which the prime minister himself just described as ``more committed to settlements than any in Israel's history,'' are leading in the opposite direction. They're leading towards one state. In fact, Israel has increasingly consolidated control over much of the West Bank for its own purposes, effectively reversing the transitions to greater Palestinian civil authority that were called for by the Oslo  I don't think most people in Israel, and certainly in the world, have any idea how broad and systematic the process has become. But the facts speak for themselves. The number of settlers in the roughly 130 Israeli settlements east of the 1967 lines has steadily grown. The settler population in the West Bank alone, not including East Jerusalem, has increased by nearly 270,000 since Oslo, including 100,000 just since 2009, when President Obama's term began.  There's no point in pretending that these are just in large settlement blocks. Nearly 90,000 settlers are living east of the separation barrier that was created by Israel itself in the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be the future Palestinian state. And the population of these distant settlements has grown by 20,000 just since 2009. In fact, just recently the government approved a significant new settlement well east of the barrier, closer to Jordan than to What does that say to Palestinians in particular--but also to the United States and the world--about Israel's intentions?  Let me emphasize, this is not to say that the settlements are the whole or even the primary cause of this conflict. Of course they are not. Nor can you say that if the settlements were suddenly removed, you'd have peace. Without a broader agreement, you would not. And we understand that in a final status agreement, certain settlements would become part of Israel to account for the changes that have taken place over the last 49 years--we understand that--including the new democratic demographic realities that exist on the ground. They would have to be factored in. But if more and more settlers are moving into the middle of Palestinian areas, it's going to be just that much harder to separate, that much harder to imagine transferring sovereignty, and that is exactly the outcome that some are purposefully accelerating.  Let's be clear: Settlement expansion has nothing to do with Israel's security. Many settlements actually increase the security burden on the Israeli Defense And leaders of the settler movement are motivated by ideological imperatives that entirely ignore legitimate Palestinian aspirations.  Among the most troubling illustrations of this point has been the proliferation of settler outposts that are illegal under Israel's own laws. They're often located on private Palestinian land and strategically placed in locations that make two states impossible. There are over 100 of these outposts. And since 2011, nearly one-third of them have been or are being legalized, despite pledges by past Israeli governments to dismantle many of them.  Now leaders of the settler movement have advanced unprecedented new legislation that would legalize most of those outposts. For the first time, it would apply Israeli domestic law to the West Bank rather than military law, which is a major step towards the process of annexation. When the law passed the first reading in the Israeli parliament, in the Knesset, one of the chief proponents said proudly--and I quote--``Today, the Israeli Knesset moved from heading towards establishing a Palestinian state towards Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.'' Even the Israeli attorney general has said that the draft law is unconstitutional and a violation of international law.  Now, you may hear from advocates that the settlements are not an obstacle to peace because the settlers who don't want to leave can just stay in Palestine, like the Arab Israelis who live in But that misses a critical point, my friends. The Arab Israelis are citizens of Israel, subject to Israel's law. Does anyone here really believe that the settlers will agree to submit to Palestinian law in Palestine?  Likewise, some supporters of the settlements argue that the settlers could just stay in their settlements and remain as Israeli citizens in their separate enclaves in the middle of Palestine, protected by the Well, there are over 80 settlements east of the separation barrier, many located in places that would make a continuous--a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. Does anyone seriously think that if they just stay where they are you could still have a viable Palestinian state?  Now, some have asked, ``Why can't we build in the blocs which everyone knows will eventually be part of Israel?'' Well, the reason building there or anywhere else in the West Bank now results in such pushback is that the decision of what constitutes a bloc is being made unilaterally by the Israeli Government, without consultation, without the consent of the Palestinians, and without granting the Palestinians a reciprocal right to build in what will be, by most accounts, part of Bottom line--without agreement or mutuality, the unilateral choices become a major point of contention, and that is part of why we are here where we are.  You may hear that these remote settlements aren't a problem because they only take up a very small percentage of the land. Well, again and again we have made it clear, it's not just a question of the overall amount of land available in the West It's whether the land can be connected or it's broken up into small parcels, like a Swiss cheese, that could never constitute a real state. The more outposts that are built, the more the settlements expand, the less possible it is to create a contiguous state. So in the end, a settlement is not just the land that it's on, it's also what the location does to the movement of people, what it does to the ability of a road to connect people, one community to another, what it does to the sense of statehood that is chipped away with each new construction. No one thinking seriously about peace can ignore the reality of what the settlements pose to that peace.  But the problem, obviously, goes well beyond settlements. Trends indicate a comprehensive effort to take the West Bank land for Israel and prevent any Palestinian development there. Today, the 60 percent of the West Bank known as Area C--much of which was supposed to be transferred to Palestinian control long ago under the Oslo Accords--much of it is effectively off limits to Palestinian development. Most today has essentially been taken for exclusive use by Israel simply by unilaterally designating it as ``state land'' or including it within the jurisdiction of regional settlement councils. Israeli farms flourish in the Jordan River Valley, and Israeli resorts line the shores of the Dead Sea--a lot of people don't realize this--they line the shore of the Dead Sea, where Palestinian development is not allowed. In fact, almost no private Palestinian building is approved in Area C at all. Only one permit was issued by Israel in all of 2014 and 2015, while approvals for hundreds of settlement units were advanced during that same period.  Moreover, Palestinian structures in Area C that do not have a permit from the Israeli military are potentially subject to demolition. And they are currently being demolished at an historically high rate. Over 1,300 Palestinians, including over 600 children, have been displaced by demolitions in 2016 alone--more than any previous year.  So the settler agenda is defining the future of And their stated purpose is clear. They believe in one state: greater In fact, one prominent minister, who heads a pro-settler party, declared just after the U.election--and I quote--``the era of the two-state solution is over,'' end quote. And many other coalition ministers publicly reject a Palestinian state. And they are increasingly getting their way, with plans for hundreds of new units in East Jerusalem recently announced and talk of a major new settlement building effort in the West Bank to follow.  So why are we so concerned? Why does this matter? Well, ask yourself these questions: What happens if that agenda succeeds? Where does that lead?  There are currently about 2.75 million Palestinians living under military occupation in the West Bank, most of them in Areas A and B--40 percent of the West Bank--where they have limited autonomy. They are restricted in their daily movements by a web of checkpoints and unable to travel into or out of the West Bank without a permit from the  So if there is only one state, you would have millions of Palestinians permanently living in segregated enclaves in the middle of the West Bank, with no real political rights, separate legal, education, and transportation systems, vast income disparities, under a permanent military occupation that deprives them of the most basic freedoms. Separate and unequal is what you would have. And nobody can explain how that works. Would an Israeli accept living that way? Would an American accept living that way? Will the world accept it?  If the occupation becomes permanent, over the time the Palestinian Authority could simply dissolve, turn over all the administrative and security responsibilities to the What would happen then? Who would administer the schools and hospitals and on what basis? Does Israel want to pay for the billions of dollars of lost international assistance that the Palestinian Authority now receives? Would the Israel Defense Force police the streets of every single Palestinian city and town?  How would Israel respond to a growing civil rights movement from Palestinians, demanding a right to vote, or widespread protests and unrest across the West Bank? How does Israel reconcile a permanent occupation with[[Page H157]]its democratic ideals? How does the U.continue to defend that and still live up to our own democratic ideals?  Nobody has ever provided good answers to those questions because there aren't any. And there would be an increasing risk of more intense violence between Palestinians and settlers, and complete despair among Palestinians that would create very fertile ground for extremists.  With all the external threats that Israel faces today, which we are very cognizant of and working with them to deal with, does it really want an intensifying conflict in the West Bank? How does that help Israel's security? How does that help the region?  The answer is it doesn't, which is precisely why so many senior Israeli military and intelligence leaders, past and present, believe the two-state solution is the only real answer for Israel's long term security.  Now, one thing we do know: if Israel goes down the one state path, it will never have true peace with the rest of the Arab world, and I can say that with certainty. The Arab countries have made clear that they will not make peace with Israel without resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That's not where their loyalties lie. That's not where their politics are.  But there is something new here. Common interests in countering Iran's destabilizing activities, and fighting extremists, as well as diversifying their economies have created real possibilities for something different if Israel takes advantage of the opportunities for peace. I have spent a great deal of time with key Arab leaders exploring this, and there is no doubt that they are prepared to have a fundamentally different relationship with That was stated in the Arab Peace Initiative, years ago. And in all my recent conversations, Arab leaders have confirmed their readiness, in the context of Israeli-Palestinian peace, not just to normalize relations but to work openly on securing that peace with significant regional security cooperation. It's waiting. It's right there.  Many have shown a willingness to support serious Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and to take steps on the path to normalization to relations, including public meetings, providing there is a meaningful progress towards a two-state solution. My friends, that is a real opportunity that we should not allow to be missed.  And that raises one final question: Is ours the generation that gives up on the dream of a Jewish democratic state of Israel living in peace and security with its neighbors? Because that is really what is at stake.  Now, that is what informed our vote at the Security Council last week--the need to preserve the two-state solution--and both sides in this conflict must take responsibility to do that. We have repeatedly and emphatically stressed to the Palestinians that all incitement to violence must stop. We have consistently condemned all violence and terrorism, and we have strongly opposed unilateral efforts to delegitimize Israel in international fora.  We've made countless public and private exhortations to the Israelis to stop the march of settlements. In literally hundreds of conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu, I have made clear that continued settlement activity would only increase pressure for an international response. We have all known for some time that the Palestinians were intent on moving forward in the UN with a settlements resolution, and I advised the prime minister repeatedly that further settlement activity only invited UN action.  Yet the settlement activity just increased, including advancing the unprecedented legislation to legalize settler outposts that the prime minister himself reportedly warned could expose Israel to action at the Security Council and even international prosecution before deciding to support it.  In the end, we could not in good conscience protect the most extreme elements of the settler movement as it tries to destroy the two-state solution. We could not in good conscience turn a blind eye to Palestinian actions that fan hatred and violence. It is not in U.interest to help anyone on either side create a unitary state. And we may not be able to stop them, but we cannot be expected to defend them. And it is certainly not the role of any country to vote against its own policies.  That is why we decided not to block the UN resolution that makes clear both sides have to take steps to save the two-state solution while there is still time. And we did not take this decision lightly. The Obama Administration has always defended Israel against any effort at the UN and any international fora or biased and one-sided resolutions that seek to undermine its legitimacy or security, and that has not changed. It didn't change with this vote.  But remember it's important to note that every United States administration, Republican and Democratic, has opposed settlements as contrary to the prospects for peace, and action at the UN Security Council is far from unprecedented. In fact, previous administrations of both political parties have allowed resolutions that were critical of Israel to pass, including on settlements. On dozens of occasions under George Bush alone, the council passed six resolutions that Israel opposed, including one that endorsed a plan calling for a complete freeze on settlements, including natural growth.  Let me read you the lead paragraph from a New York Times story dated December 23rd. I quote: ``With the United States abstaining, the Security Council adopted a resolution today strongly deploring Israel's handling of the disturbances in the occupied territories, which the resolution defined as, including All of the 14 other Security Council members voted in favor.'' My friends, that story was not written last week. It was written December 23rd, 1987, 26 years to the day that we voted last week, when Ronald Reagan was president.  Yet despite growing pressure, the Obama Administration held a strong line against UN action, any UN action, we were the only administration since 1967 that had not allowed any resolution to pass that Israel opposed. In fact, the only time in eight years the Obama Administration exercised its veto at the United Nations was against a one-sided settlements resolution in 2011. And that resolution did not mention incitement or violence.  Now let's look at what's happened since then. Since then, there have been over 30,000 settlement units advanced through some stage of the planning process. That's right--over 30,000 settlement units advanced notwithstanding the positions of the United States and other countries. And if we had vetoed this resolution just the other day, the United States would have been giving license to further unfettered settlement construction that we fundamentally oppose.  So we reject the criticism that this vote abandons On the contrary, it is not this resolution that is isolating Israel; it is the permanent policy of settlement construction that risks making peace impossible. And virtually every country in the world other than Israel opposes settlements. That includes many of the friends of Israel, including the United Kingdom, France, Russia--all of whom voted in favor of the settlements resolution in 2011 that we vetoed, and again this year along with every other member of the council.  In fact, this resolution simply reaffirms statements made by the Security Council on the legality of settlements over several decades. It does not break new ground. In 1978, the State Department Legal Adviser advised the Congress on his conclusion that Israel's government, the Israeli Government's program of establishing civilian settlements in the occupied territory is inconsistent with international law, and we see no change since then to affect that fundamental conclusion.  Now, you may have heard that some criticized this resolution for calling East Jerusalem occupied territory. But to be clear, there was absolutely nothing new in last week's resolution on that issue. It was one of a long line of Security Council resolutions that included East Jerusalem as part of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, and that includes resolutions passed by the Security Council under President Reagan and President George H.And remember that every U.administration since 1967, along with the entire international community, has recognized East Jerusalem as among the territories that Israel occupied in the Six-Day  Now, I want to stress this point: We fully respect Israel's profound historic and religious ties to the city and to its holy sites. We've never questioned that. This resolution in no manner prejudges the outcome of permanent status negotiations on East Jerusalem, which must, of course, reflect those historic ties and the realities on the ground. That's our position. We still support it.  We also strongly reject the notion that somehow the United States was the driving force behind this resolution. The Egyptians and Palestinians had long made clear to all of us--to all of the international community--their intention to bring a resolution to a vote before the end of the year, and we communicated that to the Israelis and they knew it anyway. The United States did not draft or originate this resolution, nor did we put it forward. It was drafted by Egypt--it was drafted and I think introduced by Egypt, which is one of Israel's closest friends in the region, in coordination with the Palestinians and others.  And during the time of the process as it went out, we made clear to others, including those on the Security Council, that it was possible that if the resolution were to be balanced and it were to include references to incitement and to terrorism, that it was possible the United States would then not block it, that--if it was balanced and fair. That's a standard practice with resolutions at the Security The Egyptians and the Palestinians and many others understood that if the text were more balanced, it was possible we wouldn't block it. But we also made crystal clear that the President of the United States would not make a final decision about our own position until we saw the final text.  In the end, we did not agree with every word in this resolution. There are important[[Page H158]]issues that are not sufficiently addressed or even addressed at all. But we could not in good conscience veto a resolution that condemns violence and incitement and reiterates what has been for a long time the overwhelming consensus and international view on settlements and calls for the parties to start taking constructive steps to advance the two-state solution on the ground.  Ultimately, it will be up to the Israeli people to decide whether the unusually heated attacks that Israeli officials have directed towards this Administration best serve Israel's national interests and its relationship with an ally that has been steadfast in its support, as I described. Those attacks, alongside allegations of U.S.-led conspiracy and other manufactured claims, distract attention from what the substance of this vote was really all about.  And we all understand that Israel faces very serious threats in a very tough neighborhood. Israelis are rightfully concerned about making sure that there is not a new terrorist haven right next door to them, often referencing what's happened with Gaza, and we understand that and we believe there are ways to meet those needs of security. And Israelis are fully justified in decrying attempts to legitimize their state and question the right of a Jewish state to exist. But this vote was not about that. It was about actions that Israelis and Palestinians are taking that are increasingly rendering a two-state solution impossible. It was not about making peace with the Palestinians now--it was about making sure that peace with the Palestinians will be possible in the future.  Now, we all understand that Israel faces extraordinary, serious threats in a very tough neighborhood. And Israelis are very correct in making sure that there's not a terrorist haven right on their border.  But this vote--I can't emphasize enough--is not about the possibility of arriving at an agreement that's going to resolve that overnight or in one year or two years. This is about a longer process. This is about how we make peace with the Palestinians in the future but preserve the capacity to do so.  So how do we get there? How do we get there, to that peace?  Since the parties have not yet been able to resume talks, the U.and the Middle East Quartet have repeatedly called on both sides to independently demonstrate a genuine commitment to the two-state solution--not just with words, but with real actions and policies--to create the conditions for meaningful negotiations.  We've called for both sides to take significant steps on the ground to reverse current trends and send a different message--a clear message--that they are prepared to fundamentally change the equation without waiting for the other side to act.  We have pushed them to comply with their basic commitments under their own prior agreements in order to advance a two-state reality on the ground.  We have called for the Palestinians to do everything in their power to stop violence and incitement, including publicly and consistently condemning acts of terrorism and stopping the glorification of violence.  And we have called on them to continue efforts to strengthen their own institutions and to improve governance, transparency, and accountability.  And we have stressed that the Hamas arms buildup and militant activities in Gaza must stop.  Along with our Quartet partners, we have called on Israel to end the policy of settlement construction and expansion, of taking land for exclusive Israeli use and denying Palestinian development.  To reverse the current process, the U.and our partners have encouraged Israel to resume the transfer of greater civil authority to the Palestinians in Area C, consistent with the transition that was called for by And we have made clear that significant progress across a range of sectors, including housing, agriculture, and natural resources, can be made without negatively impacting Israel's legitimate security needs. And we've called for significantly easing the movement and access restrictions to and from Gaza, with due consideration for Israel's need to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.  So let me stress here again: None of the steps that I just talked about would negatively impact Israel's security.  Let me also emphasize this is not about offering limited economic measures that perpetuate the status quo. We're talking about significant steps that would signal real progress towards creating two states.  That's the bottom line: If we're serious about the two-state solution, it's time to start implementing it now. Advancing the process of separation now, in a serious way, could make a significant difference in saving the two-state solution and in building confidence in the citizens of both sides that peace is, indeed, possible. And much progress can be made in advance of negotiations that can lay the foundation for negotiations, as contemplated by the Oslo process. In fact, these steps will help create the conditions for successful talks.  Now, in the end, we all understand that a final status agreement can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties. We've said that again and again. We cannot impose the peace.  There are other countries in the UN who believe it is our job to dictate the terms of a solution in the Security Others want us to simply recognize a Palestinian state, absent an agreement. But I want to make clear today, these are not the choices that we will make.  We choose instead to draw on the experiences of the last eight years, to provide a way forward when the parties are ready for serious negotiations. In a place where the narratives from the past powerfully inform and mold the present, it's important to understand the history. We mark this year and next a series of milestones that I believe both illustrate the two sides of the conflict and form the basis for its resolution. It's worth touching on them briefly.  A hundred and twenty years ago, the First Zionist Congress was convened in Basel by a group of Jewish visionaries, who decided that the only effective response to the waves of anti-Semitic horrors sweeping across Europe was to create a state in the historic home of the Jewish people, where their ties to the land went back centuries--a state that could defend its borders, protect its people, and live in peace with its neighbors. That was the vision. That was the modern beginning, and it remains the dream of Israel today.  Nearly 70 years ago, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 finally paved the way to making the State of Israel a reality. The concept was simple: to create two states for two peoples--one Jewish, one Arab--to realize the national aspirations of both Jews and And both Israel and the PLO referenced Resolution 181 in their respective declarations of independence.  The United States recognized Israel seven minutes after its creation. But the Palestinians and the Arab world did not, and from its birth, Israel had to fight for its life. Palestinians also suffered terribly in the 1948 war, including many who had lived for generations in a land that had long been their home too. And when Israel celebrates its 70th anniversary in 2018, the Palestinians will mark a very different anniversary: 70 years since what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe.  Next year will also mark 50 years since the end of the Six-Day War, when Israel again fought for its survival. And Palestinians will again mark just the opposite: 50 years of military occupation. Both sides have accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242, which called for the withdrawal of Israel from territory that it occupied in 1967 in return for peace and secure borders, as the basis for ending the conflict.  It has been more than 20 years since Israel and the PLO signed their first agreement--the Oslo Accords--and the PLO formally recognized Both sides committed to a plan to transition much of the West Bank and Gaza to Palestinian control during permanent status negotiations that would put an end to their conflict. Unfortunately, neither the transition nor the final agreement came about, and both sides bear responsibility for that.  Finally, some 15 years ago, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia came out with the historic Arab Peace Initiative, which offered fully normalized relations with Israel when it made peace--an enormous opportunity then and now, which has never been fully been embraced.  That history was critical to our approach to trying to find a way to resolve the conflict. And based on my experience with both sides over the last four years, including the nine months of formal negotiations, the core issues can be resolved if there is leadership on both sides committed to finding a solution.  In the end, I believe the negotiations did not fail because the gaps were too wide, but because the level of trust was too low. Both sides were concerned that any concessions would not be reciprocated and would come at too great a political cost. And the deep public skepticism only made it more difficult for them to be able to take risks.  In the countless hours that we spent working on a detailed framework, we worked through numerous formulations and developed specific bridging proposals, and we came away with a clear understanding of the fundamental needs of both sides. In the past two and a half years, I have tested ideas with regional and international stakeholders, including our Quartet partners. And I believe what has emerged from all of that is a broad consensus on balanced principles that would satisfy the core needs of both sides.  President Clinton deserves great credit for laying out extensive parameters designed to bridge gaps in advanced final status negotiations 16 years ago. Today, with mistrust too high to even start talks, we're at the opposite end of the spectrum. Neither side is willing to even risk acknowledging the other's bottom[[Page H159]]line, and more negotiations that do not produce progress will only reinforce the worst fears.  Now, everyone understands that negotiations would be complex and difficult, and nobody can be expected to agree on the final result in advance. But if the parties could at least demonstrate that they understand the other side's most basic needs--and are potentially willing to meet them if theirs are also met at the end of comprehensive negotiations--perhaps then enough trust could be established to enable a meaningful process to begin.  It is in that spirit that we offer the following principles--not to prejudge or impose an outcome, but to provide a possible basis for serious negotiations when the parties are ready. Now, individual countries may have more detailed policies on these issues--as we do, by the way--but I believe there is a broad consensus that a final status agreement that could meet the needs of both sides would do the following.  Principle number one: Provide for secure and recognized international borders between Israel and a viable and contiguous Palestine, negotiated based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed equivalent swaps.  Resolution 242, which has been enshrined in international law for 50 years, provides for the withdrawal of Israel from territory it occupied in 1967 in return for peace with its neighbors and secure and recognized borders. It has long been accepted by both sides, and it remains the basis for an agreement today.  As Secretary, one of the first issues that I worked out with the Arab League was their agreement that the reference in the Arab Peace Initiative to the 1967 lines would from now on include the concept of land swaps, which the Palestinians have acknowledged. And this is necessary to reflect practical realities on the ground, and mutually agreed equivalent swaps that will ensure that the agreement is fair to both sides.  There is also broad recognition of Israel's need to ensure that the borders are secure and defensible, and that the territory of Palestine is viable and contiguous. Virtually everyone that I have spoken to has been clear on this principle as well: No changes by Israel to the 1967 lines will be recognized by the international community unless agreed to by both sides.  Principle two: Fulfill the vision of the UN General Assembly Resolution 181 of two states for two peoples, one Jewish and one Arab, with mutual recognition and full equal rights for all their respective citizens.  This has been the fundamental--the foundational principle of the two-state solution from the beginning: creating a state for the Jewish people and a state for the Palestinian people, where each can achieve their national aspirations. And Resolution 181 is incorporated into the foundational documents of both the Israelis and Recognition of Israel as a Jewish state has been the U.position for years, and based on my conversations in these last months, I am absolutely convinced that many others are now prepared to accept it as well--provided the need for a Palestinian state is also addressed.  We also know that there are some 1.7 million Arab citizens who call Israel their home and must now and always be able to live as equal citizens, which makes this a difficult issue for Palestinians and others in the Arab world. That's why it is so important that in recognizing each other's homeland--Israel for the Jewish people and Palestine for the Palestinian people--both sides reaffirm their commitment to upholding full equal rights for all of their respective citizens.  Principle number three: Provide for a just, agreed, fair, and realistic solution to the Palestinian refugee issue, with international assistance, that includes compensation, options and assistance in finding permanent homes, acknowledgment of suffering, and other measures necessary for a comprehensive resolution consistent with two states for two peoples.  The plight of many Palestinian refugees is heartbreaking, and all agree that their needs have to be addressed. As part of a comprehensive resolution, they must be provided with compensation, their suffering must be acknowledged, and there will be a need to have options and assistance in finding permanent homes. The international community can provide significant support and assistance. I know we are prepared to do that, including in raising money to help ensure the compensation and other needs of the refugees are met, and many have expressed a willingness to contribute to that effort, particularly if it brings peace. But there is a general recognition that the solution must be consistent with two states for two peoples, and cannot affect the fundamental character of  Principle four: Provide an agreed resolution for Jerusalem as the internationally recognized capital of the two states, and protect and assure freedom of access to the holy sites consistent with the established status quo.  Now, Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue for both sides, and the solution will have to meet the needs not only of the parties, but of all three monotheistic faiths. That is why the holy sites that are sacred to billions of people around the world must be protected and remain accessible and the established status quo maintained. Most acknowledge that Jerusalem should not be divided again like it was in 1967, and we believe that. At the same time, there is broad recognition that there will be no peace agreement without reconciling the basic aspirations of both sides to have capitals there.  Principle five: Satisfy Israel's security needs and bring a full end, ultimately, to the occupation, while ensuring that Israel can defend itself effectively and that Palestine can provide security for its people in a sovereign and non-militarized state.  Security is the fundamental issue for Israel together with a couple of others I've mentioned, but security is critical. Everyone understands that no Israeli Government can ever accept an agreement that does not satisfy its security needs or that risk creating an enduring security threat like Gaza transferred to the West And Israel must be able to defend itself effectively, including against terrorism and other regional threats. In fact, there is a real willingness by Egypt, Jordan, and others to work together with Israel on meeting key security challenges. And I believe that those collective efforts, including close coordination on border security, intelligence-sharing, joint cooperations--joint operation, can all play a critical role in securing the peace.  At the same time, fully ending the occupation is the fundamental issue for the They need to know that the military occupation itself will really end after an agreed transitional process. They need to know they can live in freedom and dignity in a sovereign state while providing security for their population even without a military of their own. This is widely accepted as well. And it is important to understand there are many different ways without occupation for Israel and Palestine and Jordan and Egypt and the United States and others to cooperate in providing that security.  Now, balancing those requirements was among the most important challenges that we faced in the negotiations, but it was one where the United States has the ability to provide the most assistance. And that is why a team that was led by General John Allen, who is here, for whom I am very grateful for his many hours of effort, along with--he is one of our foremost military minds, and dozens of experts from the Department of Defense and other agencies, all of them engaged extensively with the Israeli Defense Force on trying to find solutions that could help Israel address its legitimate security needs.  They developed innovative approaches to creating unprecedented, multi-layered border security; enhancing Palestinian capacity; enabling Israel to retain the ability to address threats by itself even when the occupation had ended. General Allen and his team were not suggesting one particular outcome or one particular timeline, nor were they suggesting that technology alone would resolve these problems. They were simply working on ways to support whatever the negotiators agreed to. And they did some very impressive work that gives me total confidence that Israel's security requirements can be met.  Principle six: End the conflict and all outstanding claims, enabling normalized relations and enhanced regional security for all as envisaged by the Arab Peace It is essential for both sides that the final status agreement resolves all the outstanding issues and finally brings closure to this conflict, so that everyone can move ahead to a new era of peaceful coexistence and cooperation. For Israel, this must also bring broader peace with all of its Arab neighbors. That is the fundamental promise of the Arab Peace Initiative, which key Arab leaders have affirmed in these most recent days.  The Arab Peace Initiative also envisions enhanced security for all of the region. It envisages Israel being a partner in those efforts when peace is made. This is the area where Israel and the Arab world are looking at perhaps the greatest moment of potential transformation in the Middle East since Israel's creation in 1948. The Arab world faces its own set of security challenges. With Israeli-Palestinian peace, Israel, the United States, Jordan, Egypt--together with the GCC countries--would be ready and willing to define a new security partnership for the region that would be absolutely groundbreaking.  So ladies and gentlemen, that's why it is vital that we all work to keep open the possibility of peace, that we not lose hope in the two-state solution, no matter how difficult it may seem--because there really is no viable alternative.  Now, we all know that a speech alone won't produce peace. But based on over 30 years of experience and the lessons from the past 4 years, I have suggested, I believe, and President Obama has signed on to and believes in[[Page H160]]a path that the parties could take: realistic steps on the ground now, consistent with the parties' own prior commitments, that will begin the process of separating into two states; a political horizon to work towards to create the conditions for a successful final status talk; and a basis for negotiations that the parties could accept to demonstrate that they are serious about making peace.  We can only encourage them to take this path; we cannot walk down it for them. But if they take these steps, peace would bring extraordinary benefits in enhancing the security and the stability and the prosperity of Israelis, Palestinians, all of the nations of the region. The Palestinian economy has amazing potential in the context of independence, with major private sector investment possibilities and a talented, hungry, eager-to-work young workforce. Israel's economy could enjoy unprecedented growth as it becomes a regional economic powerhouse, taking advantage of the unparalleled culture of innovation and trading opportunities with new Arab partners. Meanwhile, security challenges could be addressed by an entirely new security arrangement, in which Israel cooperates openly with key Arab states. That is the future that everybody should be working for.  President Obama and I know that the incoming administration has signaled that they may take a different path, and even suggested breaking from the longstanding U.policies on settlements, Jerusalem, and the possibility of a two-state solution. That is for them to decide. That's how we work. But we cannot--in good conscience--do nothing, and say nothing, when we see the hope of peace slipping away.  This is a time to stand up for what is right. We have long known what two states living side by side in peace and security looks like. We should not be afraid to say so.  Now, I really began to reflect on what we have learned--and the way ahead--when I recently joined President Obama in Jerusalem for the state funeral for Shimon Shimon was one of the founding fathers of Israel who became one of the world's great elder statesmen--a beautiful man. I was proud to call him my friend, and I know that President Obama was as well.  And I remembered the first time that I saw Shimon in person--standing on the White House lawn for the signing the historic Oslo And I thought about the last time, at an intimate one-on-one Shabbat dinner just a few months before he died, when we toasted together to the future of Israel and to the peace that he still so passionately believed in for his people.  He summed it up simply and eloquently, as only Shimon could, quote, ``The original mandate gave the Palestinians 48 percent, now it's down to 22 percent. I think 78 percent is enough for us.''  As we laid Shimon to rest that day, many of us couldn't help but wonder if peace between Israelis and Palestinians might also be buried along with one of its most eloquent champions. We cannot let that happen. There is simply too much at stake--for future generations of Israelis and Palestinians--to give in to pessimism, especially when peace is, in fact, still possible.  We must not lose hope in the possibility of peace. We must not give in to those who say what is now must always be, that there is no chance for a better future. It is up to Israelis and Palestinians to make the difficult choices for peace, but we can all help. And for the sake of future generations of Israelis and Palestinians, for all the people of the region, for the United States, for all those around the world who have prayed for and worked for peace for generations, let's hope that we are all prepared--and particularly Israelis and Palestinians--to make those choices now.  Thank you very much. (Applause.)  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH146.txt,1853,OBJECTING TO UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 2334,2017.0,5.0,January

It does nothing to condemn or stop the Palestinian Authority's pay to slay, as we have heard talked over and over again, that rewarded over $300 million to terrorists in Israeli jails last year for crimes committed against Israeli citizens and others.

11667,topic-id,260,"Mr.Speaker, I oppose U.Security Council Resolution 2334--an anti-Israel, anti-Jewish attempt on behalf of pro-Palestinian nations to delegitimize Israel and ethnically cleanse East Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria of the Jewish people.  The Israelis have long been willing to compromise large swaths of land in this region in pursuit of a two-state solution. It has been the Palestinians who have, time and again, declined real offers on the table for their own state. Just think about this reality. If the Israelis agreed right now to make all of the concessions this U.Security Council resolution calls for, there would still not be peace. A viable two-state solution isn't just about Israel's recognizing the Palestinians' right to exist; it is also about the Palestinians' recognizing Israel's right to exist.
