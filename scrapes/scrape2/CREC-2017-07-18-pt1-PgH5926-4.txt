                SOLAR ECLIPSE IN HOPKINSVILLE, KENTUCKY

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a spectacular 
event that will take place in Hopkinsville, Kentucky this coming 
August. A solar eclipse will occur on August 21, 2017, the first to 
traverse coast to coast in the United States in nearly a century. The 
last time a solar eclipse was in the United States was in 1918. It will 
not be until 2045 that we witness a similar event.
  Hopkinsville is one location in the U.S. fortunate enough to have a 
position in the direct path of the shadow cast by the eclipse of the 
Sun. The historic city of Hopkinsville is expecting a huge turnout for 
this event, as many consider Hopkinsville the ``point of greatest 
eclipse'' for this August lunar display.
  August 18 to 20 will be a weekend full of celebrations surrounding 
this rare and memorable experience, including live music, food vendors, 
and activities for all ages. I thank the many people who have 
contributed to the promotion of this event in Hopkinsville, and I look 
forward to a festive weekend in the First District of Kentucky to 
celebrate the much anticipated solar eclipse.
