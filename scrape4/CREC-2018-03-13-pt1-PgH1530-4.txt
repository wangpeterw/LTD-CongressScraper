                    THE TOMPKINS FALCONS ARE WINNERS

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, in 1898, the Katy school district opened. In 
those 120 years, no Katy team ever played in the Texas Men's Basketball 
Championship.
  The Tompkins Falcons have only been around for 5 years. Yet, 4 days 
ago, those 5-year-old Falcons led Katy to its first Texas 6A finals. 
They came up 1.1 seconds short, losing by 2 points in overtime.
  There is an old saying in Texas: You see the true character, the true 
heart of a team, in defeat, not victory. That means the Tompkins 
Falcons have the biggest hearts in Texas.
  The best example is the words of the Falcons star senior Jamal 
Bieniemy: ``We still have life after basketball. We still have to wake 
up. We still have to breathe and live for each other.''
  I will close with words from Falcons head coach Bobby Sanders: ``It 
was gratifying we got this far. I am proud of them.''
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 850,000 Texans in Texas 22, I want to say: 
Darn straight, coach. Darn straight.
