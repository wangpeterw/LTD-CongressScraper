                 FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF COLORADO SHOOTING

  (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, July 20, 5 years ago, we had a terrible 
tragedy in Colorado. Twelve young people were killed, 70 were injured, 
and countless suffered emotional trauma.
  Today I want to recognize these 12. Despite the tragedy we suffered 
and the impact on our community, there were at least two bright spots: 
the response of law enforcement, firefighters, ambulance drivers, and 
medical personnel in dealing with what was a war zone.
  Over the 5 years, the families have come together and become great 
friends, recognizing and celebrating the lives of the people who were 
taken by that crazed shooter.
  I want to recognize them, I want to recognize the dedicated people 
who assisted them, and just let everybody know that we won't forget. 
Time goes on and the memories dim a little bit, but these were great 
young people. Our first responders were wonderful.
