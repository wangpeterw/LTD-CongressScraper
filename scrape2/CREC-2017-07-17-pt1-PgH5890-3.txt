                 IF DONALD TRUMP, JR., WERE A DEMOCRAT

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if Donald Trump, Jr., were a 
Democrat, the media would be defending him for doing what every 
campaign does: conducting opposition research. The media would be 
praising him for ending a meeting when it became obvious there was no 
evidence to back up an informant's allegations. The media would be 
pointing out that many countries' leaders openly supported Barack Obama 
for President, including those from the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, 
and Nicaragua.
  Maybe the real crime is the media's double standard. In their 
irrational obsession with destroying the Trump Presidency, the liberal 
media have forgotten journalism's profound responsibility: to be fair 
and objective.
