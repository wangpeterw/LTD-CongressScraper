                              ABORTION BAN

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, we are close to a government shutdown. 
The Republicans' top priority, however, is taking away a woman's right 
to choose.
  The abortion survivors bill is nothing but an insensitive, insulting, 
and unconstitutional attack against a woman's right to make her own 
healthcare decisions. No matter how sneaky the Republicans have been in 
drafting this bill, it is still, plain and simple, an abortion ban. It 
criminalizes doctors and intrudes into the doctor-patient relationship.
  Politicians are choosing what is best for a woman's health, instead 
of a woman making a choice with her doctor. This bill is part of the 
Republicans' agenda to take healthcare away from women.
  On the eve of the Women's March, we say again: Enough is enough. This 
bill will intimidate and close down reproductive health clinics across 
the country, leaving women who truly need help with no choices at all.
