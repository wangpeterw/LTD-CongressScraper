2960,topic-id,4443,"Mr.President, I wish to address the resolution the Senate is now considering.  In 2015, 85 U.Senators voted for the law fixing No Child Left Behind, which reversed the trend to a national school board and restored decisions to classroom teachers, local school boards, and The Wall Street Journal said it was the ``largest devolution of federal control to the states in a quarter of a century.''  The Department of Education regulation this resolution seeks to overturn does exactly the reverse. It begins to restore the national school board, and it takes away responsibilities from classroom teachers, local school boards, and It does this in direct violation of the law that 85 Senators voted for just 15 months ago. So the question before us, today, is not only whether we believe in a national school board or local school boards. More important, perhaps, the question is: who writes the law? Does the U.Congress write the law, or does the U.Department of Education write the law? Article I of the U.Constitution says that the Congress, elected by the people, writes the law.  The purpose of this resolution is to overturn a regulation of the Department of Education that in 7 cases directly violates the Every Student Succeeds Act, passed just 15 months ago, and in 16 other cases exceeds the authority allowed by that law.  This regulation would say to States: Ignore the law 85 Senators passed 15 months ago. Ignore the law that President Obama called a Christmas miracle. Ignore the law that Governors, teachers, school boards, and superintendents all supported, and even ignore why they supported it. Instead, listen to the unelected bureaucrats at the U.Department of  This regulation issued by the Department of Education specifically does things or requires States to do things that Congress said, in our law fixing No Child Left Behind, that the Department of Education cannot do. Therefore, it violates the law.  In this law, Congress said to the Department: You cannot tell States exactly what to do about fixing low-performing schools; that is a State decision. But this regulation does that anyway.[[Page S1667]]  Congress said to the Department: You cannot tell States exactly how to rate the public schools in your But this regulation does that anyway.  This is not a minor matter.  The remarkable consensus that developed in the 2015 bill in support of fixing No Child Left Behind was to reverse the trend toward a national school board and restore to States, classroom teachers, and school boards decisions about what to do about their children in 100,000 public schools. Teachers, Governors, and school board members were fed up with Washington telling them so much about what to do about the children in their schools. So this regulation, which contravenes the law specifically, goes to the heart of the bill fixing No Child Left  It is very unusual in Federal law to specifically prohibit a department from regulating on an issue, but that is exactly what Congress did in 2015. Here are seven specific examples of how the regulation which we seek to overturn violates prohibitions that Congress explicitly wrote into the law:  1, the regulation prescribes the long-term goals and measurements of progress that States establish for student subgroups.  The law says, for example, that the Secretary may not tell a State that goals set for students of one race must improve their progress 20 percent better than the progress of a group of students of another race. Yet the regulation says that States must establish goals and measurements for lower performing subgroups who ``require greater rates of improvement,'' which would necessarily mean that students of one race would have to do better than students of another race.  2, the regulation requires federally prescribed actions to be taken in schools that do not annually test at least 95 percent of students.  The law says that States must annually test not less than 95 percent of all students and each subgroup of students, but States determine how to hold schools accountable for ensuring that 95 percent of students participate on annual tests. The law says that the Secretary of Education may not prescribe ``the way in which the State factors'' the 95 percent testing requirement into their accountability system. Yet the regulation we seek to overturn prescribes four different specific ways that States must take action in schools that miss the 95 percent requirement.  3, the regulation prescribes that schools with consistently underperforming subgroups of students be identified with a lower summative determination.  The law says that States are required to identify schools for targeted support when a subgroup of students is ``consistently underperforming'' in a manner ``as determined by the state.'' So under the law, the Secretary can't tell States how to identify the lowest performing schools or what a school's rating should be. Yet the regulation we are seeking to overturn says that States are required to ``demonstrate that a school with a consistently underperforming subgroup . . . receive a lower summative determination. . . . than it would have otherwise received.'' The Department of Education is meddling into the methodology of school ratings again, despite the fact that Congress said it could not.  4, the regulation prescribes the timeline for identifying schools with consistently underperforming subgroups.  The law says that States are required to identify schools for targeted support when a subgroup of students is ``consistently underperforming'' in a manner ``as determined by the state.''  We had lengthy discussions about this. These issues in education are filled with conflict and filled with different opinions. I said many times during the debate that working on an education bill in the Senate is kind of like being in a football stadium on game day at Penn State or the University of Tennessee: Everybody in the stands has played football, and they know what play to call, and they usually do. So everybody had a point. We had to work these things out and we wrote down carefully the agreement we had. We wrote down that the Secretary of Education may not impose new requirements or criteria on State accountability systems, such as a timeline for the identification of lowest performing schools. Yet the regulation prescribes an exact timeline of 2 years.  5, the regulation requires States to resubmit their plans to the Secretary every 4 years.  The law says that each State plan ``shall . . . be periodically reviewed and revised as necessary by the State educational agency.'' Yet the regulation says States must review and revise their State plans ``at least once every four years'' and ``submit its revisions to the Secretary for review and approval.''  6, the regulation dictates exactly how school districts with significant numbers of low-performing schools must measure resources for students.  The law says States must ``periodically review resource allocation to support school improvement'' in districts that are serving a significant number of low-performing schools. The law says the Secretary cannot tell States what to review. Yet the regulation says that in addressing resource inequities, States must review differences in the following: rates of ineffective, out-of-field, or inexperienced teachers; access to advanced coursework; access to full-day kindergarten and preschool programs; access to specialized instructional support personnel; and per-pupil expenditures of Federal, State, and local funds.  But the law said the Secretary could not tell States what to review.  7, the regulation tells States how to count students in subgroups.  The law says each State decides the minimum number of students who should be included in the State's count of subgroups. So, a State might decide that for students to be included in the State's subgroup data, there needs to be at least 35 students, for example, of a subgroup in a school. The law says the Secretary may not impose new requirements or criteria on State accountability systems. Yet the regulation we are seeking to overturn says States must pick a number below 30 or States will have to explain themselves to the That is in violation of a specific prohibition passed by this body with 85 votes and signed by the President of the United  Those are seven ways the regulation specifically violates prohibitions in the law that were intended to keep the Secretary from doing what the Secretary then turned around and did.  Here are 16 more ways the regulation exceeds the authority of the U.Department of To some, this may seem minor. To some, it may seem dull. It is not dull to me. I don't think it is dull to most Article I of the Constitution isn't dull. We are elected to write the laws, and anytime we turn over to somebody else--whether it is the court, whether it is the executive branch--that constitutional prerogative, we violate our oath, in my opinion.  1, the regulation limits how States measure school quality or student success. The law says States must include at least one measure of school quality or student success that has to be ``valid, reliable, comparable, and statewide.''  The Secretary cannot tell States what measures to use in their State accountability system. Yet the regulation tells States they can only choose indicators that meet the criteria the Department came up with.  2, the regulation limits how States measure school quality or student success for indicators used specifically in high school.  The law says States must include at least one measure of school quality or student success, specific to high schools, and it has to be ``valid, reliable, comparable, and statewide.'' The Secretary cannot tell States what measures to use in their State accountability system. Yet the regulation tells States they can only choose indicators that meet criteria the Department came up with.  3, the regulation tells schools marked as low-performing that they will always be low-performing unless they improve on indicators the U.Department of Education has identified.  The law says something different. The law says that tests and graduation rates have to count more in the State accountability systems than indicators of school quality or student success. The Secretary of Education may not prescribe ``the weight of any measure or indicator used to identify or meaningfully differentiate schools.''[[Page S1668]]  The regulation says that a low-performing school must continue to be identified as low-performing unless it improves on tests and graduation rates, even if the school is making significant progress on other measures of school quality or student success, such as, for example, absenteeism or family engagement, something chosen by the  4, the regulation requires school districts where schools aren't testing 95 percent of students to develop and implement a Federal improvement plan.  The law says States must annually test not less than 95 percent of all students and each subgroup of students. The law leaves it to States to determine what to do in school districts with schools that are failing to meet the participation requirement. Yet the regulation tells States how to address school districts where schools aren't testing 95 percent of students. It invents out of whole cloth the idea of a Federal improvement plan, and then it mandates it.  5, similarly, the regulation requires schools that aren't testing 95 percent of students to develop and implement a Federal improvement plan.  The law says that States must annually test not less than 95 percent of all students and each subgroup of students. The law leaves it to States to determine what to do in schools that are failing to meet the participation requirement. Yet the regulation tells States how to address schools that aren't testing 95 percent of students.  Again, it invents out of whole cloth the idea of a Federal improvement plan with four federally prescribed elements, and then it mandates it.  6, the regulation tells States how to measure high school graduation rates.  The law says each State will establish long-term goals for ``all students and each subgroup of students in the State,'' including the goal of high school graduation rates using either the ``four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate'' or ``at the State's discretion, the extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.'' Yet the regulation says States can only use the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate to identify low-performing schools in their accountability systems.  You can see that throughout these examples there appears to be a deliberate attempt by the Department of Education not to interpret the law but to ignore the law or, specifically, to contravene the law, to thumb the nose of regulation writers at the Congress and the President who passed and signed the law.  7, the regulation requires each State to come up with a definition for an ``ineffective teacher.'' The law says each State will describe how low-income and minority children enrolled in schools are not served at disproportionate rates by ineffective teachers. Yet the regulations says States have to define ``ineffective teachers.'' It is going to make it nearly impossible for States not to implement an entire teacher evaluation system.  8, in the same way, the regulation requires each State to come up with a definition of an ``out-of-field teacher.''  That is what the regulation does, but the law just says States will describe how low-income and minority children enrolled in schools are not served at disproportionate rates by ``out-of-field teachers.'' The regulation says you have to define that.  9, the regulation requires each State to come up with a definition for an ``inexperienced teacher.''  The law simply says a State will describe how low-income and minority children are not served at disproportionate rates by ``inexperienced teachers.'' Yet the regulation goes on to require a definition.  10, the regulation tells States to report on the number and percentage of all students and subgroups of students who are not included in the State's accountability system.  The law says each State will report a clear and concise description of the State's accountability system, including the minimum number of students that the State determines are necessary to be included in each of the subgroups of students. Yet the regulation requires States to provide new information outside of the scope of what is required by the law.  11, the regulation tells States how to rate schools and that the State accountability system has to produce a single rating for each school.  That was not envisioned by the law. The law says that States must create a system of evaluating all public schools in the It says, further, that the Secretary of Education may not prescribe the specific methodology used by States to evaluate schools. Yet the regulation tells States that the results must lead to a ``single summative determination'' for each school.  A State might choose to do that or a State might choose not to do that. That was the decision of the Congress, but the Department decided differently.  12, the regulation adds a requirement that the State's accountability system has to include at least three levels of performance.  The law says that States have the flexibility to establish a system of meaningful differentiation of schools without any parameters or federally prescribed methodology. That couldn't be clearer--without any parameters or federally described methodology. Yet the regulation prescribes a requirement that States use at least three distinct levels of performance for schools.  13, the regulation prescribes when schools may exit from identification as the lowest-performing.  The law says States must establish statewide criteria for schools to exit from being identified as in need of improvement. The law says that the Secretary of Education may not prescribe what the exit criteria are. That is a decision left up to States, but the regulation narrows the States' ability to develop their own criteria for schools to no longer be identified as the lowest performing.  14, the regulation prescribes how States intervene in school districts with schools that are labeled as the lowest-performing. The law says that if a low-performing school does not meet a State's criteria for no longer being identified as lowest-performing, then the State must take a ``more rigorous State-determined action.'' The Secretary of Education cannot prescribe, under the law, any specific strategies to improve schools. Yet the regulation requires the State to tell school districts to take interventions the Department has prescribed.  15, the regulation prescribes how school districts intervene in schools that are labeled as low-performing.  The law says if a low-performing school does not meet statewide criteria for no longer being identified as lowest-performing, the State must take a ``more rigorous State-determined action.'' The Secretary cannot prescribe any specific strategies to improve schools. Yet the regulation requires a school to take federally prescribed actions.  We have already tried Federal one-size-fits-all actions under the School Improvement Grant program in No Child Left We rejected that. We don't think Washington should be in the business of telling schools how to fix themselves.  Finally, 16, the regulation limits how States award school improvement funding to school districts and schools.  The law says States must establish the method they will use to award school improvement funding to school districts. The regulation dictates to States how much they have to award to low-performing schools receiving school improvement funds.  Here is what this resolution overturning the regulation would do. The resolution would ensure that the law fixing No Child Left Behind is implemented as Congress wrote it. The regulation violates the law and its clear prohibitions on the Secretary by prescribing new requirements through regulation or as a condition of a State plan approval.  In the law we passed, Congress reached an agreement about requiring States to identify a certain number and types of schools that need to be improved, but we left it to the States to determine how to go about fixing those schools and how long they had to fix the schools. The regulation prescribes how States and school districts intervene in and improve schools that do not improve.  Secondly, this resolution restores State flexibility. The regulation is in direct conflict with the intent of the law to allow States and school districts[[Page S1669]]to have greater flexibility to implement the law, as Congress intended.  Congress reached an agreement that there are some essential elements of a State accountability plan that need to be included in a State plan. The other half of the agreement was that we left to the States the decisions about how to include these factors into their accountability systems. This is about article I of the  Congress wrote the law with specific rules in mind. The Secretary of Education and his or her bureaucracy do not get to treat Congress as a minor impediment to the education system of their choosing. If they want to write the laws of the land, they should run for Congress and get themselves elected, draft a bill or an amendment--not wait for Congress to finish our work and try to undo it through a simple regulation.  This resolution, overturning the regulation, would preserve local decision-making. As I mentioned, the Wall Street Journal editorialized, when we passed the law, that it was ``the largest devolution of Federal control to States in a quarter-century.''  The regulation tried to restore Washington, DC, decision-making with mandates that States comply with specific requirements instead of letting States determine how to best proceed.  This resolution scuttles new and burdensome reporting requirements. The regulation created new reporting requirements on States and school districts that will drive up compliance costs and divert resources away from students and classrooms.  Let me conclude by dealing with some of the arguments and misinformation that I have been hearing about the resolution. 1, I want to make clear that this resolution overturning the regulation strengthens accountability in our public schools the way Congress determined to do it in the law fixing No Child Left  We transferred most of that responsibility for accountability from Washington, DC, to States and local school boards. We did not want a national school board.  The law also includes Federal guardrails to ensure a quality, public education for all students, including, for example, requiring States to identify and provide support to low-performing schools--at least the lowest performing bottom 5 percent of each State's schools--and requiring academic and English language proficiency indicators to be included in each State's accountability system. The law's Federal guardrails will shape how States design their accountability systems because a State plan would not be following the law if the State fails to include accountability provisions in their plan.  The repeal of this regulation does not let States--the ones who are supposed to be addressing accountability--off the hook by any means. Repealing this regulation simply ensures that individual States and their Governors, legislators, chief State school officers, local school boards, superintendents, principals, parents, and classroom teachers are responsible for these decisions.  This resolution, overturning the regulation, will allow States to implement the new law on the existing timeline to submit their plans and have the Department review and approve State plans.  U.Education Secretary DeVos has said that she favors the current timeline, the one established by former Secretary She said this at her confirmation hearing before our committee. She confirmed that again after taking office.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that Secretary DeVos's letter of February 10 to the Chief State School Officers outlining the timeline be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 10, 2017.       Dear Chief State School Officer: Thank you for the      important work you and stakeholders in your State are engaged      in to develop new State plans and transition to the Every      Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which reauthorized the      Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). I am      writing today to assure you that I fully intend to implement      and enforce the statutory requirements of the      Additionally, I want to provide you with an update on the      timeline, procedures, and criteria under which a State      Educational Agency (SEA) may submit a State plan, including a      consolidated State plan, to the States should      continue to follow the timeline for developing and submitting      their State plans to the Department for review and approval.       On November 29, 2016, the Department issued final      regulations regarding statewide accountability systems and      data reporting under Title I of the ESEA, as amended by the      ESSA, and the preparation of State plans, including      consolidated State plans. However, in accordance with the      memorandum of January 20, 2017, from the Assistant to the      President and Chief of Staff, titled ``Regulatory Freeze      Pending Review,'' published in the Federal Register on      January 24, 2017, the Department has delayed the effective      date of regulations concerning accountability and State plans      under the ESSA until March 21, 2017, to permit further review      for questions of law and policy that the regulations might      raise. Additionally, Congress is currently considering a      joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional      Review Act (CRA) (5 U.S.801808) to overturn these      regulations. If a resolution of disapproval is enacted, these      regulations ``shall have no force or effect.''       In a Dear Colleague Letter dated November 29, 2016, the      Department notified SEAs that it would accept consolidated      State plans on two dates: April 3 or September 18, 2017. The      Department also released a Consolidated State Plan Template      that States were required to use if they submit a      consolidated State plan. Due to the regulatory delay and      review, and the potential repeal of recent regulations by      Congress, the Department is currently reviewing the      regulatory requirements of consolidated State plans, as      reflected in the current template, to ensure that they      require only descriptions, information, assurances, and other      materials that are ``absolutely necessary'' for consideration      of a consolidated State plan, consistent with section      8302(b)(3) of the In doing so, the Department, in      consultation with SEAs as well as other State and local      stakeholders, will develop a revised template for      consolidated State plans that meets the ``absolutely      necessary'' requirement by March 13, 2017. The Department may      also consider allowing a State or group of States to work      together to develop a consolidated State plan template that      meets the Department's identified requirements through the      Council of Chief State School       The regulatory delay and review, and the potential repeal      of recent regulations by Congress, should not adversely      affect or delay the progress that States have already made in      developing their State plans and transitioning to the      The Department will be notifying States and the public of the      revised template once it becomes available. In the meantime,      States should continue their work in engaging with      stakeholders and developing their plans based on the      requirements under section 8302(b)(3) of the In doing      so, States may consider using the existing template as a      guide, as any revised template will not result in      descriptions, information, assurances, or other materials      that States will be required to provide other than those      already required under the The Department will still      accept consolidated State plans on April 3 or September 18,      2017.       For your reference, the following programs may be included      in a consolidated State plan:       Title I, part A: Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local      Educational Agencies;       Title I, part C: Education of Migratory Children;       Title I, part D: Prevention and Intervention Programs for      Children and Youth Who Are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk;       Title II, part A: Supporting Effective Instruction;       Title III, part A: English Language Acquisition, Language      Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act;       Title IV, part A: Student Support and Academic Enrichment      Grants;       Title IV, part B: 21st Century Community Learning Centers;      and       Title V, part B, subpart 2: Rural and Low-Income School            In addition, pursuant to ESEA section 8302(a)(1)(B), I am      designating the Education for Homeless Children and Youths      program under subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento      Homeless Assistance Act as a program that may be included in      an SEA's consolidated State plan.       I appreciate the hard work and thoughtful attention you are      giving to implementing the ESEA, as amended by the I      understand that a great deal of work has already gone into      the planning and preparation of your State plans, whether      that is a consolidated State plan or individual program      plans. One of my main priorities as Secretary is to ensure      that States and local school districts have clarity during      the early implementation of the law. Additionally, I want to      ensure that regulations comply with the requirements of the      law, provide the State and local flexibility that Congress      intended, and do not impose unnecessary burdens. In the near      future, the Department will provide more information on its      review of existing regulations, as well as additional      guidance and technical assistance.       We have a unique opportunity as we implement the I      look forward to working with you, districts, and parents to      ensure every child has the opportunity to pursue excellence      and achieve their hopes and dreams.           Sincerely,                                                      Betsy DeVos.[[Page S1670]]    ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1666-2.txt,1695,OBAMACARE,2017.0,8.0,March
2961,topic-id,1224,"So there is no confusion, let me clearly state what that timeline is. 1, States should continue to submit State accountability plans by the April or September 2017 deadlines. 2, States should continue to implement a State accountability system in the 2017-2018 school year. 3, States should continue to identify the lowest performing schools in need of comprehensive support and improvement by the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year.  To write these plans, States need simply to consult the law. The Every Student Succeeds Act requires States to submit a plan for peer review and approval by Secretary DeVos and the Education The Department is committed to working with States by providing technical assistance, issuing non-regulatory guidance and other support materials.  If questions arise, there are a variety of ways to answer the questions. The Department will continue to provide States with clarification on how to comply with the law through the use of non-regulatory guidance, ``Dear Colleague'' letters, frequently asked questions documents, webinars, phone calls, and in-person conferences. In other words, if there are any questions about how to comply with the new law, there are plenty of ways for Chief State School Officers and others to ask the U.Department of Education to provide the answers.  It is important to emphasize that this resolution does not in any way give the Education Secretary a path to creating a new Federal voucher program. Some of my friends on the other side of this debate have been resorting to scare tactics and alleging Secretary DeVos will use this opportunity to regulate into existence a mandate that State and local school districts adopt a school voucher program. The Secretary of Education does not have that power, and this Secretary of Education has said she does not want it. Secretary DeVos has repeatedly affirmed her opposition to federally mandating school choice, saying that she does ``not and will not advocate for any Federal mandates requiring vouchers. States should determine the mechanism of choice, if any.''  A school choice program cannot be unilaterally created by the U.Department of Only Congress could create a voucher program. I tried to do that on the floor of this Senate during the debate about fixing No Child Left I offered an amendment called Scholarships for Kids that would have allowed States to use existing Federal dollars to follow the children of low-income families to schools of their parents' choice. Senator Scott of South Carolina offered a similar amendment, but only 45 Senators voted for our proposals. If you pay attention around here, you know that the most important things usually take 60 votes to gain approval.  Also, the 2015 law that we passed actually includes provisions that would prohibit the Secretary from mandating, directing, or controlling a State, school district or school's allocation of State or local resources, and it bars the Department of Education from requiring States and districts to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under the law--for example, vouchers. Now I agree that previous Secretaries of Education have imposed their own personal, policy preferences on States and school districts. I opposed such mandates and worked against them. Congress writes the law, not the Secretary and not the bureaucracy.  Instead of using this scare tactic to rile up teachers and parents around the country, misleading them and confusing them about what the Secretary of Education might do, I would take that argument and turn it around. If Congress takes a stand here and now and says that this regulation exceeds the authority granted by Congress--the authority delegated to the Secretary of Education--because the Secretary imposed conditions on States not allowed by the law, then that means any current or future Secretary of Education would be similarly prevented from imposing their own conditions on  So there could be no legal method of forcing States to adopt a voucher program, unless Congress passes a new law. There could be no legal method of reinterpreting the Every Student Succeeds Act to impose the next good education idea--however well-intended--unless Congress acts first.  The suggestion has been made that this new law requires regulations. This regulation is not required by the law. The law does not specifically call for accountability regulations. The law allows for accountability regulations, but ``only to the extent that such regulations are necessary to ensure that there is compliance.'' So there is no requirement for this regulation. It is allowed, but it is not required.  Congress wrote prohibitions on the Secretary so that States would not be faced with a bunch of new mandates that ``add new requirements that are inconsistent with or outside the scope'' or ``add new criteria that are inconsistent with or outside the scope'' or are ``in excess of statutory authority granted to the Secretary.'' That is what Congress did. In the law, we laid out requirements for State plans. States can simply follow the law. A regulation isn't necessary.  Future Secretaries will still be able to write regulations on this subject. Under the Congressional Review Act, which is the procedure under which we are operating, if Congress overturns a regulation--as I hope it will in this case--the Department of Education is prevented from making final a new regulation that is ``substantially the same'' as the overturned regulation, unless Congress passes a new law to create an opportunity for that new regulation. But no court has defined what ``substantially the same'' means. But the commonsense interpretation of that is very simple: The Department simply can't turn right around and do the same thing Congress has just overturned. It could do something else by regulation, but it could not do precisely that.  So this is a question of whether we are going to restore the national school board that 85 Senators voted to reverse 15 months ago. And this is also a question of whether you believe that the U.Congress writes the law or the U.Department of Education writes the law. I believe that under article I of our Constitution, the U.Congress writes the law, and when signed by the President, then that is the law. The regulations must stay within it, and that is especially true when Congress has written explicit prohibitions about what a Secretary may do and may not do.  The remarkable consensus around the bill fixing No Child Left Behind was to reverse the trend to a national school board and restore to States, to classroom teachers, and to parents the decisions about what to do about their children in public schools. Teachers, Governors, school boards, and parents were all are fed up with Washington telling them so much about what to do with their children in 100,000 public schools.  So this regulation, which contravenes the law specifically, goes to the heart of the bill fixing No Child Left Behind, which received 85 votes here in the And this resolution to overturn that regulation upholds the law that received ``aye'' votes from those 85 I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution and to vote aye one more time.  I believe that overturning the regulation preserves the consensus and the compromise that we achieved when we enacted the law fixing No Child Left  I yield the floor.

3008,topic-id,1840,"Mr.President, redundancy is often a virtue, so I am about to practice redundancy.  Last week, I made a speech on the floor of the Senate about the upcoming votes in connection with the President's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and I talked about the 230-year history of this body to always have Presidential nominations for judges--for Supreme Court Justices, for Federal district judges, and for circuit judges up to 2003 by a majority vote. Never in the history of this body has the Senate refused to allow a vote, an up-or-down vote on a Supreme Court  Because I hear that may be what the Democrats are planning to do--even though Mr.Gorsuch may be one of the most remarkably talented nominees in a long, long time--I want to make the address that I made last week again, and I am going to deliver it word for word in hopes that someone may actually hear it.  President Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a member of the U.Supreme Court will be considered on the floor of the Senate next week. Some have suggested that instead of allowing a majority of Senators to decide whether to approve the Gorsuch nomination, there should first be a so-called cloture vote to determine whether to cut off debate.  Now, you can see what would happen. Cutting off debate requires the approval of 60 There are 46 Democratic Senators, so if 41 of the 46 Democrat Senators vote not to cut off debate, we would never get to a vote on Judge We would never get to a vote. In other words, the 41 Democratic Senators would have filibustered to death the Gorsuch nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States, a partisan act that has never happened before in the 230 years of the  Filibustering to death the Gorsuch nomination or any Presidential nomination, for that matter, flies in the face of 230 years of Senate tradition.  Throughout the Senate's history, approval of even the most controversial Presidential nominations have required only a majority vote. For example, in 1991, President George H.Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to be Associate Justice of the U.Supreme[[Page S2037]]The debate was bitter. The vote was narrow. The Senate confirmed Justice Thomas 52 to 48.  Although Senate rules have allowed any one Senator to try to filibuster the nomination to death, to insist on a 60-vote vote, not one did. In fact, Senate rules have always allowed Senators the option to filibuster to death a Presidential nomination, yet it has almost never happened.  According to the former Senate historian, with one possible exception, which I will describe later, the number of Supreme Court Justices in our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster is zero. The number of the President's Cabinet members in our country's history who have been denied their seats by a filibuster is zero. The number of Federal district judges in our country's history who have been denied their seats by a filibuster is zero. I know that for a fact because an attempt was made to filibuster one--Judge McConnell from Rhode Island--and I voted against that, as did other Republican Senators, because we thought it was wrong to break the Senate's 230-year tradition of always considering judges by majority vote, and we prevailed.  We could have done it, but we didn't do it. That is the point.  Next week, the Democrats can filibuster Judge Gorsuch to death, but they shouldn't do it. They shouldn't do it.  Until 2003, the number of circuit judges in our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster was zero.  Senator Everett Dirksen did not filibuster President Lyndon Johnson's nominees. Senator Robert Byrd did not filibuster President Reagan's nominees. Senator Howard Baker did not filibuster President Carter's nominees. Senator Bob Dole did not filibuster President Clinton's nominees.  During most of the 20th century, when one party controlled the White House and the Senate 70 percent of the time, the minority never filibustered to death a single Presidential nomination.  On the other hand, there have been plenty of filibusters on legislation--so many that in 1917, the Senate adopted the so-called cloture rule as a way to end filibusters. The idea is, after you talk enough, you should bring it to an end, so they had a supermajority for that purpose. The rule was amended in 1949, 1959, 1975, 1979, and 1986--always in response to filibusters on legislation, never on nominations. It was the 1975 change that established the current cloture standard of 60 votes to end debate, except on amendments to the Standing  Filibustering a Presidential nomination has always been treated differently than filibustering a legislative matter. The filibuster of legislation is perhaps the Senate's most famous characteristic. It has been called ``democracy's finest show, the right to talk your head off.''  As the actor Jimmy Stewart says in the movie ``Mr.Smith Goes to Washington'': ``Wild horses aren't going to drag me off this floor until those people have heard everything I've got to say, even if it takes all winter.'' That was Jimmy Stewart talking about his filibuster.  The late Robert Byrd described the importance of a legislative filibuster in this way in his last speech to the Senate: ``Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing body that allows for open and unlimited debate and protection of minority rights. Senators have understood this since the Senate first convened.''  In fact, the whole idea of the Senate is not to have a majority rule on legislation. Throughout Senate history, the purpose of the legislative filibuster has been to force consensus on issues, to force there to be a group of Senators on either side who have to respect one another's views so they work together and produce 60 votes on important matters. We did that last December in a piece of legislation that the majority leader called the most important legislation of the Congress, the 21st Century Cures There were enormous differences of opinion about it, but because Senator Murray, the ranking Democrat and I, and the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and in the House, and President Obama and Vice President Biden all wanted a result, we formed a consensus. We resolved our differences, and we agreed on this most important piece of legislation that will help virtually every American family by advancing cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and a variety of diseases.  Nominations have always been treated differently from legislation. For example, under Senate rule XIV, any Senator can bring legislation directly to the Calendar of General Orders, bypassing committees. There is no such power for nominations. There is no rule XIV for nominations. Senate rules allow debate and, therefore, the possibility of filibuster on a motion to proceed to legislation. Debate is not allowed on a motion to proceed to nominations. So there can't be a filibuster on a motion to proceed to a nomination. In summary, while Senate rules have always allowed for extended debate or filibusters, the filibuster was never used to block a nomination until recently.  As I mentioned earlier, it was never used to block a Cabinet nomination, never used to block a Federal district judge, until 2003, never used to block a Federal circuit judge, and never used to block a Supreme Court Justice, with one possible exception. The exception occurred in 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson sought to elevate Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief There was bipartisan opposition to that idea. When it became clear that the Senate majority would not agree, President Johnson engineered a 45-43 cloture vote so that Fortas could save face and appear to have won something, according to the former Senate Fortas then asked the President to withdraw the nomination.  Other than that, never has a Supreme Court nominee been filibustered to death in the Other than the Fortas nomination, the filibuster was never used to block any judicial nomination until 2003 and 2004, when Democrats for the first time decided to use the 60-vote cloture requirement to block 10 of President George Bush's nominees. I had just arrived in the I remember it well. I was really outraged by it because, as for the nominees, it was the right of the President to name them and the right of the Senate to reject them. But throughout history it was always by 51 votes. This unprecedented action by the Senate Democrats produced a threat by Republicans to change the Senate rules to make it clear that only a majority is required to approve a Presidential nomination. There was a negotiation, and eventually five of Bush's nominees were approved, five were blocked, and the rules weren't changed.  Then in 2011 and 2013, Republicans returned the favor. That happens around here--a precedent set by that side then becomes a precedent that this side, then, undertakes. In 2011 and 2013, the Republicans returned the favor by seeking to block five of President Obama's nominees for the circuit court by insisting on a 60-vote cloture on each. Republicans alleged the President was trying to pack the Federal Circuit Court of the District of Columbia with three liberal justices. To overcome Republican objections, the Democrats invoked the so-called nuclear option. They broke the Senate rules to change the rules. The new rule eliminated the possibility of 60-vote cloture motions for all Presidential nominations except for the Supreme Court, which is where we are today.  There have been other examples of minority Senators filibustering nominations to death, all of them during the last three administrations and all involving sub-Cabinet nominations. Then, of course, there have been delays in considering nominations.  My own nomination in 1991 as U.Education Secretary was delayed for 51 days--I thought improperly--by a Democratic President Reagan's nomination of Ed Meese as Attorney General of the United States was delayed 1 year by a Democratic No one has ever disputed our right in the Senate, regardless of who was in charge, to use our constitutional duty of advice and consent to delay and examine and sometimes to cause nominations to be withdrawn or even to defeat nominees by a majority vote.  But, as we approach the vote next week on Neil Gorsuch on the floor of the Senate, it is useful to remember that the tradition of the Senate has been to treat legislative matters one way and Presidential nominations a different way: to filibuster to death[[Page S2038]]legislation, yes; to filibuster to death Presidential nominations, no.  Should the Gorsuch nomination come to the floor soon, as I believe it will, overwhelming Senate tradition requires that whether to approve it should be decided by a majority vote and there should be no attempt by the minority to filibuster the nomination, especially of such a qualified man.  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

2936,topic-id,905,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding a Special Order on a topic that could not be more relevant than at this very time: the failures of  As a healthcare professional myself, the elected representative of over 700,000 constituents, and the grandfather of 13, I have a duty to see that access to medical care is more affordable for the welfare of my patients, for my constituents, and for the livelihood of my children and my grandchildren.  ObamaCare moved us away from the patient-centered affordable medical care--the traditional doctor-patient relationship--that we have enjoyed for well over a century. ObamaCare was designed by Washington bureaucrats who, unlike other Americans, are exempt from In the last 24 hours, I have heard from nearly 1,000 of my constituents who are overwhelmingly begging me to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a bill that restores their healthcare freedom.  That is no surprise to me. I have heard from thousands of my constituents, including my own patients and my own family members, about how their premiums have skyrocketed and their deductibles have skyrocketed. They have health insurance, but they can't afford to access medical care because their deductibles are too high and their longtime family doctors are no longer accepted as providers in their new health insurance. They have to drive long distances to get to a new and different doctor in their medical plan. They have had medical care interrupted. Simply put, they want this ObamaCare nightmare to end.  A truck driver from Hardin County told me how she was forced to switch plans last year from the PPO that she wanted to keep to an HMO that she did not want. This has made it significantly more difficult for her to find a doctor to accept her insurance when she gets sick out on the road even though she pays much higher in premiums than she did last year for her  Melissa, who lives in Harris County, has the same story. Last January she had to switch her family to an HMO plan because of ObamaCare's limited choices in her community. This forced her family to leave their doctor of 20 years and their local pharmacy.  Melissa said: I have always been a very responsible American citizen, yet ObamaCare told me what kind of plan that I had to buy.                              {time}  2045  This is what ObamaCare does. It makes decisions for patients instead of the other way around. Brute Federal force.  The message is clear: ObamaCare's top down, Big Government approach is leading to higher premiums, less choice, and insufficient access for people in my district and all across this great land of ours. These higher out-of-pocket costs and premiums have priced too many Americans out of the insurance market altogether.  Melinda, who lives in the county next to me, had an ObamaCare plan last year and paid nearly $600 a month. She also had a $3,000 deductible. She had to spend over $10,000 before her health insurance plan paid for anything. Even with these high premiums, her insurance plan would not cover many of her asthma medicines or the cataract surgery that she desperately needs.  This year, when her premiums went up another $100, she dropped coverage altogether. Under ObamaCare, now she has lost affordable coverage, and she must pay a penalty, a tax.  Angela, from Harris County, actually decided to sign up for an ObamaCare plan after going uninsured for some time. Unfortunately, she soon realized that the cost vastly outweighed the benefits. So this year, she chose again to go without insurance. Now she pays the ObamaCare tax.  Others in my district don't want insurance coverage or only want catastrophic coverage. Yet, they are forced to pay expensive fines. Their freedom of choice is grossly limited.  Gina, a hardworking single mother and businessowner told me that she is now forced to use the little bit of money that she gets from her tax refund to pay the ObamaCare tax.  Charlie from Harris County says that he wants me to vote to repeal the individual mandate, stating that ObamaCare has forced him to buy a product that he doesn't want.  ObamaCare relies on force and coercion, but this is not the American way. If ObamaCare is so good, why did a larger percentage of Americans elect to pay the penalty than to take the subsidy for their coverage last year? The American people deserve much better.  I have got hundreds of similar stories, including those from a college student who couldn't work more than 27 hours a week over her Christmas break to earn money for school because the ObamaCare law imposed costly mandates for her employer if she does.  ObamaCare is in a death spiral and is imposing too much pain and suffering on the American people. Premiums have gone up, on average, by 25 percent across the country for enrollees this year alone. Some States, like Arizona, had a 116 percent increase in premiums.  Twenty-five percent of Americans have only one health insurer to choose from, and 50 percent of Americans live in areas with only two insurance providers. Folks, that is not a choice.  The complaints I am hearing now are at a fever pitch, and the American people are demanding a change now. We need a patient-centered healthcare system driven not by mandates and coercion, but by freedom and choice for my patients, for my constituents, for my family, and for all  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH2011.txt,2270,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,9.0,March
2949,topic-id,1125,"Mr.President, last week the Committee on Environment[[Page S421]]and Public Works held a hearing on the nomination of Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection The hearing was really about the future of this Agency and how we can get it back to doing the job it was meant to do from the very beginning.  We are blessed in this country with enormous natural resources. Our goal should be to use these resources responsibly in ways that protect our environment and help make our economy strong.  Over the past 8 years, the leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency created broad and legally questionable new regulations that undermined the American people's faith in the The political leaders of this Agency have been reckless, irresponsible, and arrogant.  A course of correction is long overdue, and it is exactly what we are going to get.  If my colleagues have any doubts that the EPA lost its way, they can just look at two of the biggest environmental scandals we have seen in a long time. In the summer of 2015, there was what became known as the Gold King Mine disaster. The Environmental Protection Agency spilled 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater into a river in This was water filled with toxic substances like arsenic and lead. It flowed to New Mexico and Utah, through the land of the Navajo Nation and the Southern Ute Indian tribe. There are 200,000 people who drink water from the river system that the EPA poisoned. Farmers and ranchers couldn't use the water for their crops or their animals.  The other disaster the Environmental Protection Agency helped to cause was what happened in Flint, The EPA failed to do the proper oversight. As a result, thousands of children were exposed to high levels of lead in their drinking water. The Agency knew about the dangers to the public health and for months did nothing to warn the people.  These are just two scandals where the Environmental Protection Agency actually harmed people's health because the EPA was negligent. There are also many ways the Agency has harmed families and the American economy, not by accident but intentionally. It has issued thousands of pages of regulations trying to shut down the entire coal industry in the United Since 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency has come out with nearly 200 new regulations.  According to the American Action Forum, the total cost of all of this new redtape is about $340 billion. The Agency has piled enormous new restrictions and costs onto American families and businesses, all to produce miniscule benefits.  One of them was the so-called Clean Power States sued to block this destructive bureaucratic overreach. The courts had to step in and tell Washington not so fast.  We should be looking for ways to make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs for American families. That is not what the Environmental Protection Agency did with its power regulations.  The EPA also put out a new rule that dramatically expanded its own control over what it calls waters of the United The Agency declared that it has control over things like irrigation ditches and backyard ponds all across Two different courts have blocked this rule from taking effect. Why? Because it goes far beyond the Agency's own authority.  For 8 years now, the leaders of the EPA have not had their priorities straight. They have been pursuing a political agenda instead of focusing on what should be the Agency's core mission. The Environmental Protection Agency was created for a reason. It was created because America needed someone to perform this mission. There is a right way to do the job. We can strike the right balance so we protect our environment while allowing our economy to grow.  My home State of Wyoming is one of the most pristine States in the country, one of the most beautiful places in the world, as well as one of the most energy-rich States in the country. Wyoming has struck the right balance. We have done it successfully and so have many other We can address threats to our environment best through the cooperation of States, towns, Indian tribes, and Washington--a cooperation.  The quality of America's air, water, and land are local concerns as much as they are national concerns. The Environmental Protection Agency should not try to dictate regulations from Washington without consulting its partners at all levels.  Much of the work of the EPA was intended to give States a chance to take action first. Federal regulators are meant to be a backstop, acting when States or communities fail to act. Restoring this proper order and restoring the partnership of States with the EPA is essential to making sure people see the Agency as legitimate once again. The Agency needs to learn to listen before it acts.  We can also restore the Environmental Protection Agency by restating its commitment to the rule of law. That is why the American people elect a Congress--because of the rule of law. The Agency must enforce the laws as they are written by The Agency cannot write the laws, cannot ignore the parts of the laws it doesn't like, although that is exactly what this EPA has been doing.  We all know the EPA used to do very good work. In the past, it protected America's environment while understanding that there need to be reasonable regulations that allow people to use our natural resources. Every American wants clean air, clean water, and commonsense protection for our species. That will not change. We need the EPA to do its job, and we need it to do the job right.  Through 6 hours of questioning before our committee last week, Scott Pruitt showed that he understands the need to return the Environmental Protection Agency back to its proper course. He showed he is committed to working as a partner with Americans all across the country to find the best ways to address the threats to our environment. His record as the attorney general of Oklahoma showed that he is committed to restoring and maintaining the rule of law.  I am confident that Attorney General Pruitt will be able to right the ship at the I am confident that he can restore the balance between the benefits the Agency can deliver for Americans with the costs that it imposes.

3066,topic-id,1489,"Mr.President, Mr.Trump's poorly drawn and implemented Executive order blocking refugees from the United States sacrifices fundamental American values and does not make us safer.  For the first time in memory, the order imposes a ban on all refugees entering our country, many of whom are fleeing war or who risk persecution for their religious or political beliefs. The order affects many thousands of children, women, and men whom our government has vetted for years and cleared for rescue.  President Trump's action--taken in the first days of his new administration, for political reasons, without regard for real world consequences and without the expertise of our national security professionals or even some of those appointed by the President himself--represents a rare, but shameful, departure from a constitutional heritage that has made America strong and a beacon to oppressed people throughout the world.[[Page S473]]  For generations, immigrants and refugees have come to our country to flee religious persecution and to seek a better life. Indeed, these are the very people who founded our original colonies. Although, as now, we have occasionally failed to live up to our ideals, over generations the United States has accepted millions of refugees from around the world.  My own family is part of this story, as so many people's families in this Chamber are. My mom was born in Poland in 1938 while Nazi tanks massed at the border. She and her parents miraculously survived the Holocaust--one of the worst human events in history.  After the war, after arriving in Sweden and then Mexico City, they were able to come to New York City in 1950. They wanted to come to the United States because it was the only country in the world where they believed they could rebuild their shattered lives. And they did.  This weekend, my mom joined hundreds of thousands of Americans to call on the President to change course, knowing that our family's struggles in Europe require us to recognize the danger and persecution facing families throughout the Middle East today.  Out of a population of 22 million, almost 5 million Syrians have fled to neighboring countries--some to Europe--and have registered as refugees. More than half of those displaced are children.  According to the United Nations, more than half of the remaining Syrian population--6 million of them children--require assistance such as food, water, and health care. Nearly one in four people in Lebanon today--tonight--is a Syrian refugee, and the fourth largest city in Jordan is now a refugee camp.  In the wake of President Trump's refugee ban, it seems useful to ask--and I am sure the American people are asking--why are so many millions of people fleeing their homes, their countries, and their history?  They are doing it to save their lives--and, in many cases, their children's lives--from ISIS's medieval barbarism and Assad's unrelenting brutality. They seek to escape the murder, rape, detention, and torture they suffer because of their religion or their ethnicity or both.  Assad is their enemy. ISIS is their enemy. Today's refugees are fleeing the violence and extremism that threatens our own national security. Their enemies are our enemies. The same is true of the refugees from Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, and  Does this mean we have an obligation simply to open our borders to them? Of course not. We have a national security imperative to ensure that no terrorist tries to sneak into the United States as part of the refugee program.  I have long said that the burden of proof is not on the United States to accept a refugee. Rather, the refugee has the burden to demonstrate that they are not a threat to the United We have no obligation, nor should we, to take anything on faith. It is for this reason that refugees are more thoroughly vetted than anyone else entering the United They must pass stringent screening standards to ensure that they pose no threat, a process that can take up to 2 years.  First, the United Nations screens them and collects biometric data. Only those who pass that test are then referred to the United And, by the way, no refugee knows at that stage of the process to which country they will be referred--to the United States or to any other country that is accepting refugees. After that, multiple agencies--including the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the State Department, and our intelligence agencies--conduct rigorous screenings. This process includes repeated biometric checks, several layers of biographical and background screening, health checks, and interviews. Syrian refugees, in particular, receive enhanced scrutiny through an additional security risk review by specially trained officers.  Out of the nearly 60,000 people referred to the United States, only about 12,000 have been accepted. Of those Syrian refugees accepted by the United States, three-quarters are women and children and half were under 13 in 2016.  We are the leader of the free world, a republic founded on the premise of religious freedom and a society that for generations has called out to the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to be free. That is who we are. Yet, in the name of fighting terrorism in his first week as President, Mr.Trump has sacrificed what has made us exceptional and has banned these children and their mothers from our shores.  These children are no different than Omran Daqneesh, whose distant stare from the back of an ambulance in Aleppo bore witness to the senseless violence he suffered; or Alan Kurdi, whose lifeless body on a Turkish beach condemned the worst savagery of humankind.  Once he learns the details--if he chooses to study them--if President Trump wishes to make our vetting even more extreme than it already is, I guess he may do so. But banning refugees and prioritizing immigration by religion or ethnicity simultaneously abandons our principles and weakens our counterterrorism efforts. It sends the wrong message to our Muslim partners who fight with us in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, including civilians in those countries who have risked their lives alongside our troops. It also hands ISIS a recruiting tool by fueling their narrative that the Western and Muslim worlds cannot coexist in peace.  If the President really wants to secure our borders and ensure extremists stay out of the country, there are far better alternatives, and they are alternatives that are not at war with who we are as We should work together to close security gaps in our Visa Waiver Program and partner with European countries to better track the flow of foreign fighters throughout Europe and the Middle We should also do more to counter the ability of terrorists to radicalize and recruit, both here at home and abroad. We should do more to equip our agencies with tools and capabilities to degrade the ability of terrorist organizations--in particular, ISIS--to persuade and inspire using social media. Congress should enact ideas passed by the Senate in 2013 to strengthen border security, double the number of border agents, and address visa overstays.  By tackling real vulnerabilities and investing in smart security solutions, we can secure not only our borders but also our values, and we will not repeat the darkest moments of our history when America turned away from those fleeing persecution around the world.  A year ago, I came to the Senate floor to share a note sent to me by my grandparents on my first birthday. It is a message that bears repeating tonight. The year was 1965--15 years after my mother and grandparents came to this country after surviving the horrors of the Holocaust in This is what they wrote:       The ancient Greeks gave the world the high ideals of      democracy, in search of which your dear mother and we came to      the hospitable shores of beautiful America in 1950. We have      been happy here ever since, beyond our greatest dreams and      expectations, with democracy, freedom, and love, and      humanity's greatest treasure. We hope that when you grow up,      you will help develop in other parts of the world a greater      understanding of these American values.  Like so many immigrants, my grandparents knew how special these American values are and how rare they are. We cannot take them for granted or subvert them for a political moment. These values make us who we are.  Edmund Burke once wrote: ``In history a great volume is unrolled for our instruction, drawing the materials of future wisdom from the past errors and infirmities of mankind.''  This is a time when we can learn from the past errors and infirmities of humankind. We cannot turn our backs on women, children, and families who risk persecution, starvation, or death.  The President should rescind this Executive order. If not, the Senate should end the ban immediately and start a serious conversation on how to make our country safe again in a manner that is consistent with our fundamental values.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS467-2.txt,1965,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,30.0,January
3067,topic-id,901,"Mr.President, I am honored to follow that very eloquent speech by my colleague from Colorado and to be followed on the floor by our colleague from  We are here today with stories. Every one of us has a story going back one[[Page S474]]generation, maybe two or three, maybe five or ten, but we all have an immigrant story. Most of those immigrant stories are about people coming here to seek hope, opportunity, and, yes, safety; to escape violence and persecution; to come here for refuge.  I met one of those refugees over this weekend in West Hartford at a Holocaust remembrance ceremony. Abby Weiner is a Romanian Jew who survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald but lost his parents there. He was honored by Voices of Hope at this Holocaust remembrance ceremony at a synagogue in West Hartford, attended by 500, 700 people. There was a massive outpouring of support for him and for the values that are represented by people who come here as immigrants fleeing persecution and violence, as he did in Nazi He said: The words came before the bullets and gas chambers. The words of Nazi Germany came before the bullets and gas chambers. Words have consequences. Edicts and orders have consequences.  When I spoke, I told my own story--a proud story of my father, who also came here from Nazi Germany in 1935. He was 17 years old. He spoke virtually no English, he had not much more than the shirt on his back, and he knew almost no one. This great country, the greatest in the history of the world, gave him a chance to succeed. He was a proud How sad and ashamed he would be today to see actions by the President of the United States that ban a group coming to this country based on their religion--a ban that is antithetical to our history, our values, our Constitution, and the rule of law.  I salute Sally Yates, who has taken a stand based on moral and legal principle in the highest tradition of the Department of Justice, saying that these orders cannot be defended and that the rule of law and morality is more important than the politics of the moment and the impulsive edicts of a ruler who apparently fails to understand that law--or, at least his administration does.  It raises the question of whether the next Attorney General--she is only acting--will have the strength and courage to uphold the rule of law. Tomorrow, I will vote against our respected and admired colleague, Jeff Sessions, because I believe that the next Attorney General must be a champion--a steadfast advocate and protector of the rule of law and rights and liberties that are overridden and abridged by this order banning people from Muslim-majority nations, in effect a ban on a religious group.  We are better than this kind of discriminatory edict. We know it harms mainly children and families fleeing violence and oppression. Refugees like those children have helped to shape and build this We are stronger because of our diversity. We are a nation of immigrants. Our strength comes from the talents, energies, strengths, and vibrancy they bring to this country.  Often, when I am feeling down about our public life, I go to immigration and naturalization ceremonies. They occur every Friday in courts around the State of I welcome people who are becoming citizens, and I say to them: Thank you for becoming a citizen of the greatest country in the world. You are a source of strength for us, and you have taken a test that most Americans could not pass.  They laugh because they know it is true. They will never take for granted what it means to be a citizen of this country. I look at them in their diversity, and I know that is That is our future.  We will be less safe because of this order, which will alienate allies and deny us sources of intelligence to troops on the ground that we need to win the war against ISIS, and we must win that war. It will provide a recruiting tool to ISIS, convincing young people who may be tempted to join their ranks that, in fact, this country is engaged in a war against Islam, which is utterly and totally untrue. It will discourage people from within the United States who are part of the Muslim community from coming forth when they see threats and could provide information that would forestall an attack by violent extremists within our country.  This order makes us less safe, but it weakens us mainly in a deeper moral sense: It is wrong. It is wrong for this great country, devoted and founded on the ideals of welcoming people seeking that beacon of hope and protection and opportunity.  The Statue of Liberty is a symbol, but the ideals and the values are living. The damage that has been done to them can be repaired. We must repair it and reverse this order. That is why I have sponsored legislation that will rescind it, and why I am proud to join my colleagues today on the floor of the Senate to say: Rip up this order, Mr.With all respect, do the right thing. Be on the right side of history and the right side of our Rip up this illegal order.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

2889,topic-id,7548,"Mr.President, very good to see you. I want to again, as I stated in the past, thank the staff. We are obviously pushing late into the night, and there are unsung heroes who are here in the U.Senate working in a nonpartisan way, keeping the Senate going. I want to thank them all for being here tonight. Definitely, the folks who are typing with their fingers are heroic. They have muscles in them. Thank you very much for your work. Of course, I want to just highlight the pages and thank them for yet another late night, when they still have calculus homework, I am sure, to work on.  Mr.President, I am honored to be able to join my colleagues, three of whom themselves are some of the great voices, in my opinion, in the United States on issues of the environment, issues of protecting the health and safety of our communities: Senators Merkley, Whitehouse, and I am grateful to be able to stand with them, joining them in a chorus of conviction about our opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt to serve as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  The EPA is a critical Federal It was established through an Executive order by President Nixon and charged with the protection of human health and the protection of the environment. Given the pressing health issues, environmental challenges we face in our Nation, and frankly the growing environmental challenges around our planet today, we should make sure we are confirming an Administrator who has a conviction for the protection of the health and safety of people; that he or she prioritizes the well-being of Americans and is focused tirelessly, exhaustively, on making sure the mission of the Agency is made real, that other factors, conflicts, wealth of industries--that their 1 concern is not all of those things but is really the health and safety of people, of Americans, because we know what it means when the health or safety of Americans is undermined.  This idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is completely compromised if cancer rates are going up because of toxic dumps or superfunds or asthma rates are epidemic because of toxins in the air.  We need a person who is in charge of making sure we are not prioritizing polluters or industries; that we are prioritizing people first and their safety. This is not just a moral calling of this Agency, but it is actually a practical one too. It is an economic one, too, because the cost to society of pollution, we already know, is extraordinarily high.  I see this in the community where I live. I am a proud resident of Newark, NJ, but I see a polluted river, the Passaic River, that has caused health issues, that has taken away sports and recreation, actually taken away a source of bounty of fish and clams and other shellfish. In addition to that, now it is costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up the waste and mess that was made by corporations that were allowed to get away with that polluting. That is the common sense of this.  Not only is it an issue of justice--something our country stands for, this ideal of justice--not only is it compromising life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, but it also ultimately costs us so much more not to be vigilant in the protection of our environment. It is actually stealing, as we have seen all across this country--stealing from future generations. As you pollute now, you are stealing from future generations and calling it profit.  So this is what I see as a person who is in charge of this Agency, someone who is putting health, common sense, pragmatism before the short-term avarice that often has undermined the great bounty of this  In this particular case, in this moment in time, with this Agency started by a Republican, we now have a President who is not only putting someone up who is singularly unqualified--and as a person who worked with EPA Administrators, Republican and Democratic, we had a great Republican Governor from New Jersey who was the head of the Republicans and Democrats, if you compare this person, it is my conviction that he is singularly unqualified to lead the Environmental Protection Agency at this moment. That is Scott  I do not believe Scott Pruitt will lead this Agency in a way that upholds this critical mission in our country. Again, I don't care if you are in a so-called red State or so-called blue State, I don't care what your background is, your religion, your race, if you are living in an environment that is toxic--the air, the water--it is undermining your ability to enjoy the liberty and the freedom and justice of our country.  So if you look at this individual, Scott Pruitt, if you look at his track record, you will see that his actual work has undermined the mission of the Agency that he is now nominated to lead.  At his confirmation hearing, Scott Pruitt stated, as attorney general for the State of Oklahoma, he was responsible for protecting the welfare of Oklahoma citizens. This was his statement. Yet during his 6 years as attorney general, Scott Pruitt spent his time doing the bidding of the polluters, and filing or joining 14 lawsuits against the EPA's effort to clean up the air and water of a State, challenging water and clean air rules.  On top of this, on top of his track record, not for doing things to improve the quality of the air and water but doing things consistently to fight the EPA--on top of this, on one of the largest issues going on with our planet right now, Mr.Pruitt says clearly that he denies the science and the reality of climate change.  So many in his own community who have come to this building to give their voice and their facts believe this person being nominated has a nonexistent record in Oklahoma when it comes to protecting the environment and that he actually aided and abetted many of the people who were doing some of the worst harm to the water and to the air.  Mr.Pruitt seems to say this is a philosophical thing; that he is a What amazed me, as I dealt with Mr.Pruitt, engaged with him during the hearings, is it exposed the fact that he not only tried to get the Federal Government to stop acting to clean up the air and water and constrain the avaristic polluting of these industries, but he actually worked to make sure the State government didn't have the power to do it as well, as I will show momentarily.  But here is somebody who is not into philosophy. The driving force is his picking polluters over people. Mr.Pruitt also has serious conflicts of interest. What is amazing to me is that he has stonewalled the Senate, claiming to us that all of the emails from his agency that should be open--listen, we went through a whole Presidential campaign with all of this talk about email. How ironic is it that we are now putting someone up for EPA Administrator who suddenly is not allowing open public record requests to view his emails.  This is hiding, as Senator Whitehouse has gone through--not allowing the public to see what is their right to see--the emails and communications he has had with polluting industries, as well as other organizations plowing money into his campaign and others. Not only has he denied us access to that, but he has used lies that this could not be produced.  Well, we have just had a judge in Oklahoma, contrary to what he said, force the viewing of these emails. This is really important. Here is a judge who literally calls his failure to release the emails an abject failure, that not releasing these emails in accordance to the public information laws of the State--the judge called it an ``abject failure'' to not produce this information and called it ``unreasonable under the law''; those are the quotes--and ordered him to release these thousands of emails, to release the first tranche on  These are records pertaining to communications with Devon Energy, Peabody Coal, and other organizations. These should be released on We are going to see a lot in these emails.  Then he was ordered to release another tranche to organizations like ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council that supports a tremendous amount of partisan policy, the[[Page S1288]]State Policy Network, and other organizations. Those will be released in 10 days.  By the way, the requests for those go back to April 27, 2016. So one thing I have to say that I object to--and actually I am shocked and appalled that, suddenly, when you have a judge now forcing the release of these emails, which are going to give us transparency, which are going to answer the questions many of us have been asking about the conflicts he might have and how he used or potentially abused his power working in collusion with private industry, we can now see all of this plainly. But suddenly, now, this vote on Mr.Pruitt has been scheduled for tomorrow. Why not wait to let the Senators who have been asking for these emails for months--now that we are finally getting them, why are we now rushing a vote before we get to analyze his record?  So for these reasons--his lack of qualifications, his demonstration of working against the mission of the Agency, his denial of something as important and significant and planetarily consequential as climate change, his clear demonstration of his work on behalf of polluting industries, and the potential for serious conflicts of interest--we should not only oppose him, but at the very least what we should be asking is to have the vote postponed until the transparency that has been requested by Senators is achieved.  Any of these deficiencies individually should have us move the vote or vote against, but let me take some of these issues now. Let me look right now at the issue of climate change and his positions. The EPA is the most important Agency in the United States in the fight against climate change. Through its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is tasked with regulating harmful air pollutants, including carbon dioxide.  I do not believe that Scott Pruitt will adhere to this EPA mandate. It is an EPA mandate that he has shown a disregard for that he will be tasked with enforcing. He not only has no record of enforcing it, but even believing in the harm that these pollutants can cause. He has openly questioned the need for climate change action on numerous occasions. He is on the record for pondering whether climate change is even happening at all.  Less than a year ago, he told a public audience the debate about climate change is just that, a debate. He has said that climate change is a religious belief and a political bumper sticker. Scott Pruitt appeared to walk back that language on climate denial during his confirmation hearing before the committee of jurisdiction, the Environment and Public Works Committee, last month. He claims that science tells us that the climate is changing, and human activity in some manner impacts climate change. The human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuous debate and dialogue, as well it should be.  Well, I am happy to see that he is moving. But here Mr.Pruitt now is taking a different tactic. He is acknowledging that our climate is changing, without accepting the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary cause. But this seemingly softer language is actually a damaging tactic and in many ways is just as damaging as outright climate denial.  This is a hallmark of the new strategy: Hey, let's admit the climate is changing, but let's try to cast doubt on whether human activity is doing it. The language may be different, but the implication is the same: If we don't know how much human activity contributes to climate change, hey, then we don't need to do anything about the crisis.  This reminds me of Big There were these big tobacco scientists who made their living insisting that the link between cigarettes and lung cancer was uncertain. To cast doubt on it was their strategy--that link between lung cancer and smoking. This is a strategy we have seen before, again and again and again. Even though there is a consensus of science about smoking--or in the case of climate change--cast doubt, cast doubt. That is what Scott Pruitt does; he is a merchant of doubt when it comes to climate change.  He is attempting to sow uncertainty where there is, in fact, considerable certainty. As a result, he is deliberately undermining and misrepresenting the reality of the case. This is the person we want to put--who is intended by the President to be put at the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, someone who is a merchant of doubt.  Well, let me just go through the climate change evidence. Let's be clear about the facts. There are extraordinary indicators to provide strong evidence not just for climate change but for rapid, human-caused climate change. Atmospheric carbon dioxide now is higher than at any point in recorded history; 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001; the pace of global sea level rise has doubled in the last decade; surface ocean acidity has increased by 30 percent since the beginning of the industrial revolution.  Those are dramatic changes in what is happening to our oceans. The evidence of this is global, from the bleaching of reefs to the killing of the biomass, to the extinction of species.  Arctic sea ice is declining by over 13 percent per decade. Just yesterday, scientists published a large research synthesis that has detected a decline in the amount of dissolved oxygen in oceans around the world, a long-predicted result of climate change that is expected to have severe consequences for the marine ecosystem and fisheries.  Some 97 percent of the actively published climate scientists agree that these climate change trends--I would say crises--are extremely likely due to human activity. Scientists this month released an estimate that human activity is causing the climate to change 170 times faster than natural forces alone would cause.  I just sat with an incredible author who wrote ``The Sixth Extinction,'' a book that documents the rapidity with which we are now in a period of global climatic extinction, with species disappearing from the planet Earth at a speed that she compared, in the larger perspective of time, to the impact of a massive asteroid that was one of the major extinction periods. This is happening rapidly, like no period before in history, except that of massive climactic events like the asteroid hitting This is a crisis. The crisis is already being felt in terms of human impacts. Right now, we know that, unabated, these climate trends will continue to have impacts, and they will grow more devastating for our planet, especially for our children and our grandchildren.  By 2045, some east coast cities could flood three times a week. Scott Pruitt's home State may not have to worry about this, but New Jersey, a coastal State--we now have everyone from people in the military to businesses, to leaders in government, all realizing that this is going to have a serious effect on our State and we have to start preparing now to deal with that crisis.  Weather patterns are going to become more erratic. Hurricanes and other major storms in the North Atlantic will become stronger and more intense. Drought and heat waves will increase in parts of Arizona, California, Texas, and, yes, even Oklahoma could exceed 100 degrees for over 120 days a year. The U.crop yields will drop significantly. Estimates suggest that under a business-as-usual scenario, by 2100, wheat yields could drop 20 percent, maize by 40 percent, soybeans 40 percent, causing global spikes in food prices.  The rising seas, with more intense storms and worsening drought, could create climate refugees. In fact, we are seeing climate refugees already form small island states. The United States is already facing the reality, with many of these people from around the globe, that several communities in low-lying coastal areas in Alaska and Louisiana are in the process of relocating to higher ground. It is happening right now, where you are seeing evacuations from coastal areas that are no longer habitable.  Regarding climate refugees, I would like to quote Pope He said:       Many of the poor live in areas particularly affected by the      phenomenon related to warming, and their means of subsistence      are largely dependent on natural reserves and ecosystem      services such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. They have      no other financial activities or resources which can enable      them to adapt to climate change or to face natural disasters.      Their access to social services and protection is very      limited.[[Page S1289]]  The Pope continues:       There has been a tragic rise in the number of migrants      seeking to flee from growing poverty caused by environmental      degradation. They are not recognized by international      conventions as refugees; they bear the loss of the lives they      have left behind, without enjoying the legal protection      whatsoever. Sadly, there is widespread indifference to their      suffering, which is even now taking place throughout our      world.  All of this--and perhaps lastly--it is this global insecurity that will grow. Major climate events like drought and floods have clearly been linked to violent conflicts around the globe. Climate extremes are worsening tensions in some parts of the world. There is a widespread international scientific agreement on the scope of this problem and international urgency about doing something about it.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has unequivocally concluded that there is a clear human influence on the climate system. To keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, the IPCC estimates that we need to reduce emissions by 40 to 70 percent by 2050, compared to the 2010 levels. Warming beyond this level, 2 degrees Celsius, is often cited as that threshold.  Warming beyond this level will result in surface temperatures above anything our planet has experienced in the last 100,000 years. Given current emissions scenarios, keeping temperature increases below this 2-degree threshold will be extremely challenging, but this only underscores the urgent need for rapid and dramatic emissions reductions.  Unsurprisingly, given these numbers, there is also an international agreement on the need for action. We are seeing people come together and make strong commitments. In 2015, 195 countries adopted the first-ever binding global climate change agreement in The national commitments established in the Paris Agreement would put us on a trajectory to limit warming to 2.7 degrees Celsius--not enough of a limit, but it is a start. It is a start and a remarkable moment in planetary cooperation.  There is no question that given planetary cooperation, there is no question that given a consensus of scientists, there is no question that, given the factual urgencies being created by climate change, Scott Pruitt is on the wrong side of history in refusing to acknowledge global scientific and political consensus on climate change and the urgency that we need to act. We are potentially going to put someone who stands against this global consensus in charge of the  Much of the opposition to climate action in our country is motivated by false narratives about economic costs--people who are selling this idea that somehow doing the responsible thing is going to hurt our economy. The idea that addressing climate change could actually make us less of a wealthy nation is propaganda, and it is propaganda that is being pushed by the people who are doing significant amounts of the polluting, the people whom Scott Pruitt has spent time advocating on behalf of.  Last year, Mr.Pruitt parroted the argument that fighting climate change is bad for the economy. He parroted that on an Oklahoma radio station, arguing that climate action is ``hurting our ability to manufacture, to grow our economy, it's hurting the fossil fuel industry, it's an assault, and it's all done outside of the Constitution and the law, which makes it even more egregious.''  That is a strong statement. Besides the fact that addressing climate change is very much within the law, this economic devastation narrative is simply patently false. Just last month, a renowned climate economist who had long argued that emissions reductions would damage economic growth actually changed his mind after running a more accurate analysis of carbon dioxide's impact on temperature.  In fact, responding to climate change will help grow new parts of our economy. Last year, nearly half a million Americans were employed in whole or in part by the solar energy and wind energy industries. Wind energy jobs grew by 32 percent in 2016, and solar jobs grew by 25 percent. Solar jobs, in fact, have tripled since 2010. We should be focusing on actively expanding our promising clean energy sector. Frankly, we should be racing, as the great Nation of innovation that we are, to lead in these areas and not let our competitors get there first. We should be doing the breakthroughs, making the investments, growing the jobs.  Scott Pruitt is one of the last stand-offs. In fact, the GOP--the Republican Party--is the only major political party in the developed world that refuses to acknowledge that climate change poses a problem. All of our other allies--their right parties, their left parties; you name it--all the other major political parties on the planet Earth recognize that this is a problem, but it is unconscionable that we, here in America, are still pushing a narrative that is contrary to the global consensus and the consensus of science, that denies the reality of human-caused climate change and the urgent need for action.  Recent polling says that nearly 8 out of 10 registered voters--people on the right and the left, especially with our millennial generation--support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Seven out of 10 registered voters support setting strict carbon dioxide limits on coal-fired powerplants, a core aspect of the Clean Power Plan that Scott Pruitt and the Trump administration have vowed to repeal. Seven out of 10 registered voters think the United States should participate in the Paris Agreement, another critical moment where the planet was coming together in cooperation. Seven out of 10 voters agree that we should be a part of the global movement to cooperate on dealing with climate change.  Nothing in Scott Pruitt's record as Oklahoma attorney general suggests he will uphold Americans' desire for climate action. A public servant who abides by the wishes of polluting industries, instead of the wishes of the American people, instead of the real tangible health challenges in their own State--someone who is standing with the industries and contrary to people suffering in their own State--has not earned the right to be our Administrator of the  Look at his record in Well, let's just start with air pollution. At his confirmation hearing, I asked Scott Pruitt if he knew how many children in his State had asthma. He did not know. So I informed him. According to the data published by the American Lung Association, more than 111,000 children in Oklahoma--more than 10 percent of all the children in Oklahoma, so more than 1 out of every 10 children in Oklahoma--has asthma. This is one of the highest State asthma rates in the This is a crisis.  As former mayor of Newark, I know the devastating impact that asthma has on parents and children. This is the number one health-related reason why kids miss school not only in my city, not only around my State--it is still one of the top reasons, if not the top--but in our  I have talked to parents and teachers about this crisis, about kids who are struggling to breathe, children rushed to emergency rooms, children missing school. This is literally undermining kids' ability to succeed in school and to get the benefits of life from academic success.  In a State where more than 1 out of every 10 kids--a State where more than 10 percent of your children--have asthma, clean air should be an urgency.  So what did Scott Pruitt do, as it relates to air pollution? Well, he actually took every major possible opportunity to help the polluters, joining with them to block the EPA from taking action to clean up the air and protect the children in his  When I say ``joining with them,'' and that is not a hyperbolic exaggeration. Scott Pruitt sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency in 2011, accusing Federal regulators of grossly overestimating the amount of air pollution that natural gas companies were releasing from well sites in The letter was sent to the EPA on Mr.Pruitt's official attorney general letterhead. So we might assume its contents represented the State's official stance on what was best for the welfare of Oklahoma families and children because, as he testified, his job was to represent what was best for the welfare of Oklahoma's families and children.  This is what he said in his testimony here in the This is what he said. That was his job. So he is writing a letter, challenging the EPA, saying they grossly overestimated the amount[[Page S1290]]of air pollution that natural gas companies were releasing.  Well, the problem is that we would be wrong if we had thought that this was something that his office came up with. No, what Mr.Pruitt did was actually take a letter written by lobbyists at Devon Energy, one of the State's largest oil and gas companies, change maybe a few words--maybe three, maybe four--and, basically, took these words, took off their letterhead, put the same letter on his letterhead, and passed it along to the  Remember, Devon Energy is one of those organizations that we want the emails from, back and forth between his office.  Now, did he go out from his position and do research on air quality? Did he interview families with asthma? Did he test air quality? How did he come up with his conclusions that what the EPA was doing was wrong?  Well, clearly he couldn't write his own letters. He just took the information from Devon Energy, put it on his letterhead, and sent it off. He was doing the bidding of one of the people, one of the companies that was undermining the air quality for the 1 out of 10 children that have asthma.  So we, as U.Senators, who believe in thorough vetting--we hear a lot about intense vetting for refugees; I am a guy who just wants a thorough vetting for nominees--asked for his communications, using public FOIA, or the Freedom of Information What are your communications with this company that seems to be writing your letters for you?  What he said to us was--he stonewalled: I can't get those things to you.  Well, thank God a judge in Oklahoma has now ordered him to release it, calling a failure to do so an abject failure.  Well, great, we are going to see the letters to understand what kind of cooperation or even collusion he had with these companies, but we are going to see them too late because the vote is tomorrow. We are going to get that information a day, 2 days, a few days too late.  So here is someone who says his job, as attorney general, was to represent the welfare of children and families. Here we have a State with a crisis in air quality, a crisis in asthma, and where the EPA is working to do something about air quality in the State, and he is coming to conclusions that we don't know if they are his or not, but we know there are industries that do not want to change their practices at all and want to continue to pollute the air.  Whose side is Scott Pruitt on--the side of the children in his State, 1 out of every 10 who has asthma, or of Devon Energy? And we want to put him in charge of the EPA, without even having a thorough understanding of what his relationship was with these companies.  Well, my colleague did his own exhaustive research about the campaign funding he had received and more support from companies like this, and it creates an implication. Well, let's get to the bottom of what is happening. Let's see the emails before we vote. What do these say to these corporations?  I asked him: He allowed polluting companies to write emails to the EPA on his letterhead; did he let any children with asthma or their parents write letters that he then just put on his letterhead--people who were suffering from the poor air quality?  Later, the director of government relations at Devon Energy emailed Mr.Pruitt's office--this, we do know--to express gratitude to the attorney general for sending the letter.  Beyond this note of thanks, there were other clear benefits of this type of behavior for Mr.Energy industry lobbyists and executives worked tirelessly to help Mr.Pruitt raise his profile as president of the Republican Attorneys General As president of this nationwide group, Mr.Pruitt set up something called the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a super PAC that allowed corporations benefiting from the actions of Mr.Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general to make unlimited and anonymous donations. This super PAC raised $16 million in essentially untraceable fundraising in 2014 alone.  Companies were partnering with him to fight the EPA in its efforts to fight for cleaner air in a State with children struggling from widespread asthma challenges. This would be bad enough, but this in many ways is only the beginning of Mr.Pruitt's collaborations with air polluting corporations. Scott Pruitt filed two lawsuits challenging the EPA mercury and air toxics standards.  So the EPA is working to clean up mercury. He filed lawsuits against the EPA to stop them. These were the first Federal standards to require powerplants to limit their emissions of such toxic air pollutants. The EPA's final rule set standards for known hazardous air pollutants emitted by coal- and oil-fired powerplants above a certain generating capacity.  This rule sought to limit Americans' exposure to airborne toxics like mercury. Mercury in the air settles on the surfaces of water and land where rain washes it further into surface water. Once in the water, mercury is converted to a toxic chemical called methylmercury, and this accumulates in increasing levels up the aquatic food chain. It is one of the reasons that doctors often will advise pregnant women not to eat certain fish because of the high mercury content. Why is there a high mercury content in some of those fish? This is the reason: mercury spewing out into our air, coming down and settling on land and water, getting into our waterways, and working its way up the aquatic chain, ultimately getting into our food.  Humans, especially young children and pregnant women, are vulnerable to mercury exposure from consuming contaminated fish or shellfish. This is a tragedy. Over 400,000 newborns are affected by mercury pollution each year in the United States--400,000 of our children, the greatest hope for our country, 400,000 children affected by mercury pollution each year in the United  What does mercury exposure do? It damages the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and it damages the immune system of people of all ages but, again, particularly vulnerable populations. It is a horrific toxin. This is not an argument. It is scientifically clear that the largest source of mercury air emissions are our power companies. It doesn't mean we want to shut the powerplants down; it doesn't mean we want to stop them. We want to take measures to remove the mercury emissions.  So what happened in the State of Oklahoma to hundreds of thousands of our children? What happened in the State of Oklahoma? The man who was on the job--he told the U.Senate that his job was protecting the welfare of the people. What Mr.Pruitt did is attack the He said that they lacked the legal authority to regulate powerplant mercury emissions and other hazardous pollutants under the mercury and air toxics standards. He did not do this once; he did it twice. When the EPA moved under the mandate they had, he tried to stop them twice.  He went even further than that because he apparently doesn't even believe that mercury is toxic to humans. In his challenge to the EPA's mercury rule, this is what he wrote: ``The record does not support the EPA's findings that mercury . . . pose[s] public health hazards.''  Reading this was astonishing to me. This was written by someone whom we want to put in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency? I am sure that even his family was told not to eat certain fish because of mercury. It is astonishing to me that he would say that ``the record does not support the EPA's findings that mercury . . . pose[s] public health hazards.''  Mercury is a scientifically proven, well documented, deadly neurotoxin, and the person we are about to elevate to head the Environmental Protection Agency when he had the chance to fight to protect people from mercury not only fought to stop efforts to restrain mercury being put into the air and into our water, he went as far as to say: Hey, this stuff isn't so bad.  While he was focused on attacking these mercury standards and denying its status as a toxic metal, the number of lakes in Oklahoma with mercury-related fish consumption advisories has doubled since 2010. Think about this. The attorney general, in charge of protecting people, has the Federal EPA saying: Hey, you have a problem here. Let's address it. The mercury levels in your lakes have doubled since 2010. The scientists and experts in your State are[[Page S1291]]releasing advisories to your community that state: Don't eat the fish from Oklahoma's lakes. His response is to fight against efforts to clean that up in support of those industries, as we are finding out, that are pumping money into his super  If I lived in a community and I lived next to a river that had deadly toxins in it--I have spent my entire professional career as a city councilman, as a mayor, and now here to fight to clean the Passaic I swore an oath to defend people. I am fighting for them.  What did Pruitt do when he had a shot to be there for the people who were living by lakes that literally had a doubling of the advisories about fish consumption? What did he do? Did he stand for the people or the polluters? What did he do? It is clear what he did. He stood with the polluters.  But there is more. Scott Pruitt filed a lawsuit challenging EPA's 2015 national ambient air quality standards for ozone. The Clean Air Act required the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards for air pollutants considered harmful to the public health and the environment.  Under this authority in 2015, the EPA strengthened the standards for ground-level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion, based on substantial scientific evidence about ozone levels on health. This updated ozone standard improved public health protections, particularly for children, older adults, and people who suffer from lung diseases like asthma. The new standard will prevent hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks. This is not rhetoric; this is scientifically based. The reductions will save hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks.  As already stated, Oklahomans have some of the highest incidence of asthma in our country. But like the mercury contamination in the lakes, this excessive asthma rate did not stop Scott Pruitt from trying to block EPA from regulating harmful air pollutants under the national ambient air quality standards. So this is Scott  The list goes on and on and on, of his attacks on the environment, of his doing the bidding of the polluting corporations, of literally taking his letterhead and taking their letters and putting them on his letterhead and using that, not his own research, not his own interviews with scientists, not his work connecting to people with asthma--which, unfortunately, in his State with one of the highest asthma rates isn't hard to find--not talking to the people who were in his State releasing advisories not to eat the fish because of increased mercury content. What he did was the bidding of the polluting industries, and he sued the EPA again and again and again and again and again.  The EPA estimated in 2015 on their regional haze rule--this is the Agency he is about to take over--that implementing the rule would prevent 1,600 premature deaths, 2,200 nonfatal heart attacks, 960 hospital admissions, and over 1 million lost schooldays and workdays. That is the EPA's estimate on one rule, the regional haze rule.  Think about that. He is going to lead an Agency where the scientists in that Agency are going to be telling him: Hey, this rule that you fought against is going to save lives. What is his response going to be?  Can we as Americans trust that he is going to run an Agency where he relies on science or is he going to run an Agency where he relies on polluting industries to give him advice on what he should do? If he relies on them, there will be 1,600 more premature deaths, 2,200 nonfatal heart attacks, 960 more hospitalizations. We will suffer. People will suffer.  Scott Pruitt also filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA cross-state air pollution rule. This rule tightens limits on the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution that powerplants in 28 States in the eastern United States are allowed to emit. Once in the air, this pollution drifts across state borders, meaning that States that had no role in contributing to the pollution suffer the repercussions. It is this type of interstate pollution that EPA is especially well positioned to address.  Further solidifying his stance as a staunch opponent of climate action, he filed four lawsuits. He filed four lawsuits challenging the EPA Clean Power He also sued the EPA to challenge the Clean Air Act 111(b) standards for carbon dioxide emissions from new powerplants. And in all those lawsuits except one, Scott Pruitt joined with the polluting companies that were also suing the  So amidst all this in the confirmation hearing, I asked Scott Pruitt, given all those lawsuits he had filed with the polluters against the EPA to block the EPA from reducing air pollution--he had even filed one lawsuit on behalf--he literally was advocating for polluting industries to the point where he was even using their letter on his letterhead to make his point. So my question was, in all this fighting against the EPA, all of this, using their words, using their facts, not the scientists in your community, not the scientists telling you about the mercury in the lakes and the fish that you shouldn't eat and one of the highest asthma rates in the Nation, I asked him: Have you ever filed at least one lawsuit on behalf of those 111,000 children in your State with asthma? Have you filed one lawsuit on their behalf to try to reduce the air pollution and help those kids? Have you ever filed one lawsuit as attorney general of the State? And his answer was no.  Had he ever tried as Oklahoma attorney general to take any action--any action to help those children who struggle with asthma? What reason did Mr.Pruitt give for failing to even try? Mr.Pruitt stated that he lacked the statutory authority to file that type of legal action.  Let's think about that for a minute. Again, it doesn't take a law degree to understand the problems with that statement. You see, Scott Pruitt was more aggressive than any other attorney general in our country's history in suing the EPA, often using completely novel theories in court that lost--novel theories that lost. He was trying to find all kinds of ways on behalf of polluting industries to stop the EPA and thought of using creative legal approaches for doing it. Yet, when it came to the children in his State, 111,000 children suffering from asthma, one of the highest rates in our country, could he think of one novel thing to do on their behalf? Did he file one lawsuit to try to help those children? No, he claimed he lacked the legal authority.  What Scott Pruitt lacked was not legal authority. What I believe he lacked was any interest in trying to truly help those kids, to stand up for people against polluters. Those sick children were not powerful. They didn't have millions of dollars for a super They couldn't make campaign contributions. It seems, when it comes to their advocacy, that they were not important enough for him to even try.  When Mr.Pruitt was questioned by a reporter on his practice of letting polluting companies write letters challenging EPA regulations, which he then copied onto his official attorney general letterhead and he then sent, this is what Scott Pruitt said. This is his defense for letting polluting companies write letters that he put on his letterhead and then sent off to the EPA, advocating for them: ``That is actually called representative government in my view of the world.''  That is, simply, not an acceptable world view for the head of the Environmental Protection His view of representative government isn't any one of those 111,000 children. His idea of representative government isn't a family living next to a lake from where they are advised not to eat the fish anymore. His idea of representative government isn't pregnant mothers who are worried about eating fish that are caught in the His idea of representative government is giving voice to the polluters--to the powerful, money-laden interests--and not to those of the people.  If Scott Pruitt wants to be the EPA Administrator, we as Americans should insist that we have transparency into what he did in his work beforehand--what he did on air quality, which I just went through. But the truth of the matter is that it is the same story for water pollution in the State, and it is the same story for other health and safety issues that the EPA was doing.  I conclude by saying that it is unfortunate that, at a time when we are finally going to get transparency into Scott Pruitt and what he has been doing as attorney general, after his stonewalling week after week, month after month, saying he wasn't going to release these records--by the way, the[[Page S1292]]person in charge of enforcing Oklahoma's Freedom of Information Act is the attorney general. So it is kind of ironic that the attorney general was refusing to enforce them himself--the laws that public officials have to abide by in the It finally took a judge to order him to release that transparency. Now we are going to get these letters and see more about his connections to polluting companies--what kind of potential collusion went on and what conversations went on. Was he fundraising even from his official capacity? What was happening?  Alone, that is unfortunate that we are not, at least, postponing this vote until we get transparency in the Our role, as spelled out by the Constitution, is to advise and consent the President on these choices, and we are about to vote on somebody on whom we don't have full transparency to give advice.  The final point is that here is someone who is going to be the head of an agency that was started under the Nixon administration that is focused on protecting the health and safety of Americans, and he has demonstrated in no way his commitment to doing that--that he is putting people first. More than that, he has the ability to pull back these regulations that he himself has been fighting and that the scientists are saying will literally save lives.  It is not just what he will do. It is what he won't do in that job that is so threatening and so potentially devastating to families and communities like the one he is coming from. I cannot support someone who denies climate change, someone who clearly prioritizes polluting companies over people, someone who has spent his career in not protecting folks but in fighting the  I end where I began, with this Nation's ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I would hope that an EPA Administrator, regardless of party, would understand the sanctity of those ideals and those aspirations. This person is clearly, clearly not someone who will support the common good but narrow interests to the detriment of, not just of his State, not just of our United States, but to the detriment of our children's future and of the future of the very planet.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson). The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1275-2.txt,2194,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,16.0,February
3070,topic-id,5406,"Mr.President, I rise in gratitude for the opportunity to speak on the Senate floor. I want to express a lot of gratitude toward the Senator from She has been an advocate for the truth of our country. She has spoken here on this hallowed floor. I have now watched her speak in the streets, at airports, at rallies. She is one of those people--like so many Americans, literally millions of Americans over the course of these last few weeks--who is saying with the force of conviction that they will not be silent when the cause of our country is at stake.  I join with her tonight, along with some of my other colleagues, to stand up and really speak from the heart. I think this floor has seen many partisan speeches, but this is not going to be about Republican or This is not a speech I ever imagined I would be giving in the U.I never thought I would be here today talking about something that quite honestly was unimaginable to me just months ago.  This is a time I could not have foreseen, and I fear my generation of Americans maybe, perhaps, should have known that moments like this are possible; that we who believe in the values of our Nation, we who believe in the ideals enshrined in our Constitution, such as religious liberty, we should know that every generation of Americans has to prove worthy of these ideals and stay forever vigilant in their protection and never get so complacent as to think that this could never happen. The ideals we enjoy were fought for and struggled for and often bled for and died for. We of our generation who have the privileges we enjoy, the blessings of liberty that we luxuriate in, we have the obligation to stay the course to ensure that these moments never come, and when they do, that we stand with conviction to speak out against them, work against them to resist any retrenchment of American values.  What Donald Trump did in this Executive action issued this past Friday is, in no uncertain terms, a break with American policy. I believe it is a violation of our very Constitution, that it is illegal, unconstitutional, as well as immoral. More than this, it very specifically makes this Nation less safe and not more so. I want to repeat that. It makes this Nation less safe and not more so.  The ban was put forth in a climate of fear, intending to try to appeal to people's fears, trying to tell people that doing this Executive order was going to make us safer, but in its essence it is illogical when you look at the facts. Not only should it be known that it blocks immigration from seven majority Muslim countries--seven countries. Not a single perpetrator of terrorist attacks on American soil has come from these countries, dating back to well before 9/11. In fact, well before 2000, well before the nineties, well before the eighties and, in fact, not since the seventies, in over 40 years, no American has been killed on American soil by any of these countries in terrorist attacks.  In addition to that, what this ban is doing is it is shutting down the Refugee Resettlement Program for about 4 months and suspends the Syrian refugee program indefinitely, despite the fact that individuals entering the United States as refugees undergo the most heavily vetted resettlement process of anybody traveling into the United  So understand this. If you are trying to come into this country through student visas, Visa Waiver Programs, there are so many ways to come into this country without going through the refugee process, which takes between 1 year and 3 years, and you are not just going through the vetting of the Department of State but also the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center, numerous agencies for over up to 3 years are vetting you. Let me tell you right now, again, people who go through this[[Page S480]]program, history is showing, you have not seen in any recent years that folks going through these programs pose a terrorist threat or are taking American lives. So the very argument being used to push this ban is illogical and has no basis for any of the experiences we have had in this country.  A former chief counsel for U.Citizenship and Immigration services remarked that no competent terrorist would choose the U.refugee process as a preferred strategy for gaining entry into this country. Subjecting yourself to the 1 to 3 years of vetting from multiple agencies, more than any other way to enter, is not a way for terrorists to try to gain access to this country at all.  What we see is that this terrorist ban is putting focus--excuse me, this Executive order is putting focus in areas that do not produce safety but do have the collateral consequence of making us less safe.  The order indefinitely suspends the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United The majority of these folks are women and children who are fleeing barrel bombs, chemical attacks, military attacks on homes and schools. They are fleeing famine, they are fleeing starvation, they are fleeing the same violent extremism that we ourselves are trying to fight against. While the Syrian people face violence, terror, and oppression, the President has chosen to equate helpless refugees with those who are actually perpetrating the terror. Despite the fact that we have this stringent years-long vetting program for Iraqis and Afghans who risked their lives to help Americans by acting as interpreters, the ban ends--astonishingly, it ends a Special Immigrant Visa Program and substitutes it with nothing.  What is this Special Immigrant Visa Program that many of my colleagues have spoken about? It is a program that is specifically there for Iraqis and Afghans who helped America and put their families in danger, who put their necks out for us. They put themselves out there to assist our servicemen and servicewomen. It actually is there to help people who, because of their service to us and our country, now have their lives endangered where they are.  I want to read a series of tweets just yesterday from Kirk Johnson, a former USAID Administrator in Iraq who wrote about these folks who put themselves on the line for Americans who are our allies and our friends. This is what Kirk Johnson wrote:       I served in Iraq as USAID's man in Lived      alongside Marines and interpreters as they fought terrorists.       Over 100,000 of these Iraqis risked their lives for us      during the war. They bled for our country.       You said, before signing--  He is talking about President Trump--       ``We only want to admit those into our country who will      support our country, and love deeply our people.''  And what Kirk Johnson wrote follows:       I'd like you to know [Donald Trump] about some of these      people.       ``Homeboy'' lost his leg dragging a wounded U.SSgt from      MN out of the field of fire. He spent 4 years being vetted      before coming here.       Hossam helped us build schools. When insurgents found out,      in Oct `06, they left a severed dog head on his front step      that said ``run.''       Faisal, an interpreter for the troops you command [Donald      Trump], died of a suicide bomb on 3/14/2008.       Mohammed was assassinated when terrorists, who wanted to      kill the ``traitor'' booby-trapped his house in Jan 2008.       Ali had both his legs amputated by an IED blast while      working as an interpreter in Nov 2007.       Hameed died of a gunshot wound to the head while helping      our troops in July 2007.  I could do this all day, sadly.  He wrote in his remarks. He goes on to say:       Those that helped us were Christians, Muslims, Yazidis,      atheists, you name it.  These people in Fallujah and the surrounding areas were our allies.       When they ran through gunfire to save our troops, they      didn't think about such labels.       These Iraqis believed in They loved our country.      They lost their country as a result of the choice they made      to help us.       Your signature [Donald Trump] just banned them.  He continues:       I have heard from many, many soldiers and Marines (some of      extremely high rank) who believe this is a huge mistake.       One senior military officer with extensive experience in      Iraq and Afghanistan told me it was ``heinous and      counterproductive.''  Now why is it counterproductive? Well, for one, when we are conducting dangerous missions, when we are relying on people in country to assist us with our counterterrorism efforts, if they are going to take that risk, put their lives on the line, be subjected to terrorism themselves, there should be a process that allows them, after proper vetting, to get into this country. That has been American policy. Even people who have been threatened, victimized, and persecuted can't just walk into our country because some of our high-ranking Marines say so. They still go through vetting that often takes years. That is the process. It is a process that Donald Trump has now stopped.  Yesterday a report noted that radical jihadists--the people we are fighting against, the terrorists intending to kill us--were already using this Executive order as a victory, proof that the United States is at war with Now some people say that claim is hard to make. This is just banning people from seven countries. Well, look a little closer at the Executive order. There are exceptions made for non-Muslims in those countries.  Imagine this. We are the United States of Enshrined in our Constitution is this idea of freedom of religion; that there is no religious test to vote, there is no religious test to have citizenship, there is no religious test to enjoy the richness of a nation that believes in religious liberty. But in one action by the President of the United States, who claims to be concerned about terrorism from these countries, he says: I am going to stop people from entering. Oh, wait a minute, only Christians are welcome. If that is not a violation of core principles of freedom of religion that there should be religious tests to enter from these countries--that is an assault on all we proclaim in our country to be our core values.  This is not missed by our enemies. They are now trying to say this isn't a war between America and This isn't a war between America and radical jihadists. They want, as a propaganda tool, for people to believe that this is a war between the United States and Islam, between America and a religion. That is a lie. But when Donald Trump takes actions like this that specifically target people because of their faith, he is playing into the hands of the propagandists who seek to hurt us.  National security experts from across the political spectrum, from Republicans and Democrats, have spoken out against this order on this basis and on how it will affect our security as a country.  The former Director of the CIA, Michael Hayden, said of this order that it ``inarguably has made us less safe.''  Those people who want to help us, who want to serve with our marines, who want to be interpreters, who want to stand up for America, what are they to think now when America has shut its doors, when they have watched others do this, and now they can't gain access to this country? What about those allies of ours who say that the great United States of America is standing up against terrorism and Muslim leaders in other countries? But it is not about Islam; it is about the people who are conducting vicious terrorism, which is a sin on a peaceful religion. What can our allies say now, when we have specifically targeted an Executive order from our President not at a country but at a people who pray a certain way in that country?  What are we to think in the United States? This great Nation born from the ideas of liberty and freedom--freedom to pray as we want--what are we to think?  Despite all of the evidence to the contrary, just 2 days after President Trump instituted this ban, he remarked: Hey, this ban is going ``nicely.'' Earlier today, President Trump's spokesman referred to those being unlawfully detained as just being ``temporarily inconvenienced.''  We know that the reality of the situation is much different for the families and individuals across the globe who are affected. Many of them are permanent residents and green card holders for whom this Executive order has amounted to a door slammed in their face by the country that is supposed to represent the shining beacon on the planet Earth of liberty and hope.[[Page S481]]  Hundreds of people of seven different nationalities have been trapped at American airports. Many of them were detained for hours on end without access to lawyers; they were handcuffed and interrogated; some were immediately deported, while many more have been turned away at the doors to their flights bound for the United These are people who followed all of the rules, who went through extensive vetting, who upended their lives--doors slammed in their faces.  I am sorry, but this is not an inconvenience. This is a denial of process, a denial of procedure; it is a denial of basic liberty and a violation of our principles.  It is no wonder, though, that judges across the country began issuing stays within hours of this order becoming effective. As we saw in New York, how people like Hamidyah Al Saeedi, the 65-year-old mother of a sergeant--65-year-old mother of a sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division of the U.Army, who traveled from Iraq to see her son for the first time in 5 years. A mother of a sergeant in the 82nd Airborne--someone who should be honored--lawfully entered the United States, and because of this order, she was detained for 30 hours, denied a wheelchair, and handcuffed, before her release.  On Saturday night and early into the morning, I saw Customs and Border Patrol officials at I left Washington, DC, and drove to Virginia to go to Dulles I saw Customs and Border Patrol officials seemingly defy the orders coming from a Federal judge to at least permit all legal permanent residents in detention access to legal counsel. I held the judge's order in my hands. Because of the kindness of a local law enforcement officer who was stationed in Dulles, I was able to shuttle to Customs and Border Patrol, and I was then able to submit handwritten notes and questions to the officials who refused to meet with me. I did not get much of an explanation as to why they were defying a clear order from a Federal judge. Whether or not this was a case of bureaucratic confusion or a message from the courts getting lost, Federal law enforcement officers, under the supervision of the Department of Homeland Security, ignored and defied the orders of a Federal judge.  To me, this is more reason for outrage. In a Nation with three branches of government, the judiciary with a clear role giving an order to the executive branch, I believe the defiance of that order also was unconstitutional.  Access to counsel is a principle in our democracy. It is about fairness and due process. Failing to allow access to counsel, to me, seems a clear violation of constitutional norms and ideals. The judge obviously believes so, and that is why he ordered counsel to be provided.  Still, right now, we don't know how many people are being detained across the country in the wake of this Executive order or how many were immediately and quietly deported once they came here again, thoroughly vetted, in accordance with the law, but they were still deported upon their arrival in this country. I think Congress deserves answers. I wrote to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly earlier this evening to seek them.  This mistreatment of any legal permanent resident or visitors to this country is wrong. It is un-It undermines the truth of who we are. It is patently unacceptable.  This Executive order has treated green card holders and immigrants in this Nation as if they were criminals. It has torn families apart across the world and pulled the rug out from families who were preparing to begin a new life in the United States of And this order has betrayed some of our closest allies--men and women who risked their lives to help American servicemembers deployed often on hostile soil. Ending the special immigrant visa programs established to help Iraqis and Afghans who risked their lives to help American forces is unacceptable. The United States cannot turn its back on those who stepped up and stepped in when we needed them most.  Just this morning, I read about an Iraqi man, Sami, who had risked his life to work with the American Government in After waiting 7 years to gain entry, going through a laborious process of vetting under the special immigrant visa program, he and his family finally got the OK, and they were ready to start their new lives in On Saturday, he and his wife and two daughters had flown from Iraq to Istanbul, and they were sitting in their seats ready to take off when they were removed from the plane by security officials. Foreign Policy magazine reported that, through tears, Sami's 7-year-old daughter asked, ``Why don't they want us in America?''  American servicemembers and veterans are joining a growing core, speaking out against this misguided decision which threatens the commonsense program that helps our military do their jobs.  Take Zachary Iscol, a former Marine infantry officer who wrote about some of the Iraqis he worked with who had risked everything to help the United He told the story of one man, Frank, who had served as an interpreter for his Marine Corps unit and, in doing so, had taken a bullet in his leg. Frank had remained in Iraq since then. Zachary wrote:       He was still living in Baghdad with daily fears for his and      his family's safety. After six years of vetting, including      what seemed like countless interviews and background checks      by various government agencies, he had finally been cleared      to come to the United States with his pregnant wife and 18-     month-old son.  Zachary went on to write:       My wife and I began to prepare our guest room for their      arrival. But now, because of a new executive order by      President Trump, Frank is no longer welcome.  This is an American military man, preparing to have these folks who put their lives on the line for him, stay in his home.  This special visa program is why people like Mohammed and Saif Alnasseri, whom I am proud to call Jersey residents--two of my constituents--were able to come to this country. I would like to share a little bit about this family.  Mohammed Alnasseri was finishing high school in Iraq in 2003 when the Americans arrived. As an English speaker, Mohammed began helping the Americans stationed near his neighborhood, working for free as their neighborhood translator. When the unit he had become friends with left, he decided to apply for work as an official interpreter with the U.By 2004, he had been sent to Fallujah to work with and help protect American military fighting there. Because of his work with the American military, he recounts receiving hundreds of death notes, threatening not just his life but the life of his mother and his family.  He returned to Baghdad where he worked, despite these threats, as a contractor with an American company until one day he was targeted and almost assassinated in his car. He knew at that point, with the death threats and the assassination attempt, that he had to get out of the country.  After moving to Australia, his sister informed him about America's special visa program, so he applied, and 2\1/2\ years later he was able to join his family in the United  In a call with my office just earlier today, he wanted to make it clear that he arrived in the United States on July 3, and by August 10, he had started his job. He remarked to my team that he couldn't understand why anyone would think he was coming to America because it was easy or because he wanted something. He spent most of his savings trying to get to America, and he had never taken any benefit since arriving here.  Mohammed met his wife in New Jersey and now lives in our State, works at Costco, and is working to obtain his citizenship. He shared that this Executive order made him more sad than scared and that it simply didn't make sense to ban regular, hard-working people who are also afraid of terrorists, persecuted by terrorists, almost killed by terrorists, and who had done so much to help our country. It made no sense to them.  This is what he said: ``We ran away from these people. I paid all the money I had to leave.'' He did that for the safety of his family.  Mohammed's brother is now a proud American citizen, father of two, and resident of Scotch Plains, Saif and his wife had worked as pharmacists in Iraq, but when the war began, he knew he needed to get involved. So Saif worked as a translator and reporter for[[Page S482]]the Los Angeles Times during the war in Iraq, providing support and key insights to the American media and the American public. They were able to come to the United States in 2008 through that special visa program--the SIV program--and slowly worked their way through school. Now, as pharmacy technicians, they have their pharmacy licenses.  Saif is a pharmacy manager in Cranford, NJ, a homeowner in Scotch Plains, and a proud father of two girls. He savors this country, this precious He celebrates our values. He is a glowing testimony to the truth of who we are. His success is our success. His family's security and safety and thriving lives in New Jersey give luster to the greatness of  In a phone call yesterday, Saif remarked that this Executive order was embarrassing and hurtful, that it was clear Muslims were being targeted, and that he couldn't understand why those who were so heavily vetted like his family posed such a threat.  Saif and his family are heavily involved in their community in Scotch Plains, and they make sure to offer support to families similar to theirs who come from Iraq seeking refuge. They are not just basking and luxuriating in their good fortune to become American citizens; they are honoring one of the great hallowed traditions of our country, which is service.  At the end of the call, Saif remarked that ``[he] didn't think this would happen in any other country.'' It seemed like he was about to say this kind of religiously targeted ban wouldn't happen anywhere else, and he might have been right. But instead, he said that ``if this kind of executive order from a leader in any other country happened against any group of people, you would never see the kind of resistance and action of so many standing up for them.''  Even in one of the darkest moments in recent history, this man, this patriot, this person who served our Nation's interests and continues to volunteer in service to this day, could have every reason to be angry, upset, and cynical. But what is beautiful from our conversations with this man is that he hasn't given up faith. He still believes in the American people.  The beautiful thing about the conversations my staff has had with those New Jersey residents who once were serving our Nation in theaters of violence and terrorism, standing up for our military, for our press, victimized by terroristic threats, shot at, assassination attempts--these families now here in America witnessing this Executive order are saddened and embarrassed by it, but they are not giving up in their faith in That is our story.  I stand here today--dare I say, all of the Members of the Senate stand here today because of this tradition of our country, that even when we had dark chapters from our past where others in positions of power violated our values, the faith and activism and engagement of American people remained.  I dare say we are the oldest constitutional democracy on the planet God, the genius of our Founders who put on paper ideals that have been heralded for centuries on planet Newer constitutional democracies literally would study our Constitution and model their nations after elements of our I am sad to tell you that some of those countries' democracies have failed. They had the vaunted words, they put forth the same principles and ideals, but their countries' democracies have been overthrown, have seen despots who destroyed the very spirit of those ideals.  Why has America persisted? It is not just because of the documents that are sacred and so special in the course of human events. But what makes those documents true and real--because those sentiments are not just written on parchment; every generation has had them written on their hearts and have said: No matter what I may be experiencing in this country, I am going to dedicate myself to the principles and ideals, because as great as our Founders were when they founded this country in liberty and in justice and equality under the law, it didn't apply to everyone. It didn't apply to women. Native Americans were referred to as savages. African Americans were fractions of human beings. Yet the faith of a people in every generation worked to expand the concepts of liberty and freedom. They made the Constitution more real. They made our Union more perfect. They made our country's truth more true for more people.  It is why great poets like Langston Hughes wrote:       America never was America to me,       And yet I swear this oath--       America will be!  That is the call to the citizenry of this country.  There have been dark days in our past, but every generation of Americans, despite the dark actions of people in power, understands the truth that the power of the people is greater than the people in power. If we never lose faith in the ideals of this Nation, if we keep standing and working and sacrificing and struggling, every generation could advance the ideals of our country and make us more free and more true and more real for more people.  Last week, we saw yet another American leader shrink the ideals of this country, try to pull us backward to times past when we turned our backs on people fleeing persecution. What Donald Trump did is try to pull back on the ideals inscribed on that great statue that sits right next to New Jersey, the mother of exiles, who says in poetry, among other things, ``give us''--not ``Hey, you can come in'' but a demand:       Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning      to breathe free,       The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.  It is a demand to the world that we will take those who are oppressed, we will take those who are being violated, we will take those who are being victimized. A President turns his back on those ideals. We have seen it before.  Lauren Feldman wrote to me about chapters of dark pasts. She wrote:       Today is Holocaust Remembrance I am a My      relatives were unable to find refuge in our country and were      murdered by the My grandmother lost her beloved aunt,      Rokhl Rosnick Gertman, and an uncle and 4 young cousins that      she never met. Had we as a country done the right thing and      welcomed the refugees fleeing the Nazis, Tante Rokhl and      millions of others could have joined their family members in      safety and we could have been proud of our country, instead      of ashamed of the racist paper walls built by the FDR      administration to keep my family and others out.       Please tell Mr.Trump that we cannot go back. We must be a      beacon of safety and refuge for the persecuted. Please do all      that you can to prevent this ban from being enacted. Please      think of my relatives and the relatives of your other      constituents and fellow citizens who were needlessly and      shamefully murdered because of our fear and racism. We are      better than that. You are better than that.  She concludes, ``Thank you for your time and service. Lauren Feldman, Princeton.''  We are the United States of We haven't been perfect, but there has been a striving and a yearning in every generation to be more so.  I am a product of people Black and White, Christian and Jewish and Muslim, who, even though issues didn't affect them directly, knew that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. They marched and they fought. They sat in. They got on buses for freedom rides knowing they would be bombed. They tried to cross bridges, standing up against law enforcement, State troopers, Governors who dared them to try to pass them. There were implacable walls of hatred and racism, but they stood anyway, and they bled the southern soil red--for my freedom, for our freedom, for this Nation's freedom.  I have worked all my career for the safety of communities. Yes, we must make sure our Nation is safe. But don't let fear and concern for safety ever make us ever turn our backs on our values as a nation. When we are threatened by our enemies, it is not a time to surrender our values, it is time to double down on them. The terrorists win if they change our free hearts and our souls set on liberty.  We as a nation are called to be great, to be a beacon of liberty and justice. There are people now pulled off of airplanes, forced to return to communities where their lives are being threatened. We made a bargain with them: Stand for Stand with our military. Stand against terrorism.  There are people who went through years and years of vetting by agency after agency, and when they were on the brink of freedom, like people of old who were on ships that came into our harbor, they were turned away, back to[[Page S483]]face persecution and injustice. That is not the America I believe in. It is not who we are.  So I say to our President in prayer, in deep abiding faith: Repeal your Executive order. Stand up for our principles. Defend them. Be the champion millions of Americans want you to be.  I say to Americans, to all of us as a country: This is not a time to despair. It is not a time to give up. It is not a time to grow cynical or lose faith in our country or our values. No, remember our history. When dark times come, when it seems that people in the highest points of power are turning their backs on their ideals, it is not a time to retreat or equivocate, it is a time to fight, to stand up, to resist.  We are a great nation not just because of the words printed on a Constitution; we are a great nation because people with great sacrifice and struggle fought to live those words and to make them real in the lives of every single person.  America, we must now stand up. The opposite of justice is not just injustice; it is silence and indifference. This may not affect you or your family directly, but it is a threat to all of our collective values.  Go to the Jefferson Memorial and read those final words. Thomas Jefferson knew that for this Nation to be great, we had to pledge to each other an unusual level of commitment. He said that we must mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.  There is no honor in this Executive order. We as Americans now must pledge our sacred honor to do all we can to tear this order down so that the truth of America can rise again.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

2805,topic-id,737,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a community leader, public servant, proud veteran, personal mentor, and great American, Lewis  Lewis Odom lived a life many strive to emulate, a life filled with purpose, integrity, and selfless commitment to those around him. He had such a genuine impact on my life and the lives of so many others.  From a young age, Lewis held himself to a standard of excellence. Upon graduation from high school, Lewis enlisted in the U.Navy Reserve and was selected to join the prestigious V-12 Naval College Training Program during World War II and thereafter. Through this program, he attended Millsaps College and Tulane University and went on to serve in the Navy aboard the USS  After serving, Lewis continued his education at the University of Alabama where he received a law degree, and, soon after, commissioned as a first lieutenant in the U.Air Force in 1951, serving as a legal officer in  Lewis Odom's career of service was only just beginning when he left the military. His hard work and integrity as a lawyer were recognized as he became the general counsel of the U.Senate Small Business He would go on to serve as administrative assistant to Alabama Senator John Sparkman before being named staff director and counsel for the Senate Banking He played a critical role in shaping many of our Nation's financial regulations during this important time period.  Probably one of his most memorable accomplishments during his career on Capitol Hill was to plan and organize the inauguration ceremony for President John He often spoke of the great challenge and honor of that job.  Following his time on Capitol Hill, he served as deputy to the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or He was eventually appointed senior Deputy Comptroller of the Currency before retiring from Federal service in 1981.  After his years of service in the Federal Government, Lewis returned to practice law in Mobile, joining the law firm of Miller, Hamilton, Snider & That was when I met As a newly minted lawyer, Lewis took me under his wing and served as an important mentor.  Lewis was a thorough and exact lawyer who paid attention to detail and helped instill those traits in me and many others that he worked with. He inspired in me the confidence to hold myself to a standard of excellence, but he did so without being overbearing or harsh. He took a new lawyer and allowed me to gain invaluable experience.  As a young lawyer, Lewis taught me an important lesson that every young lawyer must learn: to choose your battles wisely. This lesson applied to more than just the field of law, however, and I have continued to use this principle in many of the other skills that I learned from Lewis throughout my life and career.  Lewis was also a true community leader committed to making Alabama a better place. From his first days in Mobile to his last, Lewis was ever present in the community, serving in any way he could, always giving his time and his devotion.  During his years in Mobile, Lewis served as the chairman of the Alabama Ethics Commission, the chairman of the Mobile water board, chancellor of the Episcopal Diocese of the Central Gulf Coast, and chairman of the Mobile Museum  He was also a strong supporter of the University of Alabama, serving as president to various alumni chapters and as a founding member of the Farrah Law Society for the University of Alabama School of  It is true that Lewis worked just as hard for his community in his retirement as he had earlier in his legal career.  Sadly, Lewis Odom passed away on January 16 of this year at the age of 91.  My wife, Rebecca, and I were both heartbroken to learn of his passing because he was such a dear friend. During this time of sadness, we take great[[Page H750]]comfort in remembering the impact he had on each of us as well as on our community, State, and country.  I hope his wife, Janelle; son, Mike; daughter, Patty; beloved grandchildren and great-grandchildren can take comfort in the same.  Mr.Speaker, Lewis was a man of great integrity and set an example for all those around him to hold ourselves to such a level of excellence and service. He was a great man, and he will be sorely missed.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH749-4.txt,2197,DHS ACQUISITION AUTHORITIES ACT OF 2017,2017.0,31.0,February
2966,topic-id,3030,"Mr.President, along with the Presiding Officer, I have the distinct honor of serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and am the ranking Democrat on that committee. There are many areas of challenge for our national security. We could talk about what we think is the greatest threat to the national security of the United Unfortunately, there are a lot of candidates.  One could certainly be China has been very provocative in the China Sea, raising concern about maintaining maritime security, which is so critically important to world commerce. Clearly China could be a candidate.  North Korea could be a candidate. We know that in North Korea, they have a nuclear capacity. We know their government will gas and poison people who disagree with them, including family. It is a repressive regime, and they are developing the capacity not only to have a nuclear weapon but the capacity to be able to deliver that nuclear weapon beyond just the region in which they are located. So we could pick North  We certainly could mention the threat of ISIS, which is a growing threat of terrorism that challenges not only the Middle East but our own country.  We could mention the security threat of Iran was one of the greatest sponsors of terrorism of any country in the world, which is causing major problems for the Sunni Gulf States, in Syria, and in the Middle Clearly Iran is a candidate for major interest in our national security.  But the country I would pick as the greatest threat to America's national security would be Russia has been very aggressive in trying to dominate beyond its own geographical borders. It has incurred into other countries and has attacked the United States of  I want to take us back to 1975 when the Helsinki Final Act was passed, through the leadership of the United States and the  I have had the opportunity through several Congresses to be either the chair or the cochair or the ranking member of the U.Helsinki I have spent a lot of time on the Helsinki work.  What was remarkable about that document that was entered into in 1975 was that it recognized that security is beyond just military in that for a country to be secure, it must pay attention to its borders, yes, and its military, but it also must have economic security and must respect human rights.  What was also very unique in the Helsinki Final Act was the commitment that these standards we agreed to would not only be of internal interest to the member country but that any country to the Helsinki Final Act could challenge the actions of any other country. We have not only the right but the responsibility to call out countries that fail to adhere to the basic principles that were agreed to in 1975. The Helsinki Final Act now applies to about 56 countries--all of the countries of Europe, Canada, the United States, and all of the republics of the former Soviet  Let me review with my colleagues the guiding principles that were agreed to in 1975 under the Helsinki Final Act, signed by Russia, so that they are bound by these principles. As I read through these 10 principles, let me talk about how Russia has violated every single one of the basic 10 principles they agreed to in  1, sovereign equality and respect for the rights inherent in sovereignty.  2, refraining from the threat or use of force.  3, the inviolability of borders.  4, the territorial integrity of states.  In each of these cases, Russia has violated these basic principles. They invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea, annexing it against the will of a sovereign country. They are interfering in the eastern part of Ukraine as we speak, violating the territorial integrity of Russia's troops are in Georgia, violating the sovereignty of that country. Russia's presence in Moldova is not respecting the territorial integrity of a member state. Russia has violated the basic principles of sovereignty that were brought out in the Helsinki Final  Let me read some of the other principles.  5, the peaceful settlement of disputes.  Russia shoots first. They took their troops into They took their troops into They have not used peaceful methods.  The sixth principle is the non-intervention in internal affairs.  Russia attacked the United States of America in our free election system. That is not subject to any dispute today. They attacked They interfered with our internal affairs. They tried to influence our election. That is an attack against America and a violation of their basic commitments.  Let me read through the remaining.  7, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Ask the people who have disagreed with the Russian Government and who have tried to form a party whether there is respect for human rights and fundamental freedom in Russia today. Ask independent journalists who are arrested and killed for trying to carry out their profession. Russia today is intimidating civil societies and NGOs, and anyone who disagrees with Mr.Putin is subject to arrest, torture, and perhaps death. We know that in the case of Mr.Magnitsky, which is a cause that has been taken up by this body with the passage of Magnitsky laws.  Another principle is equal rights and the self-determination of people. That is not present in Russia today.  9, cooperation among states.  Let me conclude with the 10th principle: fulfillment in good faith of international legal obligations.  Russia entered into an agreement with regard to Ukraine's sovereignty, only to invade Ukraine a few years later. Ukraine gave up its nuclear stockpile, believing that Russia would[[Page S1674]]live up to its commitments. Russia has violated the Minsk agreements that were entered into to resolve the problems between Ukraine and Russia has not lived up to its international agreements.  Let me sort of summarize why I think Russia is the 1 candidate for concern with regard to our national security. They have violated the sovereignty of many countries of the world. They have violated the sovereignty of Ukraine and continue to do so. They have violated the sovereignty of Georgia and They have attacked the United States of America through cyber. It may not have been a MiG, but it was a mouse, and its intended purpose was to bring down our democratic election system and to favor one candidate. That cannot go unanswered.  Today, Russia is engaged in Syria and supports the Assad regime, which attacks humanitarian convoys, uses the civilian population as an instrument of war, gases its own people--violating basic international human rights and committing war crimes. That is what President Putin is doing in Russia today.  Russia's human rights records are deplorable. Kara-Murza has been poisoned not once but twice. He is an opposition leader. He is now in the United States and is recovering from the second poisoning episode. The Russian authorities tried to kill him. Why? Because he dared to oppose the Putin regime.  We need to speak out. We need to know more about that. It does not end there. Russia is violating the INF, the International Nuclear Force agreement, which is a major concern to all of us.  Russia's bottom line is that they are trying to dismantle the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which has been the bulwark of security since the end of World War II, the relationship between Europe and the United States, providing a blanket of protection not just for our physical security, but providing international leadership in dealing with the development of democratic countries around the world. That is what Russia is trying to do today, is to dismantle that protection.  What should we do? We have identified Russia as our 1 concern, and I think most Members of the Senate would agree with that assessment. I have talked to many, particularly on the Senate Foreign Relations What should we do? What is the role of Congress?  We know we are waiting for President Trump to give us his foreign policy as it relates to Russia, and that is an important thing for us to know--how the President intends to deal with a country that has done so many things against our national security interests.  We have a role. We are the first branch of government that is mentioned in the Constitution, article We have responsibilities to act. We need to take steps, and I have encouraged my colleagues.  There have been a lot of accusations made around here about Russia's contacts with Americans and that Russia is stealing information through cyber and planting that information through WikiLeaks in order to influence elections. There is the potential contact with General Flynn, what happened with the Russian Ambassador, and what happened as far as domestic wiretaps. There have been a lot of comments made around here, but we do not have the facts.  First and foremost, we need an independent commission that is similar to what the Congress constituted after the attack on 9/11 so that we get independent, nonpartisan experts, without restriction to jurisdiction or turf, who can determine exactly what Russia's game plan is and what steps we can take to protect ourselves in moving forward and what action we should take against That is the first thing we should do. Congress should also pass a resolution. I have introduced one that would set up that type of an independent commission to look at what Russia has done.  There is a second issue, though, that I want to bring to our attention, and I know the Presiding Officer is very familiar with it. It is the Countering Russian Hostilities Act, which is a bill I filed. I am very proud that this bill was not created by one Member, it was created by a group of us working together and recognizing that Congress needed to speak with a strong voice.  I am proud that, in addition to my sponsorship, Senator McCain helped draft this bill. Senator Menendez is a key leader on this bill. Senator Graham is one of the architects of the bill. We have Senator Shaheen, Senator Rubio, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Sasse, Senator Durbin, Senator Portman, Senator Murphy, Senator Gardner, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Sullivan, Senator Daines, Senator Donnelly, Senator Young, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Coons, and Senator  You might notice that I alternated between Democrats and Republicans because this is not a partisan effort. We all recognize the seriousness of what Russia has done to the United We all recognize that Congress needs to respond. When you are attacked, you don't stand by; if you do, you will get attacked again and the next time could be even more devastating. So we have to take action to protect ourselves.  So what the Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act does, first and foremost, is it codifies the sanctions currently imposed against Russia for its cyber attack on the U.election. Secondly, it extends those sanctions for what we call secondary sanctions--businesses doing business with those that are sanctioned--so we can enforce the sanctions.  The Presiding Officer recognized that when we were working on the North Korea sanctions law, we needed to strengthen that, and I congratulate the Presiding Officer on the work he did regarding North Korea, and I was pleased to join him. I am pleased he is joining with this group to see how we can strengthen our sanctions and pressure on Russia to know that they can't get away with this type of an attack against America, but then we go even further.  We recognize that Ukraine today--we have sanctions against Russia, but we can strengthen those sanctions. We can apply those sanctions to the energy sector. We can apply those sanctions to prevent American companies from financing the Russian economy through the moneys they need for sovereign debt or privatization. So we extend the program of sanctions to include those types of activities.  We take up two other major issues that I just want to share with my colleagues because these are contributions made by the Members who joined together to file this bill. We recognize that the rules of engagement have changed. Russia is using tactics today that we never thought would be used. They attack our country, get private information, give it to WikiLeaks, use it as part of a strategy to get news out there that could influence our elections. Then they develop fake news, use that fake news through social media to make it look like real news in an effort to try to affect our free election system in the United This is pretty frightening. We have to meet them. We have to protect ourselves.  So this legislation provides for a democracy initiative similar to what we have done on our security initiative with We have stationed NATO troops on the border countries of NATO with Russia to let them know we will not tolerate the invasion of a NATO country. We have done that. That is our security initiative. We have to have a democracy initiative to protect the democratic institutions of Western Europe because Russia will use the democratic institutions to try to undermine the democratic institutions--the free press, the opportunities of free speech, the opportunities to try to influence through their money the election process. They have done that. They tried to do it in Montenegro during the parliamentary elections to affect Montenegro's accession into  We have to protect the democratic institutions. This legislation would authorize that protection.  Then it sets up a resource so we can fight this propaganda, so we can find ways to counter Russia's use of propaganda in order to carry out their nefarious activities.  This is a comprehensive bill. I urge all of our colleagues to take a look at it. We are looking for input. We are looking to make sure this does exactly what we need it to do--to speak as one[[Page S1675]]voice in Congress to make it clear to Russia that it is not business as usual; that we intend to take action and be strong and let them know they cannot do this type of activity; that America will protect its national security.  There is another bill, let me just mention, that Senator Graham is the principal sponsor of that I have cosponsored and others have sponsored also. It is the Russia Sanctions Review I mention that one because we had a great debate here in the last Congress on the Iran nuclear agreement, and part of the reasons we had a great debate is because the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was able to pass a review act and get broad consensus on it, get it signed by the President, which gave us a role. More importantly, it gave the American people a role in getting transparency on a very important agreement--the Iran nuclear agreement. So we had time for public hearings. We had time for national debate. We had time for questions.  Because that law passed, I am convinced the agreement was stronger. The administration knew there were millions of eyes looking at what they were doing; they just couldn't do it in the dark of night. It helped us, I think, carry out our responsibility as the legislative branch of government.  So Senator Graham and I and others believe we should have a similar process, if there is going to be a fundamental change in the relationship between the United States and Russia; that the President should consult and work with Congress and give us an opportunity for transparency and for the American people to be heard. That is exactly what this bill does. It is a bill that I think is for good legislating, for good governance, and I would encourage my colleagues to take a look at this, and hopefully we will be able to get this done.  I will just say in conclusion that we have no issue with the Russian people. They are good people. We want to have a good relationship with the Russian people. It is Mr.Putin and his government that are directing this country to do things in interference with the sovereignty of other countries--in violating human rights, in supporting violations of human rights, in war crimes, and they should be held accountable for that and for what they are doing in Syria, and, of course, very personally, attacking our own country. That is what we are aimed at.  Mr.Khodorkovsky was in my office yesterday. I think my colleagues might recall that he was a leader in Russia--a great business leader. He made a lot of money. He decided Russia needed reforms to protect the rights of all people, that human rights were not strong enough, the right of expression was not strong enough, so he took up that cause as a successful businessperson. As a result, he was arrested, served 10 years in prison, and they tried to keep him out of politics because he did not represent Mr.Putin's politics.  Well, he has been very active. He no longer lives in Russia for fear of his own life. He has been here championing the cause for good governance within Russia and the importance for the international community to be engaged in that. As he left my office yesterday, he said: Please continue to speak out. He said: Please continue to speak out.  The United States must lead when a country driven by Mr.Putin does what it does. It is our responsibility to speak out about this outrageous conduct--threatening the integrity of so many countries and violating the human rights of so many people.  We can make a difference. The Congress can make a difference. It is for all of those reasons that we need to act.  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the legislation I have talked about on the floor and which so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have joined. Let's get together and let's speak with a united voice and let Russia know we are going to protect the national security of the United States of America, and we are going to protect the rights of our friends.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1666-2.txt,,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,8.0,February
2970,topic-id,1278,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Durbin, Senator Menendez, and Senator Coons for joining on the floor today to talk about the threat that Russia poses.  Senator Durbin is absolutely correct, and I thank him for his leadership on this. The only way the American people will have a full accounting of what Russia's intentions were and what they did in attacking our country is to have an independent commission.  We had such a commission after the attack on 9/11. Democrats and Republicans came together. There was no controversy about that. We wanted to find out what and how we were attacked, how they got through our intelligence network, how they put together the horrific attack on our country, and then we wanted to know how we could get recommendations to protect us moving forward.  I am going to tell you, that commission served a very important national security function because we learned a lot. We learned that we were stovepiping too much information. We weren't sharing it. The way the agencies were set up, it was more over turf than it was over mission. Congress acted on the recommendations, and we are safer today as a result of it.  We don't know what Russia's intentions are all about. We suspect that they are trying to undermine our democratic system of government. We suspect that Russia is interested in regaining its reputation of the former Soviet They are looking for a greater geographical footprint. We see[[Page S1679]]that in their military operations, not just on their border countries such as Ukraine or what they are doing in Georgia or Moldova, but we see that also in the Middle East where they have a military presence today, and they want to have a footprint there.  We believe they want to become a greater We know they don't like democratic systems of government. Their government stays in power through making sure that there is no effective opposition. They have quelled any opportunity for a Democratic opposition and for the free press.  We know those--but what are their ultimate aspirations? What do they intend to do with the transatlantic partnership? We talked about that. We are safer today because of the transatlantic relations. NATO has made our Nation safer. The strength of the EU has made our Nation stronger.  We know Russia is trying to interfere with that. They interfered with the Montenegro election in an effort to prevent Montenegro from agreeing to join We know they are trying to pull other nations out of We know that.  What we need to have, though, is a full accounting as to what happened in the attack on our country and how we can prepare ourselves to defend ourselves. By the way, it might also give us a blueprint for what we need to do to show Russia we will not tolerate that type of activity.  Senator Durbin is absolutely right. We have responsibilities in The committee I serve on, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--our relationship with Russia, we have to have hearings. Senator Menendez was right in calling upon our committee to have additional hearings. What is Russia doing? How does it affect not only our relationship with Russia, but how do we deal with Europe? How do we deal with the authorization for use of military force? If we were attacked, can you use cyber as an attack vehicle? Does that require congressional authorization?  We have to be prepared in our committees. The Intelligence Committee has a responsibility to find out exactly what happened and whether we need to change our intelligence network because Russia was able to invade our country. They were able to get private information and then send it to WikiLeaks to use politically against us. They may compromise some of our classified information. We don't know. We need to find that out.  The Intelligence Committee has a function to play. The Judiciary Committee has a function to play. I know the subcommittee is doing some work under Senators Whitehouse and The Armed Services Committee certainly has a role to play.  There is only one way the American people will get a clear view of how serious this matter is and that we are taking every conceivable possible step to make sure we protect the national security of the United States and our Democratic institutions, which are part of our national security, and that is to have an independent commission.  There are no turf problems there. They can look at everything. They can have a transparent process, and the American people can get an eye as to what is happening. They can make the recommendations we need.  I thank Senator Durbin for underscoring that point. It is something I think we will ultimately get to. I was hoping we could get to it sooner rather than later because I think the American people would have a great deal more confidence.  I thank Senator Coons for putting this in historic perspective. He is absolutely right; we go back a long time as to what Russia's intentions are all about. I thought that was extremely helpful to fill in all of the aspects of what we are trying to do.  Senator Menendez's point was very critical; our reasons for being here and our reasons for wanting to take action are to protect our country, the American people. We are not talking about any one person or any one election. This is not challenging the results of this past election. This is all about making sure that we protect the integrity of our free election system and, particularly moving forward, knowing that Russia may very well be engaged, as we speak, in trying to interfere with the elections in the Netherlands and Germany and We need to have a better game plan on how to deal with this.  As Senator Menendez said--I think it is a very important point; I want to underscore this: You can't trust Let's be clear about that. Ask the They signed the Budapest The United States was part of that. They very clearly gave up their nuclear capacity, and in exchange they got the security from Russia on their jurisdiction, on their territory, on their sovereignty. Look how long that lasted before Russia invaded Ukraine, annexed part of Ukraine, and they continue to supply resources to disrupt the eastern part of Ukraine so Ukraine will have a very difficult time in its integration into That is what Russia is doing today in contravention to their written commitments with  Then I might tell my colleagues: Look at the Minsk agreement set up to try to end this hot war, and Russia has violated all the aspects of the Minsk agreement. You can't trust Russia's agreements.  As Senator Menendez pointed out--he is right--look at the Look at the treaty obligations. Russia is violating their treaty obligations, which directly affect the security of These are pretty serious things. We counter this by unity.  That is why I am so proud that we have Democrats and Republicans working together. This is not one party. Both parties recognize the danger of Both parties recognize that we have to protect ourselves. I would just urge my colleagues to follow this vigorous strategy, where we can show the American people that unity and that resolve and that we will not allow Russia to attack our country, that we are going to prepare to make sure that we defend our democratic system of government and that we will be united in standing up to those types of activities that are against our national security interests.

2967,topic-id,1158,"Mr.President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from the great State of Maryland and to commend him for his leadership on the Foreign Relations Committee and on the floor today, as well as his great work with the Helsinki Commission, his tireless bipartisan work with our committee chairman, and with many others.  We have just heard detailed, in terms of the legislation he has put forward, the effort, the time, and the engagement he has put forward in terms of standing up. I think it is important for all of our colleagues and the American people to hear us working together to push back on Russian aggression and on Vladimir Putin's regime for its interference in our most recent election and its long and sad record of appalling human rights violations.  In 1950, the CIA delivered a report to then-President Harry Truman that outlined two key goals of the Soviet The first goal was ``destruction of the unity among the Western countries, thereby isolating the United States.'' The second goal was ``alienating the Western people from their governments so that the efforts of the Western countries to strengthen themselves would be undermined.''  Nearly 70 years later, the regime of Vladimir Putin in Russia remains fundamentally committed to these same two goals, but today his government has a whole new arsenal of cyber tools and information tools which it uses to interfere in democratic elections here in the United States and across Europe--among the nations that are our vital allies--to launch propaganda and misinformation campaigns that spread falsehoods and create a climate of doubt and uncertainty among citizens and democracies around the world.  Last week, on this floor, I rose to speak with my friend and colleague, Senator Marco Rubio, to highlight the threat that we know Russia poses to the American-led, rules-based international order that has been sustained by both Republican and Democratic Presidents and leaders in this body since the Second World  Just yesterday, several of us participated in a hearing of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Lindsey Graham of South We heard directly from representatives of the Governments of Ukraine, Poland, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, and All of these nations know better than any others just how serious the Russian Government is today about fulfilling the goals the CIA quoted and outlined in that report from the 1950s. Russian troops today are massing on the borders of many of these countries. In the case of Ukraine, Russia has recently invaded and continues to illegally occupy Crimea while arming and supporting separatists in the eastern 20 percent of the country.  Russia previously invaded Georgia in 2008 and continues to occupy about one-fifth of its territory, backing rebels in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and The Russian Government has tried and, in several cases, succeeded in executing cyber attacks against these countries' governments, most famously against Estonia in 2007. Its ongoing disinformation campaigns have created widespread doubt about Western institutions like NATO, the European Union, the OSCE--institutions that have helped to maintain a stable and peaceful world for seven decades.  These Ambassadors and the Foreign Ministers who testified yesterday before our appropriations subcommittee made clear their countries depend on the United States not just for leadership, not just for military strength but for leadership and our commitment to effective foreign assistance. These are the same requests I heard last August from Eastern European leaders, when I led a bipartisan congressional delegation--two Republican House Members, two Democratic Senate Members, and The five of us went to Ukraine, Estonia, and the Czech Republic, and we heard exactly the same message--that they are threatened by a constant wave of attacks of disinformation, both overt and covert efforts to subvert their democracies and to change the direction of their nations.  Maintaining our forms of American leadership, our support for the democracies, the civil societies, and the military, and the strength of these nations in Eastern Europe is not charity. A world committed to democracy and the rule of law is a more stable world. A stable world means Americans are safer and more economically secure. It[[Page S1676]]is that simple. That is why we must push back against Russian aggression in a bipartisan way and stand up for our allies and our values.  Conversations like this one on the floor today are important to educate our American people about the true nature of the Russian threat we face. The Russian Government's current strategy relies on disinformation and propaganda in an effort to divide the American people, both from their government and from each other.  Our discussion this afternoon makes clear that both Republicans and Democrats in Congress haven't lost our will to highlight, to condemn, and to fight Russian actions. Unassailable facts must serve as the basis for a bipartisan foreign policy. A clear-eyed understanding of Russian intentions and actions will protect us from their anti-Western propaganda and avoid the internal divisions that Russia seeks to leverage in an attempt to project its influence worldwide.  To that end, I am determined to support the efforts of Senator I am also determined to support the efforts of Senator Graham to provide sufficient funding that specifically targets the Russian Government's subversive actions. I will also continue to work with my colleagues, such as Senator Cardin, to see that his bill, 94, the Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act, is marked up this work period so the full Senate can consider this important legislation. As Senator Cardin commented, there are 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans who have already cosponsored this important bill.  Why is this bill, the Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act, so important? It will make sure the Russian Government pays a price for breaking the rules by supporting sanctions for its occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea, for its egregious human rights violations in Syria and elsewhere, and, most importantly, for directly interfering in our election. This bill would prevent the lifting of sanctions on Russia until its government ceases these activities that caused those sanctions to be put in place in the first place. The bill would also support civil society, pro-democracy, and anti-corruption activists in Russia and across  Today Vladimir Putin has a whole array of powerful modern tools that he intends to use to undermine democracy and promote his brand of authoritarianism, but as that 1950 memo to President Harry Truman made clear, Russia's goals haven't changed. Russia's goals are to oppose us, our vision, our values, and our democracy. We must make it clear that America's vision of a freer, safer, and more democratic world hasn't changed either.  I thank Senator Cardin for organizing this discussion, thank Senator Menendez for everything he has done to support these important efforts, and thank Senator Graham for hosting yesterday's important hearing. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to continue with this fight.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT SUBJECT TO DECLARATIONS,                    AN UNDERSTANDING, AND       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the      Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the      Accession of Montenegro, which was opened for signature at      Brussels on May 19, 2016, and signed that day on behalf of      the United States of America (the ``Protocol'') (Treaty      114-12), subject to the declarations of section 2 and the      conditions of section 3.     2.       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is      subject to the following declarations:       (1) Reaffirmation that united states membership in nato      remains a vital national security interest of the united      states.--The Senate declares that--       (A) for more than 60 years the North Atlantic Treaty      Organization (NATO) has served as the preeminent organization      to defend the countries in the North Atlantic area against      all external threats;       (B) through common action, the established democracies of      North America and Europe that were joined in NATO persevered      and prevailed in the task of ensuring the survival of      democratic government in Europe and North America throughout      the Cold War;       (C) NATO enhances the security of the United States by      embedding European states in a process of cooperative      security planning and by ensuring an ongoing and direct      leadership role for the United States in European security      affairs;       (D) the responsibility and financial burden of defending      the democracies of Europe and North America can be more      equitably shared through an alliance in which specific      obligations and force goals are met by its members;       (E) the security and prosperity of the United States is      enhanced by NATO's collective defense against aggression that      may threaten the security of NATO members; and       (F) United States membership in NATO remains a vital      national security interest of the United       (2) Strategic rationale for nato enlargement.--The Senate      finds that--       (A) the United States and its NATO allies face continued      threats to their stability and territorial integrity;       (B) an attack against Montenegro, or its destabilization      arising from external subversion, would threaten the      stability of Europe and jeopardize United States national      security interests;       (C) Montenegro, having established a democratic government      and having demonstrated a willingness to meet the      requirements of membership, including those necessary to      contribute to the defense of all NATO members, is in a      position to further the principles of the North Atlantic      Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North      Atlantic area; and       (D) extending NATO membership to Montenegro will strengthen      NATO, enhance stability in Southeast Europe, and advance the      interests of the United States and its NATO allies.       (3) Support for nato's open door policy.--The policy of the      United States is to support NATO's Open Door Policy that      allows any European country to express its desire to join      NATO and demonstrate its ability to meet the obligations of      NATO membership.

(6) Support for 2014 wales summit defense spending      benchmark.--The Senate declares that all NATO members should      continue to move towards the guideline outlined in the 2014      Wales Summit Declaration to spend a minimum of 2 percent of      their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defense and 20 percent[[Page S2039]]     of their defense budgets on major equipment, including      research and development, by 2024.       (7) Support for montenegro's democratic reform process.--     Montenegro has made difficult reforms and taken steps to      address corruption. The United States and other NATO member      states should not consider this important process complete      and should continue to urge additional reforms.     3.       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is      subject to the following conditions:       (1) Presidential certification.--Prior to the deposit of      the instrument of ratification, the President shall certify      to the Senate as follows:       (A) The inclusion of Montenegro in NATO will not have the      effect of increasing the overall percentage share of the      United States in the common budgets of       (B) The inclusion of Montenegro in NATO does not detract      from the ability of the United States to meet or to fund its      military requirements outside the North Atlantic area.       (2) Annual report on nato member defense spending.--Not      later than December 1 of each year during the 8-year period      following the date of entry into force of the Protocol to the      North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Montenegro,      the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional      committees a report, which shall be submitted in an      unclassified form, but may be accompanied by a classified      annex, and which shall contain the following information:       (A) The amount each NATO member spent on its national      defense in each of the previous 5 years.

3059,topic-id,736,"Mr.President, so once again we are hearing the Democrats and the media traffic in fake news. We heard a lot on this floor and over the weekend about a Muslim ban. This is a so-called Muslim ban that applies only to seven countries, and it does not apply to Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Nigeria--the five largest Muslim populations in the world. I have heard lots of claims on TV about 134 million Muslims who could be affected. Of course that leaves 1.6 billion Muslims who are not affected.  This is not a Muslim ban; this is a temporary pause of movement from seven countries, which President Trump did not pick from thin air. He picked from acts of this Congress and the Obama Department of Homeland Security--five countries in a state of near anarchy; a sixth country, Iraq, which has had a large part of its territory overrun by the Islamic State; and a seventh, Iran, which is the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. Moreover, it is not a ban; it is simply a temporary pause for 3 to 4 months to evaluate whether Obama administration policies are strong enough to keep this country safe.  We also heard claims that this is somehow unconstitutional. However, there is no free-floating global right of people around the world to come to this country. President Trump's order is nothing more than a temporary pause on migration from countries with very weak state institutions or which sponsor terrorism, while the President and the administration take a more thorough review of our vetting procedures and the refugee program as a whole.  Secretary Kelly has stated that it does not apply to green card holders. Secretary Mattis is reportedly advising that the long-term policy accommodate Iraqis with a documented history[[Page S469]]of serving with our troops, which I obviously support.  In fact, a temporary pause for security evaluations is so sensible that in November 2015, after the Paris terrorist attacks, even the minority leader suggested that ``a pause may be necessary.'' It wasn't beyond the pale then, and it is not now. Moreover, the people who are enforcing our laws on the frontlines agree with President The union for Border Patrol and Customs Enforcement agents has stated that they support this order and two other related immigration orders.  Yet here is the minority shedding crocodile tears over President Trump's immigration refugee policy, but where were those tears for the last 8 years when President Obama's foreign policy created all of these refugees? Where were the tears when President Obama overthrew the Government of Libya with nothing to follow? Where were the tears when President Obama withdrew from Iraq, leaving that country to fend off Iran and the Islamic State? Where were the tears when President Obama gave Iran $100 billion to continue its imperial campaign throughout the Middle East, to include overthrowing the Government of Yemen through its proxies? And most notoriously, where were the tears when President Obama stood idly by and watched Syria go up in flames? Spare me the tears now.  If the minority is worried about the President's counsel and wants to make a difference in the real world, I suggest we get to work and we confirm Rex Tillerson to be the Secretary of State and Jeff Sessions to be the Attorney In the meantime, I object.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING Objection is heard.  Is there further debate?

He had a fifth grade education, and now his youngest child is a Member of the 115th My father worked hard, and his word was his bond.  On January 15, 2017, President Trump promised insurance for everyone. He also promised Americans would have much lower deductibles. On January 22, 2017, President Trump's administration promised no one would lose healthcare coverage. But after only a glimpse of his plan, we now know these promises are not true, like so many other things that the White House has said.

2969,topic-id,1628,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his excellent statement summarizing the challenge we face. I thank my colleagues from Maryland and from Delaware as well.  Yesterday, we had a hearing in the Judiciary There is an individual seeking the Deputy Attorney General spot. Of course, he is seeking this position--a key position--at a critical moment in American history.  The Attorney General of the United States of America, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, announced publicly last week, on Thursday, that he was going to recuse himself from any prosecution involving the Russians and the last Presidential campaign. That is historic, and it was the right thing to do. Many of us on the Democratic side have called on him for weeks to do just that.  Senator Sessions had been an active participant in the Trump campaign, and when he became Attorney General, we felt that, in the best interests of preserving the integrity of the Department of Justice, he had to step aside when it came to the investigation of Russian involvement in that campaign.  Of course, in the meantime, during the course of this national debate, the National Security Advisor to the President of the United States, General Flynn, resigned after he misrepresented to the American people and to the Vice President of the United States conversations he had with the Russian It came to light last week that then-Senator Sessions, during the course of his confirmation hearing, gave misleading comments and answers to a question by Senator Franken, saying that he had had no contact with the Russians, either. In fact, he had.  He sent a clarification letter, but yesterday's hearing was about his successor, the Deputy Attorney General, who would have the power to oversee this investigation. The gentleman who was nominated is well known to the Senator from Maryland because he served as U.Attorney there for a number of years--since 2005. He served under President He was initially appointed under President Bush, a rare bipartisan selection, who, by every indication, is a professional prosecutor.  The disappointing moment at the hearing is when we asked Mr.Rosenstein if he had read the intelligence report that was publicly announced in January about the Russian involvement in our election campaign. It is an unclassified report. It is on the internet. It is about 15 pages long. It is as precise and conclusive as you can expect. It said quite clearly that the Russians did attempt to change the outcome of the election, that they were, in fact, working to benefit Donald Trump and against Hillary  I quickly added that this was not published by the Democratic National This was by the intelligence agencies of the U.I was disappointed when Mr.[[Page S1678]]Rosenstein said no, he had not read it. He was asked over and over again why he would not read a piece of information, a document so critical to his service as Deputy Attorney  I will set that aside for a moment and just observe the obvious. If you believe our intelligence agencies, there is no question that Russia was trying to change the outcome of the Presidential election. They were engaged, we believe, with up to a thousand trolls in some office buildings in Moscow, invading the internet, invading emails in the United States in an attempt to glean information that they could feed back to the public through Wikileaks and other sources.  Although there is no evidence to date that they had any impact on the actual casting or counting of ballots, their intent is clear. They wanted to pick Donald Trump as They believed he was a better choice for Russian interests than Hillary  Is that worthy of an investigation? I certainly hope so. To our knowledge, it is the first time in the history of the United States that a foreign power--and one that has been an adversary time and again to our interests around the world--tried to invade our election. It was, in fact, a day that will live in cyber infamy in terms of this Russian effort.  If we ignore it, we can expect several things. Get ready for the next election. Do you think they learned anything during the course of the last one? Do you think the Russians will be involved again? It would be naive to believe otherwise.  Secondly, there is a critical element here that we cannot ignore. Three weeks ago I visited Warsaw, Poland; Vilnius, Lithuania; and Kiev, I talked to those leaders--in a couple of instances, the Presidents of those countries, as well as opinion leaders, parliamentarians--and they continued to raise the same question to me. It came down to this: If the United States does not take seriously the invasion of Russia in your own Presidential campaign, will you take it seriously when Putin invades our country? You have told us under the NATO alliance, article 5, that you will stand by our side and protect us. If you don't take Putin seriously when he invades your own Presidential election, there is a lot of doubt.  Questions are being asked. Several Republican Senators have stepped up. I want to salute them. I will start with Lindsey Graham, who yesterday, again before the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee on Appropriations, made it clear that he believes we have to thoroughly investigate this Russian involvement in our Presidential election.  A few others have said the same. Unfortunately, the reaction by many Republican Senators has been lukewarm to cold. They don't want to spend the time to look into this. They would rather start talking about investigating leaks in the Trump administration or even the President's far-fetched tweets suggesting that somehow President Obama was engaged in a wiretap. It is something that has been denied not only by the former President but also by the former Director of National Intelligence and the head of the Federal Bureau of  To date, there is not one shred of evidence for the claim made by President Trump in his tweets in the early morning hours of At the same time, the need for this investigation continues. You have heard cataloged in detail--and I will not repeat it--Russian aggression over the last several years.  I have seen it. I have seen it throughout history, at least during my lifetime, and I have seen it more recently in Ukraine, in Georgia, and threats that go on every single day in countries in the Baltics and It is clear to them that they are fighting a hybrid war, not just the military threat, which is very real, but also cyber threats that at one point closed down the Estonian economy--a Russian cyber invasion closed it down--and propaganda threats, which are nonstop through cable television known as RT, Russia They continue to broadcast false information into countries like the Baltics and try to do it with impunity. That is the reality of what we are facing.  The question we face, though, as the U.Senate sworn to uphold this Constitution, is whether we are prepared to defend it against foreign powers that will undermine it, in this case the Russian  There has been a suggestion that the intelligence committees can have an investigation of this matter. I would say that in and of itself is not objectionable, but it is certainly not complete and satisfactory. The Intelligence Committee is going meet behind closed doors. We will not see the witnesses. We will not hear their testimony. The American people may not ever hear who testified and what they had to say.  Some parts of this must continue to be classified, and I understand that. But by and large, the American people have a right to know what the Russians did and how they did it so that we can make sure we defend ourselves against this in the future. The Intelligence Committees have a role, but not in its entirety.  I think there should be a special prosecutor from the Department of Justice to see if any crimes have been committed. I don't know where the evidence will lead, but we should have someone we trust, a person of integrity, who will step up and assume that role and make that investigation for the Department of  One other thing: I think this is of sufficient gravity that we should have an independent, transparent, bipartisan commission. My colleague, Senator Cardin of Maryland, is the sponsor of that legislation, which I am happy to cosponsor. That is the ultimate answer.  Let's get to the bottom of this once and for all to make certain we know what the Russians tried to do to us and to make doubly certain that it never happens again. That is the reality of this challenge.  I hope we can get bipartisan support for it. When it comes to sanctions against Russia, we have had good bipartisan support, and that is encouraging--equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans saying they should pay a price for what they did. Let's get the investigation to its conclusion.  Leon Panetta is a friend of mine and served in our government at many different levels. In the Sunday talk shows, he talked about what he would recommend to the Trump administration. He said to them very simply: Get in front of this. Don't keep reacting to this. Say that if you have done nothing wrong you are going to cooperate fully with any investigation to get to the bottom of it. That is the way to deal with it.  I hope we will have an end to the tweets and a beginning of the cooperation that is necessary so that we can get to the bottom of this situation and know the facts, wherever they may lead us.

3020,topic-id,1244,"Mr.President, yesterday I went to the White It was a great celebration of the World Series champion Chicago Cubs being recognized in the White House by our President from Illinois, Barack Of course, he is a White Sox fan, and he didn't apologize or change his stripes, but it was a great day of celebration. During the course of it, he said it was his last public event in the White House, and I came to realize that we are only days away from a new President and President Obama leaving.  I think back to a memorable moment in my life which most people wouldn't have remembered, but I will never forget. It was July 27, 2004. The place was Boston, At the last minute, I was called on to introduce a friend of mine, a skinny lawyer and State senator from Illinois who was about to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National His name was Barack I had known him for several years. I knew he was an extraordinarily gifted politician, and I knew he was a very good person.  I had seen him inspire many audiences back home, including some in the most unlikely places. I once saw him hold spellbound a group of blue-collar workers and farmers in Carroll, IL--a town which in the 1960s was completely devastated by racial tension and the presence of a local branch of the Ku Klux Klan--but even I was not prepared for the powerfully moving speech Barack Obama gave after I introduced him in It has been quoted in the He told us:       There is not a liberal America and a conservative America--     there is the United States of There is not a Black      America and a White America and Latino America and Asian      America--there's the United States of  He went on to say:       The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red      States and blue States; red States for Republicans, blue      States for But I've got news for them, too. We      worship an awesome God in the blue States, and we don't like      Federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red      We coach Little League in the blue States, and, yes,      we've got some gay friends in the red There are      patriots who opposed the war in Iraq, and there are patriots      who supported the war in  He only spoke for 17 minutes at that Boston convention--17 minutes--and in that time, he gave voice to what another tall, lanky lawyer from Illinois once called ``the better angels of our nature.'' He touched a longing deep within the hearts of millions of Americans who wanted to believe in those better angels, who wanted to believe in what Barack Obama called ``the audacity of hope,'' the audacity to believe that America, which had achieved so many miracles, was capable of even greater goodness. People inside the convention hall and millions outside who heard that speech all had the same reaction: I have seen America's future.  I remember going back to Illinois a few days after that convention and campaigning with Barack as he was running for the U.He went to the most unlikely downstate towns--Calumet, IL; Freeport, Huge crowds were coming in from adjoining States because they had seen him give that speech at the Democratic I knew there was something special about him.  His grandmother called him after he gave the speech. She gave him some advice. ``You did well,'' she said. ``I just kind of worry about you. I hope you keep your head on straight.'' Good advice for all of us.  A little over 4 years later, my friend--then the U.Senator from Illinois--was elected the 44th On inauguration day 2009, 2 million Americans stood shoulder to shoulder outside on the Mall near the Capitol dome and cheered as the son of a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas placed his hand on the family Bible of Abraham Lincoln and swore to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United  For the last 8 years, President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, their daughters Malia and Sasha, and First Grandmother Marian Robinson have made their home in the White What an irony--they were living in a house originally built by slaves.  The audacity of hope. The awe-inspiring strength of America to continually seek and stretch to be that ``more perfect Union.''  Part of the miracle of America is also the peaceful transition of power from one President to the next. As we prepare for the transition to a new President, we would do well to look back on the historic Presidency of Barack He was elected and reelected President both times convincingly.  His grandmother would be proud that he has not only kept his head on straight, he has held his head high, kept his priorities straight even amidst often unprecedented, unyielding opposition and searingly personal attacks. As First Lady Michelle Obama told us, the motto for the entire Obama family has been ``When they go low, we go high.'' We have seen that grace in them time and time again.  President Obama is a profoundly good and decent man who has served America with dignity and integrity. He has been thoughtful, calm, and resolute--never rash or impulsive. He is a disciplined leader who has grappled honestly with complex challenges facing America and the world, and he has delivered solutions that improved lives.  In his farewell speech in Chicago, President Obama quoted the fictional hero Atticus Finch, reminding us: ``You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.'' Putting himself in another person's shoes, seeing life through another person's eyes, and finding shared hopes is a lifelong habit and a special gift of this  He has tried his level best to heal and unite our divided His accomplishments are significant, and history will record many of them as profound.  He was first elected at a time when America badly needed hope. President Obama inherited--inherited--the greatest financial and economic crisis since the Great The country had lost more than 2 million jobs in the previous 4 months before he was sworn in. By inauguration day, the country's top four banks had lost half their value in less than a year. There was an urgent danger that not only the American economy would collapse, but the economy of the Western world was teetering in the balance.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, called the stimulus bill, saved the U.and global economy from a major crash and helped create the conditions for recovery. Unemployment today is at 4.9 percent. America has just seen the longest streak of private job creation in the Nation's history. To borrow a phrase, thanks,  Our friends across the aisle said: Let America's auto industry die. The Obama administration said: No way. They decided to place their bets on American manufacturing and workers instead. The Center for Automotive Research estimates that the special bankruptcy process for General Motors and Chrysler saved at least 1.5 million American jobs. Detroit has posted record profits for 7 years in a row. Barack Obama would not give up on American autoworkers or American auto companies, and it paid off.  Predatory lending and other systemic abuses were the cancer at the heart of the great financial meltdown of 2008 and 2009.  The PRESIDING The Senator's time has expired.

President Obama inherited a Federal budget hemorrhaging red ink. Under his watch, the budget deficit has fallen $1 trillion, despite record investments in education, green energy, broadband, high-speed rail, medical research, and other high-return priorities.[[Page S329]]  He brought us the Affordable Care I am not going to dwell on it because I spoke on it before when the other Senators were on the floor.  There was a skit on ``Saturday Night Live'' last week that talked about, would the Republicans be happy if we banned the word ``ObamaCare''? Can we stick with the Affordable Care Act since it is helping so many people? Sometimes we think that is what this is all about: We have to get rid of it because it has his name on it. Well, we shouldn't. We should reflect on the good that it has done and make sure we do nothing less in the future. Health insurance costs are going down at the fastest rate in 50 years. Medicare gets an additional projected 10 years of solvency because of the Affordable Care Numerous Republican Governors, including Vice President-Elect Mike Pence, have used Medicaid expansion of ObamaCare to reduce the uninsured in their  On the issue of climate, I will defer to my friend from Rhode Island, who has stepped off of the floor for a moment, but when it comes to this, President Obama has taken climate change seriously. He does not view it as an unproven theory or a Chinese-authored hoax; he believes it is a fact, and so do It is a threat to the existence of humanity, and we are running out of time to prevent a climate catastrophe.  Americans built on the historic breakthrough at the 2015 U.summit on climate change in When that summit ended, 195 countries joined the United States and agreed to lower greenhouse gas emissions.  The President once told a group of young people: ``I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that is beyond fixing.''  We have a safer and more secure This President brought troops home--massive numbers of troops--who were dispatched around the world in harm's way. He understands we can't fix all the world's problems. We learned that the hard way. He banned the use of torture. We have seen the withdrawal of the majority of U.troops from Iraq and Al Qaeda has been decimated, Osama bin Laden is history, and ISIS is on the run.  Under President Obama, Americans led the successful global effort to conquer an Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and he helped preserve a democratic Ukraine, despite the aggression of Vladimir Putin of He has restored relations with Cuba after 50 years of a failed policy. The President and John Kerry had enormous diplomatic success with the Iran agreement to protect our friend and ally Israel and many other states in the Middle  I want to close by saying that his efforts in two areas are personal to me. Criminal justice reform, this President is determined to make sure our sentencing laws are just. There are things going on now that are just indefensible. We have been jailing people and imprisoning them for drug crimes for decades--unacceptable. The President is determined to get this done. We did part of it. I hope we can do more.  Finally, let me just say that this President, more than any, has really shown a caring for the DREAMers, a bill I introduced 16 years ago, so that those who came to the United States as children, through no fault of their own undocumented, would get a chance. That was it. He put together DACA, an Executive order which gave them that chance.  We have to work now to protect these bright, young people. I am so encouraged that Speaker Paul Ryan, at the CNN town meeting last week, acknowledged this and said he was willing to work to make sure we protected them. Barack Obama was the one who gave them this opportunity, and now it is up to us to follow through and give them a fair shake in life.  Mr.President, to reiterate, the affordable Care and Patient Protection Act that our colleagues across the aisle are now rushing headlong to repeal--without anything to replace it--represents the greatest advance in economic fairness and security for most Americans since at least the creation of Medicare 50 years ago.  ObamaCare has made the health coverage of all insured Americans more secure and more valuable by: outlawing discrimination based on pre-existing conditions; eliminating costs for checkups, mammograms and many other preventive measures; and allowing young people to stay on their parent's policies until age 26--among other new protections.  It has reduced the ranks of uninsured Americans by 20 million, and it has saved money. That's not a matter of opinion, it's a fact.  According to an analysis by the respected, nonpartisan Brookings Institution, health insurance exchange premiums are 44 percent lower today than they would have been without  Health insurance costs are going down at the fastest rate in 50 years.  Numerous Republican Governors--including Vice President-Elect Mike Pence--have used the Medicaid expansion in ObamaCare to reduce the uninsured in their That's a good thing.  But now President-Elect Trump and our Republican colleagues tell us that they want to repeal ObamaCare, cancel those patient protections, go back to the days when insurance companies write all the rules, and leave 20 million Americans without insurance.  They say they will come up ``fairly easily'' with something better than  I say to my friends: If it were easy, it would have happened already. Work with us to fix the things that can be improved, not kill it. Lives are at stake.  President Obama understands that climate change is not an unproven theory or a Chinese-authored hoax, it is a fact. It is a threat to the very existence of humanity and we are running out of time to prevent a climate catastrophe.  Under Barack Obama, America went from being the chronic spoiler to being a world leader in global climate change negotiations.  We reached a sweeping bilateral climate pact with China to cut greenhouse gas emissions--something critics said could never happen.  American built on that historic breakthrough at the 2015 U.summit on climate change in When the summit ended, 195 countries had agreed to lower greenhouse-gas emissions.  The President once told a group of young people: ``I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that's beyond fixing.''  He has done his part to keep that commitment. We should build on his progress, not reverse it.  The cornerstone of President Obama's foreign policy is a recognition that America remains the world's one indispensable nation and that we, and the world, are safer when America chooses engagement over either isolation or unilateralism.  He also understands that America cannot fix all of the world's problems. We have to choose wisely, based on our ideals, our priorities and our limits.  He banned the use of torture. He has seen the withdrawal of the majority of U.troops from Iraq and Al Qaeda has been decimated, ISIS is on the run, and Osama Bin Laden is dead.  Under President Obama, America led the successful global effort to contain and conquer an Ebola epidemic in West  And we helped preserve a democratic Ukraine against Russian aggression.  President Obama announced plans to restore normal relations with Cuba--reversing 50 years of a failed policy that done at least as much harm to America's relations with our neighbors in this hemisphere as it had done to depose the Castro regime.  The President and Secretary of State John Kerry made a momentous diplomatic success in negotiating an agreement to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons, protecting our ally Israel and many nations across the  The Iran nuclear deal holds the promise of defusing a ticking time bomb. If Iran fails to live up to that promise, we will know quickly and we will take the steps to stop them.  I want to touch briefly on two other issues that I have worked on very closely and to which I am deeply committed.  The first is the growing, bipartisan movement to end America's era of overincarceration.  America has 5 percent of the world's population--and nearly 25 percent of the world's prisoners. That ignominious fact is largely the result of inflexible antidrug laws that disproportionately punish people of color, especially poor people of color.[[Page S330]]  In 2010, President Obama signed a law that I introduced with Senator Sessions called the Fair Sentencing It replaced a Federal law that demanded dramatically harsher sentences for convictions involving crack cocaine than powder cocaine.  I have worked with Democrats and some brave Republican colleagues for a few years to further reform Federal sentencing--to allow Federal judges some discretion in nonviolent drug cases, and eliminate ``three strikes and you're out law'' and other overly harsh and inflexible laws that are overly harsh and hugely expensive to enforce.  In the absence of action from us, President Obama has used his powers to commute the sentences of more than 1,000 people--more than 50 times the number of people whose sentences were commuted by President George Bush and more than the past 11 Presidents combined.  We can't have it both ways. If we don't want President's to use their lawful Executive authority to correct injustices, we need to correct those injustices ourselves. I hope we will do so in this new  Finally, we must--we must--fix America's broken immigration system.  And let's start by assuring DREAMers--those young people who were brought to this country as children and who are undocumented through no fault of their own--that we will not deport them from the only nation they have ever called home.  I have come to this floor dozens of times to tell you their stories. They are scholars, American soldiers, researchers, doctors, engineers, lawyers, clergy members.  DACA--the President's Executive order--allows them to stay in this country temporarily while Congress works to pass a comprehensive immigration reform plan that meets the needs of our economy, and honors our values and our unique and powerful heritage as a nation of immigrants.  More than 750,000 DREAMers put their trust in our Government and came forward to register under  What will happen to them if--as many fear--DACA is not extended?  Immigrants are not a threat to Immigrants are The sooner we acknowledge that fact and align our laws with it, the better we will be.  Mr.President, I could go on for quite some time about what President Obama, Vice President Biden, and their administration have meant for America, but time precludes that so I will close with these last thoughts.  In that historic speech he delivered in Boston 12 years ago, President Obama told us that, in his father's native tongue, the name ``Barack'' means ``blessing.''  President Obama leaves office now as the most popular politician in America, and assured of his place in history. I believe that America has been fortunate--even blessed--by his service and sacrifice as our  President Obama has also warned us that ``History travels not only forwards; history can travel backwards, history can travel sideways.''

3063,topic-id,3146,"Mr.President, this is the 11th day of the Trump To say that these have been tumultuous days is certainly an understatement. What happened over this past weekend really was unsettling to many people all across the United  Candidate Trump made it clear that he had strong feelings about refugees and strong feelings about immigration, but I don't think anyone anticipated the Executive orders that were issued by the Trump administration, by the President, on The net result of that we saw across the United States at O'Hare International Airport, JFK, Dulles, many other airports. International travelers, en route, learned that the laws of the United States were being changed because of President Trump's Executive order. As a result, there was a lot of confusion and uncertainty, and hardships were created. Individuals who were coming to the United States as refugees were being turned away.  For the record, this decision to indefinitely suspend the admission of Syrian refugees into the United States is not a decision based on fact. Since 9/11, since the war in Syria began, we have not had a single--not one--instance of terrorism by a Syrian refugee--not one. The United States has not stepped up as other countries like Canada have in admitting Syrian refugees. We have gone to great lengths, extraordinary lengths, to give background checks that are as consuming as one can imagine, to verify their identity and their safety to the United  Overwhelmingly, these Syrian refugees are the victims of a deadly war which has gone on for years, and overwhelmingly they are children with their mothers. I have met them. I sat down with them in It is heartbreaking to think that they have lived through war, may have been lucky enough to make it to a refugee camp, and then waited for years--for years--to be cleared by the United States and be given a chance to come to this country.  It has to be a heartbreaking process. Through it all, many of them have endured losses in their families that they will never be able to forget--injuries and deaths of people whom they love. These are men and women in Syria escaping a deadly war and the terrorists who have ravaged that country. They have tried to come to the United States for safety and security.  The history of refugees in America is one that in modern version is very admirable, but unfortunately before--during World War II--it was a sad chapter in our history. Not only did we inter about 120,000 Japanese Americans in camps during the war for fear that they would betray the United States, but during that war, time and again, the administration of President Roosevelt as well as Congress refused to allow those who were escaping the Holocaust in Nazi Germany to come to the United  Here on this Senate floor where I stand, an effort was made by Senator Robert Wagner of New York to admit 10,000 Jewish children out of Nazi Germany into the United States so that their parents would have the peace of mind that they would not be killed by the war or the That measure was defeated on the floor of this Prior to our entry into the war, those who tried to escape Nazi Germany and come to the United States were turned away by the United States.[[Page S470]]  The most notorious example was the SS Louis, which sailed from Germany, came to, first, Havana, Cuba, then to Miami, FL, and was turned away in both places with about 900 passengers who feared for their lives because of the anti-Semitism and the killing that was taking place in Nazi  They tracked that passenger list. Several hundred of them were rejected by the United They were not given refugee status. They were forced to return to Several hundred of them perished in the  It was after that bitter experience that the United States decided to try to set an example for the world when it came to compassion and humanity for refugees. We stepped up time and again to be that place of security and safety. We can point proudly to the fact that when the Cubans were fearful of a Communist takeover in their country, fearful for their lives and their rights and their liberties, they came to the United States in tens of thousands.  Now Cuban Americans, a proud part of our country not only in Florida but around our Nation, can point to the U.refugee policy as the means by which they finally made it to the safety of the United Here we were in a Cold War with the Soviet Union; Cuba, 90 miles off our shore was being taken over by a dictator, Fidel Castro, who was declaring his loyalty to the Soviet Yet we were readily receiving tens of thousands of refugees from Cuba in the midst of that Cold Talk about a chance--and taking a chance. Those men and women who came to the United States were not vetted for months, years, and in many cases not at all. They were allowed into our country. Thank goodness we did it. It was the right thing to do.  Time and again, whether it was refugees coming in from Vietnam after the end of that deadly war or whether it was Soviet Jews, persecuted by the Soviet Union, trying to escape, coming to the United States, we opened our doors and said: The United States of America will set an example for the world when it comes to refugees. That defined who we were and who we still should be.  Now this new President is ready to walk away from that. If we had one instance of a Syrian refugee coming into the United States after that vetting process who caused harm to our citizens or engaged in an act of terrorism--if we had one--then perhaps this President could start to make his case.  All he has is fear, unreasoned fear, unproven fear. We recall what Franklin Roosevelt said to this Nation, standing right out here on the steps when he was inaugurated in March of 1933: We have nothing to fear but fear itself. It is fear itself that is motivating this President to make decisions inconsistent with more than 50 years of American history and inconsistent with American values.  When you meet these refugees and you hear their heartbreaking stories, how can you say that there is no room for you in this country? Yet that is exactly what he said.  Sadly, he not only came up with this Executive order, he did it in a fashion where the agencies that were supposed to implement the order really were caught by surprise. Now they are priding themselves on the fact that they can turn on a dime when given instructions that are important for national security. But in this case, where national security was not the motive--political security was the motive; I am talking in the crassest terms. In those cases, these agencies were forced to make split-second decisions, and some of them were horrible.  A man who came to the United States from Iraq, from one of the seven countries designated by President Trump, came from Iraq after having risked his life for American soldiers. He was rewarded with an opportunity to come to the United States, was detained at the airport, questioned at length, threatened to be returned to Iraq, and finally--after 19 hours--allowed to stay.  There is story after story of families coming to see someone who was on the deathbed, their last chance to be together, and families who had gone overseas for what they thought were just casual or really easy trips who were subject to detention and some turned away. Why? It certainly was not in the interest of the security of the United States, and it was not handled in a professional manner. It was impulsive and not decisive. It was ill conceived instead of wise.  Here we are today. As I stand here at this chair and this desk in the Senate, across the street thousands have gathered in front of the Supreme Court to express their outrage over the Executive orders issued by President I am happy to report that almost one dozen Republican Senators have joined us in expressing reservations about this policy.  It gives me hope that maybe on a bipartisan basis we can rein in some of the excesses of this administration. God forbid we ignore the basic constitutional issue that has been raised by these Executive orders. It is no coincidence that these seven countries are predominately Muslim countries. It is no coincidence that President Trump went on a Christian broadcasting station and said preference would be given to  The Constitution which we are sworn to uphold and defend, the Constitution which guides this Nation is one that was written at a time when religion was a divisive issue that led to people coming to the United  I think in this section, our Founding Fathers probably showed more wisdom and more understanding of our future than any other on the issue of religion. They only said three things in the entire Constitution, three things over 200 years ago. They said that this Congress, this government, will not establish an official religion. They did that, of course, many of them having come from England, where they had a national church. They didn't want that in the United Most importantly, they said each person in America had freedom of religious belief, to believe what they wished or to believe nothing if they wished, and that would be an honored freedom under our Bill of The third element: Religion could not be used as a litmus test for public office. That is it.  When you think of all the wars and all the deaths and all the persecution based on religion, the fact that we have largely escaped it is because of the wisdom of that document.  Now comes this 45th President of the United States who decides to rewrite the book, to ignore this basic constitutional direction and mandate, and to say on the Christian Broadcasting Network: We are going to favor Christian refugees coming to the United That, to me, is unacceptable and unconstitutional, and inconsistent with who we are, what we are, and the values we treasure in this country.  My mother was an immigrant to this country. I never knew my grandmother, who brought her over on the ship from I do have one thing now in my office upstairs that my grandmother carried with her to this country. It is a prayer book. We are a Roman Catholic family. She was a Roman Catholic in The Russian Orthodox religion was being pushed by the czar, who was dominant when they left Lithuania, and they banned Catholic prayer books written in  I never knew my grandmother. I wish I had. She risked everything to bring that Catholic prayer book, that contraband from czarist-controlled Lithuania into the United I have it upstairs. It means the world to me that this woman with limited formal education but unlimited courage was willing to risk a lot, bringing three small children into this country, carrying with her that prayer book which might have gotten her imprisoned in Lithuania back in her day. So religion means a lot to our family, not just on a personal basis but what America means when it comes to religion.  When this President is so casual with the constitutional guarantees of religion, I don't believe he is serving the United States or honoring the history that came before him.  There have been so many issues that have come up during the 11 days of his Presidency, but President Trump's decision to turn away innocent people fleeing persecution, genocide, and terror and to ban immigrants on the basis of religion is the worst, in my view. This attack is not only un-American, it risks alienating 1 billion Muslims around the world. Some of the most conservative people in this country--I am certain Republicans--have said over and over again: Don't do this. There are Muslim countries that are[[Page S471]]allies in fighting terrorism, and if you alienate them, it is going to lessen our ability to stop the spread of Al Qaeda and  Furthermore, this is a recruiting tool. You know what is going to happen. Those who hate the United States are going to use this action by President Trump to verify their belief and their credo that the United States is anti- There was a Republican President, George Bush, whom I disagreed with many times, but thank goodness, after 9/11, he had the wisdom and showed the leadership to come before the American people to say: We are not going to condemn the Muslim religion. We are going to go after those who corrupted it, but we are going to honor it as a religion of peace.  How different President George Bush, that Republican President, was to President Donald Trump, this Republican  Senator Dianne Feinstein is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary She has introduced a resolution, on which I am proud to be one of the original cosponsors, to repeal and rescind these reprehensible President Donald Trump Executive orders on refugees and immigration.  We are in the midst of the worst refugee crisis in the history of the world. More than 65 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes. The brutal Syrian conflict, which is the epicenter of this humanitarian crisis, has killed hundreds of thousands, injured more than a million, and displaced half of the population of that country. In some areas, children literally starve to death in This conflict has forced more than 4.7 million refugees to flee. Around 70 percent of them are women and children who are looking for a safe place in this world. Half of Syrian children today are not in school because of this conflict and because of the forces that have dispersed them around the world. Millions in and outside of Syria need humanitarian assistance.  Last week--the same week President Trump signed this awful Executive order on refugees--the United Nations issued an appeal for $4.6 billion to meet the basic needs of Syrian refugees and struggling communities hosting them in neighboring countries.  Lebanon is a country where I believe half of the children in school today are Jordan, one of our best friends and allies in the Middle East, has made more sacrifices on behalf of refugees per capita than any nation on What message does it send to our friends in Jordan that while they risk the security and safety and stability of their nation to absorb these refugees from Syria and around the world, that as an official policy of President Donald Trump, the United States no longer will even consider allowing a Syrian refugee to come to the United States? How can we in good conscience ask the King of Jordan to risk his monarchy and his country for refugees when President Trump says they are not allowed in the United States?  Earlier this month, I am happy to report, more than 1,700 Jewish rabbis called on our government to maintain and strengthen the refugee program for refugees of all ethnic and religious backgrounds--not to halt it, pause it, or restrict it. This weekend, I was so proud of the Catholic cardinal in Chicago, Blase Cupich, who came out and said the Executive orders of Donald Trump are not consistent with American values and certainly are not consistent with the beliefs of the Catholic Religious leaders all across the country are speaking out. They understand that this is more than a political test; this is a moral test of who we are as  Many of the refugees who came to this country were fleeing regimes that were hostile to the United We gave them safety.  Refugees are the most carefully vetted and investigated of all travelers. Before refugees are admitted into the United States, they go through security screening that is almost unheard of. All of that screening takes place before they can even consider being allowed to set foot in America, and Syrian refugees go through an even stricter review. Extreme vetting? I have news for this President: Syrian refugees and refugees all over the world are already going through extreme vetting.  Shutting down the Refugee Resettlement Program won't protect our security. It plays into ISIS's argument that the United States is waging a war against  Listen to what Michael Hayden, former Director of the CIA and National Security Agency under Presidents Bush and Obama, said about President Trump's Executive order:       It's a horrible move. It is a political, ideological move      driven by the language of the campaign and, frankly, campaign      promises--promises in the campaign that were hyped by an      exaggeration of the threat. And in fact, what we're doing now      has probably made us less safe today than we were Friday      morning before this happened because we are now living the      worst jihadist narrative possible, that there is undying      enmity between Islam and the Muslims out there who were      not part of the jihadist movement are now being shown that      the story they were being told by the jihadists--they hate      us; they're our enemy--that's being acted out by the American      government. And frankly, at a humanitarian level, it's an      abomination.  That statement was not made by the Democratic National Committee; it was made by Michael Hayden, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency under Presidents Bush and  If we are serious about protecting America, we should be serious about closing the real loopholes that might threaten us. Think of the hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program who go through no vetting, not even fingerprinting, before they get on a plane to come to the United Want to close a loophole in security? Let's look at that one seriously.  Instead of real security threats, President Trump is focusing on innocent people--children, women, families who are fleeing terrorism.  Today's refugees, like millions before them from all over the world, will become proud Americans who contribute greatly to our society and economy.  Albert Einstein was a refugee. Thank goodness he came to the United Today, so many of the leaders of our major corporations and high-tech companies are immigrants to this country and, in some cases, refugees.  Building walls on our borders and fear in our hearts will not move America forward. Let's not continue the cruelty or deception of blaming immigrants and refugees for our security and economic challenges. Let's work together to build a better America for all Americans, including new Americans, no matter the color of their skin, where their parents were born, or how they pray.

2842,topic-id,3755,"Madam Speaker, today is Tuesday, January 31. It has been 11 days since the inauguration of our new President; and, oh my goodness, has it been an extraordinary 11 days. I just hardly know where to begin.  Normally I come up here, and we talk about how we can grow the American economy, how we can provide jobs, how we can see a return of our manufacturing industries, but I am compelled today to pick up comments on the last 11 days.  I was at a dinner out in California on Friday evening, and a wide variety of people from multiple interest groups were there: some labor unions, some farmers, senior citizens, healthcare folks, teachers. There was an overwhelming sense of concern--deep concern--about the direction this country is going. Some of these friends of mine were Republicans and others were Democrats; some liberal, some conservative.  But to a person, they came up to me and said: Oh, my God, what is happening in Washington? Where is this going? What is he doing? What does it mean to us?  And some of them said: Will they really actually terminate the Affordable Care Act? Is ObamaCare really going to end? What about my insurance policy; will I lose it? I am on Medi-What will happen to me?  And teachers saying: How does this fit with the effort to improve our schools?  And some that had been in the military looked at some of what was going on and said: But veterans' care, this hiring freeze affects the Department of Veterans What does it mean to me? What is happening in Washington?  Some others were concerned about, well, there is going to be this transportation bill, infrastructure bill. How are they going to fund it? Is it really going to happen?  I have been to many events in my years in public office, but I have never been to an event in which there was this overwhelming concern about what's going to happen in  I have seen changes occur. Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan, there was concern, but not the kind of angst, deep emotional concern about where this country is going. I have seen George H.Bush to Bill Clinton, and I am sure there were many Republicans concerned about where Bill Clinton would go, and then Clinton to George Bush, and then to Obama, but nothing like this.  It is not just last Friday night. Today, in front of my office in Davis, California, 200 people showed up to say: You have got to do something. You have got to make it clear that we can't have these shutting down our borders. You can't let them do that. Davis, California, the University of California, there are 5,000 foreign students and teachers on that campus. There are more than 200 from the countries that are affected by the immigration and by the ban on people coming in from those seven countries. What does it mean, they asked me? And what about the Affordable Care Act?  All across this Nation people are demonstrating. It is now 20 minutes to 7 here in Washington, D.C., and I suppose at 8 tonight the President is supposed to give a nationwide address on his next Supreme Court nominee. I am quite certain that tomorrow morning there will be another eruption of concern by Americans as to what does it mean if the Supreme Court throws out the role of the Federal Government in protecting voter rights? What does it mean if the Federal Government isn't there to assure that a woman's body is her own?  All across this Nation people are going: Oh, what is happening?  Executive order after executive order, starting with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and instructions to every agency of the Federal Government to stop it, see that it doesn't work. And here in Congress, a budget resolution that calls for the elimination of the financial support for the Affordable Care Act which, if you remove the money, what happens to the subsidies, the tax subsidies that people are able to use to be able to afford healthcare insurance, the additional money that goes to the States for their Medicaid programs?  And, oh, what about the seniors? If that budget resolution actually goes through, the money that is in the Affordable Care Act to provide the seniors the opportunity to have their drug benefit costs reduced, affecting millions of American seniors, the money is gone. Will the drug benefit be gone also? Most assuredly it would unless, of course, you want to just increase the deficit.  And about that free annual visit that is available to seniors that has clearly extended the life of thousands or tens of thousands of seniors because they find out they have high blood pressure. They can take a cheap pill, get that blood pressure down and not have a stroke. Or maybe diabetes, the onset of diabetes. That free annual benefit checkup, will it still be available if the budget resolution and if Mr.Trump's attack on the Affordable Care Act actually happens?  People are worried. People are frightened. And they should be. They should be. Because this goes to the very ability of Americans to carry on their tasks, protections that are necessary to protect Americans from fraud. The House of Representatives today voted to pass a rule that would lead to the elimination of protections that Americans have in their financial services. I don't know how we repeal the Affordable Care  And how are we going to protect America by building a wall? What is it going to cost? 15, 20, 30 billion dollars?  Most people who look at the immigration issue rationally would say it is not going to solve the problem. And besides that, the problem is dramatically reduced as a result of the Mexican economy growing and jobs being available there as a result of the enormous build-up that has already occurred with the Border Patrol and the immigration service. We have seen a dramatic reduction.  I was told today by some people that work in this field in California that the people who are coming into the United States illegally are mothers and children from Central America who are seeking refuge from the horrible gangs and violence in Central They are not sneaking over the border. They are presenting themselves at the border as refugees. We will come back to the refugee issue in a few moments.                              {time}  1845  How proud he looks, signing yet another executive order, this one on a wall. We are going to build a wall, 1,400 miles of wall between the United States and So with a look of pride, he wants to spend anywhere[[Page H809]]from $15 billion to $30 billion. So tell me what you could do with $15 billion. That is the minimum cost of the wall. Most people say it is probably closer to $30 billion.  What could you do with $15 billion? Well, I suppose you can build part of a wall, or you could start to build a wall. You are certainly not going to finish it. But let's just say you have got $15 billion and that is your down payment on a wall that most everybody says wouldn't work. That is not a joke. If you build a 50-foot-high wall, someone will get a 51-foot-tall ladder.  I am familiar with the universities in California State University has 460,000 students. So for $15 billion, you could fund the entire California State University system, provide tuition-free education for 3 years for 460,000 students, and pay all the faculty and the janitors and all the others. That is for $15 billion.  Now, if it is a $30 billion wall, then it is 6 years. So a junior in high school, for $30 billion, could go free, tuition free, all expenses paid. Every professor, every janitor, fully paid for 6 years--460,000 students and thousands upon thousands of professors, teachers, janitors, et cetera.  Or you could replace every pipe in Flint, Michigan, 270 times over. Do you want to solve the problem in Flint, Michigan, the lead pipe problem? 270 times for $15 billion, or that is more than 500 times, 540 times.  Or maybe you are concerned about Alzheimer's. And what American family is not concerned about Alzheimer's? If we were to spend that $15 billion on research, we would undoubtedly be able to develop a treatment--and this is what the scientists and doctors and researchers say. And we did increase the funding from around $500 million to just under $1 billion last year. But if you were able to ramp it up and develop that treatment for Alzheimer's, you could delay the onset of Alzheimer's in your family, or mine, by 5 years. And what does that mean? It means about a $220 billion in savings to the American taxpayers because that is money that will be spent for Medicare and  Or maybe you are just interested in national defense. Do you like submarines, the new Virginia class submarine? Well, let's see. We could build five of them. Or maybe you like aircraft carriers. For $15 billion, you could build one of the new aircraft carriers and an additional submarine.  So President Trump, what is our choice? You don't like these choices, and you want to build a wall that nobody believes will do much good dealing with illegal immigration?  Oh, I like this next one; 27,777 4-year, full-ride scholarships for an undergraduate program at the University of That is about the total undergraduate population at the University of California, Davis, which I have the honor of representing.  But we are going to build a wall. We are going to build a wall. For what purpose? 435 of us here and 100 Senators and one President have a task of making choices about what America is all about, choices about how we spend your tax money. You want your tax money spent on a wall?  Oh, excuse me. Mexico is going to pay for it. Do you think so?  The President has started a trade war with Mexico, has created a serious diplomatic crisis with our neighbor and our third largest trading partner, over trying to force Mexico to pay for his wall. Oh, that was really smart. But, hey, he's the President and he thinks he can do what he wants to do. Well, the Mexican President said, no, no, it is not going to be paid for by  So who is going to pay for it? I say we have choices. I would much rather us spend our money on education, national defense, Alzheimer's, and on things that actually help Americans in so many different ways. That is just one of the issues that is in play.  Immigration? Oh, we put out a new executive order on immigration, and seven countries around the world cannot have their citizens any longer come to America for some period of time, and refugees from those countries can't come to What are those countries? Well, let me see. Among the seven, I believe there is this country called  Excuse me, Mr.Isn't Iraq our ally in fighting ISIS? I think so. It is their troops plus 6,000 of our troops that are now engaged in a bitter fight to reclaim Mosul, to wipe ISIS out of And so you are going to put a limitation on Iraqi citizens and refugees coming to the United States? I am sorry. I don't understand what sense that makes, Mr.Do you? Do you understand what you just did?  There is a four-star general in Iraq who is responsible for their Special Forces that are leading the fight in Mosul right now. This man's family came to the United States for safety because of the problems that existed there in He cannot visit his family. Unless there is some sort of a waiver that has suddenly been developed for four-star Iraqi generals, he cannot go to Central Command in Tampa, Florida, to work on a strategy for the rest of the fight.  Oh, my What is going on here? What is happening? What sense does any of this make? Foreign policy experts, national security experts, experts on ISIS, on radical Islam all say the same thing. The ban on people traveling from those seven majority Muslim states will have a negative effect on our ability to deal with That is what they say. Not my view, that is the view of security experts all across the spectrum, from the most conservative to the most progressive and liberal and everybody in between. This makes no sense whatsoever, Mr. We sometimes use the word ``half-baked.'' This is not even beginning the process of being baked. This was put together by somebody that didn't know what they were doing. If they had consulted with policy experts outside of that little cabal in the White House, somebody might have said: Time out, time out, time out. Let's think this through. Why Iraq?  What is going to be the second step here? Easy enough, we are going to set the ban. But what does it mean? What does it mean to Muslim countries around the world that suddenly America is seen as shutting the door--or, shall we say, slamming the door--on Muslims? What does it mean here in the United States? It means that we are not safer. It means that our country is not protected, and, in fact, the action taken is counterproductive. That is what it means.  Who did this? Who is the architect of this policy? Was it the State Department? Apparently not. Was it the Justice Department? We know from the midnight firing--well, I guess it was actually 6 o'clock firing--yesterday of the acting Attorney General that it wasn't the Justice They had an opportunity to review and look at the legality of the ban. They didn't involve themselves, and apparently the military didn't involve themselves.  So who was it that dreamed up this ban on men, women, children, refugees coming from seven countries?  None of the residents and refugees from those countries in the last 40 years has been responsible for one terrorist death in the United But those countries from which we know the terrorists came, from 9/11, were not included.  Saudi Arabia, not included in the ban. How is that, if we are worried about this problem of refugees who are citizens from those countries coming into the United States to carry out terrorist acts? Why didn't you look at Saudi Arabia? That is where most of the 9/11 folks came from. Or maybe Chechnya or Congo or  So who wrote it? Who is responsible? Well, two names have emerged. One, a Mr.Miller, and another, a Mr.Bannon, a Mr.Bannon who is the architect of the emergence of the alt-right. We are not talking about the conservative right. We are talking about the far right White nationalist movement in this  Mr.Bannon, who became Mr.Trump's campaign chairman, who is now the key person in the White House, not just on political policy, but on national security policy. He is said to have said, in 2013, that he is a Leninist and his goal is to blow up the system. He says he doesn't remember having said that. Well, I will take him at his word. But I do know that what he did with this ban for these seven countries is to make our Nation less safe. That, we know.  And just to double down on this issue of this superconservative fellow Mr.Bannon and his cohort Mr.Miller, just to make clear where we are headed, there has been a reorganization of the[[Page H810]]National Security These are the men and women that, over the years, have been responsible for making certain that our American policy maximizes our security that deals with international issues of great concern: what to do about China in the South China Sea, what to do about North How do we handle missile defense? How do we deal with Russia in the Ukraine? The National Security  So what happened yesterday? Well, the President, which he has a right to do, reorganized the National Security And two gentlemen, or two people, that have traditionally been on the National Security Council, who seem to know a little bit about national security, were previously in what is called the principles. These are the handful of people that meet with the President, the key national security leaders.                              {time}  1900  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is one of them and the Director of the National Intelligence organization--the two of them.  The President says: I don't need you in my little inner circle. Go away. You can be part of the larger thing, and when I want you, I will call you.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the person responsible for the collection of our national intelligence--push him aside.  Who came in to take the place of the two people--the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence? Guess who? Mr.Is he a national security expert? He spent a few years in the military decades ago, but now he is sitting as one of the principals on our National Security What is his mindset? Read his history. I wouldn't recommend you go to Breitbart--I wouldn't spend a whole lot of time on that--but there is a history here. There is a history, and it is a dangerous history.  This man is now sitting as the principal voice, because he has the President's ear, on the National Security Council--the fellow, together with Mr.Miller, who is responsible for the ban on immigrants, travelers, and refugees from seven countries, which has become a major international, diplomatic crisis. ISIS is already using that ban--it is right here in the newspaper--to recruit in the Middle East, to recruit in Africa, and to encourage homegrown violence and terrorism here in the United  Well done, Mr. Well done, Mr. And very bad for our country.  We are in the midst of executive orders, one after another--often two a day. My final concern is one that comes up 25 days from now. Five days ago, Trump went over to the Pentagon and signed yet another executive order. He came out of the meeting and said: We are going to have a new war plan. We are going to wipe ISIS from the face of the Earth, and the Pentagon will deliver to me in 30 days a war plan to wipe ISIS off the face of the   Go with care. Be slow to war.  We will see what that plan is. My guess is it will cost millions upon millions--if not billions--of dollars. It will put our troops--boots--back on the ground in Iraq and Syria, and we will start the cycle one more time. We will see. We will see what the Pentagon comes up with in a war plan. We have not been told the specific instructions that the Commander in Chief has given to the Pentagon; but I will tell you that this member of the House Armed Services Committee is very concerned. Keep in mind that our effort against ISIS and al Qaeda is based on a 2001 authorization to use military force in Afghanistan against al Qaeda and related entities. It has been stretched.  One of the things that I am quite concerned about coming out of the Obama administration is that that administration stretched the 2001--a 16-year-old--authorization to use force--a declaration of war against al Qaeda--to justify the American military actions in Iraq, Syria, Liberia, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, and  We will see what the war plan is--we will learn soon enough--and I suspect that this Congress will be asked to finance it. We will be asked to pay for the men and women who will be sent into harm's way and for the munitions and the airplanes and the other equipment necessary.  I would hope that all of us take a long, long look at this and that we ask this question: If we do that, then what happens next? We didn't ask that question when we went to war in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002. We didn't ask that question when we invaded Iraq a couple of years later. I am not sure we have asked that question as we reengage ourselves in the current Iraqi war and Syria; but we should always ask: What is the result of our action? What is likely to happen?  We have choices. We have choices to build a wall or to educate our children or to care for our seniors. We have choices about war or not. We have choices about how we deal with people around this world, choices about what we do with refugees--people who are fleeing persecution, fleeing death--who are doing the very, very best they can to care for their families and children in the most desperate of situations. We have a choice. We can slam the door on them and say ``tough luck,'' or we can do what ought to be the American tradition, and that is to provide comfort, to provide assistance, and to show the good part of  Mr.President, you have given us 10 days of the most disruptive chaos I have ever seen in my many years in public life. You have a choice, too, Mr.You have a choice to take a deep breath, to not try to carry out every one of your campaign promises, most of which I think were ill-founded. You don't have to do it on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. You can take a deep breath, and you can think, together with Mr.Bannon or with Mr.Miller or with, perhaps, somebody outside of your little inner circle.  Mr.President, you might ask other people what is the effect of what you are doing. Think about the second level of effect, and slow it down, and be aware that there are consequences. For every action, there is going to be another reaction. We are already seeing that. I am sure you have seen the millions of Americans in the streets protesting about which you have thus far done.

2798,topic-id,839,"Mr.Speaker, as we all learned on Sunday, Adolphus Busch came to America from Germany to make the king of beers. He didn't have a visa. He had a boat ticket and, of course, our country welcomed him. Well, not exactly.  In the Super Bowl ad that aired, Mr.Busch was told: ``You are not welcome here. Go back home.''  But then the young man eventually reaches Louis, meets Mr.Anheuser, and Budweiser--one of the most unmistakably American brands around the world--is born.  All of us assumed that the President was watching the ad because it was, after all, the Super Bowl and it was broadcast by FOX network, his favorite. But I wonder if the message sank in.  Mr.Speaker, to borrow a line from a different advertiser: I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I think the next time it will be a  But then there was the little girl and her mom who walked to America from Latin America in the 84 Lumber ad. They didn't have a visa either because, well, we don't generally allow visas to people from Latin America who are seeking a better way of life here. If they did qualify for a visa, that little girl would be a grown-up adult by the time the visa was processed, given our broken immigration system. We learned that FOX television told the advertiser to edit out a border wall scene in the original version of the ad. I guess even FOX was worried about being attacked by the twitter in chief.  I am not sure what 84 Lumber sells, but I think I am going to go out and buy some. Mr.Speaker, I haven't had a cup of coffee in 30 years. I don't drink the stuff. You can bet, however, I am going to go find my way into a Starbucks sometime soon because they just announced--in the midst of all of this political turmoil--that they will hire an additional 10,000 refugees.  The CEO of Starbucks said in a letter recently: ``There are more than 65 million citizens of the world recognized as refugees by the United Nations, and we are developing plans to hire 10,000 of them over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks does business.''  Apple and Netflix were among the companies to strongly oppose the President's ban of travel from certain Muslim countries and the halt to the refugee program. I know this because I googled it--and Google is another company that has stepped up as a corporate citizen to say that restricting legal immigration by visa holders is bad for their bottom line, bad for a nation built by immigrants, and bad for a nation that is a leader of and dependent on the world economy.

The company issued a statement recently that said: ``Coca-Cola is resolute in its commitment to diversity, fairness and inclusion, and we do not support this travel ban or any policy that is contrary to our core values and beliefs.''  Mr.Speaker, I am not here to advertise products or to tell anybody what to shop for or who to buy from, but it is a pretty important moment in our history when America's largest companies are going out of their way to say that this President's anti-immigration agenda runs contrary to core values of their corporation and core values of the United States of  When the CEO of Uber has to resign from a corporate advisory council because the President's policies are so toxic, you know there is some bad policy there.

2816,topic-id,445,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize Stacey Escalante of Las Stacey is a Nevada mother who battled cancer and won. Ever since she defeated cancer, Stacey has taken herself to new heights and translated her strength into action. Her story makes us all proud to call Nevada home.  Stacey Escalante was diagnosed with stage 3 skin cancer over 10 years ago when she was still a news reporter for KVBC, now KSNV-Up until this point, she was a model for health, but as we all know, cancer is a disease of its own. After several medical procedures, constant trips to the doctor, Stacey had to endure years of screenings and follow-up medical procedures before the cancer finally went into remission. During this time, she was forced to take a leave of absence from her job in order to recover. Even worse, she had to spend an extended period of time away from her family and friends.  During this recovery, Stacey wanted to come back home. She knew she would recover if she got to be at home surrounded by her family and coworkers who cared deeply about her. Fortunately, Stacey was able to return home and be with her family and friends; there she continued to fight cancer tooth and nail.  After she recovered, Stacey didn't just go back to work and pick up where she left off. Instead, Stacey became a cancer survivor, willing to stand up for cancer patients and those unware of the dangers that tanning beds can cause to the human body. Stacey also remains incredibly active, a hard-working single mom who is still dedicated to living a healthy lifestyle. Despite time away from her career, Stacey worked through the setbacks and is now a publicist at Orca Communications and continues to have an exciting career in public relations.  Stacey's battle with cancer and getting to where she is today is a testament to her determination. She has a passionate story to tell, and I believe that she will continue to inspire others to do the same. She epitomizes what it means to fight back and go even further by spreading the word about the dangers posed by tanning beds and advocate for other women's health issues. I am truly inspired by her story.  I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Stacey Escalante for her perseverance and willingness to share her story and get involved to make the great State of Nevada an even stronger, healthier I wish her continued efforts the absolute best.

2920,topic-id,1538,"Mr.Speaker, last week was an historic week in many respects.  My Republican colleagues have indicated, for 6 years, they wanted to repeal the Affordable Care They introduced a bill which really did not accomplish that objective, but it did undermine, very severely, the protections and the opportunities that the Affordable Care Act provided our citizens. That bill did not come to a vote. Had it come to a vote, it would have lost very substantially.  Mr.Speaker, the proclamations last week by Republican leaders are that the Affordable Care Act will now remain in place. As Paul Ryan, our Speaker, said on Friday: ``ObamaCare is the law of the land.''                              {time}  1015  The Affordable Care Act is, indeed, the law of the land. Mr.Speaker, I rise, however, in a deep concern that the Trump administration and its allies in Congress will take steps to undermine the law and weaken it, to the detriment of millions who will see their health care put at risk. In other words, in my view, they may well try to do indirectly what they could not do directly.  Let it be absolutely clear: Republicans control the White House, the Senate, and the House of As a result, they are the governing party and will be responsible for anything that happens to our healthcare system on their watch.  Even without the passage of a repeal bill, the Trump administration's actions could fundamentally undermine the law and the stability of our healthcare system.  First and foremost, the Trump administration must commit to continuing payments for cost-sharing subsidies. We met with insurance companies yesterday to see whether or not the environment that was being created by the administration was undermining confidence so that it would undermine the ability to price the product that Americans need: healthcare insurance.  Cost-sharing payments, paid for and in the bill, are being put at risk by a suit that the Republicans in the House of Representatives have filed. They ought to withdraw that suit to give confidence to the system. We all know that confidence in markets is critically important. This is essential to preserving the affordability and accessibility of health care for millions of Americans and to ensuring stability in health insurance markets.  The uncertainty around cost-sharing subsidies that has been perpetrated by the administration's silence on this issue, must come to an end. The administration has said the system will implode. It will only implode if they are forced to do so by the administration through executive action. Insurers are preparing to file rates as soon as next month in some Without a clear and public commitment from the administration, we could very well see premiums spike and insurers flee.  Americans have made their opinion pretty clear. They said: Do not do that. Do not undermine the system.  Second, already, President Trump has undermined that requirement through lax enforcement that the individual responsibility requirement--a Republican suggestion, a Heritage Foundation suggestion, a Romney-adopted policy in the State of Massachusetts--a premise of personal responsibility that is being undermined right now by the Trump administration. The individual responsibility requirement is vital to ensuring that those with preexisting conditions can be guaranteed coverage.  To my friends across the aisle who talk often about defending our Constitution, I would remind them that the President has sworn an oath to faithfully execute the laws of this Nation; not picking and choosing which ones he likes.  Third, the administration can--and I would suggest it should--encourage States that have not yet accepted expanded Medicaid to do so. It works. According to a 2016 report by the Department of Health and Human Services, in the expanded-Medicaid States, premiums were 7 percent lower on average.  Mr.Speaker, just yesterday, the Republican-controlled Kansas State legislature--Republican Governor, Republican House, Republican Senate--sent a bill to the Governor that would expand the State's Medicaid program. Presumably, they made a judgment that was in the best interest of their State and the best interest of their people.  The Republican sponsor of the bill, State Senator Vicki Schmidt said: ``I don't believe we can wait for D.They had an opportunity, and they didn't take it.''  So her response was, and the legislature's response has been: adopt Medicaid expansion.  We have heard a lot from Governors of both parties from States with expanded Medicaid, almost universally extolling the benefits that they provided, and urging Congress not to roll it back.  The Trump administration must recognize the importance of Medicaid expansion and support ongoing efforts in States like Kansas, Virginia, and Maine to do what is right for their people and their  Fourth, the Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Price, has a responsibility, a duty, an obligation to focus at least as much on outreach and enrollment, as did his predecessor, Secretary Burwell, to let people know what options they have, what opportunities they have, what protections they have, what securities they can achieve.  Earlier this year, the Trump administration, instead, intentionally sabotaged enrollment efforts in the final week, pulling media ads to let people know what they could sign up for, and ending other outreach programs.  This move resulted in half a million fewer people obtaining affordable coverage through the marketplaces--the first decline in the history of the law. Those people will be hurt because some of them are going to get sick. Some of them may have a catastrophic accident, and they will need insurance, and they will not have it because they did not get the information that they needed.  Now that the Affordable Care Act will continue to be the ``law of the land,'' to use words first spoken by former Speaker Boehner in 2012, the issue in 2012 was the Affordable Care Act--President Obama's probably crowning achievement. Republicans called it ObamaCare, derisively. We call it the Affordable Care Act, supported by President  After the 2012 election, Speaker Boehner said, well, we resolved that issue. The American people have voted to confirm a President whose principal law that was. But the Republicans kept trying to undermine it. They kept trying to say they wanted to repeal it. And now they have all of the power. They haven't done that.  Don't break it. If you couldn't do directly something, don't do it indirectly. Don't undermine the security of the American people indirectly; not through law.  So when open enrollment comes later this year, Mr.Speaker, it would be a dereliction of duty--let me repeat that: it would be a dereliction of duty--not to inform Americans to know how they can benefit under the law, what options they have for finding coverage at more affordable rates or through expanded Let there not be a dereliction of duty.  The larger point here, Mr.Speaker, is, as I have said, that Republicans cannot now simply throw up their hands and say: We failed to offer a viable alternative, and we will now, by action and inaction, by negligence and malfeasance, conspire to undermine the options that are available to the American people.  More than two-thirds of Americans have said that is not a responsible policy. The Affordable Care Act has brought protections and benefits to millions. Twenty million more people are insured in But now my Republican friends, who have no workable alternative, are in power; and it is[[Page H2522]]now their duty to ensure that they faithfully execute existing laws to benefit the American people. If they fail to do so, or intentionally sabotage the current healthcare system, they will surely be held accountable by the American people.  Democrats don't want to see that happen. We reject the premise of some kind of death spiral. By the way, the Congressional Budget Office--an independent bipartisan group, but its director appointed by Republicans--said it was not only not on a death spiral, but it was stable.  The yardstick by which we all ought to be judged is not whether the law succeeds just enough, but whether we can work together--work together, work together--to make the law work as best it can, to benefit as many Americans as it can.  President Trump, speaking at that rostrum, looked directly into the TV camera of 100 million-plus Americans and said: I want every American to have health insurance that will be cheaper and higher quality than we have today.  Mr.President, if you send such a bill to this House, I will vote for it. I haven't seen a bill like that, but if I see it, and if you send it down here, and that is your commitment, I will vote for it.  Mr.Speaker, I hope my friends across the aisle will take a lesson from last week that, to paraphrase the President, health insurance is indeed complicated, and that it will truly take both parties working together towards consensus to meet the healthcare challenges we face.  Our constituents and our country is counting on us not to fight, not to throw bricks at one another, but to act in their best interest. And what I urge the Trump administration to do, Mr.Speaker: Do no harm until you have a bill that accomplishes what you said to the American people you want to accomplish. Mr.President, do no harm. Ensure that the American people continue to have access to affordable, quality health care.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgH2521.txt,566,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,29.0,February

2813,topic-id,4255,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague from Maryland for your tremendous work already in these 7 weeks and schooling us all on the Constitution and making sure that we continue to recognize the tremendous responsibility that we have here in this body to protect that Constitution and everything that it stands for.  Last night's State of the Union Address deserves a response for lots of reasons and, unfortunately, none of them are good.  Last night, we heard from this President a toned-down version of his campaign speeches. The speech was well delivered. He stuck to his script. It may be the first major address that he has conducted where he did stick to the script. He had a lot of diligence in that. And he even started with some very necessary recognition of the anti-Semitic acts that have been taking place across the country, and he denounced those acts.  He denounced the killing of an Indian American in I, too, am Indian American, and I know that that killing hit home hard for many of us across the country who wonder if we, too, are going to be the targets of hate. The President did say that he denounces hate, that there is no place in this Nation for hate, and that, in fact, we need to do a lot of work to make sure that we preserve this place, this country as a country that is safe for everybody.  Unfortunately, it took a while to get there, and his words belie the rhetoric that he has put out there in the past. In fact, I think that this President has not spoken out against the kind of hate and, in fact, has sometimes said things that encourage his followers to act in ways that simply do not meet the rhetoric that he had yesterday.  The first place that that was so obvious to me was in the space of immigration. Now, I have been an advocate on immigration for many, many years. I have worked across the aisle with friends and colleagues in the U.Senate, in the U.House of At that time, I was an advocate. But together, we understood the tremendous contributions of immigrants to this country, and we understood that unless you were Native American, that, willing or unwilling, everybody in this country has been an immigrant or a descendant of immigrants.  And so to come into the Chamber and yet again hear the fear-mongering and the characterization of immigrants, undocumented immigrants, as this enormous swath of people who simply all they do is commit crimes is simply a travesty and a disservice to the millions of people across this country who work every day to pick our vegetables, clean our homes, serve us in so many different capacities, as well as to all of those who have come through the legal immigration system, but with many challenges.  You know, it took me 18 years to get my citizenship. I went through visa after visa after visa. I understand the barriers. But for this President to continue to focus on a stereotype of undocumented immigrants as criminals is simply disingenuous, unfair, and, frankly, un- DREAMers and refugees and immigrants and others who have helped build this country were the guests of many of us Democrats in the We each brought incredible men and women to join us for the State of the Union; people who we feel demonstrate the resilience and the strength and the courage of immigrants across this country.  I was proud to be joined by an amazing woman, a good friend named Aneelah Afzali, who is the executive director of the American Muslim Empowerment Network, an initiative of the Muslim Association of Puget Aneelah is a Harvard-trained lawyer. She is an incredible snowboarder. She is a 12th Man She loves the Seahawks, and she is a strong advocate for a community that has been, frankly, terrorized since the passing of the President's Muslim ban. Now, of course, courts have said that that ban is unconstitutional.  The President seems to be accepting that it is unconstitutional, but we also know that he has reshaped that ban to continue to target people simply for the country from which they come, simply for the region that they come from.  The reason we invited all of those guests to be here in the Chamber with us is because we wanted to send a message to this President and to our country that we are strong as a country because of our diversity, that we are better for the perspectives and the values that people bring, and regardless of what religion you are, we all, as the President said yesterday, do bleed the same blood, and we all believe in the promise of the United States of  We wanted the President to understand and our colleagues in this body to understand, when we pass laws, when we approve of executive orders, to target people simply based on religion or place of origin, that we are doing a tremendous disservice to this country and we might be violating constitutional laws in some of these cases, but that America deserves better in terms of how we position what immigrants have done for this country.  Now, the President last night kept talking about these heinous crimes that immigrants commit. In fact, he had some people here in the Chamber, his guests, who were tragically affected by the murder of individuals in their families who were killed because of a single, undocumented immigrant. A heinous crime committed by an undocumented immigrant is simply not representative of the millions of law-abiding immigrants across our country.  This is a continuation of what the President did during the campaign: fear-mongering and otherizing people. The reality is that, just like Dylann Roof's horrific murders in South Carolina cannot be representative of all Caucasian Americans, there is no way that one undocumented immigrant or even a couple of undocumented immigrants can be representative of 11 million who have served this country, helped build our economy, helped drive our industries, and who contribute so much to our country every single day.  The President also seemed to paint this picture of immigrants as driving up crime, that when you have undocumented immigrants, then you have higher crime. In fact, the statistics show that immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than native-born Americans and that our sanctuary cities, the cities around the country that have policies that are friendly to immigrant communities, including undocumented immigrants, that those actually are safer as cities than comparable cities that are not sanctuary cities.  That was a report that came out, and it is an important one for people to understand. Why? Because, when you have trust and when you understand that the fix that we need is for a system that is broken, an immigration system that has been broken for a very long time, the way to address these issues is not to criminalize and otherize and fearmonger about people who are trying to help our country, but to actually get to work on a real fix for our immigration system.  I was initially pleased that the President talked about fixing a broken immigration system, but then he said we are going to look at a merit-based system. Now, I would not have been able to come to this country under a merit-based system because I came here by myself when I was 16 years old. My parents sent me over here. They had very little money in their bank account. They used their $5,000 to send me by myself because they felt like this was the place I was going to get the best education.[[Page H1459]]  And if you look at a merit-based system, what you do is you exclude the millions of people who have actually come to the United States seeking refuge from famine, from devastation, from drought, from persecution. You exclude all of those people. You also exclude all of the families who are trying to reunite with their loved ones when they come here and they bring their spouse or they bring their parent or their child. That whole system of family-based immigration that the United States has built so much of our country around, that, too, would be excluded.  Unfortunately, this President is still not at a place where he has said and embraced the idea of comprehensive immigration reform, an immigration reform that has been, until this point, traditionally bipartisan--68 bipartisan votes in the U.Senate in 2013 for a comprehensive immigration bill that would have brought $1.5 trillion into our economy over the next 10 years by legalizing and providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants but, perhaps equally importantly, would have provided the dignity and respect to undocumented immigrants in a very different way than what the President spoke about last night.  My colleague Mr.Raskin talked a little bit about health care and the Affordable Care Act, and during his speech, the President, unfortunately, again renewed the theme that the Affordable Care Act has been a disaster. He talked about his ideas for health care, and he said some things that maybe all of us could agree with.  He said that we deserve health care that lowers costs for people. Yes, I would like that. He said that we deserve health care that increases quality of care--absolutely.  But unfortunately, neither the President nor Republicans in this Chamber have offered us a replacement plan. So to repeal the Affordable Care Act which has provided so much benefit to people--more than 20 million Americans gained health care through the Affordable Care But if Republicans succeed in repealing it, 30 million people will lose it.  The 150 million Americans with preexisting conditions will see their protections stripped away, leaving them vulnerable to a lack of coverage. You cannot protect the most expensive and the most valuable provisions of the Affordable Care Act if you do not continue to keep the pool large enough, full of healthy people, so that those provisions actually become affordable. And you need to ensure that the pool is large enough through the individual mandate.  So we have not seen a plan that improves health care, and it is important that we recognize we have improvements to make. There are too many Americans across the country that still, today, don't have access to health care in the way that we would like them to. But the solution for that is a Medicare-for-all plan, a public plan that allows us to take profits out of the business of health care. It should not be a business. It should be about making people better. It should be about making people well and not about making corporations rich. That, I think, is a very important piece.  The President said that he would support a plan that would actually provide us with the ability to negotiate for prescription drugs for That would bring down the cost for those prescription drugs. I am all in for that plan, and that is why I hope the President supports the bill that was introduced.  Senator Cantwell introduced a bill yesterday that would allow the United States to import more affordable drugs from Canada while also allowing Medicaid to negotiate drug prices directly, and that would lower the costs for our seniors and for others who rely on those lifelong medications.  I am so proud to have sponsored that same bill in the That is the solution that we need to move to is lowering the costs of prescription drugs, lowering the cost of health care, increasing the quality of the care that we provide.  Let's talk about the environment for a minute because the President mentioned yesterday that he cares about clean water and clean air, but at the same time, the President has proposed in reports that have been published in the news that he intends to cut the Environmental Protection Agency by 25 percent, the budget of the Environmental Protection  Scott Pruitt, our new Secretary of the EPA, has talked about putting in place plans to repeal progress on climate change. The President also signed a rule to essentially roll back progress on the Clean Water Act, and we are talking about cutting agencies and staff of the EPA across the country.  The reality is that we need to be thinking about how we preserve our planet for the next generation. I have got a 20-year-old son and he says to me: Mom, this is one of the most important things you can do is preserve the planet for me and for my kids. That is what we need to do is look at the science of climate change, look at the ways in which we can strengthen our ability to protect the environment, instead of what this President has said he will do, which is to repeal so many of the rules that the Obama administration put in place to make sure that we check the notion that corporations should be able to mine our land, literally and figuratively, for profit while destroying it for the future.  Budget and taxes, this was a really interesting one. One of the most common refrains of President Trump's campaign was that he was going to drain the swamp, and last night he talked about that. He said he promised he would do it, and he is now draining the swamp. He has put a ban on lobbyists.  Unfortunately, what he didn't talk about is that, even with the ban on lobbyists, it is as if he is draining that swamp and then pumping it into another spot, which happens to be his Cabinet, that is filled with people who represent Goldman Sachs ties, the CEO of ExxonMobil, plenty of other elites who--we don't begrudge people to make some money, but these are people who have made profit off of a vast majority of Americans losing their income.                              {time}  2015  These are people, frankly, who lobbied the United States Government so that those corporations could do better and so that they, as CEOs, could do better while caring not at all for the broad interests of people across this country.  Based on these picks, it is clear that the President's priority is for the wealthiest in our country and not, as he promised over and over again, for the working people in our country.  Now, I would love to be proven wrong on this. But unfortunately, all of the tax plans, all of the proposals that we have seen so far, or, at least, the blueprints that we have seen so far would not do as he said last night. Last night, he said he wants to provide a huge tax cut or tax relief for middle class families. We would love to see that. Unfortunately, the plan looks, in fact, like it is going to provide relief to the top tier of income earners in this country and not to the middle class.  He has talked about a $54 billion cut in domestic spending, and I wanted to have people understand exactly what $54 billion amounts to because most of us don't really know. We can't really imagine that because we don't have $54 billion lying around.  If we added up the entire budget for the Environmental Protection Agency, the entire budget of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the entire budget for the National Park Service--and I should give you these numbers because they are interesting: $8 billion for the EPA, $5.85 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, $3.1 billion for the National Park Service, $2.9 billion for the Department of Energy efficiency and renewable energy program, $1.6 billion for the Fish and Wildlife Service, and $1.2 billion for the U.Geological Service--you still don't get to that $54 billion. There are a whole bunch of others that are in that list. You still don't get to $54 billion, even if you remove all of those agencies.  So the work that we have to do is really to have people understand that if we are going to cut nondefense discretionary spending by the amount that he is talking about increasing our defense budget by, our military spending by, then you are going to have to cut into the very programs that help middle class families to continue their lives and have dignity, respect, pull themselves up and know that they are[[Page H1460]]going to have food on the table and a roof over their head and be able to send their kids to college and be able to retire in security. All of these programs help people to do that, to have opportunity in this country, which is why America is such a great country because we provide that kind of opportunity. But if we decimate our nondefense discretionary spending by cutting it by $54 billion, then we are taking away that opportunity from millions and millions of families. This is not how we build up our communities.  Our budget is a demonstration of our values as a country. We have to understand that this is a time of tremendous insecurity for Americans across our country. Wealth inequality is at the highest level that it has been in a very long time, and people do not see the opportunity for themselves.  They elected this President, in part, because of the promises that he made; and so if he is going to follow through, that would mean protecting those social safety net programs. It would mean investing in the environment for the future. It would mean expanding Social Security and It would mean saying that the answer to health care is actually a Medicare-for-all program, a way to make sure that every American does not have to be one healthcare crisis away from bankruptcy.  The President also talked about education last night, and he said it is the civil rights issue of our time. I couldn't agree with him more, but I do not understand how you go from that place to then saying that the answer to that is school choice.  Ninety percent of the kids in this country go through the public education system. That is what my son went through. We need to make sure that we preserve the ability for people in this country to send their kids to good public schools.  We should be investing in our public schools, investing in our teachers, making sure that we provide the tools and the resources to teachers so that in our public schools--the place where our kids are going to spend the most amount of their days--that they are getting the kind of education that allows them to earn a future, contribute back to the country, be trained for all the jobs that we need to fill right here in the United States of  We should be investing in preapprenticeship programs. We should be investing in debt-free college for all of our young people because it is ridiculous that a young person has to choose between being $45,000 in debt or not going to college, not seeking a higher education.  Higher education is what gave me everything that I have today. It was my parents' belief in me and my future and the $5,000 that they had in the bank that they used to send me here so that I could get a college degree. I was 16 years old, and now I have the tremendous honor of standing in this Chamber, the U.House of Representatives, in the greatest country in the world, going from being an immigrant to being a United States  I want every American--no matter what color you are, no matter whether you are rural or urban, no matter whether you have money or don't have money--I want you to have a great public education that you can go to. That is choice. That is real choice.  Choice is not privatizing our public education system, and then saying, hey, 10 percent of the people get to go to that, and then everybody else is going to go to schools that don't give them that opportunity.  Real choice is about having an investment in our public education system as the doorway, the gateway to a future of opportunity.  Mr.Speaker, the most important thing I think is that last night's address was a softer tone. It was a disciplined speech, and there were some good statements.  Unfortunately, the rhetoric of last night doesn't match the actions. It doesn't match the executive actions of the last 7 weeks that have thrown this country into chaos on immigration. It doesn't match the fact that we still don't have a replacement plan that will make things better for health care, not increase payments, not give giveaways to insurance companies, not decrease subsidies so that health care can be affordable.  His speech last night did not reflect specifics around how he is going to accomplish some of the good things that he said he was going to do. And it continued to put fear into people's hearts and minds about who our neighbors are, about the immigrants across this country who have done so much to build and contribute.  He is the President of the United He has a remarkable microphone. He talked about unity last night. But unity means being a President for everybody, and it means not creating stories that somehow draw pictures of an immigrant community that is full of crime, inner cities that are full of crime. That is not the inner cities that I know. If he is talking about inner cities in Chicago and other places, we should be talking about how to fix crime, but not calling everybody who lives there criminals.  We have got to understand that our country deserves a body in this Chamber, in this United States Congress that really preserves the opportunity, the dreams, and the ability for everybody in our country to know that they have got a fair shot. That is what America has been for so long for so many people across the world.  When he talks about improving the vetting of refugees to this country, let me tell you, I know a lot about this issue. There are 20 steps you have to go through if you want to be vetted into this country as a refugee. All of our multiple intelligence agencies, multiple agencies in other countries, the United Nations and others are involved in that vetting process. Our own intelligence agencies vet people.  Out of the seven countries that he put on the list for the Muslim ban, the 9/11 hijackers didn't come from any of those countries. They came from another country that is not on that list: Saudi  So if we are really going to think about how we improve our security in this country, we should be thinking about economic security that gives people the opportunity that they need in this country, the ability to fill our jobs with well-trained folks from this country, and then we continue to allow immigrants to come in as we need them. But don't allow them to come in because we are not training enough people and we are not investing in people right here in this country and then criticize those immigrants for taking these jobs.  Let's raise our wages. Let's invest in apprenticeships. That is good in rural areas, and that is good in urban areas. Let's invest in our community and technical colleges. Let's provide opportunity for people who are ready to take that opportunity.  Let's be compassionate. It is Ash Wednesday today. I am not an observing Catholic, but I think today--because I went to a Jesuit university--and I think today of what we were taught in that university about compassion.  I think it is time for us to recognize that true greatness for our country doesn't come from fear mongering. It doesn't come from otherizing. You can tap into that. You can mobilize people around that. You can enrage people around that.  Ultimately, true greatness and the greatness of this country has always come from our ability to have a vision of opportunity for everybody and to actually work to perfect this Union, to actually work to make democracy real, to actually work to engage people in a vision that says we are all better off when we are all better off. That means that my boat rising lifts your boat rising. It is not about fighting over the spoils that are too small for us anyway. It is not about whose pie we are eating.  It is about having more pie for everybody and ultimately opportunity, education, jobs, higher wages, health care, paid family leave, the ability for people to live with dignity and respect, racial justice, all of the fights that this country has been having for a very long time. Some we have won, and some we have won a little bit on, and some we have won a lot on. We still have a ways to go.  What I hope we do, as we think about the state of the Union of this country, is understand that our state of the Union is strong when our communities are strong. Our state of the Union is strong when we invest in our future.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.[[Page H1461]]  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Smucker).

Montenegro has shown that it is committed to NATO and to making the internal reforms required to remain a member in good standing. Because of that commitment, Montenegro's membership in NATO will enhance stability in  Finally, Russia's alleged support of an attempted coup in Montenegro must not be rewarded by NATO turning its back on a country that exhibits such courage in resisting Russia's persistent aggression.

While it currently falls short of the goals stated in the 2014 NATO Wales Summit to spend 2 percent of its GDP on defense, Montenegro has committed to meeting this target by 2024.  Expanding NATO to include nations that desire to join the alliance and commit to meeting membership requirements contributes to a strong and stable It wasn't all that long ago that the Balkans region was unstable and war-torn, but because Slovenia, Croatia, and Albania have joined NATO, the Balkans is a far more stable region.

Though Prince had no formal role with the Trump campaign or      transition team, he presented himself as an unofficial envoy      for Trump to high-ranking Emiratis involved in setting up his      meeting with the Putin confidant, according to the officials,      who did not identify the       Prince was an avid supporter of Trump who gave $250,000      last year to support the GOP nominee's campaign, records      show. He has ties to people in Trump's circle, including      Stephen Bannon, now serving as the president's chief      strategist and senior counselor. Prince's sister Betsy DeVos      serves as education secretary in the Trump administration.      And Prince was seen in the Trump transition offices in New      York in       U.officials said the FBI has been scrutinizing the      Seychelles meeting as part of a broader probe of Russian      interference in the 2016 U.election and alleged contacts      between associates of Putin and The FBI declined to      comment.       The Seychelles encounter, which one official said spanned      two days, adds to an expanding web of connections between      Russia and Americans with ties to Trump--contacts that the      White House has been reluctant to acknowledge or explain      until they have been exposed by news organizations.       ``We are not aware of any meetings and Erik Prince had no      role in the transition,'' said Sean Spicer, the White House      press secretary.       ``Erik had no role on the transition team. This is a      complete fabrication,'' said a spokesman for Prince in a      statement. ``The meeting had nothing to do with President      Why is the so-called underresourced intelligence      community messing around with surveillance of American      citizens when they should be hunting terrorists?''       Prince is best known as the founder of Blackwater, a      security firm that became a symbol of U.abuses in Iraq      after a series of incidents including one in 2007 in which      the company's guards were accused--and later criminally      convicted--of killing civilians in a crowded Iraqi square.      Prince sold the firm, which was subsequently rebranded, but      has continued building a private paramilitary empire with      contracts across the Middle East and       Prince would probably have been seen as too controversial      to serve in any official capacity in the Trump transition or      administration. But his ties to Trump advisers, experience      with clandestine work and relationship with the royal leaders      of the Emirates--where he moved in 2010 amid mounting legal      problems for his American business--would have positioned him      as an ideal go-between.       The Seychelles meeting came after private discussions in      New York involving high-ranking representatives of Trump,      Moscow and the       The White House has acknowledged that Michael Flynn,      Trump's original national security adviser, and Trump adviser      and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with the Russian ambassador      to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, in late November or      early December in New       Flynn and Kushner were joined by Bannon for a separate      meeting with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed      bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who made an undisclosed visit to New      York later in December, according to the U.S., European and      Arab officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to      discuss sensitive matters.       In an unusual breach of protocol, the UAE did not notify      the Obama administration in advance of the visit, though      officials found out because Zayed's name appeared on a flight      manifest.       Officials said Zayed and his brother, the UAE's national      security adviser, coordinated the Seychelles meeting with      Russian government officials with the goal of establishing an      unofficial back channel between Trump and       Officials said Zayed wanted to be helpful to both leaders      who had talked about working more closely together, a policy      objective long advocated by the crown prince. The UAE, which      sees Iran as one of its main enemies, also shared the Trump      team's interest in finding ways to drive a wedge between      Moscow and       Zayed met twice with Putin in 2016, according to Western      officials, and urged the Russian leader to work more closely      with the Emirates and Saudi Arabia--an effort to isolate            At the time of the Seychelles meeting and for weeks      afterward, the UAE believed that Prince had the blessing of      the new administration to act as its unofficial      representative. The Russian participant was a person whom      Zayed knew was close to Putin from his interactions with both      men, the officials said.       When the Seychelles meeting took place, official contacts      between members of the incoming Trump administration and the      Russian government were under intense scrutiny, both from      federal investigators and the press.       Less than a week before the Seychelles meeting, U.     intelligence agencies released a report accusing Russia of      intervening clandestinely during the 2016 election to help      Trump win the White       The FBI was already investigating communications between      Flynn and The Washington Post's David Ignatius first      disclosed those communications on 12, around the time of      the Seychelles meeting. Flynn was subsequently fired by Trump      for misleading Vice President Pence and others about his      discussions with       Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE's ambassador in Washington,      declined to comment.       Government officials in the Seychelles said they were not      aware of any meetings between Trump and Putin associates in      the country around 11. But they said luxury resorts on      the island are ideal for clandestine gatherings like the one      described by the U.S., European and Arab officials.       ``I wouldn't be surprised at all,'' said Barry Faure, the      Seychelles secretary of state for foreign affairs. ``The      Seychelles is the kind of place where you can have a good      time away from the eyes of the media. That's even[[Page H2620]]     printed in our tourism marketing. But I guess this time you      smelled something.''       Trump has dismissed the investigations of Russia's role in      the election as ``fake news'' and a ``witch hunt.''       The level of discretion surrounding the Seychelles meeting      seems extraordinary given the frequency with which senior      Trump advisers, including Flynn and Kushner, had interacted      with Russian officials in the United States, including at the      high-profile Trump Tower in New       Steven Simon, a National Security Council senior director      for the Middle East and North Africa in the Obama White      House, said: ``The idea of using business cutouts, or      individuals perceived to be close political leaders, as a      tool of diplomacy is as old as the hills. These unofficial      channels are desirable precisely because they are deniable;      ideas can be tested without the risk of failure.''       Current and former U.officials said that while Prince      refrained from playing a direct role in the Trump transition,      his name surfaced so frequently in internal discussions that      he seemed to function as an outside adviser whose opinoins      were valued on a range of issues, including plans for      overhauling the U.intelligence community.       He appears to have particularly close ties to Bannon,      appearing multiple times as a guest on Bannon's satellite      radio program over the past year as well as in articles on      the Breitbart Web site that Bannon ran before joining the      Trump campaign.       In a July interview with Bannon, Prince said those seeking      forceful U.leadership should ``wait till January and hope      Mr.Trump is elected.'' And he lashed out at President Barack      Obama, saying that because of his policies ``the terrorists,      the fascists, are winning.''       Days before the November election, Prince appeared on      Bannon's program again, saying that he had ``well-placed      sources'' in the New York City Police Department telling him      they were preparing to make arrests in the investigation of      former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) over allegations      he exchanged sexually explicit texts with a minor. Flynn      tweeted a link to the Breitbart report on the claim. No      arrests occurred.       Prince went on to make a series of unfounded assertions      that damaging material recovered from Weiner's computers      would implicate Hillary Clinton and her close adviser, Huma      Abedin, who was married to He also called Abedin an      ``agent of influence very sympathetic to the Muslim      Brotherhood.''       Prince and his family were major GOP donors in 2016. After      the Republican convention, he contributed $250,000 to Trump's      campaign, the national party and a pro-Trump super PAC led by      GOP mega-donor Rebekah The Center for Responsive      Politics reported that the family gave more than $2.7 million      to GOP candidates and super PACs, including about $2.7      million from his sister, DeVos, and her husband.       Prince's father, Edgar Prince, built his fortune through an      auto-parts company. Betsy married Richard DeVos Jr., heir to      the Amway fortune.       Erik Prince has had lucrative contracts with the UAE      government, which at one point paid his firm a reported $529      million to help bring in foreign fighters to help assemble an      internal paramilitary force capable of carrying out secret      operations and protecting Emirati installations from      terrorist attacks.       The Trump administration and the UAE appear to share a      similar preoccupation with Current and former officials      said that Trump advisers were focused throughout the      transition period on exploring ways to get Moscow to break      ranks with       ``Separating Russia from Iran was a common theme,'' said a      former intelligence official in the Obama administration who      met with Trump transition officials. ``It didn't seem very      well thought out. It seemed a little premature. They clearly      had a very specific policy position, which I found odd given      that they hadn't even taken the reins and explored with      experts in the U.government the pros and cons of that      approach.''       Michael McFaul, former U.ambassador to Russia, said he      also had discussions with people close to the Trump      administration about the prospects of drawing Russia away      from ``When I would hear this, I would think, `Yeah      that's great for you guys, but why would Putin ever do that?'      '' McFaul said. ``There is no interest in Russia ever doing      that. They have a long relationship with They're allied      with Iran in fighting in They sell weapons to      Iran is an important strategic partner for Russia in the      Middle East.''       Following the New York meeting between the Emiratis and      Trump aides, Zayed was approached by Prince, who said he was      authorized to act as an unofficial surrogate for the      president-elect, according to the officials. He wanted Zayed      to set up a meeting with a Putin associate. Zayed agreed and      proposed the Seychelles as the meeting place because of the      privacy it would afford both sides. ``He wanted to be      helpful,'' one official said of       Wealthy Russians and Emirati royalty have a particularly      large footprint on the islands.

Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, president of the      UAE, built a hilltop palace for himself with views across the      chain of islands.       The Emiratis have given hundreds of millions of dollars to      the Seychelles in recent years for causes including public      health and affordable housing. But when the Emirati royal      family visits, they are rarely seen.       ``The jeep comes to their private jet on the tarmac and      they disappear,'' said one Seychellois official who spoke on      the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be seen      as criticizing the       Zayed, the crown prince, owns a share of the Seychelles      Four Seasons, a collection of private villas scattered on a      lush hillside on the main island's southern shore,      overlooking the Indian Ocean, according to officials in the      The hotel is tucked away on a private beach, far      from the nearest public road.       Current and former U.officials who have worked closely      with Zayed, who is often referred to as MBZ, say it would be      out of character for him to arrange the 11 meeting      without getting a green light in advance from top aides to      Trump and Putin, if not the leaders themselves. ``MBZ is very      cautious,'' said an American businessman who knows      ``There had to be a nod.''       The Seychelles meeting was deemed productive by the UAE and      Russia but the idea of arranging additional meetings between      Prince and Putin's associates was dropped, officials said.      Even unofficial contacts between Trump and Putin associates      had become too politically risky, officials said.

2984,topic-id,606,"Mr.President, today Mr.Ross joins the growing list of billionaires appointed by the Trump administration. It is not their wealth that concerns me, but their past conflicts with the agencies they are promoted to lead and support, providing guidance for policy and for administration of the laws. It is for this reason I cannot support Mr.Ross today.  Every American has a stake in the strength of our economy. We rely on the Department of Commerce to facilitate trade, investment, and innovation in a direction that ensures long-term benefits for Today while the wealthiest among us continue to profit, middle class families are working long hours to pay their bills and put food on their tables. The cost of living is outstripping their family budgets, and we must get ahead of this curve.  Mr.Ross has a background of buying fledging companies, and while he might turn around the profit margins of those companies, it is at the cost of American jobs. He has been called fair and practical, but has also committed his career in business by expanding in low-cost countries like Mexico and The economic policies of this country cannot be built on representing the interests of rich investors, but must also be creative in spurring job growth in American communities where industry has disappeared. We can shape our global trade policy in ways that benefit the United States, without having to do so under the assumption that the United States needs to operate in isolation in order to realize economic success. We can build industry at home, while partnering abroad in trade for our products. But it will take the commitment of the next Secretary to focus on our human capital as innovators and not as mere cost considerations.  Although America's role in the global market is expanding, our closest trade partner remains across our northern border. Each year, we export hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of goods and services to Canada, making it our largest export market in the world. Vermont is an active contributor to this flow of commerce. Supporting initiatives that strengthen this partnership will benefit local businesses in Vermont and across the Mr.Ross wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, and while we can debate the merits of NAFTA, the talk of renegotiating this agreement without the partnership of Mexico and Canada has many Vermont businesses concerned about the implications for their future and for the Vermont jobs that depend on our export markets.  We live in a global economy, and I work with Vermont businesses every day who rely on importing goods and materials in order to successfully create a final products that are a combination of U.and foreign made. This is the reality for many businesses today. I do not criticize the decisions a businessowner makes for the quality of their product. But every large corporation makes a choice between cheaper overseas labor and materials or investing in the workforce here at home for greater gains in the future. That is a choice that Mr.Ross has made on several occasions for the benefit of profits not workers.  I have said it time and again, but America thrives when our middle class is strong. As Secretary, Mr.Ross will be expected to represent the interests of all I hope he takes this commitment seriously and works across party lines to create new industry and opportunity that take root in the very communities that suffer from lack of it. The Secretary of Commerce cannot look at individuals as statistics of profit or loss, but must understand the innovative spirit that brings opportunity where it may otherwise be lost.[[Page S1442]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-02-27-pt1-PgS1441-4.txt,1383,IMPROVE THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT,2017.0,27.0,February

2928,topic-id,636,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise in support of National Catholic Schools Week and to recognize the outstanding contributions that Catholic schools have made and continue to make to our  As a proud graduate of Symphorosa Grammar School and Ignatius College Prep and as a strong supporter of Catholic education, I have introduced 57, honoring January 29 through February 4 as National Catholic Schools I would like to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Smith) for working with me on this resolution and on other issues. Following his Catholic faith, Mr.Smith is one of our greatest defenders of freedom and human rights around the world.  This year marks the 43rd anniversary of Catholic Schools Since 1974, Catholic Schools Week has celebrated the important role that these institutions play in America and their excellent reputation for providing a strong academic and moral education as well as teaching community responsibility and outreach.                              {time}  1045  This year's theme, ``Catholic Schools: Communities of Faith, Knowledge, and Service,'' highlights the values that are the centerpiece of a Catholic education.  Today, over 2 million elementary and secondary school students are enrolled in over 6,600 Catholic schools. These students typically surpass their peers in math, science, reading, history, and geography in the NAEP test. The same is true for SAT scores. And the graduation rate for Catholic high school students is 99 percent, with 85 percent of graduates enrolling in a 4-year college. As we continually hear disturbing reports about our national test scores, these statistics are truly remarkable and should be commended.  Notably, the success of Catholic schools does not depend on selectivity. These academic achievements are realized by students from all walks of life. Catholic schools accept 9 out of 10 students who apply and are highly effective in providing a quality education to students from every socioeconomic category, especially the disadvantaged and underserved urban communities. Over the past 30 years, the percentage of minority students enrolled in Catholic schools has more than doubled, and today they constitute about one-third of all Catholic school students. In times of economic hardship, Catholic schools can provide an affordable alternative to other forms of private education.  In addition to learning reading, writing, and arithmetic, students also learn responsibility and how to become persons of character and integrity. America's Catholic schools produce graduates with the skills and integrity needed by our businesses, governments, and communities, emphasizing a well-rounded educational experience and instilling the values of giving back to the community and helping others. That is why ``service'' is in this year's Catholic Schools Week theme. My own decision to pursue a career in public service was fostered, in part, by dedicated teachers throughout my formative years at Catholic schools.  I celebrated Catholic Schools Week last week at a number of schools in my district. I visited Barbara Grammar School, which is located in the Bridgeport neighborhood of I met with Principal Nicole Nolazco and the student council, and I spoke to and took questions from an all-school assembly.

Finally, I visited my alma mater, Symphorosa, in the Clearing neighborhood in I met with Principal Kathy Berry and Father Idzi and spoke to students about my experiences at Syms and how my Catholic education made it possible for me to serve in the U.

Scott Pruitt, as attorney general of the State of Oklahoma, has not demonstrated the qualities that are going to be necessary in order to protect the environment of our country.  Today, many of us recognized a day without an immigrants. Businesses across the country closed, students did not attend classes, and workers did not head to their jobs--in protest.

That is Scott Pruitt's favorite day. That is Scott Pruitt's  That is why we are out here tonight. We are out here tonight to begin this warning to the country that there is trouble brewing if Scott Pruitt is, in fact, confirmed as the next head of the Environmental Protection  What is it that we can look forward to?  The oil, the gas, the coal industries opposed many of the Obama administration's commonsense protections for our air, for our water, for our climate.  One by one, Republicans in Congress are working to legislatively overturn many of those protections. They now have twice deployed a very rarely used procedural tool known as the Congressional Review Act to benefit the coal, the oil, the gas industries by rolling back environmental protections. Republicans are planning to use the Congressional Review Act to hand out even more giveaways to the fossil fuel industries in the coming weeks.  You can pick any industry you want--coal, oil, mining, timber, grazing. You go through, and no matter how you spin it on the Republican ``Wheel of Giveaways,'' some industry gets a big giveaway. They are trying to decide right now what is the next one they will bring out here that waters down the protections that the American people need in each and every one of these areas. But don't question for a second if that is what this whole year is going to be about. Just take oil. There will be big tax breaks for oil coming very, very soon--like they need it. The same thing is going to be true in area after area. We have our helpful tool here, the GOP ``Wheel of Giveaways,'' to help viewers at home keep track of which industries the Republicans are making the weekly winners.  Now, by nominating Scott Pruitt to head the EPA, President Trump and Senate Republicans have found their new host for this great Republican show--the ``Wheel of Giveaways''--and that will be Scott Pruitt, attorney general of Oklahoma, because Scott Pruitt has already made a career of handing out prizes to the fossil fuel industry in our country.  As attorney general of Oklahoma, he sued to block the EPA from restricting toxic mercury pollution from powerplants in order to benefit the coal industry--that is right--blocking protections from mercury that could affect the lungs of children in his own State and, ultimately, across the whole country.  Then, as attorney general of Oklahoma, he questioned the EPA's estimate of air pollution from new natural gas wells in By doing that, he took natural gas and oil, and he made sure that would, as well, be something that wasn't subject to the types of regulations that were necessary in order to protect the public health and safety.  Then he moved on, as attorney general of Oklahoma, to push for a rollback of protections of our Nation's waterways to the benefit of corporate polluters. Corporate polluters love to use the waterways of our country as one big sewer. Why do you have to store that dirty water? Why do you have to make sure that it is just not put in some safe place when you can just use rivers? Just dump all of that garbage right in the river. Put all of that pollution right in the river. Who cares what impact it has upon families? Who cares what impact it has upon children?  So, again, this ``Wheel of Giveaways'' is really a way to ensure that the polluting industries don't have to pay to clean up the messes they create, just pass it on to innocent families, because with Scott Pruitt as the new host of the Republican ``Wheel of Giveaways,'' we know who will always win every time, every week, during all 4 years of the Trump administration. It will always be the oil industry, the natural gas industry, the coal industry, the polluters of all stripes that otherwise the EPA would be regulating and protecting the public health and safety of our country.[[Page S1293]]  It is going to ultimately be those American families who are left to lose protections which for generations we have fought to put on the books in order to ensure that we increase life expectancy and reduce exposure to asthma and other diseases that otherwise, because of these polluting companies, are going to be visited upon hundreds of thousands and millions of families within our country.  When we think about this whole issue of the environment, many times we say: Well, the Republicans--the coal industry, they say there is a War on Coal in the United States of America, an absolute war, a war out there to destroy the industry. However, upon closer examination, it turns out that it is the free market that has been working to replace coal with other sources of energy.  A decade ago--here are the numbers--50 percent of all electricity in the United States came from coal; now it is down to 30 percent of all electricity in our country. What has replaced coal? Well, the free market has actually substituted natural gas, which has grown from a little over 20 percent of U.electrical generation a decade ago to 35 percent of all electricity in our country right now. And coal has been replaced by clean energy--by wind, which has grown to 5 to 6 percent of our generation from almost nothing, and solar, which is up to 1 percent of all of our electrical generation. And between wind and solar, there are additions of 1.5 percent every single year between those two sources, to renewable electrical generation capacity in our country. So we can see that every year that goes by--over a 15-year period, for example, that would be 22 percent of all electricity would be wind and solar if we just keep on the current pace.  From the coal industry's perspective, that is terrible. That is a War on Coal, what natural gas is doing, what wind and solar are doing. But the reality is that they are losing it in the marketplace. Adam Smith is spinning in his grave--so quickly, by the way, that he would actually probably qualify as a new source of energy. So the Republican complaint is that the free market is killing coal; it is a war. It is capitalism, actually, and it is working. So the only way they can stop it, the only way they can slow it down, is to get somebody like Scott Pruitt to be the new head of the Environmental Protection This isn't a conspiracy; it is actually a competition, and the competition for those clean energy jobs is global.  Back in the 1990s, I was the author of a law that moved over 200 megahertz of spectrum. In 1993 in America, the average phone that was wireless was the size of a brick. It looked like the phone Gordon Gekko had in the movie ``Wall Street.'' People didn't have one. It cost 50 cents a minute. But I was able to move over 200 megahertz of spectrum in 1993, and four new companies were able to compete. They both went digital, and by 1996, this is what people had in their pocket--under 10 cents a minute, and all of a sudden everyone had this phone. It just killed that phone that was the size of a brick.  But then another remarkable thing happened. Within 8 or 10 more years, there was a guy out in Silicon Valley, and he came up with an idea for an iPhone, and that revolution just kept moving because we had opened it up to competition.  You can imagine there were devotees to the black rotary dial phone who kept saying: Oh my goodness, it is a war on the black rotary dial phone, all of these new devices. But it wasn't. It was just technology. It was a revolution. It was capitalism, and it had finally been opened to that competition after 100 years.  Well, that is what has happened in electrical generation. We finally have passed laws that open it up to competition. It is not a secret. And the only way to shut it down is to have someone like Scott Pruitt as the head of the EPA because then, all of a sudden, you can have an EPA chief who says: We are not going to have any new rules on climate change. We are not going to have any more rules that reduce the amount of pollution that goes up into the atmosphere. We are not going to have any more rules that ensure that President Obama's Clean Power Plan is implemented in our country, which would again telescope the timeframe that it would take in order to deploy these massive amounts of new renewable electricity sources in our country and expedite the pace at which natural gas resources get deployed in our country.  So that is really what this is all about. It is a special interest giveaway--pick your industry. How do we protect it? How do we make sure we don't move beyond the 20th century? How do we not have this incredible green generation be able to invent the new energy technologies of this century, the same way that they invented the new telecommunications technologies at the end of the 20th century? How do we stop them? Well, you have to really find people who are willfully committed to it.  Let's go to Scott Scott Pruitt, as the attorney general of Oklahoma, unbelievably sued the EPA 19 times. Now, what attorney general sues the EPA 19 times? Well, let's look at the subjects he sued on--clean air, clean water, soot, mercury, haze. It is almost like a laundry list of the dirtiest issues that America would want us to have an Environmental Protection Agency working on. And he sued over and over and over again. And even as he is being considered for confirmation, after I questioned him in the hearing, saying: Will you recuse yourself from any consideration of any issue that you have already sued the agency on that is still pending, he said he would not recuse himself.  So I said to Mr.Pruitt in that hearing: Well, if you don't recuse yourself and you still have eight pending cases, that will make you the plaintiff, the defendant, the judge, and the jury on these matters that are at the heart of the clean air, clean water agenda that the American people want to see implemented in the 21st century.  What was he doing in Oklahoma? What was he trying to accomplish? Well, I decided to ask Mr.Pruitt some questions.  Question 1: I asked Mr.Pruitt to describe the actions he took as Oklahoma's attorney general to enforce the State's environmental laws. His response: He told me to go file an open records request.  Secondly, I asked Mr.Pruitt how much of the budget he controlled as attorney general did he devote to Oklahoma's Office of Environmental Do you know what he told me? He said: Go file an open records request.  3: I asked Mr.Pruitt how many individuals he employed in the Office of Environmental Do you know what his answer was? You are asking for too much information. Go file an open records request.  4: I learned that Mr.Pruitt had hired one of his campaign contributors to sue the EPA, so I asked him to show me the contract. And do you know what he told me? You are right. You guessed it. He told me to go file an open records request.  So his answer to me over and over again was go FOIA yourself. But that is not a sufficient answer to a Member of Congress because we actually get the right to ask for critical information on the environmental records of those who are applying for the job of chief environmental protector of our country. And if you are looking for evidence to convict Scott Pruitt on the charge of protecting public health and the environment, he is unwilling to give it to you.  During his confirmation hearing, we heard a lot about Scott Pruitt respecting States' rights. Scott Pruitt's record shows that he is in favor of States' rights but only when it is good for the State of Oklahoma and the oil industry of When I asked him about protecting the rights of States like California and Massachusetts to do more to protect their environment, he declined to support their rights to do that for their  So under Scott Pruitt, EPA is going to turn into Every Polluter's He won't be there as the cop on the beat to ensure that those protections are in place to ensure that every American--all 320 million--is given the protections they need. It will no longer be an Agency that is a watchdog for the environment; this is an Agency that is going to be a lap dog for polluters across our country. And if that is the case, then we are going to see a rollback in the health, the safety of those protections that all Americans have come to expect in the area of the environment.[[Page S1294]]  When we raised the issues of his conflict of interest in the committee, we received unsatisfactory answers. When we raised the issues of providing us the information we were going to need in order to fully understand his complete record, we were not given the answers we need.  Now let me once again come back to 1981 and 1982. What did James Watt do at the Department of Interior? Well, he wound up selling off for bargain-basement prices the coal resources in the Powder River Basin in It was a scandal of massive proportion. It led to his resignation. It was avoidable but predictable because he made very clear what his attitude was about all of these resources.  The same thing was true over at the EPA with Anne It was an Agency that the Reagan administration, in actual reports, said that the goal of the EPA Administrator would be to bring the Agency to its knees--to its knees--and that became the goal during the Gorsuch time at the So another resignation.  We have here with Scott Pruitt someone who has the same agenda, the same goals, and the same unfortunate allies to accomplish those goals.  So I am going to continue, along with my colleagues, for the rest of the evening to bring this case to the American people. We believe this is a preview of coming attractions. We want America to know who Scott Pruitt is because when he begins to take action in March, in April, and in May, if he is confirmed, then they will know who he is very simply because everything we are saying tonight is going to be a preview of those coming attractions.  So at this point, I reserve the remainder of my time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

2892,topic-id,982,"Mr.President, earlier today I spoke on the floor about Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt and his nomination to lead the Environmental Protection Since that time, an Oklahoma judge has now ruled that Scott Pruitt must comply with a 2-year-old request to release email correspondence between the attorney general's office and fossil fuel companies, like oil company Devon Energy and coal company Murray  After an over 2-year struggle, these communications will finally come to light starting next Tuesday, but the Senate is due to vote on Scott Pruitt's nomination tomorrow afternoon, Friday, at 1 p.m. Now, that smells to the high heavens. The American people in the Senate have a right to know what is in all of those emails that have finally been ordered to be released by a court. Instead, what the Republican leadership is going to do is rush to judgment, forcing Members of the Senate to vote on this confirmation without knowing what is in all of these emails that have been subject to litigation for the last 2 years.  Now, it is a little bit fishy because Republicans have been obsessed with emails for over 2 years. They have spent millions of dollars on attempts to gain access to emails during the Presidential campaign, but now they are denying the Senate and the American public the right to examine Scott Pruitt's emails. That, again, is not The only thing Senate Republicans seem to want to deny more than climate change is the right of Senators to review these 3,000 emails. That, again, is not So we are going to be in a very funny situation at 1 tomorrow afternoon. The emails are on the way. We are going to find out what was in all of those emails. We are going to find out what kind of correspondence Attorney General Pruitt had with all of these different entities with which he was communicating, but the Senators will not have it for a basis of casting a vote.  Now, maybe it is benign, but maybe it is not. Maybe that is why this vote is being rushed. It is being rushed so the Senators don't know what is in there; that they are blind as they vote. Then, as each email becomes public, as each new revelation becomes public in the weeks and months ahead, people are going to look back at this body and they are going to say: Why could you not wait just another week so Senators could know what was in those emails? I think there is a reason why many people have arched eyebrows that are going up so high that it would hit the roof a ceiling. There is a reason to be skeptical that something is happening here that is meant to be a rush to judgment to avoid all of the evidence being placed in front of the Senators and the American people in terms of his nomination.  Members of the faith community are weighing in as well. They have opposed Mr.Pruitt's nomination. I want to read portions of a letter that the bishops of the Episcopal Church of Massachusetts sent to President Trump:       The Episcopal Church stands strongly for the protection of      the environment. We respect the facts of science. We support      the laws and policies that address the reality of climate      change.       Our respect for our government leaders and our reverence      for the earth as God's creation impel us to write you to      express our dismay about your selection of Scott Pruitt to      head the Environmental Protection  These are the bishops of the Episcopal Church of They continue:       We wonder why a person who has consistently and adamantly      opposed all laws and policies that provide even minimal      ``protection'' to the environment should be entrusted with      leading such an agency.       President-elect Trump, you have promised economic      development. Like you, we value a stable and prosperous      economy. However, a thriving economy depends on a healthy      environment. The more we weaken and dismantle the E.P.A.'s      vital protections of our natural world, the more we threaten      the common good.       You have also promised to strengthen our national defense.      Like you, we value national security. However, our country's      top military intelligence have concluded that climate change      is a ``threat multiplier'' that is already creating      instability around the world and will likely create      significant security challenges in the years ahead. If      someone who casts doubt on the reality of climate change      becomes the head of the E.P.A., our national security will be      compromised.       As citizens of this beloved country, we intend to write our      members of Congress, urging them to block the nomination of      Scott Pruitt to lead the E.P.We will pray for a better      choice.  The letter is signed by the following faith leaders: Right Reverend Douglas Fisher, Bishop Diocesan of Western Massachusetts; the Right Reverend Alan Gates, Bishop Diocesan of Massachusetts; the Right Reverend Gayle Harris, Bishop Suffragan of Massachusetts; the Right Reverend Barbara Harris, Bishop Suffragan of Massachusetts; the Right Reverend Roy Cederholm, Bishop Suffragan of  The reality is, this is not just a question of these Episcopal bishops, but Pope Francis came to the Congress just last year and preached a sermon on the Hill, saying the planet is dangerously warming, human activity is causing it, and we have a moral responsibility to take action as Americans, as the House and Senate, a moral responsibility to protect this planet that God created and those who are the poorest and most vulnerable who will be most exposed.  This is a moral issue of the highest magnitude. The leaders of religions all across our country are praying for us, begging us to do something in order to protect this planet. Scott Pruitt does not intend on taking those actions.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

2894,topic-id,1267,"Mr.President, I want to continue on the subject that I was just referencing. This is a story from Oklahoma that is on the wires right now across the country.  Headline: ``Judge orders Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to release emails related to fossil fuel industry.''  Let me read a little bit of this news story. This is Oklahoma       A judge has ruled that Americans have a right to know how      much of a relationship Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt      has with oil and gas leaders before becoming the head of the      Environmental Protection       For years, Pruitt has been an outspoken adversary of the      EPA and is currently suing the agency.[[Page S1295]]       In December, President Donald Trump selected Pruitt to lead      the agency despite concerns from lawmakers.       A 2014 New York Times report claimed that Pruitt's ties to      Devon Energy Corporation directly influenced decisions he      made while in office in       Through open records requests, the New York Times obtained      a letter written by Devon's attorneys, which was then taken      to       The article states, ``The attorney general's staff had      taken Devon's draft, copied it onto state government      stationery with only a few word changes, and sent it to      Washington with the attorney general's signature.''       In 2014, KFOR asked for a comment to the allegations, but      received a statement focusing on the benefits of the oil      industry. . . . Six Senators from the Senate Environment and      Public Works Committee asked Pruitt to list his connections      to energy companies so they can decide whether those      interactions will affect how he will run the . . . The      Center for Media and Democracy filed nine open records      requests with the AG's office, beginning in January 2015.       ``Probably the largest request we have is for      communication: emails, phone calls, [and] scheduling related      to his involvement with various energy companies, as well as      his involvement with the republican attorney general's      association,'' attorney Blake Lawrence said.       The group alleges that Pruitt received nearly $350,000 in      campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry. They      want his dealings with those in the industry made public--and      soon.       ``Just last week our office contacted the Center for Media      and Democracy to notify them that release of their request      was imminent. The fact that they have now filed suit despite      our ongoing communications demonstrates that this is nothing      more than political theater,'' AG spokesman Lincoln Ferguson      said in a statement.       According to the Hill, Democrats asked Pruitt for the      documents as part of his confirmation hearing, but he      declined. Instead, he told them to file public records      requests themselves.       Now, a judge has ordered the Oklahoma Attorney General's      Office to turn over close to 3,000 documents related to      Pruitt's communications with oil, gas, and coal companies,      according to E&E       Pruitt's office has until Tuesday to release the emails,      but his confirmation vote was originally believed to be held      Friday, 17.  Meaning today, in 5 more minutes.       ``Scott Pruitt and Senate Republicans have made a mockery      of the confirmation process, permitting the nominee to escape      scrutiny and hide his deep ties to the fossil fuel industry.      What is he hiding in all of these emails? The vote to confirm      Pruitt must now be delayed until every senator can see just      who Pruitt is and what he will do if permitted to run the      EPA,'' a statement from the Sierra Club read.  That is where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen. We are 6 minutes to midnight on Thursday night. The vote is now scheduled in 13 hours 5 minutes here on the Senate floor.  These emails are going to be released next Tuesday so there can be a public examination of them, to finally determine what is the relationship between Scott Pruitt and these industries that he will be given responsibility to regulate.  What are they hiding? Why are they rushing? Why will they not give the American people the ability to find out what is inside these emails before there is a vote on the Senate floor? Because once that vote takes place, he will be the head of EPA, and then we will find out what conflicts may exist, what relationships may exist, what decisions had been made. But, no, the Senate leadership will not give the American people the respect they deserve to ensure that all of that information is out for public viewing so they can make an informed judgment as to the exact nature of the relationships between this nominee for the EPA and industries that he has had responsibility for regulating in Oklahoma and he will have responsibility for regulating as the head of the national Environmental Protection  It is an absolutely unacceptable policy to know that critical information that makes it possible for the public and the Senate to understand a candidate for such a powerful office is to be available and yet not in fact considered as part of this historic decision.  For me, it is a ``March of Folly.'' It is just another example of how the Republican Party, the GOP, has become the gas and oil party. That is really what it stands for now, just committed to ensuring that they cover up what is in these emails. They don't give the public the chance to be able to understand what these potentially explosive relationships may be so the Senate can deliberate fully on whether Mr.Pruitt does in fact qualify to be an impartial head of the Environmental Protection Agency of our country and ultimately of the world because the world looks to us to determine where climate change is going, where environmental protections are going, not just for our own citizens but for theirs as well. What we do is replicated inevitably, inextricably in the rest of the world.  This man will have one of the most powerful positions on the planet. Emails are available right now if we just wait to help us in our deliberation. It is really a tragedy. It is a sad commentary upon this institution that rather than just delaying, examining, and then giving the public the information they need in the Senate, instead we rush to judgment. We rush to judgment, but ultimately the judgment of history is going to be on us if it is determined, through these emails, that Mr.Pruitt is unqualified for this position; that the conflicts which he has had disqualify him for this position; that the emails disclosed to us the conflicts of interest that are going to ultimately impair his ability to be impartial in his regulation of clean air and clean water and mercury and haze and soot and smog and this whole litany of issues that go right to the public health and safety of every  From my perspective, it is a sad day in the Senate when the information is now available, a brief delay would make it possible for each Senator to be able to make an informed decision, and yet the Senate moves on, not waiting, not listening, not willing to give the American public the information they will need to make an informed decision that they can then give to their Senators to make a wise decision that could lead to much stronger protections that they can receive from this critical Agency that is the overseer of the environment in our country.  Again, I oppose Mr.Pruitt's nomination. I would ask for a delay. I know it is not going to happen. I understand why, but it is a sad day in the history of the  Mr.President, I wish to reclaim the remainder of my time and yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1275-2.txt,735,PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEGACY,2017.0,16.0,January
2968,topic-id,1677,"Mr.President, I rise to join my colleagues in this important conversation on the Senate floor and, once again, to demand answers to the many questions raised about Russia's interference in our elections.  Not so long ago, I came to the floor to speak out against a belligerent act from an adversarial nation, an attempt to undermine American democracy and foment chaos and uncertainty on the world stage, an effort that we now know from our own intelligence community's assessment was ordered by President Putin himself, a campaign that senior intelligence officials have concluded ``blend[ed] covert intelligence operations--such as cyber activity--with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users, or `trolls,' '' to undermine our 2016 Presidential elections.  In recent weeks, the American people have been confronted by a daily drumbeat of headlines regarding Russian interference with our elections and possible ties to President Trump's campaign. They have learned that the President's former National Security Advisor, LTG Michael Flynn, was not truthful about the nature of the conversations he had with the Russian Ambassador shortly after President Obama sanctioned Russia for meddling in our elections.  They learned that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the highest law enforcement officer in the land, did not fully disclose at least two meetings he had with the Russian Ambassador during his nomination hearings.  They have learned, through reporting in the news media, that U.law enforcement continues to investigation Russian agents' contacts with President Trump's inner circle.  Yet despite these revelations, the American people now face more questions than answers. Has anyone else on the President's team been in contact with the Russian Government? What were the nature of these conversations? How credible are reports of business dealings between Russian oligarchs and the Trump organization?  But here is the reason I came to the floor today, as serious as those questions are. Getting answers to these questions, whether it be through a special prosecutor, or an independent commission--on which Senator Cardin has legislation and which I strongly, strongly support and believe it is the ultimate vehicle--or the Senate Intelligence Committee's own investigation--those efforts are not about President It is about the American people. It is about protecting our free and democratic way of life and our time-tested system of self-governance. It is about showing our constituents that, when the stakes are high, when the allegations are this startling, when the implications are this alarming, we are capable of setting politics aside and getting to the truth.  Time and again, the President has dismissed the significance of Russia's interference in our elections, and he derides reports about his financial interests and campaign contacts with Russia as ``fake news.'' Well, this isn't fake news. On the contrary, these are real threats--real threats from a real foreign adversary; real threats that undermine the integrity of our elections and, therefore, the security of our country; real threats from a brutal leader who sees the erosion of Western democracy as a strategic imperative for Russia's future.  So let's be clear about why these threats matter. Vladimir Putin's rise to power in Russia has been marked by the suppression of the freedom of the press, the oppression of the Russian people, the murder of political opponents, and the transfer of wealth and assets from the Russian people to a handful of powerful oligarchs.  President Putin sees the spread of Western democratic values that we enjoy here in our country and others in the Western world--like freedom of speech, the rule of law, and human rights--as a threat to his power. So Russia has embarked on a systematic campaign to undermine the democracies that uphold the international order established after World War II and that has been the bedrock of peace and tranquility, generally speaking, since then. These threats must be taken seriously.  Russia's aggressive behavior reaches back years and extends to this day. We saw it in 2008, when Russia backed illegal separatist forces in Georgia, declaring South Ossetia and Abkhazia independent states. We saw it in March of 2014--when I was in Ukraine--when Russia authorized the use of military force to annex Crimea, blatantly violating the sovereignty of the Ukrainian people and the Budapest Memorandum, a memorandum that we--the United States, Russia, and others--signed, saying that we would observe the territorial and sovereignty rights of Ukraine if they gave up the nuclear weapons that had been left to them after the collapse of the Soviet  They did just that. They did just that, and what happened to them afterwards? Their territory has been annexed and invaded. Today, Putin continues to break ceasefires, sow discord, and incite violence throughout eastern Ukraine--an effort that to date has claimed 10,000 lives and displaced 2 million people.  Unfortunately, Russia's interference in our 2016 Presidential election is not an isolated instance. According to U.intelligence reports, these efforts are only the most recent manifestation of[[Page S1677]]the Kremlin's ongoing campaign to undermine Western democracy.  In recent years, we have seen Russian oligarchs funnel money to fringe political movements across Europe, and Russian operatives conduct sophisticated disinformation campaigns. After the revelations that Russia interfered with our own elections, Putin has shown no signs of slowing down. On the contrary, just weeks ago, Russian's Defense Minister announced that the Kremlin will begin using troops to enhance their information operations, emphasizing that ``propaganda must be smart, competent, and efficient.''  Again, Russia's end goal here is no mystery. Putin aims to undermine European unity and fracture the transatlantic alliance--an alliance that has served as a bedrock for international security, peace and stability, and economic cooperation between the United States and Europe for the past half century.  In the Middle East, President Putin continues to disregard international norms. He aligns Russia with Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terror. He aids Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in his atrocities against innocent civilians. In Aleppo, Russian bombs fall on homes; Russian bombs fall on schools and hospitals; Russian bombs fall on aid convoys that only seek to feed starving, trapped families, and rescue children from the rubble.  Just last month, Russia violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty when they illegally launched a cruise missile, showing no regard for an agreement that has been a hallmark for nuclear security cooperation for nearly four decades. That is not an insignificant act.  The United States cannot ignore such destabilizing behavior. That is exactly why Senator Graham and I introduced 78 just 2 weeks ago, recognizing 3 years of Russian military aggression and calling on Russia to respect its obligations to the international community. Our resolution should serve as a reminder to this administration that the U.sanctions imposed on Russia for violating the international order should remain in place until Russia starts respecting and returning to that international norm.  Nor can we let Russian efforts to undermine Western democracies continue unabated. That is why I joined my colleagues in the Countering Russian Hostilities Act of 2017. This bipartisan bill codifies the sanctions imposed by President Obama for Russia's annexation of Crimea and interference in the U.elections into law.  It is the same type of proposition we had with the Iran agreement. We want a congressional opportunity to voice ourselves and make sure that those sanctions aren't lifted arbitrarily, capriciously, without Russia paying the consequences and coming back into the international order. At the same time, the legislation authorizes $100 million for the State Department and other agencies to counter Putin's propaganda.  The time for action--and for answers--is now. We can get to work immediately by holding hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to ensure that the United States has a strategy in place to protect the security of our democracy and promote stability abroad. From the spread of extremist propaganda across Europe and the denial of Ukrainian sovereignty, to the bombing of civilians in Aleppo and the cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee, Putin's intentions are not up for debate.  Russia's destabilizing behavior should make it absolutely clear to the President of the United States that the Russian Federation is not our friend. But when the President hesitates to acknowledge this reality or fails to address such aggressive behavior, it is up to Congress to act. There can be no hesitation when it comes to protecting the security and sanctity of our elections.  But to take action we need answers. That is why we need an independent investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 elections. What President Trump fails to realize time and again is that this investigation is not about whether or not Russia successfully swayed the American elections. This investigation is not about him. This investigation is about the American people. It is about ensuring that our elections are free, fair, and secure so that our government that we elect is responsive and accountable to the people. It is about understanding Russia's tactics in cyber space and preparing for future attacks. It is about standing with our allies, preserving peace and avoiding war, and preventing the need to send our sons and daughters into harm's way. It is about ensuring that, when the President of the United States faces tough decisions, the American people can trust that he puts their interests--their interests--ahead of any other interests he has abroad.  It is time to protect the integrity of our elections and to secure our democracy against the cyber threats of the 21st century--whether they come in the form of election machine tampering, or paid propaganda on social media, or targeted hacks on political and public officials.  Russia poses a real strategic threat to the United States, to our core values, and to the international order. I call on the President to treat these threats with the seriousness they deserve.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect the integrity of our elections here at home, to defend democracy abroad, and to ensure that the transatlantic alliance, so vital to international security and stability, remains strong for generations to come.

2863,topic-id,251,"Mr.President, I appreciate the opportunity that my colleague from Hawaii has given me to ask a question. Particularly, I appreciate his willingness to be on the floor making this case because being the guardians of clean air and clean water in the United States of America is an incredible responsibility, and the individual we place in this position as Director of the Environmental Protection Agency is going to make decisions that will affect the life and death of millions of American citizens, that will affect the quality of life of millions of American citizens.  When the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency proceeds to say we are to fight for the mercury standard, that means that fewer children will be exposed to a persistent neurotoxin that stunts the development of our children's brains. On the other hand, if that individual says: I am not concerned about that or I think I will just look the other way because I want to help the fossil fuel industry make a few more bucks, and he decides that weighs more heavily than the health of our children, then the health of our children is impacted. That is true with one form of pollutant and another, and they are just across the landscape. This is an incredibly important position. That is why understanding the viewpoints of the nominee is so critical.  My understanding is that the individual who controls access to the emails in Oklahoma is the attorney general; am I correct in that understanding?

My question to my colleague from Hawaii is as follows: Just the fact that a nominee, accepting a nomination and knowing the Senate has a responsibility to vet the nominee, who turns around and says, but you can't have access to my records, shouldn't that in itself disqualify that individual from consideration?

2874,topic-id,247,"Mr.President, in this conversation about these emails, the thing that keeps striking me is that our fundamental question is, Is the individual, is the nominee, given his record in Oklahoma, going to be an advocate for the environment, an advocate for the health of the citizens of the United States of America, an advocate for upholding clean water and clean air that have done so much to improve the quality of life for Americans, or is the individual, Scott Pruitt, going to be, instead, an advocate for the oil companies and the coal companies and the gas companies? That question goes to the heart of whether the individual, Scott Pruitt, is fit to carry this responsibility.  The American people have been very pleased with the enormous changes in the quality of the environment over the last 30 or 40 years, and it has added a tremendous amount of improvement to their lives. Here we have somebody who, possibly, is not going to advocate and fulfill the responsibilities of the office but who is going to use the office as director of the EPA as an extension of the complex matrix of fossil fuel companies and work on their behalf and not on the people's behalf.  I will invite my colleagues, if they have insight or questions related to this question of whether Scott Pruitt is going to serve the interests of the people or the interests of the fossil fuel companies, to feel free to weigh in.

2876,topic-id,513,"My colleague from Rhode Island put up the web. Maybe ``web'' is a better word than ``matrix'' because it looks like a giant spiderweb. What is being ensnared in this spiderweb, in this web of denial, in this ``denial beast'' as you have labeled it, is the truth.  What the complex group of organizations does is to put out information from every possible direction. They hold conferences; they hold workshops; they write letters to the editor; they write opinion editorials in our newspapers; they organize research--all so that it can reverberate in a way that an ordinary citizen hears from here and here and here the same lie--the lie that it is not clear whether carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is damaging our environment.  Here is the truth: We know very clearly the damage that is being done by burning fossil fuels, by burning natural gas, by burning coal, by burning oil, but there is so much money, so much profit, that they can build this enormous web of organizations to mislead the public, and that is half of it.  Then there is the second chart my colleague put up, which lays out these funds of dark money. This is really about the corruption of our democratic Maybe if I come over here, this will be in the same frame of reference. These funds flow through in a fashion that they contaminate the debate among citizens in election after election after election. This dark money is corrupting the very soul of our democracy--our elections.  Here is the interesting connection. Right now, a judge has ruled and said: ``There was an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access to documents requested.'' Our nominee is in control of these emails, his own emails. He has been stopping access to them because he has that power as attorney general of Oklahoma because he is afraid of the information the public will learn from his communications.  The lines on the chart that my colleague from Rhode Island put up showed his connection to fund after fund after fund. In his communications with these groups, which may possibly be among the communications that the judge has just said will be released to the public, wouldn't it be interesting to find out what he said related to those organizations? Was he serving the public, or was he serving the fossil fuel industry?  This information will be available next Tuesday, but the majority leader has said, essentially, that he is willing to deny Americans the right to know the truth about Scott He is willing to deny Americans the right to know the truth about these emails. He is willing to deny Americans the right to know about these leaks between organizations and whether Scott Pruitt served the public trust or served the fossil fuel industry, served the Koch brothers.

2879,topic-id,1398,"Mr.President, I appreciate the questions from my colleague from As we stand here tonight, I think about how Hawaii is a State completely surrounded by water. It is very vulnerable to changes in the environment, very vulnerable to the introduction of invasive species, very vulnerable to changes in the acidity of the ocean, which is affected by carbon dioxide, and very vulnerable to the rising sea level.  I appreciate so much that as a citizen of Hawaii as well as now a leader for the voice of the State here in this Chamber, he keeps going back to his fundamentals of concern for our broader environment.  As you were asking this question, I was thinking about President Richard Nixon creating the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. He recognized that we all share ``a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment and the preservation of the Earth as a place both habitable by and hospitable to man.''  Well, that is a pretty clear statement that things were in trouble and we needed to operate a rescue. I think about that in the context of growing up in Oregon and, as I grew up, through my church and through my Boy Scout troop, we would go and do different projects to try to clean up messes that had been left. One of those was that we had a problem with these plastic six-pack rings that held all of the six cans together and the birds that were on the Pacific Flyway would stick their head through one of these plastic rings that would have held the top of a soda can, and they wouldn't be able to get it off, and they would end up choking or dying. Also, these plastic rings were being digested by the animals, and it was affecting them.  Then we had these flip-tops where you would open a can of soda by pulling off a triangular piece of metal and it would be a little hook that would sit on the beach or the pathway, and then somebody would step on it and cut their foot open or an animal would eat it, and this nice little curved object would tear up their throat and kill them. Those issues of: Why? Why do we have to operate with these consumer products in the fashion that are creating these specific hazards? The answer was: We didn't.  There was a bill in the Oregon legislature, and we eliminated the plastic rings that birds were sticking their heads through. And then we had a proposal--and I can't really recall if was done by initiative or by the legislature--to eliminate these flip-tops. The industry said: You cannot eliminate these flip-tops. People will not be able to open their cans of soda. It will be a terrible tragedy for There is no solution. You cannot touch this. Adamantly, they said: Nothing can be[[Page S1283]]done. It is an impossible problem to solve.  But we passed the law. We adopted that law, either by initiative or by the legislature, and a magical thing occurred. Within what seemed like a few days--maybe it was a few weeks--those peel-off flip-tops disappeared and were replaced by a different mechanism that opens that same triangle, but stays attached to the can.  Well, I have seen this time and again where there is a proposal where we need to improve our habits as humans, and as we are engaged in making our consumer products more complimentary to the environment, we are told: It can't be done. It will be too expensive. It will be too difficult. And then, when we say no, it can be done, and we pass a law, the solutions appear. And everyone says: Oh, that works just fine.  So now we don't have those plastic rings. Now we don't have those peel-off flip-tops that sit on the ground.  But we would go out in my Scout troop or in my church group and we would clean up and we would think that this would be so unnecessary to have these, and I saw the changes that occurred.  Then people said: What about all of these aluminum cans and glass bottles that are sitting all around here on the pathways around our Oregon had a strong ethic for the environment, but we were littered by all of these aluminum cans and steel cans back then, and also by glass bottles and broken glass bottles. If you have cleaned up a broken glass bottle, you know that it is real a pain to do that. And if you step on the shards from a glass bottle, you regret that somebody else shattered it and left it on the ground.  So we said: Why can't we change that? So the legislature put forward the idea and said: Let's just put a deposit on this so when you turn it in, you get 5 cents back. So we had the first bottle bill in the Nation, and that bottle bill got a huge percentage of those cans and those bottles returned that were left out in the public. And if somebody did leave something in the public space, somebody else would come along and say: There is a nickel; I will grab it and return it.  I must say that the amount of deposits in Oregon hasn't kept pace with inflation. When my kids were small, I would say: There is a bottle; grab it. There's a nickel. And they would say: It is just a nickel, A nickel isn't what it was three or four decades ago. But nonetheless, it still was an innovation that served as well.  About that same time, Oregon was worried about the developments of its beaches because we had a huge public trust with the beaches. The beaches belonged to all the people in the State, but the law was a little bit vague in this regard. But there was a provision that said that essentially public byways would remain public byways, and those beaches were established then by law in Oregon as belonging to all of the people of the State, and that access would be available to all of the people in the So nobody could take a piece of beach and say: This is mine. It belonged to everyone. So we gained our public beaches during that time period.  Then, someone else said: Well, look, we are seeing what is happening with congestion in some other And, with apologies to my fellow Senators from California, a lot of Oregonians turned to California and said: We are seeing a lot of sprawl, we are seeing a lot of congestion, and maybe we can do something about that and change the way that development occurs.  So under the governorship of Tom McCall, who, by the way, was a Republican and who, like Richard Nixon, believed in the environment--it was Richard Nixon who was President when we did the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, and we established the EPA, and it was the Republican Tom McCall who preserved the beach bill and the bottle bill and this land use planning bill that said: Let's put a boundary around each town and city, and you will not be able to build outside of that boundary so that we don't have sprawl. And some said: Well, we want to still have the right to build anything. So a compromise was struck. And it was that the tax rate outside of those boundaries would be much lower. So, with that, the farmers said: That is a sweet deal, we will take that. And the forest industry said: We will take that. Meanwhile, it meant that our city started to develop more densely with intense services, and we avoided the sprawl that had been experienced elsewhere.  I mention each of these issues--the bottle bill, the beach bill, the land use bill, the fact that we got rid of the flip-tops--because these were strategies to make us be able to operate in a more sustainable fashion, in accordance with the vision that Richard Nixon laid out when he created the Environmental Protection  Let me read that one more time. He said that we all share ``a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment and the preservation of the Earth as a place both habitable by and hospitable to man.''

2882,topic-id,406,"I appreciate that question. It is something we have witnessed unfold over the last two decades. It was not that long ago Republicans--both parties--for example, would stand up and say: We have a serious threat to our planet. That threat is the temperature of the planet is increasing, that we are suffering the impacts of methane and carbon dioxide pollution, and we must address that threat, but in the last few years, we have seen a steady diminishment of Republican commitment to address that threat. What does that correspond to? It corresponds very precisely to the[[Page S1284]]growth of dark money from the fossil fuel industry.  I hate to lay out this story because it is offensive to anyone--any patriotic American who wants to see government of, by, and for the people--to hear this story about the massive corruption of our body politic by this dark money.  If I go back a few years and look at a set of campaigns the last time I ran for office, that dark money became involved in Senate campaign after Senate campaign after Senate campaign after Senate campaign, and it very much had an impact on the composition of this body. As those races were won with dark money from the fossil fuel industry, the willingness of some individuals to stand up and speak truthfully, forthcomingly, and powerfully about the challenge to the environment diminished and diminished and diminished. That really has to change. It is why we have to take on this role of dark money. It is the factor that means there is no longer a Governor McCall--a Republican who is fighting for the beach fill, a Republican who is fighting for the bottle bill, a Republican who is fighting for the land use bill to make our environment work better.  As a kid, we had rivers in Oregon you couldn't swim in, and now you can. Now, they are not perfect. They still show a touch of humankind on them, but the point pollution--the pipes full of toxic materials that went in the river--those are gone. What we have left primarily is nonpoint pollution, which is a much harder thing to tackle, but even that we are working to control through buffers and a variety of regulations to try to clean that up. We have made big improvements.  That, to my colleague from Hawaii, I would have to say is the factor that has changed this body.

2885,topic-id,1046,"I appreciate the Senator's chart because I think it demonstrates, in a much more precise way, what I was describing, the corrupting role of dark money. Here, the Senate has illustrated how that money was really unleashed by the Citizens United decision and how the impact has been dramatic, just squelching the ability of my Republican colleagues to share this effort to create a sustainable planet.  I think, when we are asking for these emails to be reviewed before we vote, we are asking the question: Does Scott Pruitt share the mission that Richard Nixon stated when we created the Environmental Protection Agency? If you are going to head the Agency, do you share the mission? We want to know whether Scott Pruitt has, in Richard Nixon's words, ``a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment.'' We want to know whether Scott Pruitt has a profound commitment to the preservation of the Earth as a place habitable to mankind. We want to know whether he has a commitment to the preservation of the Earth as hospitable to mankind.  Henry David Thoreau kind of summed it up like this: What use is a house if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on? That is a good question. It is a commitment to the fact that where we live is just not the house, the structure of our bedroom and our kitchen and dining room, where we live is on this beautiful blue-green planet. That is our home, and we must care for it just as we do the structure of our house.  When I ask this question: Is Scott Pruitt committed to the mission of rescuing our natural environment, I think there will be answers to that in these emails. That is why we should see these emails, as the judge has said that we should see those emails. He said there was an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access. By whom? The person who blocked it was the attorney general of Oklahoma, who is the nominee whose record we are examining--the attorney general of The reason this body hasn't had these emails, the reason the American public has not been able to answer the question: Are you committed to the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency, is because Scott Pruitt prevented us from being able to answer that question.  He has been quite clear in other circumstances which amplify our concerns. On the Agency he has been nominated to lead, he describes himself as a ``leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.'' Just with those words, we sense a certain hostility to the work the EPA does to try to clean up the air, clean up the water, and hold polluters accountable. Isn't it a good thing to fulfill the mission you are charged with doing? It is not a pejorative. It is an important commitment to work hard to fulfill the responsibilities of the office.  That is one piece of evidence, but here is another. Devon Energy sent a letter to Scott Pruitt and said: Would you please make this the position of your office and address it to the Environmental Protection Agency, to the Honorable Lisa Jackson, head of the  Here is the letter as it was sent to Scott Pruitt by Devon Energy, saying: Won't you take our position as your position. Here is the letter that was sent on. This is the first page. There was a longer amount to it. As we can see, these paragraphs in yellow were lifted 100 percent over here into the letter. There was one sentence that was dropped out in the course of this lengthy letter. I think it is less than 5 percent of the letter was dropped out. Essentially, he took their letter and printed it on his stationery as the position of the attorney general on behalf of the people of the State of  So I asked him in the hearing whether he felt he was representing Devon Energy and making his office an extension of this corporation or whether he was serving the people of the He had earlier said he would like to hear from everyone and get all sides of something. He said: Well, I consider, in printing Devon's letter as Oklahoma's attorney general's letter, simply advocating for an industry that is important to Oklahoma--so making the oil position the position of the attorney general's office.  I said: Well, earlier you stated that you liked to hear the various sides of an issue and consider the input. Whom else did you talk to about this issue before you simply took the position of the oil company?  The answer was: No one.  So we can only conclude that, at least in this one instance, the nominee before us didn't look out to the people he was representing as attorney general. He didn't look after the body of law, the body of opinion, the body of effects. He didn't consult with anyone, except one organization--Devon  I must say, this is evidence, at this moment, of not serving the people, as an officer of the people is committed to do, but serving a company. So is this an anomaly or is this essentially the way he operated day in and day out? The answer is in the emails that we do not have. That is why it is a travesty if we vote tomorrow without getting those emails next Tuesday and enabling the public to examine them.  We normally have 30 hours of debate postcloture after we officially close debate. We don't quite close it but say there is another 30 hours of debate. That is what we are in right now, and that is why we are here tonight. Wouldn't it make sense to suspend this debate until after the citizens of the United States of America have a chance to pour through those emails and know the answer? Is this what we[[Page S1285]]can expect; that we will have an Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is serving Devon Energy and the Koch brothers and this dark money cartel or is he going to serve the citizens of the United States of America?

2888,topic-id,2375,"One of the things that I want to return to is why we are so concerned about this complex matrix of corruption, of dark money changing the outcome of campaigns, changing the makeup of the Senate, changing the type of rules that are adopted and the laws that are passed, because behind it all is a rising tide of pollution that is changing the chemistry of our air and changing the temperature of our planet.  This is a very simple chart here, and this shows temperature and carbon dioxide. If we look at this carefully, you can see that the carbon dioxide rises and the temperature rises. This is what has happened. The scientists have looked back hundreds of thousands of years. Carbon dioxide goes down, and the temperature goes down. Carbon dioxide goes up, and the temperature goes up because carbon dioxide is essentially a blanket.  If you increase the thickness of that blanket--that is, the density of the carbon dioxide--more heat is trapped on the Earth's surface. When we realize the age of the Earth, which is measured in billions of years, the time that we have been here in human civilization is pretty brief. And the time that we have been burning fossil fuels for energy is very brief--150 years--a very small blink of the eye.  In that time, we have changed the chemistry of the air. We have increased the size and the weight of the blanket substantially. Prior to the burning of coal, for many thousands of years, the carbon dioxide level had varied up and down, but the top level was 280 parts per million. That is this blue line.  What we see is that the carbon dioxide level has steadily climbed as we burn the coal, the natural gas, and the oil. As we have done that, the black line is going up and down. It has varied a little bit from year to year. It has steadily increased as well.  There are many folks who look at this and say that is just lines on a chart. If you project into the future, that is just a computer model. It can have different assumptions, and you can tweak that computer model. But this is a powerful, powerful explanation of facts on the ground that we are seeing every day.  Let's look at the facts on the ground. Let's set aside the computer models. Let's even set aside this chart showing temperature rising as the carbon dioxide levels rise.  What do we see in my home State of Oregon? What we see is that we have warmer winters, and those warmer winters mean that the pine beetles don't die off in the same way they do when there is a very cold winter. So they come out, and they attack more trees and more trees are killed. That is damaging to our forests. We see that effect.  What else do we see? We see a change in forest fires. Our forest fire season has grown enormously, by more than 2 months over about the last 40 years. Two months is a big additional portion of the year with fires raging, and the fires have been more intense. Partly, they are more intense simply because the forest is different.  The old-growth forests were more resistant to fire than the second-growth forests, and that is a result of our logging practices. In addition, there is the dryness of the forest. The forest is more dry. Sometimes the wood on the floor of the forest is as dry as a kiln-dried two-by-four. Then we have these weather patterns that involve more lightning, and there are more lightning strikes that are starting fires. So we have drier forests.  We have more lightning strikes. We have more dead trees, and we have more damage from these fires. We see a significant impact on our forest. How about on our farming? Farming depends on water. We have had three worst ever droughts in the Klamath Basin over the last decade and a half--three worst ever droughts. It had a huge impact on ranching in that basin and a huge impact on farming in that basin.  As we see that impact, we realize that on the frontline--on the very frontline--in the battle with rising temperatures is rural America, where we have industries that depend on our natural resources, on our forests, on our fishing, and on our farming.  Let's turn to our fishing for a moment. As the winters have gotten warmer, we have seen that in most winters--not in all but in most winters--the snowpack has been decreasing. What does that do? Partly, it affects farming because you have less water stored in the form of the snowpack, but it also affects the mountain streams. So you have warmer, smaller mountain streams for trout and for salmon.  For those who love to fish in Oregon--and so many people do love to[[Page S1286]]fish in Oregon; in fact, people come from many parts of the world to come and fish in Oregon--you now have streams that are less hospitable for that purpose.  Let's think about what is happening on the coast of On the coast, we are a Pacific Rim We have the vast Pacific Ponder this question. Is it possible that you could burn so much coal and so much oil and so much natural gas in 150 years that you could put so much carbon dioxide into the air, that the ocean could absorb a good share of that, and you could change the chemistry of the ocean?  I have to tell you this. Apologies to my colleague from This is the most beautiful coastline on the planet. You have these incredible mountains dashing into the ocean. You have these gorgeous Pacific waters. You have all kinds of wildlife, all kinds of fishing industry. The Oregon coast is one of the most spectacular places in the world. I must say that, in fairness, I have really enjoyed seeing the Hawaii coastline as well. It is different. It is beautiful and rugged in a different way, but spectacular.  There you are on the coast of Oregon, and you are looking out from those mountains that come crashing into the sea. We have capes--one cape after another. The cape is a big projection of land. You can stand on top of those capes, and you can see out to the horizon of the ocean. You can't see any land. You realize you can only see about 20 miles with the curvature of the Earth, but you know that the ocean goes on and on, far more than a thousand miles. And you say: That is a lot of water. That is an incredible amount of water on the planet It surely can't be possible that we have changed the basic chemistry of the ocean through the burning of carbon dioxide.  Then you talk to the marine biologists who measure what makes up the Pacific Ocean, and they tell you: You know what, the burning of coal and oil and natural gas is changing our ocean in a way that is making it less hospitable to life.  Here is what they are talking about. The ocean through wave action absorbs that carbon dioxide that we have been putting into the In fact, the carbon dioxide level in the air would be much, much higher if it weren't for the oceans pulling a good deal of it out. And then, in the water of the ocean, the carbon dioxide becomes carbonic acid.  When you hear the word ``acid,'' you say: Well, that doesn't sound very good. And you are right. That acid, then, has an impact on the ability of marine organisms to create shells. One specific example of this are the oysters on the Oregon coast. The oysters, as little babies, start to pull molecules out of the water and form shells. If the water is more acidic, it is much more difficult for them to do that, and the result is they die. They put all their energy into that effort. They can't do it. So they die.  In about 2008--the year I was running for office--we had this big die-off of baby oysters in the hatchery on the Oregon coast. It was a big scientific puzzle: What is causing this? What is the virus or the bacterium that is causing this?  The scientists got together, and with a lot of help from Oregon State University, the industry got together and they studied this, and they couldn't find that there was a virus causing this action. They started looking for a bacterium. Well, they looked. They didn't find that either.  What else could it be? It has to be one disease agent or another. It turned out that it wasn't a disease agent. It was the increasing acidity of the Pacific  Now, this morning, the owner of that hatchery happened to be coming through DC and came to my ``Good Morning Oregon'' reception. I hold this every Thursday morning that I am here. People can show up. We have a little bit of good Oregon coffee and a warm chance to reacquaint ourselves with old friends and to hear what folks who are visiting are thinking. He said to me this morning: Buffering is now continuous.  What did he mean by that? What he meant was, when they discovered it was the acidity that was killing the baby oysters, they had to start taking this seawater--they have a big pipe that pulls seawater up into the oyster hatchery, and they have another pipe that recirculates it back into the ocean. They had to start artificially reducing the acidity of the seawater so the baby oysters could thrive. What he said this morning is: We now have to buffer continuously. The condition has become so bad, it is bad on any given day. So that is where we are.  If the acidity of the ocean has changed from the burning of coal and oil and natural gas, isn't it time for us to wake up and pay attention? Isn't it time for us, as the stewards of the environment here in terms of making laws, to be paying attention? Shouldn't we be thinking again about those words that President Richard Nixon said when he created the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970; that we all ``share a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment.''  How are we going to rescue our natural environment from the harm of burning fossil fuels if we keep burning fossil fuels? That is the question before us, and the answer is that we can't. We have to stop.  We have to, in a modest period of time, a rather short period of time--really, in the course of human civilization, just a microsecond of time--we have to move from burning fossil fuels to basing our economy on energy from clean and renewable sources. We have to do this very conscientiously. We have to do it through grassroots action. We have to do it through a framework that we create here at the national level. Both are powerful. Let's do both.  In the middle of that is the Environmental Protection That is why it is so important that we have a Director of the EPA who is committed to the vision of rescuing our natural environment, and that is why we need to have access to these thousands of emails before we vote in the U. I think that as we consider this, we need to ponder that the conditions we see in Oregon--that are derived from global warming, increasing temperatures--are not simply happening in my I used those examples because I come from I represent You can see these things right where I am, but you can look across our Nation, you can look across our planet, and see the effects everywhere.  If you take the 100 largest glaciers in the world and track their average retreat, it is dramatic. There are those, by the way, who say if you want to see a glacier at Glacier National Park, you better go soon because a number of glaciers in Glacier National Park have retreated substantially.  You can go to other parts of the country and see other impacts. For example, if you go to the Northeast, you have the challenge--just like the pine needles aren't being killed in the winter, the ticks aren't being killed, and the ticks are infesting the moose, and the moose are dying because you have these big clumps of ticks sucking the blood from the adults and from the babies. The list goes on.  Our colleague from Maine says: We are concerned about our lobsters. Our lobsters are migrating up the coast to find a temperature of water that used to be in Maine, and now they are moving north toward  You can talk to those who track insects, like certain types of mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus, and their range is spreading. There is an insect called a sandfly that thrives in Central America, that is starting to show up in the United States of America because the temperature is changing, and that sandfly carries a disease called leishmania. This disease basically is extraordinarily difficult to cure, and it is a single-cell parasite. When you get bit by a sandfly, you get an enormous number, if it is an infected sandfly, of these parasites that start eating a hole either in your organs or in your skin--very difficult to cure.  As I describe this, I am just touching the surface. I haven't talked about the Great Barrier Reef, much of which has died over the last couple of years off Australia, and the list goes on and on.  So to close, we need a Director of the Environmental Protection Agency who has that profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment, and the preservation of the Earth as a place habitable by and hospitable to humankind.

3064,topic-id,1540,"Mr.President, citizens across the country are very concerned. In fact, they are more than concerned; they are terrified that our President is degrading the fundamental values on which our Nation was founded: religious tolerance, freedom of religion, the ability to worship as you please, and a fundamental principle that we would be welcoming to refugees, that we would be a nation that embraces immigrants.  Tonight Lady Liberty is crying. She said, ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,'' but our President has slammed the door on the tired and the poor and the huddled masses. It is an action the citizens in my home State have come out to protest. They have gone to the airport in Portland en masse 2 days in a row to say that we are welcoming to the world, that we are not going to slam the door shut on refugees, that we are not going to single out Muslim nations and say: We do not want you here.  Indeed, I held two townhalls over the weekend. The first was in a gymnasium about this size. There were 600 people jammed into it. They are very upset and angry that our fundamental values are being disregarded by the President of the United Then I went to my second townhall. I thought 600 was a lot; there were 3,700 Oregonians who came out to my second townhall. Every one of them is wanting to send a message to President Trump: You are taking us on the wrong road--a road that hurts people around the world, a road that hurts our fundamental values, and a road that decreases our security.  This Executive order, this Executive action from the President has had an[[Page S472]]immediate and painful impact--hundreds of people en route to our country detained at airports although they were legally traveling here. Many of them have been vetted on extended periods, some of them going through several years of vetting, and finally they have in their hand that visa that says, yes, I am going to have a country, and it is going to be the United States of And the President crushed that hope.  Chaos and confusion abounded. Lawyers and protesters and advocates descended on airports everywhere across this country to tell the administration that there is no mandate, no public will for this path that is so destructive to our values. They came out to say: Mr.President, when you tear down women in America, we stand with the women of Mr.President, when you tear down the disabled, we stand with the disabled of Mr.President, when you tear down African Americans and Hispanics, we stand with African Americans and And, Mr.President, when you tear down Muslims, we stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters because this is the United States of America, where we value religious freedom, where we value religious tolerance. This is a nation of immigrants. If you are not 100 percent Native American, then you are either an immigrant yourself or you are the child or the grandchild or the great-grandchild of an immigrant. Most of us can track members of our family who came from the ravages of war or the ravages of drought or the ravages of oppression to come here to this soil, this land of freedom. James Madison remarked: ``America was indebted to immigration for her settlement and for her prosperity.'' This remains just as true today as it was in Madison's day.  Here we stand, but the President of the United States has denied access to our Nation to a group of people based on nothing more than religious beliefs, betraying our values of religious tolerance and shutting the doors on refugees. The President has said this is not a ban on those of the Muslim faith, but of course it is a ban on those of Muslim faith because it is a ban on seven nations that are Muslim nations, with an exception made for individuals who are Christians so it is nothing more than a ban on  The President says this is about protecting our citizens, but let us be very clear about that. Numerous refugees have come to our land, numerous immigrants, and there have been zero fatal terror attacks carried out by the immigrants from the seven countries listed in the order. We have been attacked by individuals from other countries which are not listed in the order, from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Those nations aren't listed on this order. What we do know is that this ban does not make our Nation safer. National security experts recognize that it does exactly the opposite. By signing this Executive order, the President has betrayed our most fundamental values and principles, antagonizing 1.6 billion citizens of the world, and given our enemies ammunition for their false narrative that America is at war with Islam because that is exactly what they have used to recruit. That is exactly what they have used to increase and pour fuel on the fire to persuade people to attack The President has basically handed them this argument--this false narrative--and put our Nation at risk.  Former CIA Director Michael Hayden said to National Public Radio this morning, ``In fact, what we're doing now has probably made us less safe today than we were Friday morning before this happened, because we are now living the worst jihadist narrative possible, that there is undying enmity between Islam and the West.''  I share the value of Daniel Benjamin, the former Coordinator for Counterterrorism at the State Department, who said this: ``It sends an unmistakable message to the American Muslim community that they are facing discrimination and isolation,'' and that message, he said, will ``feed the jihadist narrative that the United States is at war with Islam, potentially encouraging a few more Muslims to plot violence.''  This is the wrong move in every possible way. It is ill-considered, it is hasty, it is dangerous, it is wrongheaded, it puts American citizens at risk, and it helps our enemies. Benjamin Franklin once said: ``Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.'' In this case, President Trump's Executive order has degraded both our liberty and our security--both our liberty and our safety.  We have turned our backs on friends and allies who are helping us in the war against The President has made it clear that he wants to take on ISIS as we had been, but he wants to amplify it, and he has sabotaged that effort with this Executive order.  There are individuals like Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who worked for more than a decade for the United States as an interpreter in Our interpreters place their lives at risk to assist our soldiers. They place the lives of their families at risk to assist the United States of This man risked his life for more than 10 years for us, and how is he greeted when he arrives here in our country? He is greeted with handcuffs. Muslim Iraqi interpreters like Mr.Darweesh have earned the right to come to They risked their lives and their family's lives. They assisted us in multitudinous ways.  What about this ban on refugees? Refugees are the most thoroughly vetted of all those who come to the United If a terrorist wants to come to the United States, a terrorist wouldn't attempt to come as a refugee. It would be 1 to 2 years of waiting in miserable conditions in a refugee camp, with all kinds of vetting, and they might never get permission to come. If you want intense vetting, then look to how we vet refugees. Blocking women and children and interpreters from coming to our country who have been the most thoroughly vetted of all potential immigrants is simply wrong. In fact, the model for vetting refugees is intense. Women and orphans are just searching for a safe haven, but we have turned our back and we have slammed the door.  America is better than this. For centuries we have been a beacon of hope to the world. We have been a beacon of justice, a beacon of compassion, and we must restore our Nation as a beacon of hope, justice, liberty, and compassion.  Millions of Americans are coming out in the snow and the rain and in some places in good weather. They are coming out in any possible conditions to speak out and say: This is not This is not us. Change paths. Tear down this ban. Tear down this ban that has slammed the door on refugees. Tear down this ban which has placed our Nation at risk.  Let us together put our Nation back on track. Let us together fight for the values that made America great for the last two centuries. Let us together fight for the richness of our culture and our community, the strength of our society that comes from being a nation of immigrants. We need to act and act urgently.

2839,topic-id,577,"Mr.President, although the time of this administration is short and the inauguration of a new President is now just weeks away, the Obama administration isn't coming to a quiet ending. From issuing controversial regulations to transferring unprecedented numbers of detainees from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, the outgoing administration has repeatedly acted in direct opposition to the bipartisan will of Congress and to the values of many American people. The clearest examples of this are the recent American actions at the United Nations Security Council, performed at the expense of Israel, an American ally and strategic partner in the Middle  This December, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said:       Decades of political maneuvering have created a      disproportionate number of resolutions, reports and      committees against In many cases, instead of helping      the Palestinian issue, this reality has foiled the ability of      the UN to fulfill its role effectively.  The U.N.'s anti-Israel bias was evident on December 23 when the Security Council sought to pass a resolution targeting American representatives abstained from voting on the deliberately anti-Israel resolution. The refusal to defend Israel is a departure from longstanding bipartisan policy of the United States and, in fact, a departure from the standards of the Obama administration.  Just days later, this decision to abstain was aggravated by comments made by Secretary of State In a speech that sought to defend the Obama administration's diplomacy, the Secretary's one-sided lecture further criticized With so many grave and immediate foreign policy challenges concurrently facing the Obama administration and facing our country, the Secretary's decision to devote his final days at the State Department to criticism of Israel is difficult to understand.  The President's party has suffered staggering electoral defeats during his time in office. Much of that can be attributed to the championing of policies[[Page S23]]at odds with much of his own party and the American people at large. This case is no different. The Obama administration's decision defies the bipartisan directive of 88 Members of this Senate who wrote the President on this issue in September of 2016.  Fortunately, today marks the first day of the 115th On January 20, we will inaugurate a new We will have to work overtime to correct the direction of these American policies.

To this effort, I am introducing a resolution that recognizes the importance of Israel as a strategic ally, reiterates that Congress's bipartisan support for Israel continues, and objects to the Obama administration's decision and harmful public commentary related to the December 23 U.Security Council vote.  The opening of the 115th Congress and the inauguration of a new President create opportunities to improve our relations, the relationship between the United States and America's alliance with Israel is critical to combating the threat of peace in the Middle East and to our own national security. It is my hope we can seize the opportunity to better stand by our ally and continue to encourage peace and cooperation between Israelis and  I believe this resolution is an important step in repairing the relations the Obama administration has unnecessarily strained, and I hope to have the opportunity to vote on this measure in the Senate in the coming weeks.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgS22-2.txt,1507,OBAMACARE,2017.0,3.0,January

His outstanding career as a player at both institutions earned him a place in the Wilbur Cross Athletic Hall ofFame, and his experience as a standout guard on the UConn football team in 1956 and 1957 helped forge a lasting commitment tohis alma mater and shaped the ethic of teamwork and dedication that would follow him to the Connecticut State  Firstelected to the senate in 1992, Joe's commitment to his constituents and his community has never wavered. It is no exaggerationto say that his district would not be what it is today if not for the many grants and public projects he has been responsiblefor bringing home, from recreational centers and trails, to libraries, animal shelters, and affordable housing. The 17thdistrict's most important institutions--like Griffin Hospital, Quinnipiac University, the Sterling Opera House, the Troop IBarracks of the Connecticut State Police, the former Bethany Airport, and the Metro-North Waterbury branch line--have always hada dedicated friend and advocate in And the annual senior fair in Ansonia's Warsaw Park, which Joe ran throughout hisservice in the senate, has provided assistance to thousands of senior citizens over the years and become an iconic event in theNaugatuck  But more than simply serving the people in his district, Joe distinguished himself in the ConnecticutGeneral Assembly as one of its most effective and hard-working legislators. He served as chair of the Appropriations Committeeand the Insurance & Real Estate Committee and had a hand in some of the most important legislation in a generation to supportConnecticut's economy and the welfare of its citizens. He led the creation of the Biomedical Research Fund, which has devotedmillions of dollars towards research efforts in the State to fight heart disease, cancer, smoking-related illnesses,Alzheimer's, stroke, and diabetes. He championed investment tax credits for economic development and public safety, secured acost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries of the ConnPACE Program for seniors, and fought passionately to expand the reach ofhealth insurance coverage. After only 6 years in the senate, Joe pioneered the founding of Family Day; an initiative close tohis heart as a father of 6 and grandfather of 18. And the legacy he leaves with his lifesaving work to improve and expandcoverage for breast cancer exams, creating a new international standard for insurance coverage, is a special achievement ofwhich Joe should be particularly proud.  I am also personally thankful for Joe's dedication to his position in the generalassembly because I have seen it up close.

2977,topic-id,3536,"Mr.President, I want to talk about an upcoming CRA that will be on the floor potentially this week that would cancel out an important regulation that is designed to build upon this country's history of making sure there is a marriage between civil rights and education to make sure that children in this country, regardless of their race, regardless of their learning ability, regardless of their religion, regardless of their income, get an equal chance at education.  Frankly, the whole reason the Federal Government is involved in the question of education is due to civil rights. This used to be a purely local concern, and the Federal Government stepped into the question of local education because Black kids throughout the South were not getting an equal education. They were living in segregated schools and getting an education that was of far lesser quality. So the Federal Government has always been involved in education because it is a matter of civil rights.  I want to talk about this issue through the prism of one individual. I am going to call him James, but this is a true story--a story, frankly, that could be told millions of times over across the country.  James went to school in an urban district in He was a 10th grader. At the beginning of James's 10th grade year, he had a habit of walking out of class. In the middle of class, he would just get up and walk out after 10 or 15 or 20 minutes, and he would wander the halls of this big, urban high school until inevitably he was met by a security officer or a teacher or an administrator. They would bring him down to the office, and they would call his grandmother, as he lived with her. He would get suspended for a couple of days, and then he would come back.  It played out so often--this cycle of James walking out of class, being brought down to the principal's office, being suspended--that somewhere around the end of October, during his sophomore year, he had been out of school more days than he had been in school.  One day, though, James goes through this cycle again. He is in the hallway, and he runs into an assistant principal. He is sort of sick and tired of this story playing out over and over again. He raises his voice. He has some words. James has never hurt anybody in his life, no history of violence, but the assistant principal decides to call the police. The police come and they arrest James for disorderly conduct, essentially for having words with an assistant principal. Now James, at 16 years old, has a criminal record. At the time, he was treated as an adult in Connecticut, so he has an adult criminal record.  It turns out that James was walking out of class every day because he couldn't read, and he was mortified. He was embarrassed because he had been socially promoted through the years. He had a learning disability that was going untreated, and he was in the 10th grade with the ability to only read at an elementary school level. No wonder he was walking out of class every day. He literally couldn't follow along. It was embarrassing. He didn't want to be called on by the teacher so he left. Nobody ever figured that out until he got arrested and finally got a legal aid lawyer, who happened to be my wife, who identified his disability and the fact that it was being unaddressed.[[Page S1684]]  The fact is, a big part of this story is tied up in the fact that James was Black, and he was a big kid. So the police got calls maybe because he appeared to be threatening in a way that he simply was not. I can say that because the data backs up the fact that Black kids and disabled kids are treated very differently in schools today. Wherever you are, whether in Connecticut, in North Carolina, or in California, Black kids--especially Black boys--are suspended and expelled at a rate that is twice that of their White peers for the exact same behavior. Take mouthing off to a teacher. When that happens, Black kids, Black students, are twice as likely to be suspended for mouthing off to a teacher than a White student.  James's story is not unique. It is not unique because it happens in every State across the country, and it is not just in suspension and expulsion rates, it is also in achievement rates as well. We know the statistics. The graduation rate for African-American students is 16 percent lower than their White peers. I can go down the line and tell you about the different story when it comes to achievement and treatment of African-American students as compared to White students.  Racism isn't gone in this country. It might not be overt. Sometimes it might not even be conscious, but it is still there. Discrimination against kids who are different, whether they be poor or disabled, didn't vanish. It is still all over.  John Lewis is a civil rights icon. We celebrate him every day, Republicans and Democrats, in the U.He got mercilessly beaten over the head simply because he wanted to vote. John Lewis is still alive, but you know what, so are the people who beat him. We are only a generation removed from an era of open, unapologetic racism in this country. To think that we don't need civil rights protections for kids any longer is to deny reality. Racism doesn't look the same as it used to. Discrimination against kids who are different isn't as overt as it used to be, but the data is the data. It is still there.  No Child Left Behind got a lot wrong, but one of the things it got right was that it shed a light on this disparate treatment, these disparate outcomes between Black students, Hispanic students, disabled students, and their peers, because it forced States--and this was a Republican and Democratic accomplishment at the time--it forced States to disaggregate results. So you had to look at how were disabled students doing, how were Black students doing, and if they weren't measuring up and if they weren't getting closer to the performance of their nondisabled or White peers, then you had to do something to turn those students around, turn their performance around.  Now, the part that No Child Left Behind got wrong is big and significant. Part of it is that it required every single one of those kids to hit the 100-percent proficiency mark, when progress is important to measure as well. It also told States exactly what to do to turn around the experiences of those kids. It is not the same in Connecticut as it is in North Carolina, and it is not the same in an urban district as it is in a suburban district. So when we got together on this floor and passed, in a bipartisan way, the new Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we did something really important. We preserved those requirements to disaggregate results for Black kids and for Hispanic kids and for kids with disabilities, but then we left it up to States to decide what proficiency is, and we left it up to States as to how they would turn around the experience for these kids if they weren't meeting those State-set goals. We gave an enormous amount of discretion and flexibility to States, but we preserved the basic expectation that our education policy was still going to be civil rights policy: Pay attention to how those vulnerable populations with a history of discrimination levied against them performed and require States to pay attention to the interventions.  That was a bipartisan achievement, and when we did it, we knew the regulation was going to be needed because, as with many education statutes, they are very vague. Republicans and Democrats understood that there was going to have to be a regulation to provide some clarity to States on how you build these locally driven accountability systems.  So the regulation we are talking about here today was not one of these that came out of left field. It was not one of these regulations that was political in nature; no, it flows from a bipartisan act that preserved accountability requirements for kids.  It is important for a variety of reasons. One, it is important because there are some really vague terms in the statute that do need clarification. For instance, one of the things we voted for, Republicans and Democrats, is we voted to say you have to show that you are providing improvement for African-American students, let's say, and if they are not showing continuous improvement, then you have to have a turnaround plan. By the way, that turnaround plan is totally yours to decide; no sanctions from the Federal Government if it is not X turnaround plan or Y turnaround plan. That is the old law. The new law says it is yours to decide.  ``Continuous improvement'' is a super vague term. It is one of those obvious terms that has to have some regulatory guardrails put around it because what if the State said ``continuous improvement'' is improvement over 20 years. Well, kids come in and out of schools in 2 or 3 or 4 years and a 20-year period of looking at a particular subgroup's performance is meaningless to kids.  So the regulation says continuous improvement means 2 years; look at how a kid does over 2 years. And then it says, if 2 years doesn't work for you, you can make it longer but just tell us why. That is an important protection, and it still preserves enormous flexibility for  States want this regulation because it also gives them other types of flexibilities. An example is, when you are looking at performance, the statute suggests that you can have students who are meeting goal or students who are not meeting goal. The regulation recognizes that is, frankly, a really arbitrary way to look at performance. So the statute says: Yes, that is what the regulation says. The statute says: Meeting goal and not meeting goal, but you can get extra credit for students who are close to meeting goal, who have shown growth. You can get credit for students who are way above goal, your high-achieving students. You don't have to measure your schools just based on how many students meet goal. That is flexibility States want, that they likely don't have without the regulation.  Another example, for English language learners, proficiency goals should vary based on where you started. If you start here with no English skills, then your proficiency target should be different than if you started with a pretty advanced understanding of the language. The statute just says you have to have a proficiency goal. It is unclear whether you can have different ones for different levels of learners. The regulation makes it clear: Give States that flexibility.  So that is why States didn't ask for this This is different than these other States didn't ask for this All of the educational groups we listened to--teachers, superintendents, principals--they weighed in on this regulation. They didn't love every piece of it, but they were ready to implement it. None of these groups were coming up to the Congress asking for this regulation to be withdrawn. Would they have liked it to be fixed or tailored? But here is what they understood, and here is why I am really concerned.  Secretary DeVos could fix the things she doesn't like or Senator Alexander doesn't like through the regular notice and comment period. I think there is 80 percent of this regulation that everybody agrees on, that just dots the i's and crosses the t's on a bipartisan commitment to accountability, and maybe there is 20 percent or 10 percent that Senator Alexander and some other Members think goes a little bit too far, but when you pass a CRA, you don't allow for a regulation to be passed in the future that is substantially similar to the entirety of the regulation. The courts aren't going to look, or, frankly, even know, what parts of the regulation you didn't like and the 80 percent of the regulation you wanted to preserve.  The Department of Education can't pass anything that is similar to this[[Page S1685]]ever again. So one of the things the regulation says is that you get a 1-year delay because it is just too quick to come up with accountability systems for this coming school year. That is gone. When this CRA passes, every school district in the Nation has to develop an accountability system for this calendar year because without the regulation, you don't have that flexibility.  So what makes me, frankly, so disturbed about this CRA is that it could happen another way, which would preserve the pieces of the civil rights protections that all of us agree on, which is the majority of the regulation. To my mind, it violated the spirit of our agreement when we passed this law. Here was a really amazing achievement; that we were able to rewrite the No Child Left Behind law--essentially repeal it and replace it with something better--that Democrats and Republicans could agree upon. In my mind, that agreement was predicated upon the Department being able to enforce maybe the most important part of the law for big constituency groups in this country--the accountability section, the civil rights protections.  By passing this CRA, we are essentially making it impossible for any regulation ever again to be passed to implement the accountability sections and the civil rights protections in this law. Why? Because you can't pass anything that is substantially similar--substantially similar to the parts you like, substantially similar to the parts you don't like. This isn't like these other CRAs where Republicans didn't like any part of it, where Republicans didn't see any need for the regulation to go forward. This is different. We agree on 80 percent of this one, but the 80 percent is likely gone by passing this.  I guess part of what disturbs me here is that we worked, locked arm in arm, in passing this law. I really do believe that by passing this CRA, Republican leadership--HELP leadership--is violating the agreement we had to make sure this law went into force and effect in the way we all intended.  It happened in the context of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that isn't working this year like it used to work. I have such great respect for the chairman and the ranking member of that committee. They pulled off some big bipartisan wins during the time of their tenure, including the Workforce Investment Act, the rewrite of the No Child Left Behind Act, and some other smaller wins that people didn't necessarily think as much about, and leading up to the end of last year, the passage of a major new commitment to reforming mental illness and mental health in this country.  That spirit of bipartisanship, which was present in the HELP Committee in a way that it wasn't present in other committees, is disappearing before our eyes. We were mad that we only got 5 minutes to question Betsy DeVos because it felt like the committee was hiding her from public view. Democrats were asking for more time to ask more questions, and we didn't get it. That rarely happens in that committee, where the minority party is just asking to be heard and is shut down.  We begged for the CRA not to come before this body because there was another way to get it done that didn't violate the spirit of our agreement around the rewrite of the No Child Left Behind law, but we were denied in that request. Now we are voting on a CRA that is potentially going to be devastating not just for kids out there who need protection but also for States that want this flexibility.  Finally, we are on a schedule, according to the majority leader, that is going to bring a healthcare bill that will rewrite the rules for one-sixth of the American economy to the floor of the Senate without any debate in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, without a single hearing on the bill, without a markup, and without any ability for amendment.  I listened for 6 years to my Republican friends tell me that the healthcare bill, or the Affordable Care Act, was rammed through Congress and that the biggest problem was the fact that it was done outside of the public view for expediency's sake. Now, I was there in the House of Representatives, and let me express the unbelievable irony of those complaints now that there will be no process for the committees to consider the replacement to the Affordable Care  The House and the Senate had hundreds--hundreds--of meetings and hearings. The HELP Committee alone--I don't have the numbers in front of me--considered hundreds of amendments and adopted over 100 Republican amendments in the markup process. The Senate's session was the second longest in the history of the Senate, in for more than 20 days debating that bill. The reason there was so much tempest out in the American public over the Affordable Care Act was because it was open for debate for so long.  The Finance Committee had a full process. The HELP Committee had a full process. The Ways and Means Committee had a full process. The Energy and Commerce Committee had a full process.  None of that is happening here. This bill is being jammed through, as we speak, the Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce This bill is going to be jammed onto the floor, perhaps without any committee process, in the The target is from introduction Monday to passage in the House in 3 weeks and perhaps just a few more weeks before it passes the So spare me the complaints about the Affordable Care Act being rushed into place when this process is going to make that look laborious in comparison.  What pains me is not just this CRA, which is unnecessary, but it doesn't have to happen this way. What pains me is a committee process that when I got here had a reputation for being truly bipartisan, for being one of the more functional, if not the most functional, committee processes. That is being blown up most significantly by the rush job--the rush job on the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, which nobody in the American public is going to have enough time to look at it and see it.  I ask my colleagues one more time to reconsider their votes on this We are at our best when we come together around the idea that every kid in this country should have a chance at a quality education, no matter what color their skin is, no matter what their learning ability is. I know my colleagues have a couple problems with this regulation. I get it. But by passing this CRA, the regulation is gone and never coming back, and the States that want the flexibility, that are begging for the flexibility, won't get it. It will just be an unworkable section of the bill. A section that was supposed to be bipartisan now fundamentally won't work because we can't get a regulation passed that is at all substantially similar to the good parts or to the bad parts.  This body is at its best when we stand together--Republicans and Democrats--and say that no matter what you look like, no matter how well you learn, no matter how much money you have, you get a quality education. We did that when we voted together on ESSA, and we are going back on that bipartisan commitment by passing a CRA that is unnecessary. As to the bad stuff you don't like, it can be gone in a matter of months by a regular process of notice and comment in the Department of  This is part of a disturbing new trend line in this committee toward partisanship and away from a history of commitment to our kids--Republican and  I yield the floor.

3003,topic-id,1789,"Mr.President, I am on the floor to speak in favor of the pending business before the Senate--to allow for Montenegro to join NATO as a new member. I have been a proponent of this move for a long time, having spent time in Montenegro and having chaired for a period of time the Europe and Regional Security Cooperation Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee, now serving Senator Johnson as his ranking member.  I am convinced that NATO will be stronger if Montenegro joins. I am convinced that our alliance will be stronger if Montenegro joins. It is a small country with a very small military, but it occupies an incredibly important space on the world map. It is the only part of the Adriatic coast that breaks up the current NATO map, and it will provide a strengthening of our alliance in that region.  Montenegro is ready. It has made significant progress on internal reform, especially in the area of the rule of law and security sector reform. The Ministry of Defense has met all of the requirements for NATO membership. It is moving to modernize its military. It is moving to try to operationalize itself in a way that it can interact with both U.and European equipment. It is replacing its aircraft that previously had required Russian spare parts so that they are more compatible with European and American air equipment. There is still work that Montenegro needs to do, but now it can continue under the umbrella of the alliance.  I am very happy that we are taking an important step here to signal that NATO's open-door policy is still in practice. I think there was some doubt, frankly, and some concern, after years and years of Montenegro's desire to join amidst the interest from Georgia and prior to the crisis in Ukraine, that some of these transatlantic institutions were closing down. This is a sign that NATO is not only viable but is still open to those countries that want to join, that want to find additional safety and security under our umbrella. I am glad we are going to have a bipartisan vote here in favor of Montenegro's joining  I want to make a broader point about our future policy in the It was[[Page S2034]]not that long ago that it was a precondition, if you were a Member of Congress, to be an expert on the The United States was at war in the Balkans, as were Russia and our European allies. It was the hottest spot on the globe. Thanks to U.military might as well as diplomatic might, the Dayton Peace Accords brought peace and relative economic prosperity to a region of the globe that has been, frankly, at the center of almost every major conflict in and around Europe over the greater part of the last 100 years. It is a moment to celebrate this period of political and security stability in the Balkans and to remember that we should not take it for granted. There are still festering ethnic and nationalist tensions that play out every day in the We see them in small ways.  When I was there, a drone with a map of greater Albania dropped down into the middle of a football match between the Serbian national team and the Albanian national team, which was a deliberate attempt to inflame the It seemed like a small thing, but it resulted in the cancelation of a historic meeting between the Prime Minister of Albania and the Prime Minister of  Just recently, we have seen some breakdown in the progress Serbia and Kosovo had been making to try to resolve their differences, resulting ultimately, we hope--we believe--in the recognition of Kosovo's statehood by the Serbian Government, which is a reminder that bringing Montenegro into NATO is important for the alliance's sake, but it is also an important step in continuing to make investments in security in the  It is important for a second reason in that there is another player out there that is desperately trying to make the Balkans less stable, and that is For a very long time, Russia has had legitimate interests in the They have relations with the people of the Balkan nations, as well as with those governments, but today they have an interest in trying to destabilize that region, to create a crisis for Europe, to create a crisis for  As we all know, Russia fills vacuums of power better than almost any other player out there. Whether or not we like it, as Members of the Senate, there is an enormous vacuum in the world right now that is created by the withdrawal of Without a robust State Department, without coherent U.foreign policy, we are just not players in the world today like we were a year ago. Example A may be the Balkan region.  The Balkans require attention because there are these simmering potential conflicts, and the United States has been a force for good but in ways that most Americans probably do not even know. It required the constant attention from Vice President Biden, Secretary of State Kerry, and Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland to make sure that the Balkans--in particular, the western Balkans--continued their move toward Europe and rejected offers from Russia for a different kind of alignment. Weekly big and small interventions allowed the Balkan nations to feel comfort in a future with Europe and with the United That intervention, that attention, has, frankly, just disappeared, and the Russians have filled that vacuum.  There was a coup attempt in You do not see a lot of coup attempts these days in countries in and around Europe, but there was an attempt to storm the Parliament--an attempt that has been connected to Russian nationals. Those Russian nationals, according to Montenegro, have connections directly with the Russian That has not been confirmed yet, but it is incredibly disturbing to know that Russian nationals were behind an attempted military coup inside  We have seen a much tighter joining of the leaders of the Republika Srpska and Russian interests and operatives in a move toward a referendum for independence in the Republika Srpska, which is a component of Bosnia and It looks suspiciously like the kind of independence referendums that have threatened to take place in parts of Ukraine and Luhansk and  There are reports that the same players who are trying to fund and operationalize independent referendums in Ukraine are also at work inside Serbia--players with connections back to the  There are reports of a massive increase in Russian media presence in the Balkans--more offers from Russian TV stations and radio stations to provide free content to cash-strapped Balkan media outlets.  There are over 100 different nonprofit organizations in Serbia alone, according to one report, that have financial connections back in and through  Russia is filling this vacuum in the It is trying to win friends and trying to create an instability that ultimately would land at the doorstep of NATO, at the doorstep of Europe, and at the doorstep of the United They are filling that vacuum because we do not have a presence there today.  Secretary Tillerson has no meaningful experience in the He has no Deputy and he has no Assistant Secretary for the When you pair that next to a proposal that Secretary Tillerson endorses cutting his budget by 40 percent, you will make America relatively feckless in that region because it is those funds that the administration is seeking to cut that are often our linkages to influence.  In Belgrade, our Ambassador has made enormous progress with a small amount of money for exchange programs. You look at people in powerful positions in Serbia today, and many of them are close to the United States because they have participated in State Department exchange programs. They have spent time here in the United States getting to know our country, maybe getting educated here, and they have gone back to Serbia to be part of the government in order to represent Serbian interests but with a connection to the United States and to the West that is important. Those exchange programs are basically eviscerated by a 40-percent cut. They will not exist any longer. It is a very small program, but it has not only gotten us important results in the Balkans, it has contributed to our ability to argue for stability and to argue for the calming of tensions because it gets doors opened for the United  Without anybody being on call for the State Department in the Balkans, without any funding in order to try to promote stability and economic connections between those countries, we cede ground to Russia every single day. Russia sees vacuums, and they fill them, and we have created them. We have created a vacuum globally, but we have created a specific vacuum in the It is filled in part by this movement to join Montenegro with  I do appreciate the fact that Secretary Tillerson, I believe, and Secretary Mattis have both recommended to this body that we take up this matter. I think that was important, and I applaud them for standing against the recommendations of the Russian Government and for the accession of Montenegro into NATO, but it is not enough.  I wanted to come to this floor--and I see my great friend and colleague from Ohio, who is ready to speak--to make the case as to why this is so important and to make the case that as Russia tries to view Montenegro as an opportunity to establish a Kaliningrad on the Mediterranean, we can prevent its happening with this vote and with the vote of our European allies to join Montenegro with NATO, but it is not enough. We have to remember that stability in the Balkans is nothing to be taken for granted. The next global crisis may come from a small act of tension between neighbors that spins out of control, in part because the United States is not paying attention and because Russian intervention in the region, which is bigger and broader now than ever before, has an interest not in stability but actually ultimately in instability.  I thank Leader McConnell for bringing this before the body. This is a chance for us to join together in supporting Montenegro as it joins Hopefully, there will be more opportunities for us to work together to make sure that this administration, to make sure that our country has a comprehensive policy to continue to build on the NATO peace accords and double down on the work we do to promote long-term stability and prosperity in the Balkan region.[[Page S2035]]  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2032-2.txt,1837,CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF LOUISE HOPKINS UNDERWOOD,2017.0,28.0,March
3071,topic-id,3948,"Mr.President, there is a French farmer by the name of Hector John de He immigrated to the United States from Normandy, France, in 1759, and he settled in the Hudson He married an American woman. The astounding diversity of those who settled around him, his fellow farmers, was shocking to him. He said: It is ``a mixture of English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Germans, and Swedes.''  There was one family he knew who had an English grandfather, a Dutch grandmother, an Anglo-Saxon son who had a French wife, whose four sons all married women who were from different places of different nationalities. Hector said: ``From this promiscuous breed, that race now called Americans has arisen.''  He asked: ``What then is the American, this new man?''  This farmer who came to America from Normandy in 1759 wrote this:       He is an American, who leaving behind him all his ancient      prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode      of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the      new rank he holds. The American is the new man who acts upon      new principles. . . . Here individuals of all nations are      melted into a new race of men.  George Washington told us that the bosom of America is open to the oppressed and the persecuted of all nations and religions.  That great American philosopher, Alexis de Tocqueville, that observer of American life, said in a letter:       Imagine, my dear friend, if you can, a society formed of      all the nations of the world . . . people having different      languages, beliefs, opinions: in a word, a society without      roots, without memories, without prejudices, without      routines, without common ideas, without a national character,      yet a hundred times happier than our own.  I am not sure if any of those are completely accurate descriptions of what an American was or is or whether those are commensurate with our understanding as to the foundations of this country, but they speak to this founding ideal of America, this place where you could come from any part of the world with any set of beliefs, with any religion, with any skin color, and become something that is uniquely new.  There were people here before those who traveled from far-off lands, but to be an American is in many ways an invention--an invention of the amalgamation of faiths of peoples from all over the world.  Both Hector and de Tocqueville talk about the leaving behind of prejudices when you come to this new country. Inherent in that idea is this belief of new Americans that the discrimination they faced in other places could be washed away upon coming to a country, a land at that time in which everyone was equal, everyone started from the same place. Of course, that has to be true because this country was founded by individuals who were fleeing religious persecution, who thought that America was a place in which they could practice their religion freely. They could be who they knew themselves to be.  The reason why you hear such anxiety and anger and sadness from many in this Chamber and from many people we represent is because what happened on Friday is an abandonment of American originalism. It is a walking back of the faith that we have held since the days in which Scotch and Irish and French and Dutch and German and Swede came to this country believing that they could leave behind prejudices. It feels as if we are shrinking as a country before our eyes.  A young woman from Stamford, CT, wrote me this beautiful letter, and I want to read some of it to you. She encapsulates in modern language what Crevecoeur, Washington, and de Tocqueville were saying centuries ago. She said:       I am the proud descendant of Syrian immigrants. My great-     grandparent's sacrifices to resettle in Rhode Island have      shaped my entire life. I've grown up very close to my      grandfather, the first generation of his family born in      America, and I know what my ancestors did to be here and      how far we've come from them being persecuted and      subjected to religious violence in I was able to      grow up around Syrian culture and appreciate how great-     grandparents made it possible for my entire family to be      where they are now.       To give you an idea, my grandfather went on to receive a      master's degree and was a high school teacher and guidance      counselor. He is also heavily involved in the Roman Catholic      church and quietly serves communion in hospitals each      My father, second generation, also received a master's,      serves on hospital boards, and has had a successful career in      human resources. With their encouragement, I have begun a      career as a journalist, one I have dreamed of since I was in      high school.       In 2012, on the 100-year anniversary of my family's arrival      in the United States, I was the third generation in my family      to graduate from high school and enroll in college. . . . I      tell you this because this moves me every day when I go to      work. How amazing it is that my family has gone from being      persecuted for their religion to being able to hold jobs      protected by the First Amendment? Surely, this is something      my great-grandparents never could've dreamed of when they      came here, and I embrace my career with the intention to      honor their sacrifices. . . . Recently, my heart broke at the      executive order to suspend the entry of refugees,      specifically from I have looked into this extensively      and recently worked on a story about the vetting process. . .      . Trump's order is nothing but xenophobic and racist. I was      preparing to report on a family that was supposed to be      coming to a community near me, but it seems that family won't      be coming now. How truly American it would've been for the      descendant of Syrian immigrants to welcome a new generation      of Syrians into this country.  This is for many cataclysmic because everything they thought about this country seems to be disappearing in front of us. I understand that President Trump tries to sell this as something less than it is; that it isn't a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, it is just a ban on Muslims from a select set of countries. But these are countries that encapsulate over 230 million That is almost two-thirds of the population of the United States of America, including some of the most populous Muslim nations in the world, and it is directly targeted at people of Muslim faith.  It is simply not credible to say that this isn't a ban on members of one religion from entering the United States because it selects countries that are majority Muslim and then includes a caveat that if you are not of the majority religion, if you are of any religion that is not the majority religion, you can get around the ban and will be given priority to come to the United  This is a Muslim ban--a Muslim ban that applies to over 200 million Muslims around the world. It makes us smaller and weaker and less great as a nation. It also makes us weaker from a national security standpoint as well.  Let's step back for a second and understand the context here. This country does face a threat, a serious threat. There are religious extremists around the world who have perverted the religion of Islam and tried to turn it into[[Page S484]]a doctrine of violence. They are attempting today to do great violence in the Middle East and in other parts of the world, and they are trying to recruit attackers here on U.soil. But you are not likely to be killed in an act of terrorism in this country. In fact, on average, there have been about three Americans killed every year by terrorism.  I am not trying to underplay the threat. People feel fearful. As a body, we need to respond to that fear. They see these awful things happening on TV, and they want us to make sure it will not happen to them. You are more likely to be killed in this country by lightning or by an elevator malfunction than you are by terrorism.  If you really want to talk about securing this Nation, about protecting Americans, then the conversation has to be bigger than just banning individuals from one country but recognizing the real threats that are posed.  Let me guarantee you this: If this ban goes into effect, if President Trump is successful, with the support from the Republican Congress, in sending a message to the world that America is at war with Islam, then that number of three Americans killed by terrorism every year will jump, it will skyrocket. More Americans will be killed by terrorism. Why? Because today ISIS is on its heels. It is in retreat. It has substantially less territory than it ever has before, and that has robbed from it one of its primary rationales for existence, one of its primary arguments to those it is trying to recruit into its fold--the idea that ISIS is forming a caliphate, an area of geographic control in the Middle  That argument doesn't work any longer because the supposed caliphate is shrinking. The amount of territory they control is getting smaller and smaller. Most folks can see the writing on the wall, that it is just a matter of time before the Islamic State as a state is gone. But they have this second rationale for existence, this second argument that they proffer to would-be recruits, and that is that there is a war between East and West, that this is really about a long-term struggle between Islam and You need to sign up with us because they--the West, America, the Christian world--are coming for us.  We know that is not true, and we have watched Presidents of both parties make it very clear to the world that this is not the fight that we seek to engage in. Famously, immediately following the 9/11 attacks, President Bush said:       The face of terror is not the true faith of  He said:       That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace.  Yet the message that is being sent with this ban on Muslims from these seven countries entering the United States is clear. The message is that the United States is at war with this religion, that we are at war with people of the Muslim faith.  As we speak, these recruitment bulletin boards are lighting up with arguments being made as to the true nature of America's intent against the Islamic people. One posting on one of these message boards said that Trump's actions ``clearly revealed the truth and harsh reality behind the American government and their hatred toward Muslims.'' Another posting on one of these extremist Web sites hailed Trump as the ``best caller to Islam.'' Another message said that the leader of ISIS, ``Al Baghdadi[,] has the right to come out and inform Trump that banning Muslims from entering America is a blessed ban.'' That is a phrase with very meaningful connotations. To the extent that these messaging boards are calling this ban on Muslims entering from seven countries a ``blessed ban,'' it is rooted in a different phrase, something called the ``blessed invasion.''  The U.invasion of Iraq in 2003 became the starting point for the very insurgency that we are fighting today. It was that invasion that was called by Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda in Iraq, and the affiliated extremist groups that were drawn into the fight the ``blessed invasion.'' Today on extremist Web sites, the ban on Muslims entering the United States is being called the ``blessed ban.''  This order is making this country less safe hour by hour. It is giving a pathway to rebirth for the very terrorist organizations that we had made such progress in pushing back and fighting back. In Iran specifically, it will lead to this country and our allies in the Middle East losing the fight against hardliners who pose a threat to the United States, to stability in the Middle East, and to our sacred ally of In Iran, there is a contest between moderates--and that is a relative term within the Iranian political space--and hardliners who chant ``Death to Israel'' who don't fear a world war or a conflict with the United  With the signing of the Iran nuclear agreement and the lifting of a handful of sanctions on Iran, the moderates won a victory. The population of that country--which is surprisingly pro-American and supported that nuclear agreement--was ascended, potentially foreshadowing a day in which that country would no longer be a provocateur in the region and instead could join in conversations about how to bring stability to the Middle Now the hardliners have been handed a gift, a gift which proves that America is an enemy, not just of the Iranian state but of the Iranian people.  Remember, when we think of actions that we take against governments that we don't like, we first try to start with actions that specifically identify individuals in the government, so that we make it clear that it is not about the people of that country but about their leaders. If that isn't strong enough, then we go to sanctions against commercial interests, against the economy writ large. Yes, those sanctions do filter down and hurt real people, but the sanctions are levied at the economy or against commercial actors.  When you enact a specific ban on the people of a country being able to travel to the United States, you are levying that punishment directly on those individuals, who, by and large, bear no ill will toward the United You are telling them that it is their fault, and the Iranian people will turn against the United States, will turn toward the hardliners based upon this action.  This ban makes us less safe. It will allow for terrorist groups to rebound. That is not just me saying it. Senators McCain and Graham have said the same thing. National security experts of both stripes have testified as such. Tonight I think back to the moment in which I first heard that Candidate Donald Trump was proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the United I remember the universal bipartisan derision that met that announcement. It was almost laughable at that point in time during the campaign. If you remember, Candidate Trump was flailing. He was weak. He needed to reassert himself. He needed to make news, and so he grabbed for the most controversial, most outlandish proposal he could make. Republicans and Democrats here in Congress condemned it.  Speaker Ryan tweeted this:       A religious test for entering our country is not reflective      of America's fundamental values. I reject it.  Governor Mike Pence said:       Calls to ban Muslims from entering the United States are      offensive and unconstitutional.       A religious test for entering this country is not      reflective of America's fundamental values. I reject it.       Calls to ban Muslims from entering the United States are      offensive and unconstitutional.  I give credit to a small handful of Republicans here in the Senate and a small handful of Republicans in the House who have raised serious concerns about this ban with respect to what it says about American values or what it says about American national security. But there is utter silence from Republican leadership. Republican leadership--who only months ago claimed that if there were a religious test for entering our country, they would reject it--today are quiet. The idea that individuals could come to this country without regard to their religion or their national origin or their set of beliefs has never been a partisan issue. Of all the things that divide us, that idea has been one that unifies us.  My hope is that there is still a chance that both parties can come together and recapture the essence of American originalism, can put this country on firmer national security footing, and can continue the relentless drive against extremist groups like ISIS that now find themselves at a point of potential rebirth.[[Page S485]]  You have heard a lot of stories on the floor of the Senate today. It is interesting. We have these incredibly compelling stories from real people who are caught today in the middle of this reckless ill-thought-out ban. There are 67,000 refugees who are currently in the pipeline to come to this country right now. This isn't about 100, 200, 300, or 400. This is about tens of thousands of refugees who are fleeing persecution, terror, and torture. This is about the 230 million Muslims who live in those seven countries, who have been told that they are lesser. Frankly, every other Muslim in the world believes the message is being sent to them as well.  These stories that we tell you are--the tip of the iceberg isn't even accurate. This is a pinprick. Fadi Kassar and his family--here are his two girls. They left Syria in 2011 due to the epic levels of violence that Fadi was sure would kill his two little girls if he didn't leave. His family went to the UAE, or the United Arab But the way in which the UAE works is that if you have a job, you can stay, but if you don't have a job, you leave. When he lost his job, they were kicked out and that began an epic journey for Fadi and his family.  These girls actually were born in the UAE, as I understand. He was fleeing Syria to protect his family and his future children, yet they were kicked out of the country they went to. Fadi then began a journey to try to find a home for him and his family. He tried to get to Europe via Tunisia, but he was detained and sent back to He eventually flew to He made his way to the United States by crossing the border with Upon entry, he was detained. He was transferred to He was released and eventually found his way to He applied for asylum that was granted in December of 2015.  Fadi's relatives in Syria were tortured and had been detained by the regime. His neighborhood was dangerous and deadly. Fadi and his family were exactly the kind of people whom this country historically has been able to rescue from war-torn countries, from terror, and from torture. His family had experienced torture. His children were later returned to Syria and would face potential death.  He went through all of the processes that we asked him to go through. He didn't go into the shadows. He didn't hide. He applied for asylum status. It was granted in 2015. He filed forms that would allow for his wife and two daughters to follow. Those visas were issued last Tuesday, on January 24.  Originally, they had a flight that was scheduled to bring his wife and these two little girls to the United States today, but last week, when Fadi learned of the potential for this Executive order, he paid $1,000 to move their flight up to His two little girls and his wife got on a flight from Jordan to Kiev, Ukraine, and eventually to the United But once in Kiev, their passports and their visas were taken from them. They were sent to Their visas were rejected, and they were returned to  These two little girls are back in their old apartment, but they got rid of all their furniture. They got rid of all their clothes. Their neighbors have temporarily given them mattresses to sleep on. They don't even know where their suitcases are. Their father, who is ready to greet them at the airport here in the United States, may never see them.  They are scared to death. I have two little boys who are the exact same age. I have an 8-year-old. I have a 5-year-old.

You are going to go back to Jordan and, potentially, eventually back to  Imagine what those little girls went through. Imagine millions of other little boys and girls like them who had in their mind this place called America, a place that would welcome them, who would rescue them from the disaster that had become their lives.  Imagine that dream that was literally hours away for these two little girls extinguishing, and extinguishing for millions of others like them all around this planet. It is up to us whether that light which flickered off on Friday relights. It is up to us as to whether we rekindle the American dream, that idea of America from our founding. This is not irreversible. These two little girls, you could bring them here. We could choose to bring them here. It is up to us.  There is legislation on the floor of the Senate right now as we speak that would rescind this order. It is our decision, right? There are 100 of us. There are only 435 down the hall. There are only 535 of us. It is our decision whether these two little girls come to the United States or they go back to their war-ravaged home that their father left. It is up to us. It is not up to the President of the United States alone. He does not get to make these decisions by himself.  Democracy allows for us to make a different decision. It is up to us.

What do we do?  Is this a partisan issue or can we commit ourselves together to stand up for those basic ideas of America's founding?

2963,topic-id,1745,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today on behalf of students, parents, teachers, and communities around the country to urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act and to oppose this resolution today.  This resolution will roll back a rule issued by the Department of Education that is critical to the effective and intended implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act, or  I am urging my fellow Senators to vote against this resolution for the following reasons, and I will go through each one of them: First of all, this legislation will throw our States and[[Page S1671]]school districts into chaos just as they are beginning to implement our new law. Secondly, it will give Secretary DeVos a blank check to promote her anti-public school agenda. Third, passing this resolution would be a retreat from the bipartisan law President Obama called a Christmas miracle, one that takes us down a strong partisan path instead, which could undermine ESSA's civil rights protections and guardrails.  But before I go into that, I want to remind my colleagues of what we are working on here and what this resolution would unwind. As many of my colleagues remember well, in 2015, the senior Senator from Tennessee and I came together, with so many others in this body, to fix No Child Left We both agreed--in fact, nearly everyone in the country agreed--the law was badly broken. No Child Left Behind relied too much on high stakes standardized testing. It gave schools unrealistic goals but failed to give them the resources to meet those goals. And it included a one-size-fits-all punishment if those goals weren't met.  We knew overhauling our public education law was not going to be easy, but we took the time to listen to teachers, to parents, and to students around the country, to make sure their voices were heard. And I am proud that we were then able to break through the partisan gridlock in Congress, find common ground, and pass the Every Student Succeeds Act with strong bipartisan support.  After a major law like the Every Student Succeeds Act passes, Federal agencies usually issue rules to implement and clarify that law. The Every Student Succeeds Act maintains the Secretary's authority to issue rules and clarifications that are consistent with the law. This rule before us today is consistent with ESSA, and it provides important clarity to States, school districts, and schools.  Using such a blunt instrument like this resolution to overturn the entire rule will be a retreat from bipartisanship. Here is how: This resolution would roll back a critical Department of Education rule that gives States more flexibility in key areas while at the same time maintaining strong Federal guardrails to ensure our most vulnerable children don't fall through the cracks. This rule provides clarity on accountability, on reporting requirements, and State plan requirements. It helps ensure that no student, no matter where they live, can fall through those cracks. In other words, this is a rule that gets at the heart and soul of what we are trying to accomplish with our bipartisan law.  The Department of Education did not simply come up with this rule on its own. It incorporated over 20,000 comments from education stakeholders, State chiefs, and district superintendents, many of whom--including the State chiefs and superintendents--applauded the Department of Education for listening to their concerns and incorporating those comments into the final rule that was then released last fall.  During the debate around the Every Student Succeeds Act, there was some division about what accountability should mean in the law, but the final law showed that we can balance flexibility with strong Federal guardrails, until this point, when Republicans now want to tear down the rule that ensures those guardrails go into effect.  Now I want to get into some of the challenges that would be created if this resolution passes and this rule was eliminated. One important thing this rule did was clarify State submission plan requirements and set deadlines for the submission of those plans. Based on this, States have been working now with the Department of Education for months on their State plans. Approximately 18 States and the District of Columbia intend to submit their plans in the beginning of April, but if this rule goes away now, if the rug gets pulled out from under these States, there could be chaos and confusion and the undermining of confidence in this new law.  By the way, we are already seeing this start. In February, Secretary DeVos sent a letter to our State chiefs suggesting a new template for their State submission plans would be ``coming,'' even before the Senate voted on this resolution, and that the new template would be available less than a month before State plans are due. This could force those impacted States to abandon their plans and start from scratch, and it does not allow enough time for the stakeholder review process that is required in the law.  So that is the first reason we should oppose this legislation because there is simply no reason to insert more chaos into a system that is finally settling into our new law. The second reason is, passing this legislation would then give Secretary DeVos a blank check over implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act to promote her anti-public school agenda.  As we saw in her confirmation hearing, Secretary DeVos, we know, has dedicated her career to privatizing public education. She has a long record of fighting to cut investments in public schools and shift taxpayer dollars toward private school vouchers. In her hearing, she showed a lack of even basic understanding of key concepts in public education policy, and she has openly questioned the role of the Federal Government in protecting our most vulnerable students.  After her hearing, millions of people across the country stood up, made their voices heard, and called on the Senate to reject her confirmation. Although she squeaked through with a historic tie-breaking vote from Vice President Pence, it was clear people across the country rejected her anti-public school agenda. Instead, they want the Department of Education to stand with students and with our schools.  One month into her tenure as Secretary of Education, Secretary DeVos has not done a lot to reassure parents who had serious concerns. She has made mistake after mistake, from grossly misrepresenting the origins of the HBCUs to failing to protect transgender students in schools, proving what the American people saw at her confirmation hearing; that her lack of understanding of public education is hurting our students. We cannot, in good conscience, provide Secretary DeVos another potential tool to implement ESSA, our bipartisan bill, with her anti-public education slant, and that is exactly what passing this resolution would do.  If this resolution passes, make no mistake, I will do everything I can to ensure that Secretary DeVos implements ESSA, as Congress intended.  Let me be clear. Congress did not intend that DeVos or any future Secretary of Education could use this law to encourage, prioritize, or even require States to incentivize private school choice. We will work to ensure that she does not take advantage of the chaos that will follow, if this rule is overturned.  Providing Secretary DeVos a blank check would absolutely be the wrong way to go in the early stages of this law's implementation. So that is the second reason.  The third reason is, at its heart, the Every Student Succeeds Act is a civil rights law, and the rule that this resolution would eliminate reflects that reality. We know from experience that without strong accountability, kids from low-income neighborhoods, students of color, kids with disabilities, and students learning English too often fall through the cracks. Now it is up to all of us to uphold the civil rights legacy of this law and its promise for all of our students.  I was proud to work with my colleague, the senior Senator from Tennessee, on this law. I know he is proud of what we accomplished, but I am disheartened to see my Republican colleagues jamming this partisan play through in the same fashion they did with Secretary DeVos's nomination.  Voting for this resolution will ruin the bipartisan nature of our Every Student Succeeds Act, and it will hurt our students, but by voting against this resolution, we can make sure ESSA works for all of our students, regardless of where they live, how they learn, or how much money their parents make.  Finally, I want to make one more point. Even people who had concerns with the final rule do not--do not--want to see it overturned. In fact, the American Federation of Teachers, civil rights groups, and the U.Chamber of Commerce--groups that aren't always actually on the same side of education issues--are all speaking out against rolling back this rule, and parents,[[Page S1672]]teachers, and community leaders are all on the same page.  In a letter to the Senate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union said: ``Repealing these regulations now would not just be counterproductive and disruptive but would demonstrate a disregard by Congress of school districts' operation and timelines.''  In a letter to my colleagues, Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer, the U.Chamber of Commerce and various education groups, including the National Center for Learning Disabilities, wrote that rolling back this rule ``will cause unnecessary confusion, disrupting the work in states and wasting time that we cannot afford to waste.''  So if unions, business, and civil rights groups, disability advocate organizations, and the States are not asking for this, we must ask the questions, Why are my colleagues jamming this resolution through? What perceived problem are we trying to solve?  Millions of students, parents, and teachers have made their voices heard about the importance of public education. They want us to work together to uphold and build on our bipartisan law, not for it to become just the latest partisan exercise that only hurts our students.  A vote against this resolution is a vote for our students, it is a vote for our schools, it is a vote not to give Secretary DeVos power she can abuse, and it is a vote to keep working together to build on this bipartisan law, not tear it apart.

2965,topic-id,1495,"Mr.President, I rise today to express serious concern about reports in the press that the administration is considering deep cuts in funding to crucial aspects of our Nation's national security and our homeland security to pay for the construction of a border wall and also for a crackdown on illegal immigration.  The first target that alarmed me was America's maritime guardian, the U.Coast  Even as the administration says it plans to secure the borders and increase funding for our military by $54 billion, which, in fact, may be a good thing, it is reportedly considering cuts on the nondefense side--and that includes the Department of Homeland Security--with a cut of $1.3 billion, or 12 percent, to the very military service that secures our vast maritime borders, and that is the Coast That plan just doesn't make any sense, especially when it comes to securing our borders. You would be putting a bunch of money in a wall, but you are losing the security of the border over here on the oceans.  The 42,000 member-strong Coast Guard plays a vital role in protecting our Nation from narcoterrorism, combating human smuggling, preventing and responding to maritime environmental disasters, and protecting lives and property at sea.  By the way, in other foreign parts of the globe, the U.Coast Guard is assisting the U.military in our military operations.  If securing our borders and supporting our military is a true priority for the administration, then it ought not be slashing the Coast Guard's budget. Instead, we should be supporting the Coast Guard's ongoing and much needed fleet recapitalization program, including the design and construction of the new offshore patrol cutter and the continued production of the new fast response cutter. These are desperately needed assets for the Coast  This Senator has personally visited dozens of Coast Guard units all around, not just in my State of Florida but in Alaska, the Great The job the Coast Guard does is amazing. What I have witnessed firsthand is what they do in service to our country.  The constant theme I have heard from my visits is the need to modernize and become increasingly more nimble, given the host of threats that could be delivered from our maritime borders. Let me give just one example.  In the Caribbean, it is a Coast Guard admiral who heads up the task force that has all agencies of government participating as we look to protect the southern borders in the Caribbean, as well as the southern Pacific, from anything that is coming to our borders--drugs, migrants, terrorists, whatever. It is all agencies involved, but if, for example, there are U.Navy ships in the area or Air Force assets in the air that might pick up one of these threats coming toward America, they work hand-in-glove with the Coast Guard because it is the Coast Guard that has the legal authority as a law enforcement agency to stop, apprehend, and board that vessel.  We are doing all of this border protection with cutters that have an average age of 45 years old. The average age of a Coast Guard 210-foot medium endurance cutter is 48 years old. The Coast Guard's high endurance cutter average age is 45 years. These are just two classes of ships that the Coast Guard uses for interdiction and rescue missions, and they do it worldwide.  As you may expect, with assets this old, the Coast Guard struggles with major, mission-debilitating casualties, which result in severe losses of operational days at sea and drastically increases maintenance costs. To correct that, the new offshore patrol cutters and the fast response cutters will give the Coast Guard an effective coastal and offshore interdiction capability in order to meet objectives. What are they? Combating transnational organized crime networks, securing our national maritime borders, safeguarding waterborne commerce, and safeguarding life and property at sea.  Looking at the administration's second target to pay for the wall, what is the second target? Believe it or not, FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management That agency comes to the aid of millions of Americans during any kind of natural disaster, and they are singling that out for cuts? That doesn't make common sense, and it certainly is not going to be a popular thing to do in the eyes of those who have to turn to FEMA after a natural disaster to try to get their lives back on track.  Last year, just taking 1 year as an example, two major hurricanes hit Florida, in addition to many other devastating natural disasters that struck nationwide and resulted in many deaths and billions of dollars of damage. FEMA was critical to people's survival and recovery in each of those events. Just think of what we hear on the news all the time. There are storms, tornadoes, earthquakes. Remember the mountain that erupted out in the State of Washington decades ago, not to mention hurricanes.  For the sake of people's safety and that of our country, we simply cannot use FEMA as a piggy bank to pay for the administration's trillion-dollar spending programs.  The administration's third target--this has just been reported. What is the third target? You are not going to believe this. It is TSA, the Transportation Security If we target TSA for budget cuts--is that really what we want to do in a threat environment? Every time we go through an airport, TSA is on the frontlines of protecting our country from terrorist attacks. That is its security mission at airports across the country--and, by the way, with the air marshals who fly on our flights. Need I remind the administration why TSA was created? It was after the September 11 attacks in 2001.  Funding is vital to ensure the success of TSA's mission. In fact, just last year Congress responded to concerns over insider threats and security at airports, such as the bombings in Brussels and Istanbul, with the most extensive security-related measures in years. Specifically, what we did, particularly in the Commerce Committee when we formulated the FAA bill, is we included bipartisan provisions enhancing the background and vetting requirements for airport employees and expanded the random and physical inspection of airport employees in secure areas.  Remember the case at the Atlanta Airport? For several months, people had a gun-running scheme going from Atlanta to New They didn't drive up Interstate 95 to take the guns; they had an airport employee in Atlanta[[Page S1673]]who could get into the airport, without being checked, carrying a sack of guns. That airport employee would go up into the sterile area where passengers are, go into the men's room, and would exchange knapsacks with a passenger who had come through TSA clean, and that passenger took the sack of guns on the airplane flight from Atlanta to New The New York City Police Department couldn't figure out how they were getting all those guns on the streets of New That was a gun-running scheme over several months. Thank goodness they were criminals and not terrorists. And you want to cut that kind of security?  Do you want to cut the strongest security we have at an airport when screening passengers who are going through? It is the nose of a dog, the VIPR teams. The trained dog teams and their handlers are the most efficient way to screen passengers. It is amazing what those dogs can sense. When we did the FAA bill last year, we doubled the number of VIPR teams, the dog teams, and you want to cut this? That was all done in a bipartisan manner. We doubled the number for the protection of the American public.  In that bill, we also expanded the grant funding to assist law enforcement in responding to mass casualty and active-shooter incidents, which is very important. Another tragic example of that is the recent shooting in Fort Lauderdale at the airport.  To counter the issue of long lines, which I know we all had to go through last spring, the legislation included provisions to expand TSA Precheck and require the TSA to evaluate staffing and checkpoint configurations in order to expedite passenger security screening.  Does that sound like a bunch of administrative mumbo jumbo? Let me tell you that it works and that all of it is designed to protect Americans going to airports and getting on airplanes.  None of this is possible without continued funding and, in fact, even more funding. Any cuts are certainly going to impair the TSA's ability to keep our country safe.  The bottom line here is that we must do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe and our citizens secure. Slashing the budgets of the U.Coast Guard or FEMA or the TSA is only going to make us less secure.  Need I say more about these proposals to pay for some of these other things, like a wall, by slashing these kinds of budgets?  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Gardner).

I also want to thank him for the opportunity to address the House of Representatives on this very important issue that we are dealing with right now.  Mr.Speaker, throughout my time representing the good people of central Washington State in the U.Congress, constituents from across my district, the Fourth District, have shared with me their deeply personal stories. These are personal stories about the struggles and the hardships that they have experienced and that they have faced since the passage of the Affordable Care  So let me just relate to you a couple of those because I think they are very important and help illustrate exactly what it is that we are trying to correct.  In late 2016, a gentleman from the city of Yakima wrote to me in distress, as his insurance provider was pulling out of Yakima  He told me: My wife and I are losing our healthcare coverage. Our financial lives are about to be radically changed and a literal risk to our health is upon us. The challenge to find affordable, acceptable healthcare insurance will be immense.  That is not unlike another story that I heard in early 2015. A young woman from Grandview wrote to describe her dire situation being forced on to the Affordable Care Act exchange.  She told me: I was paying $231 a month for a policy that had a $500 deductible with a $10 copay.  However, under the ACA, she said her healthcare costs have skyrocketed.  She continues: I now pay $475 a month for a policy that has a $5,500 deductible. This is not affordable health care.  It is the middle class American who has worked hard to have a good retirement who is being hit hard by this.[[Page H2014]]  Another gentleman from West Richland recently pleaded that the many middle class workers like him must not be forgotten as we repeal and replace this broken law.  He says: Do not forget us when fixing. We liked our plan, and we lost it.  Just last week, a farmer from Moses Lake called my office and said that, before the ACA, he was paying less than $200 a month for a catastrophic plan that provided coverage for his family. Now he is forced to pay $1,000 a month with high deductibles that discourage his family from even being able to use and access the healthcare insurance that they are paying for.  These are just some of the many stories of the dozens, the hundreds that I have been hearing from over the last couple of years since I started representing the good people of central  Like I said, these are true stories, personal stories of the struggles that people are facing on a daily basis and have pleaded with us to take strong action to deliver them from this situation that they find themselves in. I think it is similar across the country. As you hear tonight from other Members speaking about their districts, you are hearing similar stories.  So that is something that, I think, as we debate the best way to repeal and to replace the Affordable Care Act, I am committed to ensuring that we protect the most vulnerable.  I am also committed to providing relief for the majority of everyday, middle class Americans who have been devastated by this misguided and broken law.  Let me just say: I hear you, I will not forget about you, and I will keep your stories at the forefront of my mind as we work to fix this failed system.

We do need to stand up and be counted. The new department of global engagement at the State Department is beginning to do that. I know Senator Murphy has had some meetings recently--and I have, too--where they are starting to get their feet on the ground and being able to allow people to be able to see the objective truth; in other words, to sort of separate narratives from reality, to be able to ensure that we don't have an undermining of these great democracies--these fledgling democracies, many of them.

Read Aloud Month  Mr.President, I am actually speaking out today about another issue, which is one that is a little closer to home, and that is about the importance of reading to our kids. It turns out that this month of March has been designated as Read Aloud Month, and this group called Read Aloud is doing fantastic work around the country. They actually started in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH, so I am a little biased about them, but what they are doing is incredibly important. It is about education, it is about the economy, and more importantly, it is about the lives of young people around the country and the ability to achieve their dreams. It is about child literacy.  Here is the information. Elementary schools and libraries are talking about this more and more back home. If you read to your kids when they are young, they will have a much better chance of succeeding in life. According to a study that dates back to 1995--kind of a famous study--by the time a child born into poverty reaches age 3, he or she has heard 30 million fewer words than his or her peers. Let me repeat that. A kid who is born into poverty is going to hear 30 million fewer words by the time he or she is 3 years old. Why does that matter? Why does this word gap, as they call it, matter? Well, it matters because it turns out these verbal skills, like other skills, develop as they are used, and if they are not used, they don't develop. So a lot of kids who already have the challenge of growing up in poverty are also burdened with the disadvantage of not developing these verbal skills. That makes it harder for them to get good grades, harder for them to develop social skills, and harder for them to get a good job and ultimately to be able to live out their dreams.  I know Washington, DC, may be the only place on Earth where 30 million sounds like a small number, but it is a big number. It makes a huge difference. This word gap leads to an achievement gap later in life based on all the studies. Experts tell us that a child's vocabulary is reflective of his or her parents' vocabulary. It makes sense. Kids learn what they see and what they hear.  There is a 2003 study by Elizabeth Martin and Tom Risley studying word gaps which found that by age 3, before even reaching school age, children's ``trends in the amount of talk, vocabulary growth, and style of interaction were well established and clearly suggest widening gaps to come.'' So having poor reading skills makes it harder to make a living, it affects self-esteem, and it makes life more difficult in so many small ways. Think about this: unable to read a manual when you buy something, unable to read a list of ingredients, unable to read a newspaper to understand what is going on, to be online.  Millions of our friends and neighbors are struggling with these consequences every day. According to the Department of Education, about 32 million adults in this country can't read. Think about that. That is a group nearly 3 times the size of the State of Ohio and maybe 25 to 30 times the size of the Presiding Officer's State--32 million. Too many of these adults, of course, started off life with the disadvantage of this word gap, and they never caught up.  That is why this Read Aloud Month is so critical. Parents and other caretakers need to know they can steer their child in a better direction--develop vocabulary skills and end the word gap just by reading aloud to them.  Developing these skills, according to experts, affects the biology of the brain. Tzipi Horowitz-Kraus of Cincinnati Children's Hospital--a great institution in my hometown and one of the top three children's hospitals in the country, based on U.News and World Anyway, he is an expert on this topic, and this is what he said: ``The more you read to your child, the more you help the neurons in the brain to grow and connect.'' So it is physiological.  Kim Noble, a brain scientist at Columbia University, has found that this word gap actually translates into a brain-sized gap in the areas dealing with language.  Dana Suskind of the University of Chicago has found that more than 80 percent of a child's brain development occurs by age 3--80 percent--and the effects of the word gap are detected in brain development in babies as young as 9 months old. These aren't children; these are babies. Doctor Suskind says that by reading aloud, every parent has the ability to grow their child's brain.  So certainly before a child can read, before a child can even speak, it is important to be speaking to that child. Think about that. Think about the impact you can have. So get out a book and do some reading to a child, a grandchild, someone who is in the neighborhood, one of your kids. Do it tonight.  Sometimes when I talk about this, people say: Well, Rob, parenting is pretty tough. Everybody is busy. Some people are working two shifts. Both parents are working. Where do you make time for this? Here is my answer to that: Fifteen minutes a day. That is the goal here. Fifteen minutes a day makes a huge difference to be able to close that gap.  Others say: We can't afford it. How do you afford to buy these books if you are going to read all the time? To me, that is pretty simple. Buy a library card. They are free, usually. If not, they are cheap. You don't need a lot of new books, but you do need a library card, and that is very helpful. They helped Jane and me to be able to have books to read to our kids.  Again, I am very proud Ohio has led on this issue. In 2008, this group Read Aloud was started in Cincinnati, It has now become a national movement. It has more than 10,000 grassroots partners--including daycare facilities, schools and libraries, and rotary clubs--in all 50  So what can you do to help? I would say that this issue is not going to be found here in this body. It is not about Washington, DC, doing anything except encouraging people to do what makes sense, which is to spend time with your kid, to ensure that if you have a kid in school, that you know that kid gets the right start in life, to ensure that everybody has the ability to have a successful life.[[Page S2036]]  Senator Harris and I introduced a resolution about this recently in the U.It is called the Read Aloud Month resolution. It encourages parents and caregivers to read to their kids for 15 minutes a day. We are asking our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democratic, to sign off on that resolution. That would help raise the visibility of this issue.  Again, I hope everybody listening today takes the opportunity to follow up, to read to a kid, to help ensure they can close that words gap in their lives and therefore have a better chance of getting better grades, getting a better job, and achieving whatever their dream is in life.

2812,topic-id,1958,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman She has been a sensational leader within the Democratic Caucus and within the Congressional Progressive Caucus, especially on the issues of immigration and the rights of refugees. It is such an honor to be able to serve with her. I appreciate being able to spend some moments just reflecting on what took place in our Chamber last night with the President's speech.  We should start by giving credit where credit is due. This speech was not ``American Carnage II.'' It was a vast improvement, I would say, over all of the violent and apocalyptic imagery and rhetoric that we saw in the inaugural address. So hats off to the President's new speech writer, whoever that may be.  However, having said that, I think it is simply old wine in a new bottle. The same basic extremist Steve Bannon infrastructure governed that address despite the fact that the manners had improved considerably.                              {time}  1945  When I thought about President Trump's speech in this Chamber last night, I thought about George Not because of 1984, although I admit that my well-thumbed copy of this great dystopian novel is sitting on my desk right now and the words ``war is peace'' and ``ignorance is strength'' have been running through my mind over the last several weeks. No, I thought of Orwell not because of 1984, but because of a great essay he once wrote called ``Notes on Nationalism.''  In this essay, George Orwell contrasted patriotism and nationalism--two concepts that often get conflated. But at least, in his view, they represented two very different things. Patriotism, he argued, was a positive emotion, a passionate belief in one's own community--its people, its institutions, its values, its history, its culture.  An American patriot today, I would argue, believes in our magnificent constitutional democracy--our Constitution; our Bill of Rights; our judiciary and our judges; our States and our communities; our poets like Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and Langston Hughes and Merrill Leffler; our philosophers like John Dewey and Ralph Waldo Emerson; our extraordinary dynamic culture which invites and absorbs new waves of people from all over the world, our artists, our musicians like Bruce Springsteen, the Neville Brothers, and Dar All of these people and things are what we love about America, and they evoke the positive emotion of patriotism.  Patriotism is all about uplifting people; drawing on what is best in our history; finding what is best in our culture; invoking our Founders, Madison,[[Page H1457]]Jefferson, Franklin, and Tom Paine; invoking the people who founded the country once again through the Civil War and the reconstruction amendments, Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass; the people who transformed America in the women's suffrage movement, like Susan Anthony; the people who remade America once again in the civil rights movement, like Martin Luther King, Bob Moses, and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee; the people who blew the doors off of discrimination and oppression against other groups, like the LGBT community, like Harvey  All of these people stand for a progressive dynamic and inclusive concept of America, and patriots want to draw on this culture in history in order to continue to make great progress for our people today. A patriot wants to improve the health of our people, the education of our people, the critical thinking skills of our people, the well-being of  Now, nationalism is different. If you look at it historically as Orwell did, nationalism has been not about building people up and improving their lives, it has been about militarizing society and getting everyone to sync their individuality, their creative personality into a large corporatist and authoritarian state, one that is destined to exploit people's goodwill by mobilizing them for groupthink and endless hostility in war, the kind that Orwell dramatized so frightfully in 1984 and in ``Animal Farm.''  Well, I am sorry to say that I didn't see a lot of patriotism in Orwell's terms in the speech last night. Ninety percent of our kids go to public schools, but 90 percent of this President's energy and administration's energy seems to go into maligning and defunding public education and diverting public money away from public schools into private education. That is the Betsy DeVos agenda.  Or take health care. The Affordable Care Act represents a magnificent national investment in health care of our own people. More than 22 million of our fellow citizens, previously uninsured, got health care because of the Thirty million if you include the expansion of Medicaid that took place under the  If you decide to go to a town hall, yours or someone else's, you will meet people who will tell you that their lives were saved because of the Affordable Care Act--victims of breast cancer and colon cancer and heart attacks and strokes and on and on. These things are just in the nature of life. We are all subject to medical misfortune. If you learn you have cancer or if you have a heart attack, that is a misfortune. It happens to people every day. But if you have cancer or leukemia or you have a heart attack and you can't get health coverage because you lost your job or because you are too poor, that is not just a misfortune, that is an injustice because we can do something about that. Because that has to do with how we have organized our own affairs as a society.  But what did we hear from the President last night about the health care and well-being of our people? Repeal and replace the Affordable Care They voted more than 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act and never once to replace it. They have got no plan. The President did not offer a plan.  The President restated the values of the Affordable Care Act itself. And understand, the Affordable Care Act was the compromise because the logical thing to have done, as President Obama said, if we were starting from scratch, would be to adopt a single payor plan. But because we were along a certain path, he felt we couldn't do that.  So he took the plan that was adopted at The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, the one that was put in in Massachusetts by Governor Romney--That is the Affordable Care But they couldn't tolerate that because they cared more about scoring political points against the President than they did about actually making health care available to as many Americans as possible.  So the President showed up empty-handed again. No plan whatsoever. If there were a plan, we would be debating it. If they had something to offer, we would be talking about it. But they don't have it. They just want to repeal and consign everybody back to medical oblivion. Millions of people going back to not having it. Making everybody else's insurance premiums skyrocket and just turning our backs on the families that now depend on the Affordable Care  Now, I will say the President mentioned in passing something that he made a big deal of during the campaign, and I was happy he did. He went back to saying that we needed to give the government the authority to negotiate with the large drug companies, the prescription drug companies, for lower prices.  And I was happy to hear my colleagues from the other side of the aisle in talking about the pharmacist just now, also talking about the extraordinary power of the pharmaceutical companies and their predatory practices.  Well, what the President has said makes perfect sense on this point, which is there was some special interest legislation that came out several years ago saying that the government could not negotiate for lower prices with the drug companies when it comes to We do it with Medicaid, we do it with VA drug benefits, but we can't do it for Medicare drug benefits because some lobbyist was able to get somebody to stick that into the bill, and the GOP majority stands by it now.  And so I appeal to the President, if you are serious about it, I will work day and night to get every Democratic vote I can to side with you in giving the government the authority to negotiate for lower drug prices. That is a common ground agenda. Let's do that.  But as to the general picture of health care in the country, the President gave us nothing last night. We also got no jobs plan. We got no plan to confront the shameful inequality in our society.  When the President and his Cabinet entered the Chamber last night, the net worth of this room went up by $9.6 billion. This is the richest Cabinet in American history. These 17 people in the Cabinet have more wealth than 43 million American households combined. That is one-third of American households. When you look at the Trump Cabinet, you can see the net worth of one-third of American families together.  And the President, who campaigned like a crusading populist, like William Jennings Bryan, for working people, creates a Cabinet of billionaires and CEOs, people who profited like mad from NAFTA and all the trade deals that the President now denounces. He closed his campaign by railing against Goldman But Goldman Sachs may as well be the nickname of this From Secretary Tillerson to Steve Bannon and many others, Goldman Sachs is all over this administration.  And last night, we also got more immigrant bashing. And I know my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Jayapal, will discuss this.  How patriotic is immigrant bashing? I would say not very. Tom Paine said America would be a haven of refuge for people fleeing political and religious repression all over the world. Madison said it would be a sanctuary for religious and political refugees. America would come to be symbolized by the Statue of ``Give us your poor, your tired, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,'' that is the spirit of  We are a nation of immigrants. Other than Native Americans, we were here before everybody else got here. And the slaves were brought here against their will. But everybody else, we are immigrants or we are the descendants of immigrants. So if you attack immigrants, you are really attacking the dynamic and inclusive culture of America, a community of communities.  And then there is the big proposal we got to slash $56 billion in domestic spending and put it into a great big, new military buildup. And here we see the fingerprints, of course, of Steve We could destroy the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institutes of Health, the State Department, the Peace Corps, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Election Commission, the CFPB, and on[[Page H1458]]and on, and still not come close to the $56 billion that they want to rip out of the domestic priorities of the American people and simply give to the And for what? Why? No one has told us why. What is all of that money going to buy? Who is going to get rich off of all of that money?  Ladies and gentlemen, when you add it all up, this program seems like it partakes of the ultra-nationalist politics that Orwell perceived in authoritarian regimes, not the kind of patriotism that reflects the best in our own Democratic political culture.  The great thing is that Americans are deep patriots. We love our communities. We love our institutions. We love our values. We love our We love our Bill of And we are not going to fall for a right-wing, ultra-nationalist agenda that takes us away from everything that we love.                              {time}  2000  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1456.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,1.0,February

2823,topic-id,585,"Mr.President, the Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act, which I reintroduce today with Senator Grassley, Senator Heitkamp, and Senator Leahy, will enhance the ability of securities regulators to protect investors and demand greater accountability from market players. Even after the financial crisis that crippled the economy, we continue to see calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall Street, and without the consequence of meaningful penalties to serve as an effective deterrent, I fear this disturbing culture of misconduct will persist.  Today, the amount of penalties the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC can fine an institution or individual is limited by statute. During hearings I held in 2011 in the Securities, Insurance, and Investment Banking Subcommittee, I learned how this limitation significantly interferes with the SEC's ability to perform its enforcement duties. At that time, the agency had been criticized by a Federal judge for not obtaining a larger settlement against Citigroup, a major player in the financial crisis that settled with the SEC in an amount that was a fraction of the cost the bank had inflicted on investors. The SEC explained that the reason for the low settlement amount was a statutory prohibition against levying a larger penalty. Indeed, then SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro in 2011 also explained that ``the Commission's statutory authority to obtain civil monetary penalties with appropriate deterrent effect is limited in many circumstances.''  The bipartisan bill Senator Grassley and I are reintroducing finally updates the SEC's civil penalties statute. This bill strives to make potential and current offenders think twice before engaging in misconduct by increasing the maximum civil monetary penalties permitted by statute, directly linking the size of the maximum penalties to the amount of losses suffered by victims of a violation and substantially raising the financial stakes for repeat offenders of our Nation's securities laws.  Specifically, our bill would give the SEC more options to tailor penalties to the specific circumstances of a given violation. In addition to raising the per violation caps for severe, or ``tier[[Page S2154]]three,'' violations to $1 million per offense for individuals and $10 million per offense for entities, the legislation would also give the SEC additional options to obtain greater penalties based on the ill-gotten gains of the violator or on the financial harm to investors.  Our bill also addresses the disturbing trend of repeat offenders on Wall Street through two provisions. The first would allow the SEC to triple the penalty cap applicable to recidivists who have been held either criminally or civilly liable for securities fraud within the previous 5 years. The second would allow the SEC to seek a civil penalty against those that violate existing Federal court or SEC orders, an approach that would be more efficient, effective, and flexible than the current civil contempt remedy. Both of these changes would substantially improve the ability of the SEC's enforcement program to ratchet up penalties for recidivists.  Slightly more than half of all U.households are invested in the stock market. They deserve a strong cop on the beat that has the tools it needs to go after fraudsters and pursue the difficult cases arising from our increasingly complex financial markets. The Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act will give the SEC more tools to demand meaningful accountability from Wall Street, which in turn will increase transparency and confidence in our financial system. I urge our colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation to enhance the SEC's ability to protect investors and to deter and crack down on fraud.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2153-2.txt,1982,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,30.0,March

2975,topic-id,606,"Mr.President, I rise today to commemorate the life and legacy of Jack Robinson, who passed away on March 1, 2017, in Pierre, SD, at the age of 92.  Jack dedicated his life to public service--first to his Nation in the U.military and later to thousands of students as a teacher in  When Jack graduated from high school in 1942, he was awarded a scholarship to Yangton College, but instead of furthering his education, he answered the call of duty amidst World War II and enlisted in the U. After transferring from the infantry to the Army Air Corps, he completed navigation school and became a crew member on a B-17 bomber. He and his team were eventually sent overseas to England and completed 27 combat missions over Germany before being shot down on March 2, 1945. Shortly afterward, Jack returned home to South  Throughout the rest of his life, he was a strong advocate for the military and a true patriot. With the stories he told and the love of country he shared, he showed what it meant to be a true American hero. For that, he affectionately adopted the nickname ``Captain Jack.''  There are not enough words in a dictionary to describe what we owe to the men and women who fought in World War II to save our Nation and to save democracy for the world. Jack Robinson put his own dreams aside and put his own life in great danger for our country and for all of the future generations of  After World War II, Jack graduated from Yankton College and taught high school science at Highmore, SD, for 2 years. Then he earned his master's degree in biology from the University of South For the next 35 years, Jack was a teacher at Riggs High School in my hometown of There, he created advanced biology and aeronautics programs for his students and inspired several young South Dakotans to become doctors. Brent Lindbloom of Pierre said his father and Jack Robinson were the reasons he became a doctor. ``Mr.Robinson was a great teacher,'' he said. ``He taught us how to study and inspired us to pursue our dreams.''  I couldn't agree more.  As a teenager, Jack taught me navigational skills needed to properly fly an airplane, fueling a lifelong passion that continues today. As Jack would say, ``you have to know the difference between compass course and compass heading.''  Over the years he taught many others navigational skills as well. But he didn't just teach young people how to fly in the skies. He was a tremendous role model for all of us and for all the students he taught.  As a bomber crew member, Jack defended our gift of democracy. As a teacher, he gave us what we needed to become responsible adults and pursue our own dreams. In 1994, Jack was inducted into the South Dakota Aviation Hall of Fame as a combat crew member. I can state that he was very proud of that moment. But more important than his many achievements as a war hero and as a teacher was his life as a husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.

3001,topic-id,978,"Mr.President, I rise to comment briefly on Russian interference in the electoral processes in this country and across the West and governments of many of Russia's own neighbors.  We are in the middle of a civilization warfare crisis of public trust in this country. This isn't about the last 2 months. This isn't just about the last Presidential election. This is fundamentally about the last few decades of declining public trust in a broad range of our institutions: the press, political parties, executive branch agencies, the Congress, and beyond.  Russia is not unaware of our own distrust of each other. Russia is not unaware of our own increasing self-doubt about our shared values. Russia is today very self-consciously working to further erode confidence in our self-government by pulling at the threads of our public and civic life. Moscow's influence campaigns don't start by creating wholly new problems out of thin air, but rather by exploiting fissures that already exist in our civilization. The simplest way for Russia to try to weaken us is by trying to exploit the places where we are already weak, the places where we are already distrustful, and the places where we are failing to pass along a shared understanding of American values to the next generation.  The sad state of modern politics and the explosion of digital media are proving to be ripe targets for many of our own internal doubts and our own discord. We--all of us, Republicans and Democrats, the legislature and the executive branch--are ill-prepared for the challenges that are already on our doorstep, let alone what comes next with the acceleration of these kinds of technologies.  Today in the Wall Street Journal, we in this body were rebuked--rightly rebuked, I think, and rebuked in a bipartisan way by former Congressman Mike Chairman Rogers, a Republican, served as the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee from 2011 through 2015. I am going to read his op-ed rebuke into the Record today, but I would humbly ask that all 100 Members of this body calmly and self-critically consider carefully Chairman Rogers' argument, for his argument is not fundamentally against Republicans alone. It is not against Democrats alone. He is offering double-barreled criticism of all of us in the Congress--criticism of both parties. Why of both parties? Because Russia's influence campaign is a really big deal. Are we Republicans listening? Also, because our response to Russia's influence campaign is not primarily about who you supported last November in the Presidential election.  Listening to the Democrats, it is sometimes hard to understand if that side of the aisle remembers that basic fact about what Russia's influence campaign was up to. Russia's goals in our most recent election were not initially about one candidate versus another candidate. We need to underscore this. There are particulars that those of us who spend time reading classified intelligence know we can't discuss in this unclassified setting. But the big, broad point is simple and needs to be shouted, and that is that Putin's fundamental goals are about undermining Putin's fundamental goals are about making us doubt our own values: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right of protest or redress of grievances.  The Kremlin isn't attempting an influence campaign to make Americans believe that the sky is green or the grass is blue. He is trying to undertake an influence campaign to make us doubt our own First Amendment values. The Kremlin wants us to believe that our society is as corrupt as the thugocracy that Putin and his cronies are trying to advance. That isn't true, but if you listen to us in this body, we regularly do very little to restore the kind of public trust that Putin is actively working to undermine.  So I ask that each Member of this body would humbly and carefully consider Chairman Rogers' rebuke to the Congress this morning. This is from the Wall Street Journal, Chairman Rogers; headline: ``America is Ill-Prepared to Counter Russia's Information Warfare.''       When historians look back at the 2016 election, they will      likely determine that it represented one of the most      successful information operation campaigns ever conducted. A      foreign power, through the targeted application of cyber      tools to influence America's electoral process, was able to      cast doubt on the election's legitimacy, engender doubts      about the victor's fitness for office, tarnish the outcome of      the vote, and frustrate the new President's agenda.       Historians will also see a feckless Congress--both      Democrats and Republicans--that focused on playing partisan      ``gotcha'' and fundamentally failed in its duty to gather      information, hold officials accountable, and ultimately serve      our country's interests.       Whether or not the Trump campaign or its staff were      complicit in Moscow's meddling is missing the broader point:      Russia's intervention has affected how Americans now view the      peaceful transition of power from one president to the next.      About this we should not be surprised. Far from it.       Propaganda is perhaps the second- or third-oldest      profession. Using information as a tool to affect outcomes is      as old as politics. Propaganda was familiar to the ancient      Greeks and Romans, the Byzantines, and the Han Each      generation applies the technology of the day in trying to      influence an adversary's people.       What's new today is the reach of social media, the      anonymity of the internet, and the speed in which falsehoods      and fabrications can propagate. Twitter averaged 319 million      monthly users in the fourth quarter of 2016. Instagram had      600 million accounts at the end of last year. Facebook's      monthly active users total 1.86 billion--a quarter of the      global population. Yet each of these staggering figures      doesn't fully capture the internet's reach.       In February, Russia's minister of defense, Sergey Shoigu,      announced a realignment in its cyber and digital assets. ``We      have information troops who are much more effective and      stronger than the former `counter-propaganda' section,'' ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2032-2.txt,2289,PROTOCOL TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY OF 1949 ON THE ACCESSION OF,2017.0,28.0,February

This is a person who is a plaintiff in multiple lawsuits, as the Oklahoma attorney general, against the This is a person who has not promised to recuse himself when he is running the So imagine that there are going to be pending lawsuits where he was the plaintiff, and they are going to still be before the He was asked in committee whether he would recuse himself, because obviously it is preposterous to be both the plaintiff and the defendant in a lawsuit. It just stands to reason. He did not promise to recuse himself.  So this is a person who has an incredibly close, uncomfortably close working relationship with the fossil fuel industry. He may have that as a sincerely held belief, but the Oklahoma State law requires that he disclose whom he is working with. Why is that relevant? Well, he actually had a couple of instances where he has taken language given to him, sent to him by email from oil companies, and he just copied it--select all, copy, drop it, paste it--onto Oklahoma attorney general letterhead, and then transmitted it to the EPA as if it were from the AG's office in So that is the context.  What did this Federal judge say today? An Oklahoma County district court judge said that according to the Oklahoma Open Records Act--Aletia Haynes Timmons from the district court of Oklahoma instructed Pruitt's office to hand over the emails by close of business next  So here we are, trying to jam through this nomination, and now it makes perfect sense why they wanted to run the clock. They had congressional delegation trips to Munich for the security conference. There were Republicans who were planning to meet with NATO allies. There was another overseas trip of great import. Yet they abandon all other obligations, all other objectives, and they are bound and determined to run this clock until 1 p.m. tomorrow because they need to vote before these emails become disclosed. Tuesday is when we will see these emails. Yet we seem to be in a[[Page S1276]]race to get this vote done tomorrow at 1 p.m. Something feels wrong about this. Something feels like they are worried about the contents of those emails.  Gosh, I hope I am wrong. I hope on Tuesday that these emails are perfunctory, professional, proper. I hope I am wrong. I hope my fears and suspicions about what may be in those emails are unfounded. But here we are in the so-called world's greatest deliberative body, and we decided we don't even need another 2 business days to deliberate or to gather more information.  This is a decision that will stick for 4 years. This is a nominee who will run one of the most important Federal agencies that there is, the one in charge of clean air and clean water. The person in charge of clean air and clean water has been corresponding with oil and gas and coal companies--nothing necessarily illegal or untoward about that, but he seems to not want people to know what the content of that correspondence was.  The context here is very, very important, and that is why I am asking that we delay this vote until every Member of the Senate can read and review these emails. I think it is very important that we understand what is in the contents of those emails because there are some things we know about Mr.I am going to try really hard not to impugn his personal motivation. I have no doubt he feels sincerely about the issues we are arguing about. I don't have any reason to believe he has personally done anything improper. But I think it is totally reasonable for us to just see what is in those emails next  This isn't that we are trying to drag this out for 6 weeks or 6 months. This isn't that we are trying to cook up an issue. I didn't know about these emails, actually, until I didn't know there was a court case. I was perfectly ready to say: Look, it looks like they have the votes. We will have our argument. Maybe we can persuade a couple of people--certainly Susan Collins has been a profile in courage here, and there are Members of the Senate on the Republican side who have been on the right side of climate. But you know what, all that gets washed away. All that gets washed away because you don't get to be on the right side of climate and vote for a climate denier for the Environmental Protection  And lest you think I am being a little bit overheated here in terms of who Scott Pruitt is, this is what Scott Pruitt has said about himself. He describes himself as a leading advocate against the EPA's agenda. On the role of the EPA he says:       I believe that the EPA has a role to play in our Republican      form of government. Air and water quality issues can cross      State lines, and can sometimes require Federal intervention.      At the same time, the EPA was never intended to be our      Nation's frontline environmental regulator.  That is kind of a well-put-together statement, but I want you to understand how radical of a statement that is, because the EPA was designed to be the Nation's frontline environmental regulation.  The basic premise is that there are certain things that can be done at the local level that ought to be done at the local level. When we configured our governments, we decided we want police forces and firehouses and other municipal services--sewer and water, and trash pickup--certain things get done locally. Some things get done at the county level. Some things get done at the State level. And what we have decided as a nation is that because pollution doesn't recognize municipal, State, or even Federal boundaries, that we actually need Federal law to make sure that if one State is polluting, it doesn't move over to the other So the idea that the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator, which is what Mr.Pruitt says, is actually quite radical. It is an intentional misunderstanding of what the EPA is for. It is intended to be our frontline environmental regulator.  Here is Mr.Pruitt on climate change:       Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates      of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists      continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global      warming and its connections to the actions of mankind. That      debate should be encouraged in classrooms, public forums and      the halls of  I have to hand it to Mr.Pruitt--he magnificently describes radical policies as though they are not radical. He is very skillful at that. He is very lawyerly at that.  He did very well, in my view, in the EPW Committee, but his views are essentially that the EPA is not the frontline in terms of protecting clean air and clean water, and that blows up the mission of the  I see the Senator from Rhode Island is here. I would be happy to entertain any questions he may have in a moment.  A couple more quotes from Mr.Pruitt on the Clean Power Plan:       The president could announce the most ``state-friendly''      plan possible, but it would not change the fact that the      administration does not have the legal authority under the      Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions.  ``[T]hat the administration does not have the legal authority for regulate carbon emissions.'' Factually wrong. Legally wrong. This has been settled. Massachusetts v. I left my law degree in my apartment, but I know Massachusetts v. EPA, and I know this is flat wrong. So what he says is totally radical. He is a skillful guy. I assume he is a good guy, but he wants to undermine the basic authorities of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water  I will finish with this quote before I yield for a question from the Senator from Rhode Island on methane regulation.       My concern is that the EPA is employing its flawed      methodology in order to rationalize new and unjustified      federal regulations to solve a methane emissions problem that      simply does not exist.  That has no basis in fact.  I see the Senator from Rhode Before I yield for his question, Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the Senators from Rhode Island and  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.

2851,topic-id,275,"Well, I thank the Senator from Rhode I think one of the great challenges is that it is one thing to misunderstand the EPA's role here; that is dangerous enough as the attorney general of a State or the head of the Republican Attorneys General But when you are in the EPA and you have charge to administer the law, to discharge your duties under Federal law, to the degree and extent that you misunderstand the authorities in the Clean Air Act as either weaker than they may be or sort of optional--I mean, this is the issue in Massachusetts v.  For instance, the question around carbon was resolved. There were a couple of questions. First of all, is carbon an airborne pollutant? The Supreme Court and the EPA made their finding, and they determined that it was an airborne pollutant.  Once you determine that something is an airborne pollutant, it is not for the EPA, on a discretionary basis, to try to regulate that airborne pollutant. They are then required under Federal law to regulate that pollutant.  So part of the misunderstanding here is the question isn't, Is the EPA authorized to regulate carbon? It is, Are they required to regulate carbon? So he has it wrong doubly--first of all, on the law and second of all, on the science.  I think the danger of putting someone like that in a position of authority[[Page S1277]]is that they will preempt States, California and others--although California has some pretty significant carve-outs--but they will at least attempt to preempt the States from doing what they want to do to protect their clean air and their clean water.

2854,topic-id,370,"Well, I thank the Senator for that question. It is a really important one because essentially what Scott Pruitt is saying is: Hey, let's let the States handle this. But if you are to take him at his word, I think it is not unreasonable to say: Well how did you handle enforcement of either State or Federal environmental law as the top cop in the State of Oklahoma? Right?  He did two things that would cause everybody to question his commitment to even local environmental protection. The first thing he did when he came in as Oklahoma AG--a lot of offices the attorney general have environmental protection units. It is like a big law firm. They have different units that handle different kinds of crime. They have a civil division; they have a criminal division. They do lots of things. One of the divisions is to enforce environmental law. He disbanded it. He disbanded the State attorney general's division that enforces environmental law. Then he beefed up this thing that did not exist until he got there, which was essentially a division to undermine Federal authorities.  So you are right. He has them coming and going. He is making an argument that the State should be empowered to enforce environmental law. At least we could take that as kind of on-the-level federalism. We have some good Republican colleagues who just really believe that the government that governs least governs best. They think that local problems should be solved at the local level, even though, in my view, when it comes to air pollution and water pollution, that is essentially preposterous because pollution moves.  I really believe that for some of these Members it is a sincerely held belief. It is hard to believe this attorney general when he says: Hey, give us the authority to enforce our environmental laws, and then, when the rubber hits the road--which is how many lawyers you put on the job, how many cops you put on the beat--he basically eviscerates the division that enforces environmental law, and he beefs up this division that is basically a little shop that sues the EPA to undermine the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act federally.

2856,topic-id,1218,"Well, I think the Senator is right. You know, it is fair to look at his record. It is also fair to look at his words. In 2016--so this is not 10 years ago; this is less than a year ago--he said: Legislation should not be ``we like clean air, so go make clean air.'' It is something that bothers me, that Congress then gives this general grant of authority to  Congress has given a general grant of authority to the That is what the law says. So, my concern, when it comes to Mr.Pruitt, is that he understands, as a member of the bar, as an attorney general, what the law says. He has been operating in a political context, I think it is fair to say, as the head of the Republican Attorneys General Working with energy companies, he has been very aggressive in cultivating friends across the country who are very enthusiastic about his nomination and potential confirmation.  But he totally misunderstands the mission of the It is granted by the Congress, a general authority to enforce clean air. That is what the EPA is, really; it is clean air, and it is clean water. That is what the EPA is about.  The thing I think is especially troubling for me when it comes to the politics of this, is that there was a bipartisan consensus for many, many, many years around the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water I believe the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act came under President George H.This used to be not very controversial because, actually, we can fight about the Iran deal, we can fight about women's reproductive health, we can fight about LGBT rights, we can fight about civil rights, we can even fight about foreign policy and the size and scope of the government, but even if you are an extremely conservative individual, you ought to believe, to the extent that we have government at all, that it should be responsible for keeping us safe and that it is a Federal role to make sure our air is clean and our water is clean.  So this person who is very skillful in kind of eluding--you know, he basically dodged punches in that EPW We have some very skillful members on the EPW committee. They are very knowledgeable, very passionate. It was rough, but he was able to avoid a sort of knockout blow. The reason is that he is a professional climate denier. This is what this guy has been training to do all of his life.  So, again: We like clean air, so go make clean air. That is something that bothers me.  The Congress then gives a general grant of authority to EPA on the Oklahoma environmental regulations. He said: Federal regional haze standards--if you live in Oklahoma, I understand. You did not vote for Barack Obama, but I don't think you thought you were voting to reduce air quality. So he says that Federal regional haze standards threaten the competitive edge Oklahomans have enjoyed for years with low-cost and reliable electric generation.[[Page S1278]]This low-cost energy not only benefits Oklahoma manufacturers, but gives the State a considerable edge in recruiting jobs. He is the attorney general. He is supposed to enforce the law. I mean, that sounds like a Member of That sounds like a Member of the State legislature. But it does not sound to me like someone who is prepared to discharge their duties under the Federal law.  Another space where Mr.Pruitt has some alarming views is on science itself. I am deeply concerned about what is happening to science, to scientists, to government research. We just confirmed the Director of OMB who, in a Facebook post, wondered out loud--he had some questions about the Zika virus. I am not sure he had any special expertise to be raising these questions. We should all be researching and be as scientifically literate as possible, but the OMB Director put on his Facebook post: I have these questions. I am really interested in this, but the real question is whether we should have publicly funded research at all.  So there is a full-on attack on science and facts. There is a full-on attack on reality. But when it comes to environmental science, it is so consequential. I am looking at these pages sitting here. I think about everybody's children and grandchildren. We just have an obligation to get the data right, to really understand what is happening with air quality and water quality.  Here is what Mr.Pruitt says about mercury. ``Human exposure to methylmercury resulting from coal fired EGUs is exceedingly small.''  This is, again, the White Stallion Energy Center versus  This is what the scientists say: ``As a result of these long-term mercury inputs, there are hotspots and whole regions, such as the Adirondacks of New York, the Great Lakes region of the Midwest and large portions of the Southeast where the fishery is contaminated with mercury.''  There are more fish consumption advisories in the United States for mercury than all other contaminants combined.  I can tell you, just on a personal level, to the Senator from Rhode Island, that I like my ahi. I like my fresh sashimi. I like tuna, and everybody in Hawaii likes fish. So you kind of watch how much marlin you eat, how much ahi you eat because we understand that there is a real mercury problem. This isn't made up. If you talk to ER doctors in Honolulu, they have to deal with mercury poisoning on a weekly basis. That is what the science shows, and that is what the reality shows.  Here is what Mr.Pruitt says: ``The record does not support EPA's findings that mercury, non-mercury metals, and acid gas pose public health hazards.''  And here is what the scientists say: ``There is no evidence demonstrating a safe level of mercury exposure.''  So before yielding for a question, I think it is really important for all of us to understand what is at stake here. We have a nominee who is really unique in the history of the EPA because never before have we had a person who has made it their life's mission to undermine the Agency which they wish to lead.  You could probably argue that Mr.Puzder, who just withdrew his nomination yesterday, had a similar kind of attitude about the Department of  But even under Republican administrations, we have had Republican Administrators of the EPA who understood: Hey, look, the law is the Clean Air Act, the law is the Clean Water Act, the law is the Endangered Species Act, and I have an obligation, as the EPA Administrator, to accept those premises--right?--and to be the EPA Administrator, to not sort of be on my crusade against Federal law.  If he wants to undermine Federal law, he can go litigate that. He can be a private attorney or he could run for the Congress and try to be a lawmaker. But to the degree and extent that he wants to run the Agency with a specific statutory mission, he has to follow those statutes. And I have seen no evidence that he has any respect for or understanding of those statutes.  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Rhode  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1275-2.txt,2173,REACTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS,2017.0,16.0,April
2858,topic-id,1278,"Well, I thank the Senator for the question.  This is what is happening today. It would be enough if we were in the process of debating and confirming a climate-denier to the It would be enough that this person is a plaintiff in 17 lawsuits against the It would be enough that he is a plaintiff in these lawsuits against the EPA and he refused to recuse himself if he is running the As Senator Markey says, he is going to be plaintiff, defendant, and judge in these lawsuits.  All of that would be enough, but today a judge is compelling him to release around 3,000 emails that have squarely to do with the debate that we are having, which is this: Is this person a little too close to the industry that he is going to regulate?  As I said before, gosh, I hope these emails, as they are disclosed, show nothing. I hope that my suspicions, my fears, my concerns are without foundation. But I think about the Republicans, the good Republicans on the other side of the aisle who are voting for this man tomorrow.  Boy, they had better hope there is nothing in those emails. They had better think very carefully about what is in those emails. They might want to delay this vote themselves because, look, if there is nothing in those emails, then we can vote two Mondays from now--no harm no foul. You have career professionals at EPA doing their job. EPA will run for another 5 or 6 business days. It is  We are the world's greatest deliberative body. We go slow on almost everything, and we are rushing on this. Why are we rushing?  Well, I was trying to figure out all week why we were rushing. Then I understood that the court was going to rule today, and they are jamming this. They are ramming this down the American people's throats.  I would just offer this to my Republican colleagues: These emails are going to be disclosed, and maybe you guys and gals know that there is nothing to be concerned about in terms of the content of these emails, where the Oklahoma attorney general is corresponding with a bunch of fossil fuel[[Page S1279]]companies. Maybe it is all good in those emails.  But the thing is, if that is the case, why did he refuse for 750 days to offer the emails up? I mean, it literally takes more work to not provide the emails than to provide the emails. You have to lawyer up to not do something. You are going to lawyer up as the Oklahoma attorney general to not comply with an Oklahoma statute. This takes a special effort.  Why would somebody want to undertake such a special effort to not comply with State law? I don't know. But I think we may find out on  Gosh, I hope I am wrong. But I have a feeling that the people who are most nervous right now about what is in those emails--in addition to the American public who care about clean air and clean water--are the Republicans who are being forced to vote at 1 o'clock without seeing them. They are being forced to vote on this person to run the EPA that they know is unpopular.  I mean, I understand that in some States this guy is tremendously popular because it is very easy to blast the In some portion of the Republican conference, Scott Pruitt is totally popular. I get that.  There is a nontrivial number of Members on the Republican side who actually don't want to be on the wrong side of the public when it comes to clean air and clean water, but they are going to be on the wrong side of the public when it comes to clean air and clean water. And it might get worse next  I really wonder why you would work so hard to not disclose the contents of 3,000 emails over a 750-day period.  I want to quote from Mr.Pruitt again on climate change:       Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates      of our time. That debate is far from settled.  Here is what the scientists say: ``The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.'' This is from the U.National Academy of Sciences in 2005. This wasn't just some sort of recently arrived at conclusion.  Here is Mr.Pruitt again on climate:       We've had ebb and flow. We've had obviously, climate      conditions change throughout our history. That's scientific      fact. It gets cooler, it gets hotter. We don't know the      trajectory, if it is on an unsustainable course. Nor do we      know the extent by which the burning of fossil fuels, man's      contribution to that, is making this far worse than it is.  I mean, sorry, this is not what the scientists say. This is what I say. That is just bunk. There was a point at which that was a tenable position, even if it was scientifically bunk, easily 15 years ago. It was politically kind of workable 10 years ago--maybe even 8 years ago and, depending on your community, 5 years ago. But there is a majority of Republicans who understand the urgency of climate change.  The only place where the reality of climate change continues to be debated fiercely is in the halls of  Local people in every community across the country understand that this thing is settled fact. This thing is upon us. You don't have to be some wonk. You don't have to understand ocean acidification. You don't have to understand exactly what is going on. You just have to, A, listen to experts who know about climate, who know about weather, who know about atmospheric science. Even if you don't believe any of the experts, you just have to believe your own experience. There is not a person out there--whether they are a fisherman on the Big Island or a farmer in the Midwest or a hunter in the Southwest--there is not a person out there who isn't experiencing the weather getting strange.  Everybody understands that 1 day of weird weather does not climate change make. But there is just no doubt that severe weather and odd weather is getting more frequent and more odd and more severe.  Here is what the scientists say about climate change:       The scientific evidence is clear: Global climate change      caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a      growing threat to society.  Here is Mr.Pruitt again:       Is it truly man-made and is this just simply another period      of time where the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? Is it      just typical, natural type of occurrences as opposed to what      the administration says?''  I mean, this is so far out of the mainstream that it would be funny if it weren't terrifying. It would be funny if it weren't terrifying to think that the person who is going to run the Environmental Protection Agency, the person who is going to be in charge of administering the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act is saying: Is it truly man-made and is this just simply just another period of time where the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? I mean, is it just a natural type of occurrence, as opposed to what the Obama administration says?  I would be happy to yield to the Senator for a question.

2862,topic-id,923,"I want to make an observation that there are a couple of kinds of willful blindness. One is willful blindness about climate change in the first place, a desire not to hear the truth, a desire to put blinders on when it comes to these issues. I will note that not every time but almost every time we have a debate on climate, we have a nice complement of Democrats on this side and a totally empty Chamber on the other side. It is not that they don't know what is going on, it is that they know exactly what is going on, and they don't want to deal with it. They don't want to deal with it, and they are good people and patriotic people, but there is a reason to believe this willful blindness is not coincidental.  I would just implore the Senate Republicans who respect the Senate, who understand our special role under the Constitution to give advice and consent on nominations for Cabinet positions, that this isn't some minor sub-Cabinet position. This isn't some matter of little import. I understand both sides employ tactics to delay action on the Senate floor. That is kind of part of the way this body works, right? The minority slows the majority down, and we try to come to some kind of consensus, sometimes a unanimous consent agreement or whatever it may be, to try to make this place work a little better, and it is maddeningly slow, but it forces bipartisanship, right?  I understand the accusation that sometimes gets made that we are just trying to delay for delay's sake. At the beginning of this week--look, I ran for the Senate because of climate. That is how passionately I feel about this issue, but I understood how this thing was lining up, and I said: Look, let's fight the fight. There is no magic between 28 hours and 30 hours. There is no magic between 29 hours of talking about this and 26 hours of talking about this. I was prepared to fight the fight and move this week. I didn't want to employ extraordinary delay tactics. I was actually even arguing with some of my colleagues, with whom I agree so much on climate, about the sort of efficacy just delaying for another couple of hours, but we are not trying to delay another couple of hours for no particular reason. There are 3,000 emails that a judge in Oklahoma is compelling Scott Pruitt to provide to the public, and not 6 weeks from now or 6 months from now but 3 business days from now. On Tuesday morning, the public and, maybe in this instance even more importantly, the Members of the U.Senate, who are in a position to determine whether this is the right person to run the Environmental Protection Agency, are going to see the contents of these emails. Do you know what? It is probably nothing. These 3,000 emails that are correspondence between the Oklahoma attorney general, the head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, and a bunch of fossil fuel companies--this guy who has sued the EPA and tried to undermine the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act 17 times, this guy who refuses to recuse himself from running the EPA, from being both a plaintiff and a defendant, I am sure the 3,000 emails he has delayed releasing for 750 days--I am sure the 3,000 e-mails he has delayed releasing for 750 days and is only going to have to provide them to the public because a court is making him, I am sure there is nothing in them.

Because it seems to me that if they are awful, it would give pause to  I just don't get why the Republicans--I understand why people want to jam this through before maybe something bad happens on Tuesday, but if I were a rank-and-file Republican, I would be saying: This looks a little goofy.

So it is not unreasonable for the public to say: Well, let me understand what the nature of your correspondence was.  My very basic question to the Members of the Senate on the Republican side is, Why in the world would we vote at 1 o'clock before we get these emails? I understand that if we had said, give us 6 months so we can see these emails, that would be preposterous. That would be us delaying for delay's sake. Listen, we feel so strongly, I think it is fair to say about this nominee that we might have even tried that, but then in that case the majority would be within their rights to say: We are not going to let you delay for delay's sake.  But this is not delay for delay's sake. There is information that is exactly on point.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1275-2.txt,2173,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,16.0,March
2870,topic-id,366,"I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for that question. The Senator is right that he has been delaying because he wants to be confirmed as the EPA Administrator before these emails become public. There is no other reason that I can think of that is so important that we get the EPA Administrator in. Remember, we have the HUD nominee, we have the Department of Commerce nominee, we have the Department of the Interior nominee, and we have the Department of Energy nominee, who has responsibility and stewardship over our nuclear arsenal. We have decided we are not going to run until Friday afternoon getting a person in charge as the Secretary of Energy to take care of our nuclear arsenal, but it is a really big hurry--and we have to literally prevent Members from meeting with NATO allies--to get this guy through. I really didn't understand earlier in the week what the big rush was and why Pruitt and why now.  Listen, every Wednesday we are in some kind of negotiation about what kind of legislation and what kind of matters come before the Senate, and both sides sort of puff up their chests and make threats about going through the weekend, and we usually come to some sort of agreement. Yet this week there was no budging, and now I get it. They were afraid this judge was going to do what this judge did. This judge is requiring these emails to come out, and I think they are terrified about what these emails say.  Do you know what? There is only one way to prove me wrong, which is to call our bluff and delay. Let's go two Mondays from now. We have a recess, and we will all read the emails. Then it will be great. We will find out that there was nothing untoward, nothing improper, nothing concerning about these 3,000 emails between the Republican attorney general from Oklahoma and these oil and gas and coal companies. I think maybe something is in those emails. Maybe I am wrong. I hope I am wrong. For the country, for the planet, I hope I am wrong.

You had rivers catching on fire.  I went to college in Southern California in, I guess, 1990 through 1994, and the success of the Clean Air Act is incredible. I mean, L.still has its smog, but because of CAFE standards, because of the Clean Air Act, because of other environmental regulations, you don't have nearly the air quality problems that you had even 20, 25 years ago, and this is a nationwide success story.  Kids had to stay home from school because of air pollution. I know everybody understands that is happening in Shanghai and in Beijing, parts of Africa, parts of the developing world, parts of the industrializing world. But 10, 20 years ago, you would have smog alerts, and kids would have to stay home from school in the United States of You had kids who couldn't function because of their asthma. So what is at stake is not a bird or a butterfly.  I got my start in politics because of conservation issues. I am interested in forest ecology and reef ecology, but I understand a lot of people live a different life than that, and they are not in a position to be worrying about birds and butterflies. But everybody worries about clean air and clean water.  So I was wondering if the Senator from Oregon could talk a little bit about the foundation of this debate. I saw the Senator from Rhode Island do this incredible exposition--as I have seen before, and nobody is better at this--in describing the forces behind what is going on. But I would like to talk about the premise that undergirds this debate, which is not about fossil fuel companies versus conservationists; it is about clean air versus dirty air, and it is about clean water versus dirty water.  I know that is something that the Senator from Oregon is very passionate about, and I wonder if he might comment on the basic idea of a clean and healthy environment and the bipartisan consensus that we ought to have related to that.

2881,topic-id,499,"Through the Chair, I would just like to ask the Senator a question. It strikes me that Governor McCall, President Nixon, I am thinking of Governor Schwarzenegger, I am thinking of Susan Collins, although I am almost sheepish to continue to single her out; it may not always be helpful to her to be singled out as the lone pro-climate person on the Republican side of the fence on this issue--but it strikes me that your beginning as an environmentalist was not based on being liberal or progressive, but your community's values, your family's values, your church's values, your Scout troop's values.  We had a really interesting lunch today with a preacher from North Carolina talking about framing political issues as moral issues. It really touched me because I am telling you, it breaks my heart to think--I mean, look, for some of these arguments about the size and the scope of the government, we just have different views on what the right size and scope and role of the Federal Government is. Some of these questions about geopolitics--tough stuff. You try to get it right. You try to have a coherent world view. Tough stuff. If you serve in the Senate long enough, you are going to get some stuff exactly right, and you may be wrong a few times.  But what really breaks my heart is to see the once-bipartisan consensus, which was based on common sense and morality that we just don't pollute our oceans, our streams, our aquifers, the air we breathe; that we try to preserve our environment for each other and for posterity; and a basic understanding that people who own businesses--especially once those businesses are incorporated and especially if those businesses are publicly traded--have a different set of imperatives. It is really hard to get each individual business that is in the mining industry or the electricity generation industry or the extraction industry or the transportation industry or the manufacturing industry to voluntarily worry every day about clean air and clean water. It is kind of like not their job. They are supposed to make stuff. They are supposed to extract stuff. They are supposed to make electronics. They are supposed to make this economy work.  So one of the ideas of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act is that we have an obligation to creation itself for those of us who are religious and for those of us who are not. That is a moral obligation, not a political obligation. We have a duty that has nothing to do with us being Democrats, and that duty doesn't stop because they decided to run for office as a  I am wondering if the Senator from Oregon could comment on the sort of degradation of the bipartisan consensus around protecting our environment, which used to be a sort of 90-percent issue, a bipartisan issue.

2910,topic-id,1090,"Mr.President, on another matter, last night we saw the House Republicans plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care After 70 years of talking about the same thing over and over again, you would think the Republicans would have been able to come up with a better plan than this. This plan is a mess.  First, it will cost average Americans more money for their healthcare, while providing fewer benefits; second, it will cut taxes for the very wealthy, making average Americans pay more for their healthcare; third, it will raise premiums and costs for older Americans; and, fourth, it will remove the guarantee that ensures Americans with preexisting conditions can get coverage.  TrumpCare will make health insurance in America measurably worse in just about every way and leave more Americans uninsured. It does, however, greatly benefit the very wealthy and special interests. Let's quickly look at each of the items I just mentioned.  First, TrumpCare will cost more and you will get less. By eliminating minimum coverage for healthcare plans and decreasing the availability of tax credits, the cost for average Americans will increase by at least $1,000 annually. That is a huge increase, like a tax increase for average Americans who need healthcare. It cuts and caps Medicaid, which has expanded health insurance to over 20 million Americans, and affects poor people, as well as many elderly who are in nursing homes, as well as their children who might have to pay for their care with the kinds of cuts we are seeing.  The bill would greatly decrease coverage for maternity care, preventive screenings, mental health, opioid treatment, and more. With respect to women, TrumpCare would send us back to the Dark Gone are the protections for maternity care, mammograms, and more. Gone is all the funding next year for Planned Parenthood, where 2.5 million women a year get healthcare. The ACA finally made it[[Page S1609]]the case that you no longer had to pay more for coverage just because you are a woman. TrumpCare rips that away, undoes the progress we made just a few years ago.  Second, TrumpCare would be a boon to the wealthy, while making working Americans pay more. The bill is a winning lottery ticket for wealthy It removes an investment tax and a surcharge on the wealthiest Americans, folks with incomes of above $250,000 a year, saving them an average of $200,000 a year, and it allows a tax break for insurance executives making over $500,000 a year.  Third, TrumpCare will raise premiums and costs for older It would repeal the Affordable Care Act's premium subsidies and replace them with refundable tax credits that could be worth thousands of dollars less than what was provided under the Under this plan, a senior without Medicare might receive only $4,000 a year in tax credits, an inadequate sum for someone of that age. One illness or a bad break, and the value of their tax credit would evaporate. It also allows insurers to charge older Americans more simply because of their age.  Finally, TrumpCare would remove the guarantee of coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions. TrumpCare is breathtakingly irresponsible. It shifts the costs and the burdens from the rich to the poor and middle class, from the government to the people, and raises premiums on older It seems designed to cover fewer Americans and make that coverage less affordable and less generous. It seems designed to make America sick again.  We don't even know how large a negative impact this bill will have because Republicans are irresponsibly rushing forward before this bill even receives a score from the Congressional Budget  After years of howling at the Moon, at Democrats for rushing through the Affordable Care Act, the mantra they said over and over again on the floor here and in the House was ``read the bill.'' Republicans are having committee votes 2 days after the bill is released.  No wonder they don't want anyone to know what is in the bill. They are rushing it through because it is very hard to defend what they have done, and the longer it is out there, the harder it is going to be for their colleagues, Republicans, to vote for it. Lawmakers will be voting blind, without a final analysis of how this bill will affect overall coverage and affordability. I know this affects a lot of my colleagues on the other side.  We have no knowledge of how this affects the deficit. It is removing a lot of the revenues for healthcare without replacing them. In all likelihood--we will see what CBO says--the deficit is going to go way up.  The President is already throwing his arms around this plan, and ultimately he and his party will bear the responsibility for its passage and implementation. At this time, I would like to remind President Trump that he said repeatedly in the campaign that he would expand treatment for Americans suffering from opioid addiction, but this mess of a replacement bill would rip treatment away from hundreds of thousands of Americans dealing with opioid addiction. President Trump said he would ensure Americans with preexisting conditions would continue to have access to coverage, but this bill makes that harder in several ways. President Trump, in his campaign, said:       Everybody's got to be covered. . . . I am going to take      care of everybody. I don't care if it's going to cost me      votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of, much      better than they're being taken care of now. . . . They can      have their doctors. They can have their plans, they can have      everything.  ``They can have everything.''  Well, if you read the bill the way it reduces funding for Medicaid and replaces the Affordable Care Act subsidies with much smaller tax credits, there is just no way this bill meets the President's standard.  Was the Affordable Care Act perfect? It could use some improvements, but Democrats spent a long time thinking about it and crafting the policy to achieve two very real and specific goals, expand coverage, lower costs.  TrumpCare will do the very opposite. If it has any one coherent positive goal, it is to limit the tax burdens on the very wealthy, and in the process it will badly hurt millions of Americans and throw our healthcare system back into chaos.  If the final product out of the House looks anything like this draft, the Senate should consider it a moral duty to reject it.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1608-6.txt,1036,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,7.0,March

3053,topic-id,725,"Mr.President, I will speak and then make my two motions, and then the Senator from Arkansas can speak and either object or not, whatever he decides.  Mr.President, earlier I spoke at length on the President's Executive order. I just want to repeat that this Executive order has made us less safe, less secure, put our troops in the field at increased risk, and was implemented in a way that has caused chaos and confusion across the country. Most fundamentally of all, it is un-It flies in the face of a grand American tradition of granting refuge to those fleeing persecution, regardless of their race, religion, or political views. It is dangerous. It is shameful. It is wrong. It must be reversed immediately. And I know that many of my colleagues agree with me. They know this is wrong. A dozen Republican Senators and counting, including my good friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, have expressed serious concern. One former Republican CIA Director said that it ``makes us less safe than we were on Friday.''  So let's repeal the order and then sit down to discuss a smart, thoughtful, effective way to counter terrorism. President Obama wanted tougher vetting. Democrats are happy to look at proposals to that effect but not this ineffective, un-American policy that will do more to empower our enemies and inspire those around the globe who would do us harm.  Now I am going to make a second unanimous consent request, and I will do them seriatim, as the UC allowed.  The second request is, I ask unanimous consent that we delay the confirmation vote on Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson until these Executive orders are overturned and he commits to opposing them.  So far, this is the most important foreign policy order of the new administration, and in the committee hearing for his nomination, Mr.Tillerson appeared--he wasn't 100 percent certain--to roundly reject the idea of a blanket travel ban just like the one President Trump signed. He said: ``I don't support a blanket type of travel ban on people coming to this country.'' He stressed in his opening statement that moderate Muslims are going to be our greatest allies in the fight against Islamic extremists. The implication was that he wouldn't support a proposal that would in any way alienate and inflame them. He said he didn't think it was helpful to suggest that Americans should be afraid of That would suggest he might be wary about a policy that explicitly singles out seven majority-Muslim countries for different treatment under U.policy.  Now, many of the comments Mr.Tillerson made to the committee are at odds with the President's policy. So Democrats and Republicans alike and the American people, most of all, deserve to know whether Mr.Tillerson would implement this Executive order or not because it seems to directly contradict comments he made under oath to a Senate committee. Key allies around the world are wondering whether the potential future Secretary of State supports this policy, and so are the American people.  Here are some important questions: Did he have any involvement or consultation in the construction or drafting of the Executive order? How would he answer the outcries from countries around the world that are asking that President Trump rethink this policy? Does he think it would make us less safe? Does he think it would alienate moderate Muslim communities in the United States and around the world? And does he believe current green card holders should be subjected to another round of scrutiny if they come back to the United States, even though they have been vetted before?  We need these answers from President Trump's nominees, and Mr.Tillerson's nomination is before the Senate right now, so it is imperative that we know what he thinks before moving forward.  So, Mr.President, I am making two unanimous consent requests.  First, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senator Feinstein's bill, 240, introduced earlier today; that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be considered read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; finally, that there be no amendments, motions, or points of order in order to the bill.

3072,topic-id,1406,"Mr.President, so we have had a number, a large number of eloquent speeches about the President's Executive order. While they were going on, of course, we had a Monday night massacre. Sally Yates, a person of great integrity, who follows the law, was fired by the She was fired because she would not enact, pursue, the Executive order on the belief that it was illegal, perhaps unconstitutional.  It was a profile in courage. It was a brave act and the right act. I hope the President and his people who are in the White House learned something from this; first, that we are a nation under the rule of law. You cannot just sit down, Twitter something out, and then think: Let's enact it. It is a complicated country. When you do something as major as what the President proposed in his Executive order, you have to think it through. You have to talk to people.  Sally Yates was the Acting Attorney Why wasn't she consulted? Maybe they would have known what she felt and maybe they would not have done what they did. Clearly, that lack of consultation went up and down the line. Sally Yates is from a different administration. General Kelly was President Trump's selection.  He learned of this Executive order when he got a phone call from the White House while he saw it being announced on television. How can you run a country like that? I am hearing from my constituents in New There are hard-core Trump supporters. They are for him. But they are a small minority of New  There are many progressive, liberal, and pro-immigrant people. Obviously, they are horrified, but I would say this to the President and his minions. There are a lot of people who voted for[[Page S486]]President Trump--not the hard core--and they are appalled by the simple ineptitude of this administration. Substantively, even more important, how can you run a country like this? How can you make a major order, major doing, and not check it out with your Homeland Security Secretary, with the Justice Department and the Attorney General?  I will say, if this continues, this country has big trouble. We cannot have a Twitter We cannot have a Presidency that thinks: Oh, this sounds good. Let's just go do it and not think the consequences through. Most of all, we cannot have a Presidency that does not understand the beauty and depth of America, in this case when it comes to immigrants.  We have been an amazing country. In the city in which I live there is a big lady in the harbor with a torch. It is a beautiful symbol. Americans revere it and admire it. The world reveres it and admires it. Why? Because it says: America will be a place where people can take refuge if they are persecuted religiously, politically, and then they can build a great life for themselves.  That is a beautiful thing. That moral force of America helps us win wars, helps us win support, helps us be the greatest country in the world that everyone admires.  Of course, we need a strong military. Of course, we need a strong economy. Praise God, America has had both through the decades, but we also have been a moral beacon, ``God's noble experiment,'' as the Founding Fathers called it. In those days, as now, we have welcomed people from distant shores and said: Come be  Our President is trampling on that, to be honest with you. The idea that immigrants are preponderantly criminals and preponderantly terrorists is absurd. They are the future of In my State of New York, 25 percent of the people are foreign born, probably as high as 40 percent if you are either foreign born or had a parent foreign born.  They are great New I was with a Syrian refugee this week. He and his wife and his children had just come. His parents were American citizens. They had come to America in 1970. The parents and Mr.Elias, who lived in the Bronx, came here. He was a tailor. We don't have that many fine tailors in America these days. It is a lost art. So people who do it tend to be immigrants; mainly from Italy is my experience.  But he was a tailor from He then did what immigrants do in He founded a little business. He reupholsters boats, a lot of them in a place in the Bronx called City He built a company. He made America better. He is a Syrian immigrant.  His children and grandchildren were in danger. A suicide bomber had even blown up himself in front of their home nearly killing them. They just got in this month. Had Donald Trump's Executive order been in effect several weeks earlier, they would not have been able to get here. They might have perished. They might have been hurt.  Similarly, another guy I met is Mohammed knows He was so impressed by America, by the lady with the torch, by our values, by what we stand for, that he volunteered to be a translator for our soldiers. He put his life in danger for doing that.  Then he began to get threats from the terrorists in He is an His wife was in danger. His children were in danger. He came January 5. Again, had President Trump and his evil order--and that is what it is, it is evil--gone into effect January 1, for all we know Mohammed would have died for helping our soldiers.  Do we have to prevent terrorists from coming into America?  The greatest source of terror are lone wolves. Americans, citizens--ISIS gets its evil ideas in their heads, and they do terrorist things.  John McCain, my colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona who is an expert on this stuff, said: This Executive order will encourage and increase the number of lone wolves.  Here is another group that needs tightening, I would suggest to the President and his minions: those available in the Visa Waiver If you are a country that has generally been friendly to us, there is something called the Visa Waiver Program, which means you can come into this country with very few questions asked, very little vetting.  Refugees are vetted for 2 years. That is why not a single refugee from any of the countries that were proscribed by the President has committed an act of terror here--not a single one.  I heard someone defending the President saying: Well, all these people would have come in; the terrorists would have come in had they done it slowly and announced a date.  Well, we have done it like this for 15, 20 years, and we haven't had a single terrorist come in. What kind of absurdity is that?  Anyway, the Visa Waiver Program allows people from, say, France and Belgium to come into this country with few questions asked. We have seen French citizens, Belgian citizens do terrorism. They would be allowed to come into this country to do it here. Why aren't we tightening that up? That is what should be done.  So I am going to conclude. The evening is late.  Sally Yates was a profile in courage, a profile in courage. Maybe some of her courage, her insight, and her wisdom would rub off on the people in the White Maybe they will back off and repeal this Executive order, and then we can work together and truly try to tighten up the laws, the actions of the administration to prevent terrorists from coming in.  This Executive order makes us less safe. It was poorly done in a slipshod, quick way that foretells real trouble in the White House, and, most of all, it has done more to tarnish the great American dream, the great moral force of America that has, in part, made us the greatest country in the world--in 1, 2 days, undoing the work of generations.  Please, Mr.President, reconsider. Really think about this. Don't just tweet. Don't just get mad. Don't just call names. Think about it. Change it. Repeal it.  It is too far gone to change; we have to repeal it. And then maybe we can work together on tightening up some of the areas that I have talked about.  I see my friend from Arizona has come to the floor, and I will not hold him up, so I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS467-2.txt,1036,OBAMACARE,2017.0,30.0,January

Indeed, for more than seven decades, Congress has stood strong on a bipartisan basis, first against the Soviet Union and now against Russian threats against the United States and our European allies. Working across the aisle in Congress, we have supported the NATO alliance. Beginning after World War II with the Marshall Plan and continuing to this day with the European Reassurance Initiative, we have helped to build the richest economies and the most robust democracies the world has ever seen, protected in large part in Western Europe by  Today we face new and unprecedented threats from an increasingly aggressive Russia continues to illegally occupy territory in Georgia and It is on the march in Syria, and it is building up its military presence and making threatening moves toward the Baltic States and in the  There is growing evidence that it is actively interfering to spread disinformation and manipulate the outcome of elections this year in France, Germany, and across In fact there is evidence to suggest that they were involved in the Brexit vote and in the Dutch referendum last year.  Right here in our own country, Russia has used brazen cyber attacks and other measures to aggressively interfere in our Presidential election last fall. This was an attack on our sovereignty, on our democracy, and on the American people, and it was unprecedented. It requires the strongest possible response, short of armed force, to demonstrate to Vladimir Putin that this behavior will not be tolerated and it must not happen again. That is exactly the purpose of these comprehensive sanctions.  I agree with Senator Cardin, the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, that the Foreign Relations Committee should play a pivotal leadership role in both our legislative and oversight capacities in pushing back against Russia's aggression in all its forms. By all means, this includes making the case that the skills and experience of our State Department and USAID professionals are more important than ever.  In Eastern Europe, in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, and all across the world, they are working to increase the resilience of our allies by strengthening democratic institutions, fostering the rule of law, and fighting corruption. These initiatives have played an indispensable role in helping the United States prevail in the Cold War, and they are every bit as important today as we oppose Russian aggression.  We had the opportunity in the Armed Services Committee to hear from an expert talking about Russia and about Russia's strategy. One of the things he pointed out is that, just as Russia is building up its military might, just as it is expanding its propaganda initiatives through television broadcasts like ``Russia Today'' and ``Sputnik,'' it is also looking at how it can undermine Western democracies as a way to interrupt the transatlantic alliance--the alliance between the United States and Europe that has been so important to stability in the world for the last 70 years.  That is Russia's real goal. They want to undermine They want to undermine the West and the United One of the ways they are trying to do that is by disrupting our elections. We can't allow this kind of aggression to go unpunished. If we do, we will surely face further attacks from an emboldened Russia looking to disrupt our democracy. Indeed, I think this attack should be answered with the most punishing economic and financial sanctions that we can muster, and we need to work even harder to[[Page S1683]]shore up our European allies who are facing Russian aggression and interference.  As we look at the upcoming French and German elections, there is no doubt that Russia is trying to interfere with those elections, as well, with the goal of undermining our democracy. When one begins to mess around with our elections, they strike at the heart of a democracy that is the foundation of this country.  I commend Senator McCain and Senator Cardin for introducing this bipartisan sanctions legislation, and I hope that Senators on both sides of the aisle will join us in passing these comprehensive sanctions against  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.

2971,topic-id,1308,"Mr.President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to reject this resolution to roll back accountability for the billions of dollars that are sent to States to help educate children.  When Congress updated the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 2015, it was a bipartisan achievement. Republicans and Democrats came together on the 50th anniversary of that landmark civil rights law to rewrite it into what became the Every Student Succeeds  When President Obama signed this K-12 legislation into law in December of that year, he called it a ``Christmas miracle.'' It received 85 votes in the It was one of the most important pieces of bipartisan legislation passed in the last  It wasn't the bill I would have written, but it was a bipartisan compromise. It gave States and districts far more flexibility when it comes to improving their struggling public schools. At the same time, it also maintained critical civil rights and accountability protections to ensure that when the Federal Government gives States billions of dollars to improve the education of their students, that money goes to the schools and students that need those Federal resources the most. It was a critical step toward making sure we are building a future not just for some of our kids but for all of our kids.  When Congress passes big, complex laws like the Every Student Succeeds Act, it always leaves some of the implementation details to the agency that has to enforce the law. That is why I fought hard to make sure the Department of Education had the tools it needs to write clarifying rules and guidelines to enforce the Every Student Succeeds That was a condition of my vote and the votes of lots of other people. We won that fight. The authority to enforce the rules is right there in the law. It was debated in public, and it was part of the bipartisan agreement between Republicans and  Last November, the Department of Education--after careful consultation with teachers, school leaders, State education leaders, and parents--issued new rules to enforce this law. Today, congressional Republicans are trying to take a sledgehammer to these new rules.  When these new rules were issued, everyone who works in education agreed that they were critical and necessary. Teachers were fine with the new rules. State education leaders were fine with the new rules. Civil rights leaders were fine with the new rules. Everyone was ready to get to work. Apparently, congressional Republicans do not care. Instead, they want to blow up these critically important accountability rules even though the people who work in or around public education did not ask them to do so. This makes no sense.  Groups that often disagree with each other over public education policies are united in their belief that this resolution is a dumb idea. It is opposed by teachers; civil rights organizations, such as the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza; and organizations representing students with disabilities, such as the National Center for Learning It is even opposed by the U.Chamber of Commerce because they know this resolution will only make it more difficult for States as they try to implement the new education law. And this resolution will undermine the work States are currently doing right now to improve their public schools with the new law.  Last week, many of these groups signed on to a letter that states: ``This action will cause unnecessary confusion, disrupting the work in states and wasting time that we cannot afford to waste.''  In fact, even conservative education policy experts at the Fordham Institute--a right-leaning educational policy think tank--argue that congressional Republicans should not swing a wrecking ball to these guidelines.[[Page S1682]]  They identified over 20 provisions in these rules that actually provide more flexibility to States by clarifying ambiguous sections in the law, and they concluded: ``Senate Republicans, then, should scrap their plan to use the Congressional Review Act to kill all of the accountability regulations outright.''  Killing these new rules now would lead to chaos and confusion just when States, districts, and school leaders are beginning to implement this new K-12 education law. States have already spent months drafting their plans for complying. Eighteen States, including Massachusetts, intended to submit their implementation plans to the Department of Education next month. If this resolution passes, all of that work will be thrown into limbo.  These clarifying rules include important provisions that allow States to send additional Federal resources to struggling schools, whether or not those schools already receive Federal dollars; provisions that give States more flexibility in educating their English learners in the manner that best meets the needs of each individual student; provisions that ensure that parents have more information about how their child's public school is doing and sets clear guidelines with what States and districts must disclose to parents and when they must disclose it; and provisions that promote transparency by preventing States from manipulating their graduation rates or data on how much money they are investing in each student. These regulations were carefully crafted over the course of 1 year of input from teachers, school system leaders, and student advocates. Both Republicans and Democrats should support these provisions.  I think we all know what is going on here. Betsy DeVos is the new Secretary of Congressional Republicans have decided they want to hand over the keys to her with no restrictions whatsoever. The resolutions we are debating today would give Secretary DeVos more freedom to push States in whatever direction she felt like. If you are a teacher in Tennessee or a principal in Massachusetts, you should be furious about that. Congress is about to scrap a year of hard work and a year of careful compromise in order to give Secretary DeVos a blank check.  It is a blank check for Betsy This is the same Secretary of Education who has never attended a public school, never taught in a public school, and never led a public school. This is the same Secretary of Education who proved to the world, during her confirmation hearing, that she doesn't have a clue about public schools. This is the same Secretary of Education who still holds shady investments that could be hiding conflicts of interest. This is the same Secretary of Education who has used her vast fortune to advance her extreme privatization agenda. This is the same Secretary of Education whom Jeff Sessions and the Vice President of the United States had to drag across the finish line in an unprecedented tie-breaking confirmation vote. She is the one to whom Senate Republicans want to give a blank check to figure out where she wants to drive public education--a blank check to push her radical privatization agenda.  States and school districts are planning for the next school year right now. They are figuring out how to implement this law and improve the education of kids as I speak. They are doing hero's work every day while Congress wastes time and creates more confusion.  Handing this law over to an Education Secretary with no experience in public education without any accountability rules to guide its implementation is an insult. It is an insult to teachers, an insult to school leaders, and an insult to families everywhere.  This is not a game. Congress should not be playing politics with the education of our children. Instead of disrupting the important work that States and districts are doing to educate our kids, Congress should get out of the way and let States finish what they have already started. Let them get to work. That is why I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

3068,topic-id,4437,"Mr.President, on Friday night, President Donald Trump issued an Executive order that strikes at the very heart of our democracy.  I wish I were exaggerating. I wish this were some sort of game. But the ban that imposes religious tests and keeps refugees and immigrants from entering our country is illegal, it is unconstitutional, it is immoral, and it must be overturned.  The effects of this order were immediate and terrifying for people in Massachusetts and all across this country. My office got a call from an Iranian citizen who was traveling to Massachusetts to see his daughter who is currently receiving treatment for cancer. He was denied boarding in Germany and sent back to We heard from a woman who already has an approved immigrant visa but still hasn't found an airline that will allow her to board a flight to the United A Massachusetts resident called because her cousin who holds a student visa was not allowed to board a flight either. Another Massachusetts resident called because her Iranian sisters were denied boarding at London Both have their valid J-1 visas. One is a visiting professor at Harvard, and the other is a postdoc fellow at Harvard We heard from an Iranian student studying at She was denied entry on Saturday, and when she tried to return on Sunday, after the temporary stay had been issued, she was denied boarding by A Massachusetts student on a student visa called because his wife was denied boarding in  None of these people are criminals. None of these people are threats. They are students at some of the world's top universities; they are doctors and scientists at some of the country's best hospitals. Most of them have already been vetted and granted the right to come to One is a father who wants to see his cancer-stricken daughter. They are husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, friends and neighbors. They are people. They are real people. They are part of what makes Massachusetts great, and they are part of what makes America great.  Donald Trump's radical ban on Muslims isn't in line with American values or with our It is also not in line with what the Republican Party stands for.  In the months following the attacks of September 11, President George Bush made a point to remind the United States that we were not at war against In a speech in April of 2002, he said:       America rejects bigotry. We reject every act of hatred      against people of Arab background or Muslim faith. America      values and welcomes peaceful people of all faiths--Christian,      Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and many others. Every faith is      practiced and protected here, because we are one country.      Every immigrant can be fully and equally American because      we're one country. Race and color should not divide us,      because America is one country.  Do Senate Republicans agree? If so, then come down here and say so. Where are you? Where are Senate Republicans when their Republican President issues an order targeting one religious group?  Let's be clear about what happened here. Keeping the details secret, working with a small group of operatives inside the White House, consulting no experts in diplomacy or homeland security, and getting advice from outsiders with no actual legal authority, President Trump acted unilaterally to issue this order.  Make no mistake, while it may not affect every Muslim in the world, Donald Trump's Executive order is a Muslim ban, and it is unconstitutional.[[Page S475]]This is a crisis. The Senate should take up and pass Senator Feinstein's bill to overturn this illegal order right now. What is happening is shocking. It is shocking, but it is not surprising.  Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he was going to do. During his Presidential campaign, he promised ``a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.'' That is what he said. Last year, it seemed like pretty much everyone agreed that this was not acceptable in the United States of  Speaker Paul Ryan declared:       A religious test for entering our country is not reflective      of America's fundamental values. I reject it.  Where are you now, Paul Ryan? Have you rejected President Trump's order to impose a religious test for entering our country? Have you introduced a bill to overturn it? You have the power. Where are you?  As Governor of Indiana, Vice President Mike Pence said: ``Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.are offensive and unconstitutional.'' Where are you right now, Vice President Pence? Have you called to overturn President Trump's offensive and unconstitutional order? Have you asked Republicans to introduce a bill to overturn it? You have a platform. Where are you?  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called a Muslim ban ``completely and totally inconsistent with American values.'' Where are you right now, Mitch McConnell? Have you rejected President Trump's Muslim ban that is completely and totally inconsistent with American values? Have you introduced a bill to overturn it? You have the power. Where are you?  President Trump ignored these Republican leaders. Today these Republican leaders will not stand up for what is right. President Trump may be willing to ignore the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and the Republican leadership in Congress may be willing to ignore the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, but the American people are not.  This weekend, Americans across this country came together to reject this sort of fear and hate. The American people showed courage, even as the Republican leadership hid out. Crowds of people raced to airports across this country to welcome immigrants and refugees and to demand compliance with court rulings that gave individuals and families temporary relief and to demand that this reckless order be rescinded.  I was proud to stand with hundreds of people at Logan Airport in Boston on Saturday night and then with more than 20,000 people in Copley Square on We had one of the biggest demonstrations in the country. I also want to say I am in awe of the hundreds of lawyers and translators who dropped everything and spent sleepless nights in airport terminals and courts fighting for justice. Because of their tireless work, we have already been able to undo some of the damage caused by President  While I am encouraged by our victories in the courts this weekend, the Trump administration has derided these judges and, in some instances, refused to follow these orders. This is shocking and unconstitutional. Congress must act. We must act now. Congress must stand up and say to President Trump that this is not who we are. Congress must say to Donald Trump and to the world: We will not turn our backs on lawful immigrants and refugees fleeing murderers. We will not turn our backs on people who risk their own lives to protect our soldiers in Iraq and in the fight against We will not give ISIS more recruiting material. We will not promote an imagined religious war between America and We will stand for our values, for American values, for human values. We will not be divided by hate and fear.  Fifteen months ago, I traveled to the Greek island of This is the first stop for many Syrian refugees as they flee from the terrorists of That was where I saw the shoddy, paper-thin river rafts that people cram onto, with nothing more than a hope and a prayer that they will make it across a choppy sea. I saw the little plastic pool floaties that people put on small children, hoping it would be enough to save them if the raft went down.  I met a 7-year-old girl who had been sent out on that perilous journey alone. I thought about what horrors her parents must have faced to hand a wad of cash to human smugglers with only the most desperate dream that their little girl would find something better on the other side.  President Trump is trying to shut the door on that little girl and on countless others who are fleeing for their lives. He is trying to shut the door on children, on doctors, on students, on engineers, on husbands and wives, on grandmas and grandpas. That is not all. President Trump is trying to shut the door on people who risked their lives helping American soldiers, people who face execution in the hands of terrorists if they are sent back.  President Trump is even trying to shut the door on legal immigrants, on students and faculty, on people who work in Massachusetts and across this country, on people who have already been thoroughly screened for entry into the United States and have been granted permanent status to live and work in our country. This has nothing to do with security--nothing.  Little girls fleeing from murderers are not a threat. Elderly grandparents detained at airports are not a threat. Students and teachers and people who work in Massachusetts and across the country are not a threat. Iraqi translators who put their own lives at risk to protect American soldiers are not a threat. We should welcome them. We should welcome them with open arms. That is who we are.  Voices from across the political spectrum, including many of my friends from across the aisle, have already stepped forward to criticize this order, but criticism is not enough. President Trump's Executive order must be overturned. We must overturn it.  For those who remain unconvinced, I would like to take some time this evening to talk about some of the people who are hurt by the President's reckless, heartless, illegal, and unconstitutional actions. As stories have poured into my office, on the evening news, on social media, we have heard time and again about the consequences of President Trump's reckless and illegal order, and I would like to share some of those stories in my time tonight. I want to read one.  My staff and I have spent the weekend listening to and meeting with people who have been affected. I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of President Trump's actions. I want to start with a story of someone I met at Logan Airport on Saturday night. The story I want to read is from CBS Boston, ``Detainee Released After Federal Judge Grants Stay On Trump's Immigration Freeze.''       Hamed Hosseini Bay was questioned at Logan Airport Saturday      while trying to get back into America after caring for his      sick father in his native Hosseini Bay has lived in the      Boston area for approximately nine years. After a judge      granted a case brought by lawyers from the American Civil      Liberties Union Saturday night, Hosseini Bay was reunited      with his wife and daughter, who had traveled with him to Iran      but returned two weeks earlier.       He was not angry about his questioning.       ``Everybody was friendly,'' Hosseini Bay told WBZ-TV's Jim      ``They had to do what they had to do. I'm grateful for      all the people back there, but it was chaotic.''       Hosseini Bay's wife is now questioning what the future will      be like for her family in ``It's just terrifying how      my life has changed in two days, in three days,'' she said.      ``I don't know (about the future). Last week everything was      normal. I would pick up my daughter from preschool, she was      like everyone else, I was like everyone else. But now we're      different.''  I met with this family. This is what President Trump's order means. It means stopping people like this and telling them that their future is different now in  I am going to read another story. This one is from NBC ``Protesters Rally as Doctors, Students Blocked From Entering Country After Trump's Orders.''       At Boston's Logan International Airport, at least six      people from Iran were detained Saturday after their flights      landed in the U.A Federal judge in New York issued a      temporary stay late Saturday for all detainees affected by      Trump's executive orders, which barred all refugees from      entering the United States for four months, and indefinitely      halted any from Trump argued the ban is needed to keep      out ``radical Islamic terrorists.''       A tweet by Samira Asgari, an Iranian doctor, stated that      she was denied boarding when she arrived for her flight to      the U.S.[[Page S476]]     from In a Skype interview from Switzerland, Asgari      told us she had planned to come to the U.to start a study      at Harvard Medical School analyzing tuberculosis.       ``My view of America of course, doesn't change because of a      decision a politician makes. My view of America changes      because the land that used to be the land of those who want      to be there, who want to do something good to the community      and take something good from the community--that picture of      America has changed for me,'' she said.       Several students at Massachusetts colleges also tweeted      that they were being blocked from entering the country.       In a statement, MIT officials said they're ``very      troubled'' that Trump's executive order is affecting the      university's community and are exploring options for helping      impacted students.       Northeastern University in a statement to their community      offered support to their students, faculty and staff      reminding them of ``their commitment to each other.''       We believe in the commitment to inform each other, but that      is what it is that Donald Trump is trying to destroy.  Another story, from WBUR, a ``Somali Family Resettling In Lowell Worries For Other Refugees As Trump Promises Restrictions.''       The order will have global implications, including for one      newly arrived Somali family now living in       The three Ahmed sisters from Somalia huddled on a couch      with their mother in a lobby of a busy office. Each woman      wore a brightly colored head scarf and winter jacket, and      each clutched a plastic bag carrying their personal      documents.       They are the most recent refugees to be welcomed at the      International Institute of New England's Lowell resettlement      office. And, with Trump's refugee restrictions hanging in the      balance, they are likely the last Somali family to enter the      state for some time.       ``My mom and dad fled from the conflict in Mogadishu,''      explained Hawo Ahmed, 24. She and her twin sister were only 4      months old when their parents fled for       Hawo retold the story of her mother, Fatuma, and why she      and Hawo's father left in 1993 amid the Somali Civil       ``She said that it was, like, conflict all over the      country,'' Hawo said. ``People were killing each other, like      tribes, different tribes were killing each other. Whenever      they see you, they kill you, and they even used to come in      the houses to rape the girls and kill them. So they had to      move.''       The youngest daughter, Asha, was born in Kenya, where the      girls grew up, and went to school and learned Still,      they all very much consider themselves       When asked about their father, one of the young women said      she watched him die in 2006 from an asthma attack. She said      the family didn't have enough money for a new inhaler.       After beginning the refugee application process in Kenya 6      years ago, the family arrived in Manchester, NH, only a few      days ago.       Hawo and Muna said their arrival barely felt real, like a      dream come true. And then, Hawo said, as soon as they got off      the plane, they saw the news about Trump's executive orders      on the airport television.       ``Even tears were filled up in my eyes, because I felt very      bad for others,'' she said. ``They have more expectations,      some were even told where they are going, which city they are      going, and if they stop all the things, it's going to be very      painful. I just have a very sincere request to the President,      that he should drop out that idea. That is all.''       Hawo said that they know many fellow refugees in Kenya who      are in the final phases of their application process.       She said her aunt and cousin, who live in a refugee camp in      Kampala, Uganda, had only one more interview to complete      before they were hoping to meet them in Now      they're not sure what will happen.       ``I couldn't sleep last night just thinking about them, and      she has been in the process for so long, and we want, if you      can help her,'' Hawo said.  That is what Donald Trump is doing to people around the world.  Another story--WCVB       Trump's executive order worries Massachusetts family      awaiting loved one.       With the stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump fulfilled      a campaign promise that temporarily bans more than 130      million people from entering the United       Several people were prevented from entering Boston due to      Trump's executive order.       ``We are very worried. We are very concerned,'' Omar Salem,      of Canton, said. ``I'm hoping for the best. I'm hoping that I      could get a text from him saying, `I'm here.'''       Salem is anxiously awaiting his brother's arrival back in      The Syrian-born, Boston-based orthodontist was      on vacation when the President signed the executive order      suspending visa entry from seven countries.       ``We didn't know it was going to be that bad and that      shameful,'' Salem said.       Salem's brother thought his green card would be enough to      secure his return, but the business owner is now facing      uncertainty.       ``It always starts somewhere and we see it evolving to      become much bigger and much more sophisticated,'' Salem said.       While Salem is hoping to see his brother soon, his heart is      heavy for the millions of refugees and visa holders, who see      the U.as a sanctuary of freedom and acceptance.       ``I really call it un-American to do this with the stroke      of a pen,'' Salem said.       The seven countries included in the executive order may be      just a starting point as the order left room for a broader      ban.  That is what Donald Trump is doing around the world.  Another story--this is a Facebook post from Niki Rhamati, a student at       I just got back home (Tehran) and I figured I should break      the silence. I want to start by saying how grateful I am to      all the friends, faculty, alums, sorority sisters, staff and      admin at MIT and other parts of the US who have contacted me      in the past couple of hours. My inbox is flooded with      messages and emails of love and support. I am truly      speechless, grateful and proud to be part of the MIT      community. I have never been subjected to any form of      religious or racial discrimination at Our community is      extremely diverse, inclusive, supportive and accepting of      individuals and their backgrounds. But I cannot believe all      this love is coming from the same country that banned me from      entering its borders just a couple of hours ago.       I don't want to get to the political mess that has created      this situation for me and many others. I just want to share      what millions of other people and I are going through, and      simply what it feels like to be an Iranian and targeted to      such racism and discrimination--things I have been very      familiar with most of my life.       I currently have a valid multiple entry student visa that      I've used for the past year and a half and have traveled very      smoothly (thank you Obama!). I came home (Tehran) to visit my      parents and family. I suspected I would not be able to travel      as easily as before with the new President, so I extended my      stay.       Here's the story of what happened this past week. On      Wednesday, I woke up to the announcement of the new Executive      Order by President Trump that would restrict entry for Syrian      refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries      (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen) for 30      days. As BBC Persian, one of the reliable sources here,      contacted immigration attorneys and Politicians, this order      was read and interpreted as, ``issuance of any types of      immigrant and non-immigrant visas would be banned for      citizens of those countries for 30 days.''       The President had not yet signed this order so the ban was      not yet effective. I changed my flight to another one that      would get me to Boston on Saturday night with a transfer in      It was rumored that the President signed the Order      once I was on my way to the airport, and it was executed      while I was in my first flight to But I looked on the      White House website, BBC and Washington Post and nothing had      been published yet. When I got to Doha, I was stopped at the      gate for my U.flight.       We found out that the ban (which is effective for 90 days      now instead of 30), included everyone currently holding an      immigrant, student or tourist visa as well as Green Card      holders. We heard a lot of people were deported at the      American border in different cities.       About 30 other Iranians and I were stuck in Doha, waiting      for flights back to Among them were old couples      trying to go and see their children in the US, 2 old women      trying to be with and help their pregnant daughters there for      their third trimesters, students who had just gotten their      visas and families who had sold their belongings back home so      they could build a better life in the All these people      had gotten visas legally and had gone through background      checks. The President had said that the goal of this Order      was dealing with illegal immigration. Do any of the people      sound like illegal immigrants?       This will not secure the borders from the terrorism and      illegal immigrants. It will only increase racism in the      American society. The President is trying to make      Islamophobia a norm and policy by which he wants to lead the      country. There has not been a single terrorist activity from      those 7 countries listed above, in the       If you feel like helping millions of people facing this,      please contact your representatives or senators in your areas      and ask them to fight against this absurd ban. Reach out to      friends and ask them to do the same. Please also let me and      everyone else know how we can contribute to this.       As I was stuck in Doha, with other Iranians, I was telling      stories of interactions with many of the Americans I know.      Please know that I love and respect all of you because you      have always treated me with love and respect.  This is who Donald Trump is trying to keep out of the country.

He is currently safe in the United  Emam has also decided to begin his U.citizenship application, and the couple have two young children whom they are raising in the United States, afraid to travel outside the United States on business because of President Trump's ban.  Another story. This is a story via the Wall Street       Iraqi interpreter Laith al-Haydar received multiple death      threats for working with the American military at the height      of the war in his country. In return for helping the U.S., he      and tens of thousands of other Iraqis were promised U.     immigration visas.       Nearly four years after he applied, the 41-year-old father      of two is still waiting for a visa--and now he faces a new      setback: President Donald Trump signed an order suspending      immigration from several countries with a Muslim majority,      including Iraq, and a temporary ban on all refugees.       Mr.Haydar is among roughly 58,000 Iraqi applicants for      U.immigrant visas and refugee resettlement under the      federal programs that promised to fast-track entry for Iraqis      who worked with the U.government and other institutions      deemed critical to the U.S.-led effort in Iraq, according to      the State A similar program for Afghans who've      worked with the U.government may also be at risk.       At least one Iraqi and two Afghans who worked with the U.     government and also qualify for expedited immigration visas      were turned away from American ports of entry on Friday and      Saturday, a State Department official said, adding that      several more were prevented from boarding planes to the U.      A substantial backlog of applications remains in part      because Congress limits the number of visas that can be      granted each year. Frustration with visa delays has now been      aggravated by Mr.Trump's executive orders.       Critics of the visa ban say it abandons thousands of      valuable allies abroad and risks deterring such people from      working with the United States in the future at a time when      Mr.Trump is promising a more aggressive military posture      abroad.       ``These guys laid their lives on the line alongside      American soldiers and got paid a fraction of what I made,''      said Jake Thomas, a U.Army veteran who worked with ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS467-2.txt,2182,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,30.0,January

He says:       Trump's executive order, which seeks to ``keep radical      Islamic terrorists out of the United States,'' will only      embolden those very same people, who already had a near-zero      chance of gaining entry to our country to begin with. This      order proves too many ISIS and al-Qaeda talking points true      about what the United States really is, and will serve as an      excellent recruiting tool for those organizations and others.       This executive order isn't about national security. It's      about fear-mongering for ends we can only guess at.       This shouldn't be a partisan issue. As my friend Phil Klay,      winner of the National Book Award and a Marine veteran,      pointed out last year, Ronald Reagan's ``city on a hill''      speech outlined an America ``For all the pilgrims from all      the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness toward      home.''       ``I get that people are scared,'' Klay continued. ``But      it's only during frightening times when you get to find out      if your country really deserves to call itself the `home of      the brave.' ''       Donald Trump's zero-sum worldview and flimsy understanding      of the intricacies of modern war and terrorism threaten to      undermine our republic. His policy on Middle Eastern refugees      and immigrants must be checked and resisted by citizens of      all political stripes, legislators of both major parties and      the judicial courts.       After 16 years of war, much of my generation of military      veterans stands with the Middle Eastern people we sweated,      labored and bled with, and sometimes died for. It's going to      be a fight, but it's one we're not going to lose. The legacy      of America's past is at stake, as well as the soul of its      future.

2855,topic-id,358,"If I recall the facts of this correctly, not only did he shut down the environmental unit of the department of the attorney general, but in subsequent reporting you could not find a dollar allocated to environmental activities in the Oklahoma attorney general's budget. And he abandoned what his predecessor, Drew Edmondson, had been running, which was not just to have an environmental enforcement unit within the department of the attorney general, but also to have an environmental enforcement team that brought together Federal folks, State regulators, water officials, and put together the multiagency task force that prosecuted environmental cases--gone also.  Finally, Drew Edmondson used to do an annual report, as I recall, on the successes of his environmental enforcement and his environmental task force, the multiagency group. That was gone too.  In addition to all of those facts, what worries me a little bit--you know, one of the things we have to assess in this process is the credibility of the nominee. Are they going to tell you the truth in the nomination process? If they are not going to tell you the truth in the nomination process, you are probably going to get a lot of malarkey out of them down the road as well.  He took the position that he actually had not gotten rid of the environmental unit. He said he had moved it into a new unit--the federalism unit--which, if you go to their own website and read about the federalism unit, it says it is an appellate. You don't do environmental enforcement at the appellate level; you do environmental enforcement at the trial level, and you do it at the investigative level.  Further, if you read down, the word ``environment'' never appears in the general description of that unit. So it is not as if there is just one little wrinkle of the environmental unit kind of magically disappearing under this guy. Wherever there was any activity by the department of the attorney general with respect to the environment, he shut it down, zeroed it out, silenced it, finished it.

2857,topic-id,367,"Well, on the subject of respect for and obedience to statute, I thought we might want to discuss for a minute the Oklahoma open records law which the attorney general of Oklahoma not only needs to obey, but he needs to enforce it. He is not just subject to that law. He is the agency responsible for policing compliance with it.  What we have just seen is 750 days of noncompliance by his office with an Open Records Act request where he refused to provide anything to us in the EPW And, by the way, shame on the Environment and Public Works Committee for allowing that to happen. Shame on the Environment and Public Works Committee for--on a purely partisan basis--not allowing us to get those emails that this office had covered up and suppressed for 2 years.  Finally, they got before a judge and the judge said: Release that first set Tuesday--So he is sitting on several thousand emails between his office and the big energy companies and the big energy organizations, and he stonewalls everybody for 2 years.

And third, she says: Produce them  This was a guy who didn't think he could produce them He couldn't produce them for 2 years, and now the judge says  So when you are looking at his adherence to law, his respect for law, it seems to me that this is yet another example in which off he goes. The beneficiaries are himself and all the big fossil fuel companies that he was engaged with. That is who the beneficiaries were.  The people who lost were the ones who were supposedly the beneficiaries of the law--the public, the right to know, transparency.  So it makes for an interesting comparison to his version of compliance with the law.

2859,topic-id,629,"Well, I wanted to go back to lawyering for a minute in response to the Senator's comments about the predicament that the other side is being put into--being asked to vote on the nominee, knowing that the disclosure of thousands of emails between the nominee and the industry and companies that he is going to supposed to regulate is imminent--is imminent. As the distinguished Senator from Hawaii said, maybe there is nothing in those; maybe this is just an empty concern. But over and over and over, emails have been really important at breaking investigations open. Certainly, our friends on the other side--until the election in November--had a fascination with emails, a fixation with emails. They couldn't get enough of other people's emails. And now suddenly everybody is looking at the ceiling, examining the ceiling tiles when it is time to wonder about these emails.  There is a doctrine, if I recall successfully back in the days when I was a more active lawyer, called willful blindness, which is the wrongful act of intentionally keeping oneself unaware of something--the wrongful act of intentionally keeping oneself unaware of something. If that doesn't describe what is being done right now to the Republican Senators about these emails with this vote, I don't know what does, but what I do know is that willful blindness under the law is a culpable state of mind. It is a culpable state of mind in civil cases, where you can be held liable because of deliberate willful blindness, and it is a culpable state of mind in criminal cases, where you can be found guilty of a criminal offense based on a finding of willful blindness.  So this is no small predicament that the majority leader is creating for his Republican Members in the mad rush to get this fossil fuel tool voted on before this stuff all comes out, and it is either going to be good or it is going to be bad, and if it is bad, there will be a price to pay for having ignored this emerging avalanche of emails. If they are good, fine, no harm done, but who really gets hurt if it is bad?  We are going to be examining Pruitt over this, when they come out. If these are bad things, there could be investigations that ensue and an enormous amount of stuff can take place, but there will be ownership on the other side of the aisle for the willful blindness they are displaying toward this package of emails that we now know are on their way and that we know were wrongfully withheld because the judge said so. The judge said it was an ``abject failure'' under the law. The judge said it was unreasonable. So we know it is wrong, and still, still, comes the vote.  You have to wonder what the power force is here that makes that happen. In astronomy, there are dark stars, black holes. Because they are dark and because they are black, you can't see them in the sky. You have to deduce their presence when light bends around them and when their gravitational pull affects the behavior of other heavenly bodies. When you look for those weird, anomalous behaviors in space, that is a signal that some dark star is out there operating. This is a lot of weird and anomalous behavior. And what is the dark star that is causing the majority leader to put all the Republican Senators, other than Susan Collins, in peril, in terms of willful blindness to this release of emails, which everybody knows now is coming and which everybody knows now was wrongfully delayed--wrongfully and deliberately delayed--by this attorney general as the enforcer of the disclosure of his own emails.[[Page S1280]]    ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1275-2.txt,1823,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,16.0,March

2875,topic-id,508,"I thank the Senator from  Mr.President, I note the diagram that I am showing beside me here on the floor, which is the work of an academic professor. He is one of a considerable number of professors and researchers who are looking at the fossil fuel-funded climate-denial operation as a socioeconomic creature. They are studying it. It is rather new. This is a diagram done by Professor Robert Brulle of Drexel University, one of the many academics and researchers who are looking into what I call the denial beast, because obviously if you are ExxonMobil, if you are the Koch brothers, you don't want to be out front yourself. You want to put outfits with names that sound much more benign out there--the Heartland Institute, the George Marshall These groups get thrown up by the fossil fuel company, stuffed with their money, filled with their employees, and they all run around saying more or less the same thing, which is, don't worry about climate change; don't worry about our carbon emissions.  When the Senator from Oregon refers to a complex matrix that this individual serves, this is just one visual description of that complex matrix of fossil fuel interests with which he has been so closely involved.  Here is one other example. This is Mr.Pruitt's fundraising from all of these energy companies and then the different ways he raised money. Liberty 2.0 was his super We still don't know a single thing about it. We haven't talked about the dark money life of Scott Pruitt because--why?--our colleagues on the other side won't require those questions to be answered. They are perfectly willing to scoot him through without knowing a single thing about his dark money operation--his attorney general reelection, which was chaired by a fossil fuel billionaire; the Oklahoma Strong Leadership PAC, which was his leadership PAC that took constant fossil fuel money; the Rule of Law Defense Fund, which was the laundering operation for bringing money to the Republican Attorneys General  If you were one of these big companies and if you could drop money into the Rule of Law Defense Fund, it would wash your identity clean of the money, and then the money could go over to the Republican Attorneys General Association as if it were a gift from the Rule of Law Defense Fund, when all they did was launder the identity off of the fossil fuel donor. Then you had, of course, the Republican Attorneys General Association, which was so loaded up with fossil fuel interests that they had special, secret, private meetings with these big donors at their retreats. It was right on the secret agenda of the retreats, which we have been able to get our hands on.  I add that to the equation because when the Senator from Oregon talks about a complex matrix of fossil fuel interests, he is not kidding. This is a very, very significant matrix of fossil fuel interests, and that is what Scott Pruitt has been serving, not the public and not his duties.[[Page S1282]]    ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1275-2.txt,1823,PUBLICATION OF COMMITTEE RULES,2017.0,16.0,January

2884,topic-id,164,"I draw the Senator's attention to this graphic my office has prepared which reflects certainly my recollection. When I came to the Senate, I want to say there were at least five Republican-sponsored climate change bills floating around. Senator John Warner, a Republican of Virginia, had one; Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, had one; Senator John McCain, a Republican of Arizona actually ran for President on a strong climate change platform; Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, was working with Senator Kerry on one; Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican of Tennessee, had one.  So there was a regular heartbeat of activity in this body on climate change, a bipartisan heartbeat of activity. Then, pow, came Citizens United 2010, and it has been flatlined since.

2887,topic-id,570,"One of the points I think could be made here with respect to the emails is that the first tranche of emails--the ones the judge instructed be released on Tuesday--are communications with Scott Pruitt's donors, with Devon Energy right here, with Peabody coal--which I don't see on the list--and with API, the American Petroleum Institute, which is right here. That funding has gone into his political operation.  It is worth understanding how that pays off. I don't know if we can see this, but this says ``confidential.'' I don't know if that is clear on the screen. This is the confidential agenda for a Republican Attorneys General Association meeting, at a nice place--the Greenbrier in West It is pretty swish. Look here on the agenda: Private meeting with Murray There is Murray Energy, right in the energy donors. He is attorney general. Look at what they get--a private meeting with the Republican attorneys general on the confidential agenda. If you go to the next day, the morning meeting is an issue briefing on the dangerous consequences of the Clean Power Plan and other EPA rules, and guess who the lead panelist is--Attorney General Scott Pruitt of  What you have is this link between a big political donor, Murray Energy, and a private meeting for Murray Energy on the confidential agenda and a followup meeting at the same retreat on attacking the Clean Power And guess who a lead plaintiff with Scott Pruitt is in the lawsuit against the Clean Power Plan? Boom--Murray  There is a little machine here that turns between money in from the fossil fuel industry and litigation out on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. These emails aren't just matters of general interest. These emails may provide some good connection, some good evidence into what exactly that little feedback loop entails, because there are plenty of circumstances, and, as somebody who spent years as an attorney general and years as the U.Attorney, those little feedback loops is sometimes called corruption.  Depending on what those emails say, that could easily be prosecutable corruption. Rather than answer that question, of whether this link between big donors and action on cases using the badge of the State of Oklahoma as a shield to protect the fossil fuel interests, which were the donors, and talking about it in confidential meetings, in private meetings on confidential agendas--to me, that smells pretty high all by itself, before you have actually dug into it and seen what the emails say and gotten to the potentially really stinky part.  The fact that this is being jammed through is not without consequence for the Republicans on the other side who are not being given the chance by their leadership to say: Hold it. Let's give this a couple of weeks. Let's see if there is something beyond how bad it is already--that perhaps might even make this chargeable stuff--before we are forced to vote on this guy.  Once again, the fact that they are being forced to vote on this guy in this circumstance is very, very unusual behavior. And unusual behavior, to me, signals powerful forces.  I could not agree more with the Senator from Oregon about the importance of these emails and their potential significance. I agree with my friend from Hawaii that I hope there isn't anything really bad here, but the likelihood that there is is very strong. The dogs are hunting.

2934,topic-id,915,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to spend time here with my colleagues. We just heard a diatribe from our colleagues. It is interesting to me to note how they say the American people don't want us to change this, but I have to remind my colleagues that I think the American people spoke very loudly on November 8. We have run multiple times to repeal this bill. I heard one of my other colleagues say that we voted over 60 times, and we are going to vote one more time to get rid of the Affordable Care Act because the American people have delivered that message to us, and we have a President that says that we will do this.  I think, as we go through this, we are going to have some interesting conversations. Considering all the bickering and posturing you see in the media by partisans on the left and the right, it is time for Members of this body to step back for a moment and take stock of where we are in the healthcare debate.  I was not a Member of Congress when the Affordable Care Act was passed. I was a practicing large animal veterinarian in private practice plying my trade and not a political animal, if you will. However, I was concerned to see the way the law was passed. My colleagues on the other side were talking about how this was rammed through Congress and how it was passed in the shadows--or how we are doing that now. But I have to remind them that in 2009 it was passed in the dark of night--no Republican input, no debate, and no discussion. It was just passed and rammed down the American people's throat.  I want to go on here, and I want to yield to a couple of my colleagues before I do.[[Page H2012]]  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa) because he has to go tend to some other business. I would like to have his input on this. Doug LaMalfa is my good friend and a great leader up here.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from California (Mr.Yoho), a good friend here, and my other colleagues here, to allow me the moment to speak.  Mr.Speaker, I am really excited about the opportunity with this new administration for relief for regular Americans from the Affordable Care I think the intentions may have been good when it was passed, but we see the devastating effects from the many emails, letters, calls, and the communications my office received from middle-income families. They are the ones that are the most negatively affected by this act. We have seen their premiums and their deductibles go out of sight. They may not even need to have the insurance anymore because the deductibles are so out of reach for them on cost, so insurance means nothing to them.  Indeed, with most Americans having health insurance before the ACA that they were at least reasonably happy with, they have had that choice taken away from them. They have had choices taken away. My wife and I were sitting there in December 2013, being forced, just like everybody else, to enroll in a plan with a broken website trying to get it to go through. We knew at the time we were going to have big problems with that.  We even agreed with the Republican conference when we were on the eve of this taking effect. The President decided that maybe we need to have a 1-year pause for this for employers of 100 people or more. We agreed with that. We offered legislation because you are not supposed to just do that with the stroke of a pen. Indeed, it was duly passed legislation with all Democrat votes, no Republican votes, just a few short years before. We agreed, let's lay this for a year, if nothing else, for those larger employers.  But we also said: Mr.President, we should also delay it for everybody else because we know it isn't going to work. We know this is going to do nothing to curb costs. That really is the bottom line. It is the middle-income families that I am really worried about in this thing because, again, we received so many communications from them saying: Please help us. We can't afford it. We are putting off being able to buy a home because we are seeing these costs go up. We are putting off college savings for our kids because our costs are spiraling out of control.  So if we do nothing else in the process, again, are we going to come up with the perfect bill?  There is no perfect bill when you have this many years of the type of government takeover of health care that we have seen here. But we are going to do the best we can because it is those folks out there--middle-income Americans--that we are trying to help to bring relief from the ACA so they can go back to doing the priorities they see: having affordable insurance, doctors they can choose, a plan they can choose, and being able to go off and do the things like saving for their kids' college and maybe buying that home that is part of the American Dream instead of the American nightmare they see it has been.  So I appreciate my colleague, again, having this time this night and for allowing me to speak for a few minutes.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH2011.txt,2115,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,9.0,March
2935,topic-id,936,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Mr.Speaker, as I was saying, I was concerned to see the way the law was passed. It was passed in the middle of the night. I thought it was passed through hastily and without transparency. I did not think that boded well for the law's success. Unfortunately, I was proven right.  If you remember the words of the then-Speaker of the House, it was passed without reading it, and the words were: We have to pass it to see what is in it. We have to pass it to see how it is going to work.  Talk about legislative malpractice that was poured on to the American people to get a bill they didn't want, that nobody read. Yet my colleagues on the other side are talking about how we are running this through without anybody's input. It has had 6 years of input, it is coming together now, and our goal is to fix health care for the American people.  As someone who has practiced medicine, I believe that, despite all the good intentions behind the Affordable Care Act, it was doomed to fail, as most Big Government programs are. In fact, one of the main reasons I ran was on behalf of patient-centered, free-market oriented health care. I supported and still support healthcare reform that allows us in Congress to keep our promises when we talk about what we want to achieve.  I was one of the Members that came up here who lost my health care because of the Affordable Care My premiums have gone up over $11,000 since I have been here. My deductibles have gone up and my coverage has gone down. It is a disaster. I have to remind my colleague from Minnesota who was talking about how bad the Republican bill is that his own Governor from the State of Minnesota said that this bill is a disaster, the Affordable Care Act in its present form, and his premiums have gone up 45 percent in his own  I want to remind this body that many people lost health care they had before ObamaCare was passed with the promise that if you like your plan, you can keep it. It was broken by our own President of the United If you like your plan, if you like your doctor, and if you like your insurance company, your premiums will go down $2,500 on an average. Lie after lie after lie. The American people answered that by electing a majority in Congress to the Republican Party to fix that, and that is what we aim to do.  Supporters of the ACA also told us that the premiums wouldn't increase. It turned out that was false. Premiums in the individual markets have increased partly because ObamaCare has forced insurers to leave the exchange. For example, benchmark silver-level plan premiums have increased by an average of 25 percent from 2016 to 2017, according to the Department of If you like the State of Arizona, the premium this year is going up an astounding 116 percent. They worry about us, and then they blame us for raising the cost of health care. Sophistry, pure sophistry.  Many families have been forced to pay drastically higher out-of-pocket costs, which hits their pocketbooks hard even though they are not wealthy people by any stretch of the imagination. As my friend, Mr.LaMalfa, was talking about the cost, at the end of the month people are finding out they are running out of money before they run out of the month.  I am reminded of one family in my district whom I met with personally many times over my tenure in They had to deal with the intense treatments and frequent hospitalizations for an illness that has hit two generations of their family very hard. They had coverage through an employer that they started out with, and it was a $350-a-month premium right before the ACA passed in 2010. However, around the time the ACA mandates kicked in, their plan went up over $100 a month. Today their premium is a staggering $680 a month. That is over $8,000 a year in premiums, nearly double what they were paying before the These are the people that sent us up here to fix health care. Unless you are making six figures a year, this is an absolutely painful sum.  Mr.Speaker, I may not generally be a supporter of government benefits, but I do believe very strongly that our government should make every effort in protecting our Nation's vulnerable population, especially the chronically ill. My concern is the ACA has resulted in those groups being harmed more than anybody else. Particularly for those who had employer-provided insurance prior to the ACA, the law's effect has been hurtful, especially if their coverage was for families afflicted by long-term illness. Simply put, no healthcare law should ever make things worse for people who were responsible and had health care to treat a medical condition. If anything, that is the opposite of health care.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Babin), who is a good friend of mine. Babin has practiced dentistry in our military and in the private sector. Right after graduating dental school, he was commissioned in the Air Force as an officer and was stationed overseas. I thank the gentleman[[Page H2013]]for his service.

I want to go over a couple of things here. As we have heard, the average increase of health plans in the United States rose by over 35 percent. I already talked about Arizona: 116 percent this year alone.  The insurance exchanges that were set up--the 26 in the beginning--are down to 5, with some counties not even having exchanges to purchase insurance.  I think for the people that are watching this at home, whether they are Members of Congress, the American citizens, I want you to listen to this, and I want to take you back to the information that came out when the Speaker of the House then talked about, we have to pass it to see what is in it, how it is going to work.

If we were to do nothing, this would collapse, and the American people would be left without any coverage. We have heard other people on the other side say: Leave it alone.  That is irresponsible, and we will not do that. We will repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and we remove it from Washington bureaucrats and government mandates. If government can tell you what kind of insurance to buy, you have to buy it, and if you don't, they penalize you, what else can they force you to do?  Our Constitution is not a function of the government. Government is a function of the Yet when government steps beyond the boundaries of the Constitution, it is up to us, we, the people--and we are the representatives of we, the people--to change how government works. That is what we are doing with the repeal and the replacement of the Affordable Care We have heard about the nightmare this has caused to the American people, to our economy, the loss of jobs, the depression of job growth, wage growth. We can go on and on for hours, but it is not going to fix this problem.  What I want to focus on for the next few minutes is what the replacement does do. We have heard about the mandates that are going away, the taxes that are going away, the expansion of The reality in America, our country is in financial dire straits. It is unsustainable. It would be imprudent for us to sit by and do nothing while the country goes into default.  So with the direction we are going, this will bend the cost curve to Medicaid to make it solvent for a longer period of time. This will empower the individual to have health care and make those decisions between the doctor and the patient, the way it should be, instead of a government-controlled mandate.  This empowers individuals to be more responsible for themselves, to incentivize them to go out and buy health care by the use of health savings accounts, where they can buy over-the-counter medications to share with family members the benefit of the health savings account.  Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all want preexisting conditions covered, so that is something we all are in agreement with. There is the argument about should children be able to stay on their parents' policies until the age of 26. Personally, I don't think they should have to--I think they should be out on their own, but I have heard from enough people in my district that I am willing to compromise and go along with that. Truth be known, children could already stay on their parents' health plan until the age of 26 if they were actively enrolled in college or disabled. So we are compromising.  This will make health care better. It puts health care into the hands of the American people and their doctors and drives government out of it. Let them oversee the process.  We have heard over and over again that we need to open up the market across State lines. There is legislation coming out that will free up the insurance companies. We are introducing legislation to hold harmless insurance companies now, before we get through with this process, so that insurance companies are not held to the standards of the Affordable Care Act, so that they can start writing policies today when this legislation passes, so they can write their policies and start marketing now so that the American people will have time to research these products.  There will be a transition period. I can't guarantee it is going to be smooth. I can guarantee you it will be smoother than the last one.  I think the last thing I want to leave the American people with is we don't want to pull the rug out from anybody. We will do everything possible, and I know on both sides of this. I would think the Democrats, with the debacle that they created, the legislative malpractice that they passed in the dark hours of the night in December of 2009 or 2010, that they would want to come to the aid to fix health care for the American people instead of chastising us and telling us how bad and how wrong we are to interfere.[[Page H2016]]  This plan is going to collapse on its own. We invite them to come to the table to help us fix this because this is for all Americans, not just It is for all Americans--Republicans, Democrats, Independents, everybody. I would hope they would come and help us do this.  I think the last thing, Mr.Speaker, is this is a historic opportunity. The Wall Street Journal said never before has there been a chance to change a program as significant as what we are getting ready to do. We are the ones who are going to lead this effort to bring healthcare stability to the American people.  I look forward to the discussions in the future. I ask the American people to believe in the people you sent up here to fix this. We are going to get it right.  One last thing.
