            HONORING THE LIFE OF CONGRESSMAN MAURICE HINCHEY

  (Mrs. LOWEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my 
longtime friend and colleague, Maurice Hinchey, who passed away this 
month at the age of 79.
  A lifelong public servant, Congressman Hinchey was a steadfast 
champion for New York's Hudson Valley and never wavered in his 
commitment to the people he served, the communities he represented, and 
the causes in which he believed.
  Over his 20 years in the Congress, Congressman Hinchey helped shape 
the course of his environmental movement and record, and as a senior 
member of the House Appropriations Committee, he always put the Hudson 
Valley and New York State first, ensuring that our priorities were 
reflected in the Nation's spending policies and securing New Yorkers' 
fair share of Federal resources.
  Congressman Hinchey inspired and influenced not only a generation of 
public servants and community leaders, but also those of us who had the 
good fortune to serve alongside him in this body. We will miss him 
deeply.
  My thoughts are with Congressman Hinchey's wife, Ilene; his children, 
Michelle, Reese, and Josef; and the countless people in the Hudson 
Valley and beyond whose lives he enriched.
