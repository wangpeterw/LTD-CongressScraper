          SUPPORT FOR PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, our prayers go to all 
victims of the Las Vegas massacre.
  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that I have been an advocate for pro-life 
values and protecting the rights of unborn babies. Today, the House 
will vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This will 
save the lives of babies who are too young to speak for themselves but 
who are old enough to feel physical pain.
  I appreciate the success of South Carolina Citizens for Life, who 
work to give a voice to those who do not have one. With the great 
leadership of Executive Director Holly Gatling of the Midlands, Leon 
Wizorek of Barnwell, and Sally Zaleski of Orangeburg, this organization 
has been working to save lives.
  As a cosponsor of the legislation with colleagues Trent Franks, Vicky 
Hartzler, Mia Love, and Karen Handel, I am grateful to stand for life, 
upholding the conservative values and protecting the lives of our 
unborn babies. Every life is precious and has great value.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Thank you, Dr. Tom Price and Betty Price, for your successful service 
to American families.
