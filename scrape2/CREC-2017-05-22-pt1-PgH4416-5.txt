     HONORING NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH AND KENNATH FORSYTH-SEARS

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Foster 
Youth Caucus, I rise in recognition of National Foster Care Month and 
in honor of the remarkable foster youth alumnus that I am fortunate to 
host this week: Kennath Forsyth-Sears.
  Kennath hails from the Ocean State, where he attends my alma mater, 
Rhode Island College, and aspires to work with children with 
disabilities.
  Kennath is a reminder of why we must ensure every child has the 
opportunity to reach their full potential. Madam Speaker, all children 
need the support and love of a family, yet finding ``forever families'' 
for foster youth is one of our biggest challenges.
  Madam Speaker, it is our moral duty to care for these children as we 
would our own, including by supporting permanency for foster youth.
  I thank my co-chair of the Congressional Foster Youth Caucus and the 
leader of our Caucus, Congresswoman Karen Bass of California, for 
bringing young people like Kennath to Capitol Hill for Foster Youth 
Shadow Day, and I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring National 
Foster Care Month.
