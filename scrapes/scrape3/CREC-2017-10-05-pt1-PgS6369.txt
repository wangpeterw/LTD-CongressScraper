  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. Portman, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Coons, Mr.

agreed to:

                              S. Res. 290

       Whereas October has been designated as ``National Energy 
     Awareness Month'';
       Whereas improvements in energy efficiency technologies and 
     practices along with policies of the United States enacted 
     since the 1970s have resulted in energy savings of more than 
     60,000,000,000,000,000 British thermal units and energy cost 
     avoidance of more than $800,000,000,000 annually;
       Whereas energy efficiency has enjoyed bipartisan support in 
     Congress and in administrations of both parties for more than 
     40 years;
       Whereas bipartisan legislation enacted since the 1970s to 
     advance Federal energy efficiency policies includes--
       (1) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6201 
     et seq.);
       (2) the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 
     (Public Law 100-12; 101 Stat. 103);
       (3) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13201 et 
     seq.);
       (4) the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801 et 
     seq.);
       (5) the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 
     U.S.C. 17001 et seq.); and
       (6) the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 (Public 
     Law 114-11; 129 Stat. 182);

       Whereas energy efficiency has long been supported by a 
     diverse coalition of businesses (including manufacturers, 
     utilities, energy service companies, and technology firms), 
     public-interest organizations, environmental and conservation 
     groups, and State and local governments;
       Whereas, since 1980, the United States has more than 
     doubled its energy productivity, realizing twice the economic 
     output per unit of energy consumed;
       Whereas more than 2,200,000 individuals in the United 
     States are currently employed across the energy efficiency 
     sector, as the United States has doubled its energy 
     productivity and business and industry have become more 
     innovative and competitive in global markets;
       Whereas the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
     Energy of the Department of Energy is the principal Federal 
     agency responsible for renewable energy technologies and 
     energy efficiency efforts;
       Whereas cutting energy waste saves the consumers of the 
     United States billions of dollars on utility bills annually; 
     and
       Whereas energy efficiency policies, financing innovations, 
     and public-private partnerships have contributed to a 
     reduction in energy intensity in Federal facilities and 
     vehicle fleets by over 47 percent since the mid-1970s, which 
     results in direct savings to United States taxpayers: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates October 5, 2017, as ``Energy Efficiency 
     Day''; and
       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
     Energy Efficiency Day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
     and activities.
