                       SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, yesterday this House took a step to 
establish and maintain an environment where sexual harassment and 
discrimination is neither tolerated nor swept under the rug.
  When I got here a year ago, I was surprised that there was no 
antisexual harassment training that was mandated. In every professional 
position that I have held, there always was this type of training. In 
the Navy, as a law student, and as a prosecutor, antisexual harassment 
training was a given.
  So this month--before yesterday--I had an ethics attorney come into 
my office and conduct that type of training with my entire D.C. staff. 
I am proud to have done that. I am proud to be an original cosponsor, 
and I voted for the legislation yesterday which makes antisexual 
harassment training mandatory in all offices for all Members and their 
employees.
  Although this bill should have been passed a long time ago, it is a 
small step in the right direction in the large fight against sexual 
harassment, and I look forward to being a part of that fight.
