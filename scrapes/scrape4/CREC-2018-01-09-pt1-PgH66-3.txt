               NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY

  (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to our Nation's law 
enforcement men and women. The safety and security of our communities 
is the result of our law enforcement men and women, who wake up every 
single day to protect neighborhoods from criminals, fight crime, ensure 
justice, and keep the peace.
  In 2017, 125 officers died in the line of duty. Their deaths are a 
sober reminder that our Nation's law enforcement officers face danger 
every day they carry out their duty to protect the American people. 
They run towards danger while everyone else is running away.
  No matter what, they serve and protect. They serve and protect so 
that you and I may be free from harm.
  Their diligent service does not go unnoticed, and today, on behalf of 
Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District, we thank them for their 
bravery, fortitude, and sacrifice.
  So thank you to the men and women in blue. We are a safer nation 
because of the bravery of you and your families. Thank you for choosing 
to live a life of service. Your sacrifice and heroism will never be 
forgotten. Happy Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and God bless you.
