                  HAPPY FATHER'S DAY TO STEVE SCALISE

  (Mr. RUSH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, it is with a determined spirit that I come to 
the floor today to wish our friend, my friend, our colleague, Steve 
Scalise, a Happy Father's Day.

  Mr. Speaker, we pray for Steve's full recovery as he fights for his 
life at a hospital near here in our Nation's Capital. We pray for 
Steve's family, for their strength, and for their comfort during this 
most difficult time.
  Today, Mr. Speaker, we all join together in a spirit of family and 
love, to send our love to Steve. Jennifer, Harrison, Madison, you are 
in our prayers.
  Steve, get well soon. Happy Father's Day. In spite of it all, Happy 
Father's Day.
