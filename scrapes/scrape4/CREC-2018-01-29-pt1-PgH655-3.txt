        CELEBRATING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SOUTH FLORIDA RED CROSS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to celebrate the 100th 
anniversary of the Red Cross South Florida.
  The Red Cross opened its first south Florida chapter in 1918 in order 
to meet the demands of World War I. In the century since, its wonderful 
volunteers and trained personnel have valiantly responded to our most 
critical needs during national disasters and other catastrophes.
  While this organization has significantly grown and expanded into 
five chapters, it still has remained true to its core mission, which is 
to be a vital source of relief for disaster victims while helping to 
prevent, to prepare for, and to respond to emergencies across 13 
counties.
  Mr. Speaker, by caring for the most vulnerable members of our 
society, the local Red Cross chapter has become a cornerstone of our 
south Florida community. So today I would like to congratulate all of 
the staff and the volunteers of the South Florida Red Cross for a 
century of dedication of service and of excellence.
  Thank you for serving as stewards of the Red Cross legacy and for 
continuing to provide compassionate care to all who need it.
  Congratulations to all.

                          ____________________
