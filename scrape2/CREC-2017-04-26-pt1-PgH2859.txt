               PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 100 DAYS AND HEALTH CARE

  (Ms. MATSUI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, across the board, the President's first 100 
days have been marked by nothing but broken promises.
  Instead of creating jobs, he has made it a priority to repeatedly 
push for a TrumpCare bill that will increase costs for families and rip 
away care from more than 24 million people.
  The American people have made it clear time and time again that 
TrumpCare is a bad bill, but the President refuses to listen.
  He and congressional Republicans remain intent on pushing through 
legislation that undermines the care of people, like a social worker in 
my district in Sacramento who before the Affordable Care Act, went into 
debt in order to pay for a few routine medical tests.
  The President should spend some time thinking about our country's 
future instead of taking reckless actions that put the health and well-
being of American families on the line.
