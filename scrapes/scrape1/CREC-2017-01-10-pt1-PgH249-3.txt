    CONGRATULATIONS TO UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA'S MACHINE INTELLIGENCE 
                      LABORATORY ENGINEERING TEAM

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the other 
Gainesville--the University of Florida's Machine Intelligence 
Laboratory Engineering Team.
  On December 12, 2016, the University of Florida's Machine 
Intelligence Laboratory Engineering Team won a world championship and 
beat 12 teams from five countries at the Maritime RobotX Challenge in 
Hawaii. This team, which is comprised of UF students, designed a vessel 
that completed a number of different obstacles, including navigating 
through buoys and self-parking--all without human intervention.
  As a supporter of scientific research, I am proud of the inspiring 
work being done in Florida's Third Congressional District. The 
dedication displayed by these students and professors is an outstanding 
example of the success that comes from hard work. It is the dreams of 
the students and scientists, like these of today, that will propel them 
to go on and create the innovations of tomorrow that will make this 
country great again. I am honored to announce their accomplishments, 
and I look forward to witnessing their continued success.
  As a UF alumnus, I would be remiss not to say, ``Go Gators.''
