                    PREMIUMS HAVE GONE UP, NOT DOWN

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is built on broken promises.
  President Obama promised that, through his healthcare law, premiums 
would go down. Instead, they have gone up. In mostStates, premiums have 
increased by double digits. In some States, like Oklahoma, premiums are 
going up by as much as 76 percent.
  I am from Indiana. In Indiana, in 2017, based upon current 
enrollments, the average rate will increase by 18.7 percent.Overall, 
the premiums in Indiana have gone up by 70 percent since the Affordable 
Care Act was first enacted.
  Not only are Americans paying more for coverage, the costs have gone 
up as well: out-of-pocket costs, deductibles. For 2017,four carriers 
will be selling on the Indiana Marketplace. I have one county in my 
district, Wayne County, where no carriersprovide for the local 
hospital.
  Today, we will start a process of keeping our promises, Mr. Speaker. 
We promised the American people that we would repealand replace this 
failed healthcare law. Only in Washington would keeping your promise 
somehow be controversial.
