 HONORING THE LIFE OF LORIMER ARENDSE, PRINCIPAL OF GRAND PRAIRIE HIGH 
                                 SCHOOL

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Lorimer 
Arendse, the principal of Grand Prairie High School, who lost his 
battle with stage IV lung cancer on December 15.
  Never shy about sharing his hatred for school during his formative 
years, Lorimer found his passion for academics once he met and fell in 
love with his wife, Jeanelle, while attending Grace College in Warsaw, 
Indiana. Upon graduating Grace College, Lorimer continued his passion 
for education upon earning his master's degree in educational 
administration from Ashland University.
  From there, he began his career in education as a math teacher and 
advanced to assistant principal. In 2013, Lorimer was named principal 
of the Young Men's Leadership Academy at Kennedy Middle School in Grand 
Prairie. In 2014, he was named principal of Grand Prairie High School.
  Although his time with us was short, let us all be encouraged by his 
final lesson: treat each other with kindness. Be respectful. Be 
courteous. Be what a Gopher is.
  At this time, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their 
prayers to Principal Lorimer Arendse's family and the Grand Prairie 
High School community.
