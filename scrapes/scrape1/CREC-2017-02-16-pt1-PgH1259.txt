           RECOGNIZING PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Prince 
George's County Public Schools for achieving a record high school 
graduation rate. Prince George's schools are living up to their motto 
of being Great By Choice.
  Eight schools have met the goal of graduating 90 percent of seniors 
within 4 years, including three schools in the Fourth Congressional 
District: Charles Herbert Flowers High School, DuVal High School, and 
the Academy of Health Sciences at Prince George's Community College.
  Many schools in the Fourth District, including Suitland, Potomac, and 
Forestville high schools have demonstrated real progress, with 
graduation rate gains of more than 4 percentage points.
  Mr. Speaker, these gains have been made possible by the incredible 
dedication of educators and parents who are focused on policies that 
improve student success like expanding mentoring programs, effectively 
using data to target student needs, and emphasizing core reading and 
math skills.
  Mr. Speaker, we must prepare students for successful lives and 
careers once they graduate from high school. That is why I am committed 
to working during this Congress to ensure every student has access to 
rigorous, relevant, and results-driven career technology education 
programs to equip them with the skills to succeed in the 21st century.
