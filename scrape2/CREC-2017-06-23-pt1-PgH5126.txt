           RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE REVEREND NATHANIEL DIXON

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Honorable 
Reverend Nathaniel Dixon. On Sunday, Reverend Dixon will be giving his 
last sermon at St. Stephen's United Methodist Church.
  While this Sunday may be his last sermon, I have no doubt that the 
lives he has touched, parishioners, colleagues, neighbors, all of us, 
will continue to uphold the lessons he taught us and will remember the 
action he has taken over a long and hard-fought career.
  Reverend Dixon is a true renaissance man whose life has always been 
committed to New York City. For 27 years, he was a music teacher and, 
later, an administrator, and also an executive director of the Saxrack 
Learning Center.
  Old Satchmo, the great Louie Armstrong, once said: ``Musicians don't 
retire; they just stop when there's no more music in them.''
  Reverend Dixon never stopped teaching music, and he has inculcated 
this love and passion into the lives of students and parishioners. 
``Music helps,'' he said, ``because there is awe in them.''
  Thank you, Reverend Dixon, for your commitment and willingness to 
become a leader and a role model for many years to come in New York's 
13th Congressional District.
  We love you and wish you the very best.
