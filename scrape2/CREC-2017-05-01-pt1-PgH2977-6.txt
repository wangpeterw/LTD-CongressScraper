                   APPRECIATING CAPTAIN TAYLOR FORCE

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Captain Taylor Force of 
South Carolina was a graduate of West Point, a veteran who had served 
in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he was an MBA candidate at Vanderbilt 
University when he was, at random, stabbed to death by a Palestinian 
terrorist in March of 2016 as he innocently departed from a bus as a 
tourist in Israel. He was only 28 years old.
  His merciless murder at the hands of Palestinian terrorists is even 
more gruesome because of the Palestinian Authority program of paying 
out hundreds of millions of dollars to terrorists and their families in 
support of mass murder.
  I am grateful to support the Taylor Force Act, legislation that 
restricts all aid from the Palestinian Authority until the Secretary of 
State confirms they do not provide financial rewards for terrorists in 
their murderous activities. I appreciate the leadership of

Senator Lindsey Graham, Congressman Doug Lamborn, and Congressman Lee 
Zeldin for introducing the Taylor Force Act.
  As Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas travels to Washington to 
meet with President Trump on Wednesday, I am confident that President 
Trump will show his commitment to ending financial rewards for 
terrorists.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
