          HIGHLIGHTING THE 2017 MIAMI WALK TO END ALZHEIMER'S

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the 2017 
Miami Walk to End Alzheimer's that will take place at Museum Park in 
downtown Miami on Saturday, November 4.
  Alzheimer's is a devastating disease that impacts over 54,000 seniors 
in my county of Miami Dade and more than 500,000 individuals across the 
Sunshine State. It is not just the patients who suffer. Family members 
and caregivers also bear the brunt of this tragic and emotionally 
draining disease.
  I know this personally, having lost my mother due to complications 
from Alzheimer's 6 years ago. The Miami Walk to End Alzheimer's plays 
an essential role in helping advance Alzheimer's care and research in 
our community and across our Nation.
  This wonderful event is also important to patients, families, and 
caregivers as a reminder that they have the full support of our 
community as they battle this terrible disease.
  I encourage everyone in our south Florida community to come out on 
November 4 and support and raise awareness for Alzheimer's.
