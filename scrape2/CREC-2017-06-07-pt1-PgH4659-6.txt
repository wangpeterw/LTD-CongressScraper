                        DEFEATING THE ISIS ENEMY

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand shoulder to shoulder 
with our friends and allies in Great Britain, who have suffered three 
horrific terror attacks in a period of less than 3 months.
  These attacks at the hands of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria are 
barbaric, evil, and must be condemned by the entire world. These 
cowards have used vehicles, knives, and bombs to rein terror down on 
London and Manchester, even targeting innocent young girls at a concert 
hall.
  Radical Islamic extremism is a vile ideology that must be stamped out 
at every corner of the world. This is a time for unity of purpose and 
strong leadership.
  The United States, our NATO allies, and our allies in the Middle East 
must chart a unified course towards complete destruction of ISIS. As we 
begin to succeed in the fight, their resolve to attack us will only 
grow stronger, but we cannot be deterred.
  Mr. Speaker, freedom and liberty must win over hatred and extremism. 
We must defeat this enemy, and this Congress stands ready to support 
this administration in its efforts to do so.
