  So (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and 
the bill, as amended, was passed.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  Stated for:
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, during rollcall Vote No. 384 on H.R. 2786, I 
mistakenly recorded my vote as ``no'' when I should have voted ``yes.''
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 384.
