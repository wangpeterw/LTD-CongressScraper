                        TRIBUTE TO JIM SINCLAIR

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct 
honor of recognizing Jim Sinclair of Plains for the leadership he has 
provided to his community in northwest Montana. As the senior pastor of 
his church, Jim has provided a helping hand to others for over two 
decades.
  The people of Sanders County know Jim and his wife, Renee, for the 
admirable work their ministry has done to support those in need. Before 
becoming a pastor, Jim made a living harvesting timber, and those 
skills have been valuable with helping the most vulnerable members of 
their community stay warm during the cold Montana winters. In addition 
to distributing firewood, Jim's church harnesses the talents of many 
volunteers in order to provide a food bank, soup kitchen, and clothing 
bank. Jim's hands on approach to ministry has empowered his community 
to help each other overcome challenges.
  Communities like Plains depend on folks like Jim and Renee, as well 
as the dozens of volunteers they have mentored over the years. I thank 
them for all the hard work they have done and wish them the best as 
their ministry continues to grow in the service of others.
