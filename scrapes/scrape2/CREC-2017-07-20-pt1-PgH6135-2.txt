                     REPEAL OF OBAMACARE STATISTICS

  (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, next week we will see consideration of the 
repeal of ObamaCare without a replacement. This would be a life-and-
death issue for most Americans.
  First, we would see skyrocketing uninsured rates: 18 million people 
would lose insurance next year; 32 million people would lose insurance 
by 2026.
  We would also see skyrocketing premiums: 20 to 25 percent by next 
year, 50 percent by 2020, and 100 percent by 2026.
  Seventy-five percent of Americans would live in a place where there 
would be no marketplace insurer.
  We know that for every 455 people who gain coverage across the United 
States, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, that at least 
one life is saved. So if we lose coverage for 20 million people next 
year, we would be looking at 43,000 to almost 44,000 avoidable deaths 
in the United States. That is why this is life and death.
  TrumpCare has had its shot, and it has failed. It is time for the 
parties to come together now. It is time to have a bipartisan bill to 
fix the ACA.
  The American people deserve nothing less.
