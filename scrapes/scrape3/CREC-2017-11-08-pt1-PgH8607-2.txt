                       THE REPUBLICANS' TAX SCAM

  (Ms. McCOLLUM asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
Republicans' tax scam. The middle class receives virtually no benefit 
from this bill.
  This bill hits middle class Minnesotans especially hard by 
dismantling the State and local tax deduction. It increases costs for 
college students and their families. It abandons adoptive parents, and 
it punishes people with high medical bills.
  So why does this bill hurt hardworking families? So President Trump 
and the Republicans can pay for giveaways to the wealthiest Americans?
  Big corporations and billionaires will see their taxes slashed. 
Wealthy heirs and heiresses will be allowed to dodge taxes entirely. 
While the top 1 percent of Americans receive nearly half the tax cuts, 
99 percent of us will be stuck with a Federal debt that will explode by 
trillions of dollars.
  Mr. Speaker, this Republican bill is not tax reform. It is not a good 
deal for the middle class. It is a scam, plain and simple. I oppose it, 
and we must defeat it.
