                     NOMINATION OF REX W. TILLERSON

  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from 
Lee Boothby be printed in the Record in support of the nomination of 
Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State of the United States.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                                 Newfield Exploration Company,

                           The Woodlands, Texas, January 11, 2017.
     Hon. James M. Inhofe,
     U.S. Senate,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. James Lankford,
     U.S. Senate,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Senators Inhofe and Lankford: As leader of Oklahoma's 
     third largest producer of crude oil and natural gas, I write 
     to urge your vote to confirm Rex Tillerson as U.S. Secretary 
     of State.
       Mr. Tillerson has been rightly lauded for his effective 
     stewardship of one the world's largest and most successful 
     companies, his deep exposure to and knowledge of both foreign 
     and domestic public policies impacting our nation and his 
     extensive global experience. He is intelligent, highly 
     regarded and has accomplished many achievements in the 
     private sector through vision, hard work and sound judgment. 
     He is extremely qualified to lead U.S. foreign policy.
       Over the past several years, I have had the privilege of 
     working with Rex professionally and I've also had the 
     opportunity to get to know him personally. His personal 
     attributes are equally as impressive as his professional 
     characteristics. He is a man of integrity and strong moral 
     character.
       We both share a fondness for the outdoors and regularly 
     have found ourselves discussing not the day-to-day happenings 
     in our industry, but rather his love for the United States of 
     America--an affection deepened by his exposure to countries 
     where democracy and human rights do not exist.
       I am proud to call Rex Tillerson a friend, and I am 
     confident our nation will benefit from his service and the 
     many attributes he will contribute as U.S. Secretary of 
     State.
           Sincerely,
     Lee K. Boothby.
