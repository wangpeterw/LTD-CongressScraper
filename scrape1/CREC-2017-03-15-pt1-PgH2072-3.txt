                              NOAA FUNDING

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 
mission of NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
now under attack by the Trump administration.
  An assault on NOAA, Mr. Speaker, is an assault on science. NOAA is a 
data-driven organization with proven research in the public interest. 
NOAA defends our coasts from the surges we have seen from Sandy, Irene, 
and other storms. NOAA's satellites keep watch day and night, providing 
up-to-the-second data to farmers, forecasters, and fishermen.
  Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge the Trump administration's denial of 
climate damage, but I do not understand it. Defunding NOAA, as the 
President's budget purportedly does, does not make our climate problems 
simply go away. The mission of NOAA isn't just about our environment. 
American businesses rely on its data every day to give them an economic 
advantage. After all, there is a reason NOAA is in the Department of 
Commerce to begin with.
