              PRESIDENT TRUMP THREATENS THE ESTABLISHMENT

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, President Trump doesn't have many 
fans in the political, media, or academic establishment. The definition 
of ``establishment'' is a ruling class or a controlling group.
  They oppose the President because he is not one of them. They hold 
different views of immigration, trade, regulations, political 
correctness, and media bias. Their beliefs are threatened by his world 
view, so they are relentlessly trying to discredit his Presidency.
  The President, I believe, sees himself as representing the working 
men and women of America; Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. 
This is the broad middle class and those who aspire to be part of it.
  The establishment has linked arms and resists the President's 
reforms, but all true reform starts with the voice of the people, and 
they are on his side.
