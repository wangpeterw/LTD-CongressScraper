                        THE REPUBLICAN TAX SCAM

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, what do Iran, Ebenezer Scrooge, 
and the Republican tax scam have in common?
  Well, they are all ruthless, cutthroat, coldblooded, heartless, and 
stingy.
  That is why I voted ``no'' on the Republican tax scam, and if I could 
have added an H to the no, I would have.
  This legislation gives 83 percent of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 
percent, while raising taxes on 86 million middle-income families.
  The numbers prove that this is a tax cut for the ultrawealthy and not 
for the middle class, and anyone who tries to deceive you into thinking 
otherwise, shame on them.
  Adding insult to injury, this tax cut adds $1.5 trillion to the 
national debt, and Republicans will soon use the debt to justify their 
ultimate plan, which is to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
  Today's vote proves that Republicans care more about the wealthy and 
big multinational corporations than they do for ordinary people.
  Merry Christmas to the wealthy, who already have plenty, and to their 
special interest lobbyists. And to the rest of America struggling to 
make ends meet, bah humbug.
