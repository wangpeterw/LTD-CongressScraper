                              BORDER WALL

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to oppose the inclusion of 
$1.6 billion that would be a waste of taxpayer money on this useless 
wall. The funds will go towards an unnecessary wall along the Southern 
border. This wall that the President promised voters that Mexico would 
pay for is now being put on the taxpayers' backs.
  $1.6 billion can be used for better things. It can pay for thousands 
of jobs in the U.S. and workforce development programs and 
apprenticeships.
  And one other thing: agents protecting our border don't even want it. 
They do not see themselves as defenders of a wall.
  Mr. President, please come back to reality. This is not ``Game of 
Thrones.''
  This administration needs to stop demonizing people outside of our 
borders. We need to fix our immigration system, and we can do it in a 
humane and pragmatic and effective way, and in a way that will 
supercharge our economy and actually create American jobs.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). Members are reminded to 
address their remarks to the Chair and not to the President.
