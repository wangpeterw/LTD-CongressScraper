                            BUILDING TRADES

  (Mr. VARGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the San Diego 
Building and Construction Trades Council, and the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 569, and applaud the leadership 
of their business manager, a proud marine, Tom Lemmon.
  Yesterday, these patriots stood up for something much larger than 
themselves when they resisted the Trump administration's contempt for 
workers' rights, misogyny, racism, and Islamophobia.

  It is in the best tradition of organized labor to stand for others' 
rights and against a system that attempts to exploit the most 
vulnerable in our society. They stood up against threats to organized 
labor. They stood up against separating immigrant families. They stood 
up for working families and the most vulnerable in our society.
  Again, I congratulate Tom Lemmon, Gretchen Newsom, and Carol Kim, 
along with many others, for their courage to speak up and resist.
  Their resistance is a great patriotic reminder to all of us to stand 
up for what we know is right.
