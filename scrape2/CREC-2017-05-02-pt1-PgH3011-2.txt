       ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL

  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 69th 
anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel. Like our own 
country, our friend and ally has a deep commitment to meeting human 
needs around the world.
  Throughout its history, Israel has been a leader in humanitarian 
assistance. Israel established the very first field hospital in Haiti 
after the devastating earthquake in 2010 and rebuilt villages ravaged 
by cyclones in Fiji. Israel sent over 100 tons of supplies to aid 
Indonesia and Sri Lanka after the 2004 tsunami, and dispatched doctors 
to Greece to care for refugees fleeing the horrors of war in Syria.
  When Israeli soldiers reported wounded Syrians arriving at their 
border, medics from the Israeli military were dispatched and over 3,000 
Syrians were treated by Israeli doctors.
  Today, as we celebrate Israel's proud history and the bond between 
our nations, we are reminded of the importance of looking beyond our 
own borders and our proud shared history of welcoming those fleeing 
persecution from all around the globe. We renew our shared commitment 
to helping those in need in every corner of the world.
