     THE 71ST RESCUE SQUADRON IS RECOGNIZED FOR ITS RESCUE EFFORTS

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
71st Rescue Squadron of the United States Air Force, which is stationed 
at Moody Air Force Base in the first District of Georgia.
  They responded as part of the 23rd Wing effort by mobilizing their 
personnel and equipment in order to help the victims of Hurricane 
Harvey in Texas.
  The 71st Rescue Squadron successfully evacuated 308 flood victims and 
38 family pets. They repositioned 15 rescue crafts and teams to access 
difficult areas, saving 1,100 lives.
  In addition, they moved 83 tons of cargo and delivered 23,000 gallons 
of fuel, which was used to conduct helicopter search and rescues.
  Because of their dedication to this country, this group received the 
That Others May Live Squadron of the Year Award for the Air Force.
  Thank you, 71st Rescue Squadron, for your extensive efforts to help 
the citizens of this country.
