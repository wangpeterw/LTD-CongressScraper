                    CELEBRATING MONTANA'S STATEHOOD

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a special 
place: Montana.
  From our snowcapped mountains to our nearly endless prairies, Montana 
is an awe-inspiring place of tremendous beauty. We call it Big Sky 
Country, the Treasure State, the Last Best Place, and we call it home.
  When Montana first became a territory in 1864, it was the Wild West. 
Prospectors, cattle ranchers, and settlers overcame scorching sun and 
blistering cold to establish our Nation's 41st State.
  But there is something even more special than the beauty of an 
eastern Montana sunset or being knee-deep in a crystal-clear mountain 
stream. It is the people of Montana. Montanans are kind, warm, 
generous, and hardworking people.
  On November 8, 1889, our special place became part of something even 
more special, the land of the free and the home of the brave. Today, 
Montanans celebrate the 128th anniversary of our statehood.
