                                TAX BILL

  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, today 9 million children are at risk of 
losing their access to healthcare and millions of parents are losing 
sleep as funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program expires.
  Community health centers across the country are at risk of steep 
cuts, forcing them to lay off medical professionals and turn away 
thousands of patients as their funding expires.
  DREAMers, who know no other home than America, are at risk of 
deportation as their DACA status expires.
  Military families, who serve a nation at war, are at risk of going 
without pay as government funding expires.
  But instead of passing legislation to ensure children have access to 
healthcare, to keep community health centers open, to protect our 
DREAMers, and to support military families, the majority is too focused 
on cutting taxes for the wealthiest individuals in America. This is a 
shameful failure to act in the best interests of the American people.
