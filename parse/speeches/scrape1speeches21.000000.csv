12681,topic-id,337,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying bill which provides for H.5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017.  I promised my district in eastern Nebraska that I would work my hardest to rein in an out-of-control bureaucracy that is burdening our Nation with over 3,000 new regulations each year. The cumulative cost of all of these regulations passed each year cost approximately $2 trillion, almost 10 percent of our That is a tremendous burden, and it largely falls on our small businesses, farmers, and community banks.  I meet often with our local, small business owners. The top concern that I hear, and they are loud and clear, and I hear it over and over, is that regulations and ObamaCare are preventing them from growing, and, in some cases, making it very difficult for them to stay afloat. There is anger that the health of our businesses are not being undermined by competition or new technology, but they are being undermined by their own government, and they are angry about it.  I have promised my district that I will be aware and push back on these regulations and on a bureaucracy that is on steroids. That is what we are doing today by passing H.5 and by passing these rules.  I think one of the Members of the very first Congress and the writer of our Constitution would be proud to see H.5 passed. James Madison thought the separation of powers was vital to the safeguarding of our In recent years, we have seen that separation of powers undermined by an overzealous bureaucracy that creates laws, then executes those laws, and then acts as their own appeal authority. Madison said the accumulation of powers--legislative, executive, and judiciary--in the same hands is the very definition of tyranny. Today, we move toward the right balance, toward restoring the separation of powers and lifting the burden that has been put on our small businesses and farmers.  I urge support for the rule and the underlying bill.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH249-6.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,10.0,January

It is 2017 and we still need a Day Without a Woman to remind this administration and Republicans in Congress that women deserve equal pay and access to affordable health care.  Just yesterday, the assault on women continued with the GOP's plan to pay more for less in healthcare legislation that will restrict a woman's right to comprehensive healthcare coverage.  The Republican bill also defunds Planned Women with nowhere else to turn will lose access to essential preventative care and affordable contraception.  This is very personal for me. When I was growing up, we were poor. I had a sister that got pregnant at 15 and another one that got pregnant at 16. I, myself, had a condition that required me to get on a contraceptive to deal with pain that I had. I had nowhere to turn. I, myself, had to go to a clinic that saw me on a sliding scale; otherwise, I would have had nowhere to go.  The fact that we are facing the threat of losing this today for women and preventive care is beyond incomprehensible to me and scary.  On this day today, without a woman, I also think about women, women like Rosa Parks, the mothers, the daughters and grandchildren that took part in the Women's March on January 21, women at the forefront of every fight for equality.  I stand today with women like my mother, Teresa, an immigrant from Mexico, who raised a large family and who took care of my father when he was sick and continues to support me today.  I stand today to fight for equal pay for equal work because women--and Latinas in particular--are paid only 54 cents for every $1 paid to White men.  I fight in Congress for American families so that they have economic stability and can make ends meet and set their kids off to a brighter future. I will continue to fight with my sisters in Congress for health care, for immigration, and for human rights.

12508,topic-id,633,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 123 provides for a rule to consider two Congressional Review Act resolutions which will undo burdensome and harmful regulations put into place by the Obama administration during the final hours of his The rule brings before the House these resolutions so that Congress may remove, through the proper legislative process, rules promulgated by bureaucrats who remain unaccountable to the American people. This process allows those who are accountable--the elected Representatives in the Congress--to fight for their constituents' rights and liberties.  House Resolution 123 provides for a closed rule for each of the Congressional Review Act resolutions, both H.43 and H.69, the standard procedure for such resolutions, since the sole purpose of each is to remove a harmful regulation from the Federal  The rule allows for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the majority and the minority leader or their designees, for H.43, and 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the Chair and the ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources, for H.69. On each resolution contained in the rule, the minority is afforded the customary motion to recommit.  H.43 is a joint resolution which would repeal the Obama administration's midnight rule that takes away States' ability to direct funding within their own borders to certain healthcare providers that conform to the States' values.  In her final days in office, Secretary Mathews Burwell pushed forward a rule that would require States to fund, with public dollars, facilities that perform abortions, potentially against the will of the people of that given This flies in the face of the 10th Amendment which grants to States the authority to make such decisions within their borders and to prioritize which healthcare providers should receive funding based on the greatest need in their own communities.  Those of us who care about the carefully crafted Federal system which our Founding Fathers set up, which allows different States to operate differently based upon their own values and priorities, recognize the Obama rule for what it is: a power grab by the Federal This is why the House will take up this resolution today--to continue to fight for states' rights--and will repeal this burdensome regulation that ties the hands of every State legislature and ties the hands of every Governor in the  H.69 is a Congressional Review Act resolution to repeal an overreaching regulation by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service which usurps Alaska's ability to manage its own lands within its own borders. Federal law has long recognized that Alaska--that Alaska--and her elected officials are in the best position to make the decisions on what actions to permit on the public lands in that State, whether those lands are Federal, State, or private.  Despite this long precedent, codified by Congress in the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act, the Obama administration moved forward in its waning days with a rule that imposes Federal restrictions on lands that have been, up until the end of the Obama administration, successfully regulated by the State of Like H.43, this resolution recognizes the important 10th Amendment protections put in place by the Founding Fathers in our Constitution which protects states' rights to govern within their own borders.[[Page H1194]]  The Congressional Review Act is an important tool in maintaining accountability at the Federal level. Its necessity has never been more apparent than over the past few weeks where this Congress has needed to step in and remove burdensome and unbalanced regulations put in place by President Obama and his team just as they were walking out the door.

12514,topic-id,288,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I do want to point out that H.43 would repeal the Obama administration's rule and allow States to enjoy the freedom and flexibility to distribute title X grant money in a way that serves the needs of their constituents.  Just in the way of background, December 16, 2016, the Obama administration finalized a rule that prevents States from eliminating abortion providers from title X grant distributions. Title X is a family planning program authorized in 1970, and was intended to provide family planning services to low-income women. The Obama rule was widely perceived as an attempt by the Obama administration to require States to fund Planned Parenthood, the Nation's largest abortion business.  Prior to the Obama administration's rule, States were free to direct their title X funds to healthcare providers that did not participate in abortion. When States had this freedom, they were able to choose to invest in women's health care instead of investing in Big  States should be able to choose to prioritize family planning funds to health clinics that offer a full range of healthcare services, including family planning, but do not participate in abortion.  States can fully support family planning and other health services without funding abortion providers like Planned Planned Parenthood only comprises 13 percent of approximately 4,100 title X service sites.  Redirecting funds away from abortion providers does not reduce funds for the title X program. When States set criteria that eliminates abortion providers from title X distributions, those funds are then directed to other clinics.  Eighty-seven percent of current title X service sites are comprised of local health departments, local hospitals, and Federally qualified health centers.

12520,topic-id,1160,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter written to the Honorable Sylvia Mathews Burwell signed by 110 Members of the House and Senate to express strong opposition to the Department of Health and Human Services' September 7, 2016, notice of proposed rulemaking titled ``Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients.''                                Congress of the United States,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2016.     Sylvia Mathews Burwell,     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services,          Washington,       Dear Secretary Burwell, We write to express our strong      opposition to the Department of Health and Human Services      (HHS) September 7, 2016, notice of proposed rulemaking titled      ``Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients      in Selecting Subrecipients.'' Although we appreciate the      Department's intent to follow proper regulatory procedure      pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, HHS's purpose      for engaging in the rulemaking appears on its face to be an      attempt to subvert the will of elected representatives.       Moreover, apart from the Department's impetus for the      notice of proposed rulemaking, we also question whether the      Department's stated rationale adequately supports its      conclusion that providers with a reproductive health focus      are more ``effective'' than other health providers that offer      comprehensive care for women and men. Nowhere in the proposed      notice of rulemaking does HHS clearly define what it means to      provide Title X services in an ``effective'' manner. It does      appear to assert that a number of factors--such as the range      of contraceptive methods on-site, the number of clients in      need of publicly funded family planning services served, and      the availability of preconception care--distinguish providers      with a reproductive health focus as more ``effective'' and      ``high quality'' than other types of providers. However, that      list of factors falls far short of all of the attributes and      recommendations included in the Centers for Disease Control      and Office of Population Affairs report entitled ``Providing      Quality Family Planning Services: Recommendations of CDC and      the US Office of Population Affairs.''       To further complicate the argument about quality and      effectiveness, the data cited in the notice of proposed      rulemaking is not adequate for determining patient outcomes.      The Department relies heavily on utilization and demographic      statistics, but appears to lack hard data regarding actual      patient outcomes and need, as the Department does not require      grantees to track patients or verify their income. As you      know, the issue of inadequate data has previously been raised      by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), after the HHS Office of      Family Planning in 2007 asked IOM to provide a critical      review of the Title X Family Planning In addition to      finding ``no clear, evidence-based process for establishing      or revising program priorities and guidelines,'' IOM stated      the following in its May 2009 Report Brief:       ``The committee concludes that the program does not collect      all the data needed to monitor and evaluate its impact.      Therefore, the committee proposes a comprehensive framework      to evaluate the program and assess how well clinics meet the      family planning needs of the program's clients. The committee      concludes that additional data will be needed in the areas of      client needs, structure, process, and outcomes in order to      assess the program's overall progress.''       We welcome evidence that this recommendation has been fully      adopted, but are unaware of any clear evidence confirming      that to be the case. If HHS cannot clearly define an      ``effective'' or ``high quality'' provider, it is unclear to      us how state and local project grantees are supposed to do so      in order to comply with this proposed rule. It is also      therefore unclear how HHS will be able to accurately      determine in every case whether state or local project      recipients--who are generally closer to and more familiar      with subrecipients and the patient base in their geographical      region--have considered inappropriate criteria in evaluating      subrecipients. Rarely do the American people benefit when the      federal government attempts to substitute its judgment for      that of state or local governments--particularly when the      criteria used to inform that judgment are unclear, and that      judgment is not supported by coherent and impartial facts.       Finally, if HHS is going to assert the authority to adapt      its rules in order to address changing circumstances, we      implore HHS to consider the recent general shift in health      care policy toward comprehensive care. As HHS states on its      website, in addition to assisting individuals and couples in      planning and spacing births, part of the mission of Title X      is to contribute to ``improved health for women and      infants.'' HHS's suggestion that subrecipients like federally      qualified health centers--which provide greater preventive      and primary health care services than providers with a      reproductive health focus--are per se less ``effective'' than      providers with a reproductive health focus does not comport      with that stated mission.       We urge HHS to reconsider this overreaching and ill-     supported rule. We will continue to closely monitor this      proposed rulemaking, and intend to submit this letter as a      formal comment. We look forward to a detailed response from      your           Sincerely,     Joni Ernst,       United States     Diane Black,       United States       Senators Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Boozman (R-AR), Bill      Cassidy (R-LA), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve      Daines (R-MT), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Deb Fischer (R-NE), James      Inhofe (R-OK), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Jerry      Moran (R-KS), Jim Risch (R-ID), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Marco      Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Tim Scott (R-SC), David      Vitter (R-LA).

12742,topic-id,821,"Mr.Speaker, in 2010, then-President Obama said: ``If you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.''  Unfortunately, at least 4.7 million Americans now know that was simply not true. ObamaCare was a takeover of the American healthcare system. The law's mandates have been burdensome, destroying 300,000 small-business jobs and forcing an estimated 10,000 small businesses to close. Premiums are skyrocketing, and choices are dwindling.[[Page H2648]]  House Resolution 241 provides for the consideration of H.1304, the Self-Insurance Protection Act, an important part of the Republican effort to repair the damage ObamaCare has done to insurance markets. More than 150 million Americans--62 percent of workers--receive their health insurance from their employer. In fact, almost all firms with at least 200 or more employees offer health benefits, and just over half of smaller firms with 3 to 199 employees offer health insurance.  Overwhelmingly, Americans and their employers like this system of employer-sponsored health care; and for many years, employer health plans have been successfully regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or                              {time}  1315  Typically, small and large employers offer healthcare coverage to employees either in self-funded arrangements or purchase fully insured plans from an insurer.  Under self-insurance plans, employers cover the costs of their employees' medical expenses. Employers can either process claims in-house or work with a third-party administrator to oversee and implement the plans.  ERISA regulates both fully insured and self-insured plans, but only self-insured plans are exempt from the patchwork of mandates imposed under State insurance law. Furthermore, employer-sponsored self-insured plans are not subject to the same requirements under ObamaCare, as are fully insured plans.  Thus, self-insurance plans are desirable and successful because they are free from many government restrictions and regulations and allow employers to tailor their plans to meet the unique needs of their employees and to innovate.  For example, these plans do not require employees to purchase government-mandated coverage options that their employees do not want or need. This helps lower costs for working families while ensuring access to high-quality health care.  In hearings before the Education and the Workforce Committee, on which I sit, we heard testimony that today self-insurance is often the only way employers can afford coverage, thanks to the burdens of  Mr.Speaker, in Alabama, we like to say: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Prior to ObamaCare, there were problems in our Nation's healthcare system, but the successful model of employer self-insurance wasn't one of them. Today, self-insurance remains perhaps the best way for employers to provide health care to their workers.  Unfortunately, the prior administration seemed intent on disrupting this successful healthcare model. Rather than leave self-insurance plans alone, they repeatedly explored ways to impose new regulations that would negatively impact self-insurance. Specifically, the Obama administration wanted to disrupt the model by regulating stop-loss insurance and treating it as if it were health insurance.  Employers who self-insure often purchase stop-loss insurance to cover large medical claims and to protect against the financial risks such claims can pose. Despite decades of Federal regulation on employer health plans under ERISA, stop-loss insurance has never been regulated by the Federal That is because stop-loss insurance is actually a financial risk management tool designed to protect employers from catastrophic claim expenses. Remarkably, in a regulatory grab, the Obama administration tried to reclassify it as ``group health insurance.''  Mr.Speaker, if the last 7 years have taught us anything, it is that more Federal control over health insurance does not make health care more affordable for the American people. Stop-loss insurance is not health insurance, and it should not be regulated like it is.  The Self-Insurance Protection Act simply updates the law to make clear that Federal bureaucrats cannot redefine stop-loss insurance as group health insurance. This is about reaffirming longstanding policies and ensuring workers continue to have access to a health insurance model that is proven to lower costs and provide flexibility to consumers.  This bill will provide workers and employers alike with the regulatory certainty that they have desperately wanted and needed. They shouldn't have to worry about unelected Federal bureaucrats stepping in and destroying their healthcare system.  To put it simply, this bill is necessary in order to prevent future bureaucratic overreach that would destroy the self-insurance model that has been so successful for so many working families.  I also think this bill is an area where we should have some bipartisan cooperation. It passed out of the Education and the Workforce Committee earlier this year on a voice vote, and I hope it earns bipartisan support here in the full  As we continue our efforts to increase choices, lower costs, and provide better healthcare options for working families, let us not forget to shore up and protect the health insurance programs that are actually working and getting the job done.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 241 and the underlying bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

12744,topic-id,261,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, my colleague from Florida said that the Moon is not the Well, stop-loss insurance is not health insurance, but the Obama administration tried to make it so. Because they tried to make it so, we need to put into statutory law what I think we all agree on both sides of the aisle not only is the law but should be the law so that there is no question about it in the future. It is unfortunate we have to do that, but, because of some of the actions of the prior administration, it is necessary.  He talked about the strong foundation of the ACA, That foundation is crumbling beneath the program. We now have more insurers jumping out of exchanges. My home State of Alabama is down to one carrier on the exchange. Soon enough, we may find that, in Alabama, like some other States, there are no carriers. This isn't a foundation. It is a foundation made of sand--and the sand is leaking out. Something has to be done.  Today's bill is a step--not the only step--in that direction.

Both parties should be working together to make sure that we provide what we can reasonably for the health care of the people of America, and we should be collaborating, not just in this House across the aisle but in the Senate as well. I think it is a good place to start right here with this bill because we really don't have a substantive disagreement about this bill.  Both sides understand that stop-loss insurance is not health insurance. It is just the Obama administration tried to turn it into that. This bill would stop that and bring the certainty we need back to these self-insured plans that mainly small employers have and make sure that we have in place for working families across America a system that is working for them and maintain that.

Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     1868) to provide that providers of broadband Internet access      service shall be subject to the privacy rules adopted by the      Federal Communications Commission on October 27, 2016. The      first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points      of order against consideration of the bill are waived.      General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not      exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair      and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and      After general debate the bill shall be considered      for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order      against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion      of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee      shall rise and report the bill to the House with such      amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question      shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments      thereto to final passage without intervening motion except      one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the      Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to      no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day      the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of      business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the      Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.1868.        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution .. . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

12547,topic-id,581,"Madam President, I wish to express my opposition to 89 because it exempts certain vessels--actually one specific vessel called the Delta Queen--from current fire retardant construction standards and, according to the U.Coast Guard, represents ``an unacceptable degree of fire safety risk. . . . ''  Maritime history has numerous examples of catastrophic on-board fires followed by the passage--or attempted passage--of laws designed to improve safety and protect passengers and crew.  In response to the sinking of the RMS Titanic, in 1914, the International Maritime Organization, IMO, prescribed emergency equipment and safety procedures IMO-flagged ships were required to have in place.  The 1934 fire on the SS Morro Castle prompted the adoption of multiple Federal safety regulations, including the use of fire retardant construction materials.  A series of fires aboard international passenger ships in the early 1960s prompted the U.to enact the Safety of Life at Sea Act, SOLAS, which mandated that ``no passenger vessel of the United States shall be granted a certificate of inspection [. . .] unless the vessel is constructed of fire-retardant materials.''  Congress delayed the implementation of the SOLAS mandate first until 1968, then until 1970, then again until 1973, but only for U.passenger vessels operating on inland rivers.  In 1973, Congress again delayed the effect of the mandate, but this time EXPRESSLY for one ship--the Delta Queen--and only for one 5-year period ``while a new [overnight passenger] riverboat is being constructed.''  Despite the clear intent of Congress in 1973, the various owners of the Delta Queen successfully secured exemptions from SOLAS for the Delta Queen in 1986, 1991, and 1996.  Their attempts to seek a 10-year extension in 2007 and a 15-year extension in 2013 were unsuccessful, so they made another run in the 114th Congress and now in the 115th Congress with 89.  Current law requires passenger vessels with overnight accommodations for 50 or more passengers to be constructed of fire-retardant materials, unless an exemption is made, but in the case of the Delta Queen, the U.Coast Guard has consistently opposed legislation to provide the Delta Queen an exemption to remain in service as an overnight passenger cruise vessel.  A Coast Guard Special Inspection Report on the Delta Queen in 2008 found ``an unnecessary and unacceptable accumulation of combustible fire load.'' In a January 8, 2016, letter to Senator Bill Nelson, the Coast Guard's then-Assistant Secretary of Legislative Affairs wrote ``the Department of Homeland Security is resigned to oppose continuously any legislation that would provide any form of statutory relief for the steamer Delta Queen.''  89 is contrary to public safety. It is contrary to the Safety of Life at Sea Act regulations which have been in full force in the U.since 1966, and it is contrary to the guidance of the U.Coast  The Delta Queen is an old ship made of wood. The boilers are original and open to the wood superstructure. There are no structural boundaries to contain a fire and only one means of egress.  I understand that supporters of 89 are concerned about the historic preservation of this ship and the economic opportunities that operation of the ship could bring to its homeport.  We should first and foremost be concerned with the safety of the people who will work on the ship and vacation on the ship and that they can have the same opportunities and experiences on a ship that is compliant with the reasonable safety standards that have been in place in this country for more than 50 years.

Montenegro's inclusion in NATO will have positive repercussions across the continent and will send an important message of hope to aspirant countries.  Last week, I met with Montenegro's Foreign Minister, and he described Russia's persistent efforts to weaken support for NATO membership in Last October, Russia interfered in the Montenegrin elections.[[Page S1992]]There was a plot to assassinate the former Prime Minister of Montenegro and take over the Montenegrin The suspects in that case scurried back to Moscow, and the Russian authorities refused to turn them over to the Montenegrins or even make them available for questioning in To this day, Russian-supported NGOs and media propaganda continue to rail against Montenegro's NATO membership.  Russia does not get a veto over decisions of the alliance. We need to send a strong message of resolve. This is not an isolated circumstance with We have seen how they interfered in our elections. We have seen what they are doing in Europe today.  We see all these different activities by Russia, and we have to protect ourselves. One way we protect ourselves is by making our own decisions as to who should be admitted into Another is that we should have an independent commission take a look at what Russia was doing in their interference with our elections and what they are trying to do in trying to compromise our democratic system of government. I think the events that occurred in recent weeks of additional contacts that Russia made with members of the Trump administration just underscore the importance for that independent commission to take a look at what happened.  I stand here today in support of NATO enlargement. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently voted by voice vote in support of this bid--unanimously, Democrats and This is not a partisan issue. We have had a request from the President to take up this issue. Nearly all NATO members have approved Montenegro's bid. We are among the last to ratify, and we must get the job done.

I hope that Montenegro's admission will help them motivate the reforms necessary for other Balkan countries to join.  Montenegro has made outsized contributions to NATO missions, despite not being a full member. I understand that in Afghanistan, Montenegro has rotated 20 percent of its armed forces through the ISAF and the resolute support missions. Twenty percent of their force--that is a substantial contribution. It also contributed to the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo and other NATO missions.

12790,topic-id,1160,"Mr.President, I was pleased to see on the front page of the Washington Post that President-Elect Trump was speaking about how we should maintain at least the number of people covered under ObamaCare in a new kind of replacement for that portion of If you will, I agree totally with him. We should fulfill this promise and do it, as he said, at a lower cost.  We think we have a mechanism to do so with Senator We will speak to that today. First, let me point out, for those who are praising ObamaCare, I will say that since it has passed, the American people have been voting consistently against candidates who supported ObamaCare, culminating in the election of President-Elect So whatever folks might say about how wonderful it is, the American people are voting against it consistently.  That said, there is a mandate from the American people not just to repeal but to replace. So it is not that the American people don't want to have coverage, and they want folks with preexisting conditions to have their issues addressed, but what they are concerned about is the way ObamaCare was forced upon them, with the power of Washington, DC, reaching into their own life, if you will, to their kitchen table, promising them penalties unless they comply with the Washington bureaucrats directly. That is what the American people do not like.  So, first, can we maintain coverage? President-Elect Trump said we are going to have insurance for everybody. Two, will we cover more? Three, can we lower costs? The answer there is yes.  Now, let's first speak to covering more Americans than President-Elect Trump, Majority Leader McConnell, and Speaker Ryan have all committed to maintaining coverage for all.  People speak of the advances made under I will give them those advances. There are still 30 million people uninsured. Our alternative has the potential to cover 95 percent of Americans without a mandate. The way we do this is that as we return power to the States, we give States the option of saying that everyone who is eligible for coverage is enrolled unless they choose not to be.  Just like when I turned 65 and I am on I am on I don't feel it is a mandate. No one calls me up. Indeed, if I don't want to be on Medicare, I have to call someone up and tell them I don't want to be on it. State legislatures would have the option to say you are in unless you call and tell us you are out. I say that addresses two folks who are hard to reach; the fellow whose life is so in disarray that he is living beneath a park bench and the typical 28-year-old male who never thinks about health insurance. All of a sudden he is in without even realizing he is in, until he needs it, and then he will be very pleased.  On the other hand, if you don't want to be in, we make it easy to get out. By the way, I spoke of that fellow living beneath the park bench. As a physician who has worked in a hospital for the uninsured for 30 years, that was not tongue-in-cheek, and that is not a throwaway line. That person living beneath the park bench will never have his life well enough together, or almost never, to go to a public library to log onto healthcare.gov. He does not have a W-2--and if he did, he lost it long ago--to submit it to sign up.  Under our program, he is enrolled. What are the benefits that he would get? He would have a health savings account so that if he goes to the urgent care center with a nail in his foot, it is covered. He has a pharmacy benefit, so that if he gets his life together while he is at that urgent care center to take an antipsychotic, he has a pharmacy benefit. Lastly, if something terrible happens, he is hit by a car or something, then he is brought to the hospital and that catastrophic coverage protects society against the cost of his hospitalization.  By the way, under our plan, we give States the power. I would like to think that this is something Democrats and Republicans can agree to. When Republicans say: You can keep your plan if you like it, and we mean it, we mean it. The way we would do this is that Congress would give States alternative options. The State would have the choice.  The State could go with the alternative, which we will lay out. The State could opt for nothing, no Medicaid expansion and no help for their lower income folks, or the State could opt to stay in If Illinois, California, Massachusetts, New York want to stay in ObamaCare, we think they should have the right to stay in  ObamaCare, if it is working for your State, God bless you. On the other hand, it is not working for a State where there are double-digit and sometimes triple-digit premium increases in 1 year.  So the State could choose to stay in ObamaCare, for nothing, or for the alternative, which we lay out for them. By the way, I would say that those who govern closest to those who are governed govern best. We know that the State of Alaska is far different than the State of California, Illinois, Louisiana, or New So let those States decide the system that works best for them.  What is the timeline? This year, 2017, we would like to repeal ObamaCare but put in place the legislation which allows, in 2018, for a State legislature or a Governor to choose the option they wish and the method by which they wish to enroll the people of their In 2019, the State would implement the replacement option of their choice. By 2020, the repeal and the replace would have been finished.  If, at a later date, a State wishes to change their option--they decided to stay with ObamaCare but on second thought now they wish to have the alternative we lay out, which I actually think would be something that might happen, they could choose that as a later option.  We are not being partisan. I tell folks, this is not a Republican plan, not[[Page S327]]a Democratic plan, it is a patient plan, born out of my experience working in a public hospital for the uninsured; that if you give the patient the power, things line up.

Montenegro's accession to NATO will serve the strategic interests of the United States, it will help to promote stability in the Balkans, and it will make us safer. Montenegro has already proven its support for American interests, having sent troops to Afghanistan in support of NATO- and U.S.-led operations there. Although not yet a member of the European Union, Montenegro also voluntarily joined the EU sanctions regime against Russia in response to Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea and destabilizing actions in eastern Most important, I have great confidence that Montenegro will meet the collective defense obligations of NATO membership.  For the past 10 years, with the assistance of the Maine National Guard through the State Partnership Program, Montenegro has worked hard to reform its military and to strengthen the rule of law to come into compliance with NATO requirements, as defined in NATO's Membership Action Even today, Maine National Guard members are deployed to Montenegro to assist its Ministry of Defense in furthering its integration into NATO standards and processes.  I want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to all of the[[Page S1993]]members of the Maine National Guard who have participated in this operation, including the former and current adjutant general, GEN Bill Libby and GEN Doug Farnham, as well as our current guardsman stationed in Montenegro, Army CPT Nicolas All of them have worked very hard during the past 10 years to help Montenegro get ready for this highly significant moment.  We must be clear-eyed about the fact that the Russian Federation has undertaken an extensive overt and covert campaign to derail Montenegro's bid to join These efforts include a brazen plot to disrupt Montenegro's elections last October and to turn the public against the pro-NATO ruling government there. According to Montenegro's special prosecutor assigned to the investigation, at least two Russian intelligence officers actively participated in this plot, which fortunately was disrupted.  Ratifying Montenegro's NATO membership demonstrates our firm resolve against Russia's efforts to deny other countries the opportunity to participate in NATO free from outside interference. That is why the Supreme Allied Commander for Europe and NATO testified just last week before the Senate Armed Services Committee that it is ``absolutely critical'' that Montenegro join  As President Trump prepares to travel to the NATO leaders' summit in Brussels at the end of May, I can think of no better action for the Senate to have taken ahead of his visit than our action tonight to finally ratify Montenegro's membership in In the meantime, I also look forward to the continued special relationship between Montenegro and the great State of  Thank you, Mr. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

12791,topic-id,854,"Mr.President, first, let me start by commending the Senator from Louisiana for all of the thought and the work he has put into coming up with an alternative plan that would fix ObamaCare and result in more Americans having affordable health insurance. As a physician, Senator Cassidy cares deeply about his patients and about patients in general. His goal, which I share, is to make sure every American has access to affordable health care. I commend him for his hard work and leadership.  There has been much debate lately on the best approach to replacing and reforming the Affordable Care Act, also known as Some of my colleagues have argued for immediate repeal without any replacement, an option I reject, for it risks leaving millions of vulnerable Americans without affordable health insurance and would undo important consumer protections provided by current law.  Others have proposed repeal with a delayed effective date of 2 or 3 years to allow time for the Senate to devise legislation that would provide a better approach to health insurance. My concern with the repeal-and-delay plan is that the ObamaCare exchanges, already on very shaky financial ground, would go into a death spiral as consumers would face uncertainty and insurers would have no basis for pricing their policies.  Already we have seen insurers fleeing the marketplaces in many States, reducing choices for consumers. In some States, only one or two insurers remain on the exchanges, leaving individuals and families with few, if any, choice of insurance carriers. Every single one of the 23 State cooperatives whose startup costs were financed by ObamaCare has experienced severe financial problems and only five remain operational today.  Many States, including Maine, are experiencing double-digit increases in premiums, causing increased costs for consumers and for taxpayers. So repeal and delay would only exacerbate this problem.  I am pleased to see a growing consensus among Members of both the Senate and the House that we must fix ObamaCare, provide reforms at nearly the same time that we repeal the law, in order to protect families who rely on the program and to give insurers time to transition to a new marketplace that is based on more choices for consumers.  Many of us have been working for years on proposals to reform our health care system, to expand coverage, and to encourage new delivery systems that would help restrain the growth in health care costs. That is what the legislation that I am going to be pleased to be joining my colleague from Louisiana on, would do. It is focused on giving more choices while ensuring that consumers have access to affordable health insurance.  We have advanced bipartisan proposals in the past to deal with provisions of the law that have increased costs and discouraged employers from hiring full-time workers. Regrettably, every such reform has been met with a veto threat. That is why we continued to work.  In 2015, I joined Senator Cassidy in introducing a more comprehensive and creative approach, the Patient Freedom Act, which is the basis for the legislation we are going to be introducing soon. It would allow States to have more choices. If they like the Affordable Care Act, they can keep the Affordable Care If they want to go an alternative route that is more patient-centered, that would provide more choices and help to restrain costs, they can do that, too, and the Federal Government would bundle the funding that would otherwise be used for ACA subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid in their State and allow them to proceed along a more creative route.  We recognize how different the needs of our States are, but our citizens should have access to affordable health care and be able to choose the path that works best for them.  We will be talking more about the specifics of our bill when we introduce it, but I am excited about this approach. I am not saying it is perfect, but it is important that we put specific proposals on the table that our colleagues can coalesce around, debate, and refine so that we can move ahead and remove the fear and uncertainty of families who are relying on coverage through the exchanges without putting an undue burden on the employers who create jobs in this country.  Mr.President, let me again commend the Senator from He has worked so hard to come up with a fresh approach. He has been very open to suggestions that I and others have made.  We all understand the importance of maintaining the consumer protections that help individuals with preexisting conditions, that ensure that young people can remain on their parents' insurance policies until age 26, and that prohibit lifetime caps. Those provisions would remain. But what we want to do is to allow our States the option of selecting a different path that will lead to patient-directed reforms that contain costs and provide citizens with more health care choices. The Patient Freedom Act does just that.  Again, I want to commend my colleague Senator Cassidy for his leadership.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

The alliance's self-defense clause has only been invoked once, after 9/11, when our allies deployed with us to  Our militaries, in their working together, allow NATO to function. NATO members have committed to spending 2 percent of their GDPs on their militaries, but only the United Kingdom, Estonia, Poland, Greece, and the United States currently hit that goal.

States that are interested in becoming allies are encouraged to join the Partnership for When those states then meet the criteria for membership, they are welcomed into the alliance.  This process is exactly what occurred with Just after becoming[[Page S1989]]an independent country in June of 2006, Montenegro joined the Partnership for Peace in December 2006. Exactly 3 years later, Montenegro obtained its Membership Action Six years after that, NATO recognized that Montenegro had met all of the necessary standards for membership and invited the country to begin talks to become part of the alliance. Then, in May of 2016, NATO's Foreign Ministers signed the protocol to formally open the way for Montenegro to join. As of today, every other NATO member has already ratified this treaty and Montenegro's inclusion.  Beyond such procedural steps, Montenegro has long been contributing to shared security challenges. For example, Montenegro actively supported the NATO-led operation in Afghanistan from 2010 until its end in 2014 and now is supporting the follow-on mission to train, advise, and assist Afghan security forces. It is important to note that Montenegro has taken these steps despite Russia's best efforts to undermine their progress every step of the way.  I thank Senator Ben Cardin; the Europe and Regional Security Cooperation Subcommittee chairman, Ron Johnson; and my other colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for their support and constructive work during this process.

I think there has been a little bit of an evolution here. I know that the reason we are having to go through this process of filibustering a treaty is the fact that the Senator from Kentucky wanted a vote on an unrelated amendment relative to surveillance here in our own country. When he was unable to get that agreement, he decided to filibuster a treaty. So that is what is happening here.  I am interested to hear this evolution of why we are having this debate. Let me just say, having dealt with this issue firsthand--and I know he knows this--this filibuster is about something totally unrelated to the amendment that is being offered right now.  I know the Senator from Kentucky, my friend, knows that I have offered authorizations for the use of force. I did so against Syria, and I am glad to have a debate on authorizations for the use of force, and I think we should. I know the administration is developing a strategy around ISIS right now, and when they complete that, it is my hope that we will, in fact, update the 2001  I think it has been stated by past administrations that the authorization they are utilizing as it relates to ISIS is legal. I believe them to be correct. But I will say that I agree we ought to have another debate on the issue of authorizing the fight against ISIS, and I hope we will do so as soon as this administration completes the process of laying out what their plan is. Then we can debate that and then hopefully update that authorization. I don't know what that has to do with a treaty with There has been a lot that has been said, and I don't know how it necessarily ties together. But the fact is, when you enter into an article 5 treaty--which has, by the way, passed out of our committee on two occasions--you are, in fact, saying under article 5 that a war against one is a war against all and that we will come to their defense. So the amendment itself, if we were to vote on it, would basically negate that.  I think the Senator from Kentucky could have had this vote, but the fact is that 98 Senators wanted to have this vote--have wanted to have this vote for months, I might add--and we have had to come to this point of filing cloture.  So, with that, with good will toward the Senator, with good will toward the other 97 Senators here who would like to pass this posthaste, I object.  The PRESIDING Objection is heard.

But I wanted, first, to extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those tragically killed in an automobile crash near New Valley, TX, last week.  A bus carrying a group of 14 members of the First Baptist Church in New[[Page S2165]]Braunfels collided with a pickup truck on Highway 83. Thirteen people were killed and two others, including the driver of the other vehicle, were injured. You can imagine how heartbreaking this has been to everyone involved. I can't begin to imagine the pain and the grief felt by their loved ones, their church family, and their entire close-knit community of New Braunfels, TX, just north of San  I had the opportunity to speak with the pastor of First Baptist of New Braunfels, Pastor McLean, the day after the accident. He is leading his congregation and that community during this very difficult time. He is shepherding his flock, though, with grace and strength. There is a phrase I am reminded off in times like this. After the terrible explosion in West Texas, I had a county commissioner from that area tell me: Being a Texan doesn't describe where you are from, it describes who your family is.  Today, our family is mourning. But I know Pastor McLean and all of my fellow Texans and all Americans really lift up this community in prayer, along with the families and friends of those we lost.  I am grateful to the first responders and medical professionals who were first to arrive at the scene of the accident and lent a hand to those in need.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Separately, Madam President, as I have indicated, this is an important week for the American people. Earlier today, the Judiciary Committee voted to send Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Senate floor for full consideration. Later this week, he will be confirmed as the next Associate Justice of the U.Supreme For the past several weeks and through 20 grueling hours of questioning before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Gorsuch has proven to be one of the most qualified nominees to the Court in modern history.  Republicans in the Senate said we would give the American people a voice in who would select the next Supreme Court In a sense, we had a referendum of whether it would be a nominee selected by Donald Trump or by Hillary On November 8, we saw the outcome of that election. This week, that referendum will be answered when the country will have its ninth Justice on the Supreme  Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues are doing their very best to decide that they should mount the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in American history. This is truly unprecedented. I know sometimes people want to talk about 1968 and the Abe Fortas nomination, but not even then was there a partisan filibuster that successfully blocked the confirmation of a Supreme Court  What I am talking about is blocking the ability to have an up-or-down vote. I am not talking about how people vote on the confirmation vote. I am talking about allowing us to have a vote--that up-or-down vote--or denying it by virtue of the filibuster. I, for one, have been encouraged to see people from across the country speaking out and urging our colleagues to drop their obstruction and to allow such an up-or-down vote on an incredibly qualified, upstanding, and brilliant judge.  Editorials from all over the country have registered their opposition to the idea of a filibuster and have done so rather bluntly. The Chicago Tribune, for example, said: ``Neil Gorsuch earns his Supreme Court seat.'' The Boston Herald says: ``Shame on Senate Dems.'' The Boston Herald specifically said that those going along with the strategy were ``blindly partisan for whom any nomination made by President Trump would never be qualified.''  The Denver Post, in the home State of Judge Gorsuch, urged Senators to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and specifically urged the senior Senator from Colorado, Senator Bennet, not to cooperate with this blind partisanship and this filibuster but rather to allow the judge an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.  Their editorial title made that much clearer. They said: ``Michael Bennet should buck Democrats and speak up for Neil Gorsuch.''  The Billings Gazette in Montana had this to say: ``Democrats refuse to rise above petty partisan politics.''  The Richmond Times-Dispatch took the junior Senator from Virginia to task and said: His opposition to Judge Gorsuch, ``suggests he can't come up with a defensible reason to oppose the nomination.''  Finally in New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Union Leader editorial last week was titled: ``Confirm Gorsuch: Dems plan pointless filibuster.'' ``Pointless'' about sums it up. There is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch is qualified. He has received the highest rating from the American Bar Association, which reportedly interviewed 500 leading lawyers and practitioners in the country, and the ratings system of the American Bar Association has been called by many of our Senate Democratic colleagues the ``gold standard'' when it comes to confirmations.  Among the legal and local communities, Judge Gorsuch enjoys broad bipartisan support, but that seems to make no difference to our friends across the aisle who voted on a party-line vote not to send his nomination from the Judiciary Of course, their minority position lost when the majority of the committee voted today to send that nomination to the floor.  I can't help but think that they are in an unenviable position, torn by their desire to do what they know is the right thing when it comes to confirming a good judge, and, on the other hand, being attacked by their own party's political base, telling them that if they vote to confirm this judge, they are somehow going to suffer some political damage.  Of these newspapers I mentioned, not one of them endorsed Donald Trump for President--not one. But unlike some of our Senate colleagues, they are able to distinguish between President Trump and Judge Neil Gorsuch, instead of using Donald Trump as a proxy not to vote to confirm Neil  These newspapers are urging Senate Democrats to drop this pointless filibuster because they understand that it will not be President Trump we will be voting on next week. It is Judge Neil Now, after repeatedly moving the goalposts for this nominee, my Democratic friends are saying that he has to pass the ``traditional'' threshold of 60 votes. Well, that is a made-up standard.  Throughout our Nation's history, the Senate has not had a tradition of filibustering judges. It was a strategy cooked up by Senator Schumer, Laurence Tribe from Harvard Law School, and other liberal activists to try to block President George Bush's judges when he was President of the United So there is no 60-vote threshold in Senate tradition. Actually, there have only been four cloture votes for a Supreme Court nominee--only four--and none of them for a partisan filibuster that actually succeeded in blocking an up-or-down vote for a nominee.  One of the newspaper fact checks concluded with this. They said: ``There is no traditional 60-vote `standard' or `rule' for Supreme Court nominations, no matter how much or how often Democrats claim otherwise.'' This should be a time when the Senate should come together in a bipartisan fashion and do what it is supposed to do when we receive the nomination of such a highly qualified person.  Judge Gorsuch has won bipartisan approval. People across the country understand that, as do a number of independent Democrats here in the Senate, and they understand the dangerous path the minority leader is setting us and them on. Unfortunately, the Democratic leader wants to mount the first successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in our history.  But I would point out that no Republican Senator in the Senate has ever voted to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee, including those nominated by Democratic As a matter of fact, Justice Clarence Thomas was confirmed with 52 votes. If the threshold were really 60, then he would not currently be serving on the Supreme Court of the United Even such polar opposites as Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg were confirmed by virtually unanimous votes because people understood that once the President was elected, that the President's choice should matter, and the Senate should not artificially try to lift up a 60-vote threshold in order to block, effectively, the will of the voters in choosing the president.  A few years ago, when we considered the nominations of Justice Sotomayor[[Page S2166]]and Justice Kagan, we gave both nominees a simple up-or-down vote. So our friends across the aisle have a simple but very important decision to make. They can listen to the extremist groups on the left that are urging them to resist at all costs or they can assert some of their independence.  As of today, several of our Democratic colleagues have done exactly that. I congratulate them. I am glad Senator Heitkamp, Senator Manchin, and Senator Donnelly have said they will assert their prerogative, as Senators, to allow an up-or-down vote for this nominee and actually vote for them. I hope they stand firm, but I hope, more importantly, more of their colleagues will demonstrate the same sort of independence from the radical base of the Democratic Party that says no to everything this President does. I hope they at least afford Judge Gorsuch an up-or-down vote because, if the Democrats successfully block Judge Gorsuch, there is literally no nominee from this President who they will not block--plain and simple.  So as we have been saying, Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed at the end of this week, but it is up to the Democrats as to how that happens.  Madam President, I yield the floor.

12656,topic-id,1866,"Mr.President, earlier today in the Senate Judiciary Committee, we considered the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as the next Justice on the U.Supreme According to Judiciary Committee practice, that nomination was held over for a week, which means that Judge Gorsuch will be voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 3, and it will be available for floor action thereafter.  As the Nation--and perhaps even the world--knows, we held lengthy hearings last week to review his qualifications, his experience, and his approach to judging. I have to say that he really impressed everybody who approached this whole issue with an open mind about whether he was qualified to serve on the High But unfortunately, as those of us who work in the Senate know, there has already been a threat by the Democratic leader to filibuster his nomination.  It is really important for the country to recall that there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a nominee to the U.Supreme Sometimes people want to talk about Abe Fortas in 1968, but ultimately Abe Fortas, who was nominated to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by his friend and mentor, Lyndon Johnson, asked to withdraw his nomination after one failed cloture vote and ultimately ended up resigning from the Supreme Court of the United States in disgrace. It is hardly a precedent for what Democrats have said they are going to do with regard to this good man and this good judge, Neil  I understand my friend the Democratic leader has a tough job. He has a split caucus--those who want to take Democrats over the ledge and those who would like to try to find some way to work out a reasonable accommodation. Unfortunately, he is under a lot of pressure from the radical groups on the left to do whatever he can to tank this superb nominee. Again, this would be unprecedented in American history.  It is true that Democrats in 2013 did the so-called nuclear option, which has established a new precedent in the Senate with regard to lower court judges--circuit court judges and district court judges--along with Cabinet nominees. Ironically, the so-called Reid precedent of 2013 has kind of come back to bite them a little bit, as President Trump now has been able to see all of his Cabinet members confirmed with 51 votes, or, in the case of one, 50 plus the Vice  I was glad to see a quote from a report in a Vermont publication from our friend the senior Senator from Vermont, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in which he said he wasn't inclined to filibuster the nomination of Judge Gorsuch and that he deserves a minimum of an up-or-down vote. So I hope others will follow the lead of Senator Leahy, who has been in the Senate a long time in the majority and in the minority. He realizes it is important to maintain a certain level of tradition and decorum here in the Senate, because usually what goes around comes around. Unfortunately, this new precedent of filibustering Supreme Court Justices, if allowed to happen, is going to continue to be very damaging to the Senate and even to the country.  I hope he is still of that same mind--that he is not inclined to filibuster the nomination of Judge If he takes that position, I know he will influence a lot of colleagues on the other side of the aisle because of his distinguished record of service in the Senate and in the Judiciary  I look forward to the committee approving Judge Gorsuch's nomination next week and then taking that nomination up on the Senate floor and confirming the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to serve as the next Associate Justice on the U.Supreme                               ObamaCare  Mr.President, last week, a lot of attention was focused on the House of Representatives and their efforts to fix our Nation's healthcare system.  We have said for a long time that ObamaCare needs to be repealed and replaced. I stand by that comment, and I know many of our colleagues do as well. But I want to make something else clear. The failure of ObamaCare isn't a problem for Democrats or Republicans alone. It is a problem for the entire country, and particularly those who find their premiums going up by double digits every year, their deductibles unaffordable, or even choices drying up because insurance companies simply have withdrawn from the individual market. Our colleagues on the Democratic side have repeatedly recognized the problems with ObamaCare, even though they pushed it through on a partisan vote 7 years ago.  The fact of the matter is that the President promised: If you like your healthcare policy, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; and, premiums for a family of four will go down by an average of $2,500. None of that has proven to be true. People were misled into believing that ObamaCare would somehow be the gold standard for healthcare in the country, and people are being hurt now by high premiums, high deductibles, and fewer choices. Indeed, 30 million people remain uninsured in this country because of the cost or the fact that they just decide that they don't want to buy government-mandated healthcare. They either pay a penalty through the IRS or they simply get a hardship exemption. There are 30 million people currently uninsured, more or less, under  I want to remind our colleagues on the other side that they understand ObamaCare needs some work, and many of them have made repeated calls to fix it. Last year, for example, the junior Senator from Wisconsin said of ObamaCare:       There were things obviously that need perfecting, need      revisiting. Even if it were perfect, over time we would have      to make adaptations, and so I think we would absolutely want      to strengthen it.  Not even our colleague, the junior Senator from Wisconsin, is saying ObamaCare is delivering 100 percent on the promise. She is saying it needs some work.  The senior Senator from Indiana has echoed this sentiment. He said:       I supported the Affordable Care Act because I wanted to      help working- and middle-class families to have access to      healthcare. That doesn't mean the law is perfect, and it      doesn't mean that we don't still have work to do. That's why      I'm working with my colleagues to make this bill stronger.  We haven't seen any proposals from our friends across the aisle on how to fix the law, which they concede is far from perfect. Instead, what we have seen is their standing back, watching Republicans trying to do this by ourselves and coming up short last week in the House of To my mind, that is not commendable behavior on their part. I thought we all came here to the U.Senate to try to do things and fix problems for the constituents we represent. It is purely partisan to say: We know ObamaCare is falling apart, and it is not delivering as we promised. And, oh yes, you Republicans can try to fix it, but if you don't have the votes to do it, we are just going to sit back and applaud or react with glee from a partisan perspective because our political opponents somehow came up short when it came to the votes in the  The truth is, ObamaCare didn't bring massive relief for working- and middle-class For many, it made life more difficult with skyrocketing premiums, losing their plans and the doctors they wanted, and having fewer options to choose from.  I will quote one of our colleagues on the other side of the isle, the junior Senator from North Her website says: ``With any major legislation, there are improvements that need to be made so that it works as well as possible, and that holds true for the[[Page S1986]]healthcare reform law,'' speaking of  She goes on to say that she is committed to ``correcting the parts of the healthcare reform law that do not make sense, improve on others, and implement new ideas to improve on healthcare costs and improve quality.''  I am grateful to our colleague from North Dakota for her honesty and open take on where things stand with respect to ObamaCare, but that is just a start. What we need to do now is work together to try to address the failings of ObamaCare where it is not delivering as promised and where even our colleagues across the aisle have said that it needs to be fixed in order to make sure that people have access to affordable, accessible quality healthcare. They don't have that now.  My point is that ObamaCare was a bill sold to the American people under false pretenses by the previous administration, and it has proved to be a disaster for many people. I was reading an article--I think it was either in the Washington Post or the New York Times today--about a woman in Texas who runs a hair care salon and who has intentionally kept her number of employees under the threshold under which ObamaCare's employer mandate would be invoked. So rather than spending time focusing on growing her business and improving her business, she has consciously kept it smaller, with fewer employees, because she knows that the burden of complying with the ObamaCare employer mandate will ultimately make her business less profitable. And when her business is less profitable, it means she can hire fewer people and perhaps can't pay the wages or the benefits she would like to pay her employees.  So I would just say to our colleagues across the aisle that I understand you think you had a pretty good day last week when the Republicans couldn't pass the healthcare plan on their own in the House, but I don't think this is a time for people to enjoy other people's failed efforts to try to improve the status quo. It is a mandate, I believe, for all of us to work together to address the flaws that we know exist--that they admitted exist--to try to do better when it comes to affordable, accessible healthcare for the American people.  This law will fail. Insurance companies will withdraw from the market, and the individual market serving roughly 18 million people will literally dry up and go away. Imagine how those families are going to be impacted.  I wouldn't want to be somebody who said: Well, I had an opportunity to fix it; yes, I had an opportunity to address your concerns when it came to affordable healthcare, but for partisan political reasons, I simply stood down and did nothing and literally washed my hands of it.  So before this law collapses--and it will--I hope our colleagues across the aisle will start offering their ideas and their solutions to bring better healthcare to families across the country. That is what I think our constituents expect of us. That is in the finest tradition of the U.Senate, and our constituents deserve no less.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.690, the Gains in Global Nuclear Detection Architecture Act of 2016, sponsored by Representative H.690 directs the Department of Homeland Security's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to develop and maintain documentation that provides information on how the office's research investments align with gaps in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture and the research challenges identified by the Domestic Nuclear Detection  It further directs the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to document the rationale for selecting research topics and to develop a systematic approach for evaluating how the outcomes of the office's individual research projects collectively contribute to addressing the research challenges.  ISIS has declared its intention to develop weapons of mass destruction, which include nuclear devices, as well as radiological dispersal devices. The key to preventing this from happening is to make sure that nuclear material never falls into terrorist hands.  According to data compiled by the International Atomic Energy Agency, there were nearly 1,150 incidents involving theft, criminal possession, or loss of radiological material reported between 1993 and 2014. The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California identified 325 instances alone between 2013 and 2014 in 38 different countries where nuclear or radioactive material was stolen, lost, or outside of regulatory control.  The amount of nuclear material in peaceful uses in the world has risen by 70 percent since 1999. It will continue to grow in the coming decades as global use of nuclear power increases.  Just last summer, six men were convicted in Tbilisi, Georgia, for trying to sell uranium-238; and in January of 2016, three members of a criminal group were detained for trying to sell caesium-137, which could be used to make a dirty bomb.  We must ensure that terrorists never get their hands on radioactive materials. This bill will enhance the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office's ability to provide radiation detection devices specifically aimed at preventing terrorists from being able to obtain enough radioactive material to construct a dirty bomb.  This bill will ensure that the research topics it chooses to invest in to enhance our ability to detect smuggled nuclear materials are aligned with the gaps that have been identified in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture, a multiagency framework for detecting, analyzing, and reporting on nuclear and other radioactive materials that are out of regulatory control.  Requiring the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to document their rationale for choosing research topics will ensure that the most important gaps in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture are addressed.                              {time}  1615  I would like to thank Mr.Richmond for the work that he and his staff have done on this legislation. I believe this will better enable this country to detect smuggling of nuclear materials and prevent ISIS and other terrorists from carrying out a nuclear or radiological attack on American soil.

12590,topic-id,448,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise in support of H.655, the Securing the Cities Act of 2017.  Representing New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and Brooklyn, and as a former district attorney, I fully understand the importance of protecting our major cities from catastrophic terrorist attacks. In keeping our pledge to never forget 9/11, it is our duty to ensure that such an attack never happens again. This legislation underscores our commitment and gives the Department of Homeland Security the tools it needs to carry out this mission.  In 2015, the Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing at Ground Zero in lower At that hearing, we heard from Commissioner Bratton of the New York City Police Department who described the current threat environment facing New York In his testimony, he specifically referenced the risk that terrorists may introduce illicit nuclear materials into the city to conduct an attack. Similarly, Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly recently stated: The United States must prepare for the eventuality of a catastrophic attack given the potential impact and consequences.  This bill establishes the Securing the Cities program at the Department of Homeland Security to enhance the ability of the United States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high-consequence events using nuclear and other radiological materials in high-risk urban areas.  The Securing the Cities program within the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office provides training, equipment, and other resources to State and local law enforcement in high-risk urban areas to prevent a terrorist group from carrying out an attack using a radiological or nuclear device.  The Securing the Cities program began in 2006 as a pilot program in the New York City region which included Jersey City and Since 2007, the New York City region has purchased nearly 14,000 radiation detectors and trained nearly 20,000 personnel. The pilot program has been so successful it was expanded to the Los Angeles/Long Beach region in fiscal year 2012, the National Capital Region in fiscal year 2014, and to the cities of Houston and Chicago in 2016. Once the Securing[[Page H797]]the Cities program is fully implemented, it will protect nearly 100 million people across this country.  I would like to thank the Department of Homeland Security for its hard work and commitment to this program. Given the alarming terrorist threat from ISIS and al Qaeda and their willingness to carry out an attack using a weapon of mass destruction, this program could not be more vital.

12482,topic-id,1061,"Mr.President, for 7 years, Republicans in Congress have promised to ``repeal and replace ObamaCare,'' but not once during those 7 years did they actually put together a piece of legislation to make good on that promise.  Not once during those 7 years did Republican leaders actually convene serious hearings and meetings with patients, hospitals, insurers, and medical groups to discuss how best to reform our healthcare system, instead preferring to just rail against the law.  Not once during those 7 years did congressional Republicans actually try to sit down with Democrats and work on a bipartisan basis to improve upon the law.  But here is what they did do: They did everything possible to gum up the works, with many Republican Governors even refusing to expand Medicaid, denying millions of their constituents access to healthcare.  They went on TV, did interviews, and held campaign rallies about how all of[[Page S2147]]the challenges facing our healthcare system, challenges that we faced even before we passed the ACA, was the fault of ObamaCare and made empty promises about ``repeal and replace.''  Congressional Republicans voted over 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act when they knew President Obama was in office and he would veto repeal--60 times.  Now, with Republicans controlling the House, the Senate, the White House, you know what they are doing? Nothing--they cancelled their vote last Friday to repeal the law.  Why? As evidenced last week, they are incapable of developing a proposal that garners the support of their own Republican They are incapable of bringing a piece of legislation to the House Floor for a vote, despite having a large Republican majority in the  Now, after 17 legislative days of trying to ram through a bill that would have thrown at least 24 million people off their health insurance, reduced protections for 178 million people who have employer-based coverage, increased costs for seniors and rural communities, and given a huge tax break to drug companies and the wealthiest Americans, Republicans are giving up.  Time to move on, they say; time to tackle tax reform, they say.  Well, I, along with the majority of Americans who have benefited from this law, am relieved.  The Affordable Care Act is not perfect--no law is.  It made sure 20 million more Americans could get health insurance, including 1 million As a result, our uninsured rate is at its lowest level in our Nation's history.  Young people are staying on their parents' plans till age 26, and seniors are seeing big savings on their prescription drugs.  Women can no longer be charged more than men for the same coverage, and people with preexisting conditions can no longer be discriminated against.  Annual and lifetime caps on benefits are a thing of the past, and people now have access to maternity and newborn care, as well as mental health and substance abuse treatment.  Now that Republicans have acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act is, as Speaker Ryan stated, ``the law of the land . . . for the foreseeable future,'' it is time to start building off of it.  Like Medicare and Social Security before it, it is time to make some bipartisan modifications that can help improve the law.  We need to increase insurer competition because, in too many of our communities, there are not enough options.  We need to address individual market premium increases because, for too many of our constituents, an affordable health plan is still out of reach.  I, along with many of my Democratic colleagues, have put forth ideas to deal with some of these issues.  I support the creation of a ``public plan,'' which would both increase competition in areas that are lacking and drive down premiums since, as Medicare has demonstrated time and again, the Federal Government can be more efficient than private for-profit companies.  I support legislation to bring down the high cast of prescription drugs, which are driving up premiums for families nationwide.  BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois now pays more for prescription drugs than they do on inpatient hospital costs, and they readily admit that drug costs are contributing to premium hikes.  We need to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. We need to end ``pay for delay'' agreements and get cheaper drugs on the market quicker. We need to prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising. We need more transparency into how drug prices are set, and we need penalties on drug companies that gouge the American public.  I also support enforcing portions of the law that Republicans have sabotaged and undermined since its inception. We need to allow the ``risk corridor'' program to operate unimpeded. We need to expand Medicaid in all States, especially since we know that premiums are highest and competition lowest in nonexpansion States, and we need to enforce the law--which is why the very first order of business going forward must be for President Trump to rescind the Executive order he issued on January 20.  The President's order directed the heads of all Federal agencies responsible for implementing and enforcing the Affordable Care Act to stand down, to not implement the law, to not enforce the law.  Now that the page has hopefully been turned on the ugly ``repeal'' chapter of this saga, it is time for the President and his administration to faithfully implement, enforce, and help improve this law.  I am calling on the President and congressional Republicans: Now is the time to stop undermining the law that is enjoying record support from  Now is not time to throw sand in the law's eyes, put a spoke in its wheel, and then turn around, gloat, and blame Democrats when it does not function properly.  The Affordable Care Act while championed by Democrats and President Obama, included over 100 Republican amendments and, for better or worse, borrowed heavily from Republican ideas for the marketplace.  Let's end these partisan games.  This law--the good and the shortcomings--is on all of us to improve.  Democrats have ideas, but we cannot do it alone. Remember, the Republican Party controls the House, the Senate, and the White  They are in charge. If improvements are going to be made, Republicans are going to have to get serious.  Now that the half-baked repeal effort has collapsed, my hope is that Republicans will finally be willing to sit down and work with I know I am ready to pull up a chair.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2146-2.txt,326,UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,30.0,April

12792,topic-id,486,"Mr.President, let me start by commending my colleagues from Louisiana and I really believe their approach to the Affordable Care Act is much more reasonable than what we have heard in the past from some.  Senator Collins just went through a litany of options of repeal and run or repeal and replace 2 years from now. None of those are good options, and there is a reason why there is a backlash against this repeal effort across the country now, even among many Republicans as they consider the chaos that would be created by simply repealing it.  I don't know the merits of the proposal they brought before us. I can tell you, having been through the debate on the Affordable Care Act, which went on for years, that there are many complex questions that need to be addressed to satisfy all of us that we are doing the best we can do to give affordable, quality health care to more and more people across the United  The Congressional Budget Office just put out its report on what would happen if we just repealed, and it is a disaster. The number of people who are uninsured would increase by 18 million in the first new year following enactment of a repeal bill.  Later, after the elimination of the ACA's expansion of Medicaid eligibility and subsidies for insurance purchased through the ACA, that number will increase to 27 million more uninsured and then to 32 million in 2026.  Premiums in the nongroup market--and those are folks who don't work for companies that provide health insurance--premiums in the nongroup market, with just repeal, would increase by 20 to 25 percent in the first year and then reach 50 percent in the year following the elimination of the Medicaid expansion and would double by 2026. So fewer people would have insurance, and those who do would pay dramatically more.  So we shouldn't take this as just a matter of being able to have a bragging right about repeal. If we are serious about legislating, we should be looking at the options to find out how to make the Affordable Care Act better or how to approach it in a different manner.  I commend my colleagues on the Republican side. Here is what it comes down to: If a handful of Republican Senators will say to the leadership: We are not going to vote to repeal until we have a replacement, then we can have a constructive conversation. But this notion of repealing the Affordable Care Act and then getting around to replacing it at some later time is irresponsible, will create chaos, and really says[[Page S328]]to the American people: We are no longer committed to making sure your family has the peace of mind of good health insurance. So I thank them for the efforts they have put into this, and I look forward to working with them.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS326.txt,326,OLD VESSELS EXEMPTION ACT--Continued,2017.0,17.0,March

I look forward to helping make sure he can receive a vote here on the Senate floor.  In the weeks since his nomination, I have spoken at length about his qualifications to serve on the Supreme I have recognized him as a conservative champion of religious liberty, a defender of the separation of powers, and a westerner who will bring some much needed geographic diversity and a regional perspective to the  During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Gorsuch showed the country what it means to be a judge.  Big or small, popular or unpopular, powerful or powerless, Judge Gorsuch promised to render judgments based on the facts of the case, nothing else. He also has a remarkable record of respectful cooperation with judges appointed by Presidents of both parties.  During his decade-long tenure on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Gorsuch participated in more than 2,700 appeals. These comprised some of the most difficult cases across six Of those cases, 97 percent of them were decided unanimously--97 percent.  Judge Gorsuch was in the majority 99 percent of the time. He was in the majority on those cases 99 percent of the time. This is a testament to Judge Gorsuch's ability to consider other points of view and to seek out consensus, where possible. To try to paint Judge Gorsuch as an ideologue simply doesn't work. Those are essential qualities for any prospective Supreme Court  Now that we have reported Judge Gorsuch out of committee as of today, I would like to say a few words on the obstacles that stand in the way of his being considered here on the Senate floor.  As we proceed with Judge Gorsuch's confirmation, I would like to explain my support for confirming him in light of what transpired in the waning months of the previous administration.  For nearly 230 years, Presidents have been making nominations to the Supreme According to the Congressional Research Service: ``From the appointment of the first Justices in 1789 through its consideration of Nominee Elena Kagan in 2010, the Senate has confirmed 124 Supreme Court nominations out of 160 received.''  I would like to reiterate that number. Out of 160 Supreme Court nominations in our Nation's history, 124 were confirmed.  The Congressional Research Service goes on to state: ``Of the 36 nominations which were not confirmed, 11 were rejected outright in roll-call votes by the Senate, while nearly all of the rest, in the face of substantial committee or Senate opposition to the nominee or the President, were withdrawn by the President, or were postponed, tabled, or never voted on by the Senate.''  The manner in which the Senate decides to provide its constitutional advice and consent on Presidential nominations has varied over the centuries[[Page S2167]]with respect to nominations. This includes decisions not to take up Supreme Court nominees.  As Jonathan Adler put it in his article in the George Mason Law Review:       Much as the Senate may reject a legislative proposal that      originated in the House of Representatives by voting it down,      killing it in committee, or simply refusing to take up the      measure, the Senate may withhold its consent by voting      against confirmation of a nominee, rejecting the nominee in      committee, or simply refusing to act.  Is refusing to act the preferred outcome? I can certainly see where some would say no, as would  However, the history of the Senate demonstrates that to do otherwise in similar circumstances, as we just experienced is, in fact, a rare exception.  To cite Adler's law review article again, he states: ``The last time a Supreme Court vacancy arose in the calendar year of a Presidential election and was filled prior to [the] election was in 1932.''  President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the heat of the 2016 Presidential election. When he was nominated, I understood the frustration of those on the other side of the aisle over the fate of that nomination.  I met Judge He is a good man and a good judge, but the decision by the majority not to take up Judge Garland's nomination was not inconsistent with a longstanding practice of filling Supreme Court vacancies after elections.  This brings us today to why I support confirming Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme There is no question about the appropriateness of confirming Supreme Court nominees during the first years of the President's term, let alone the first 3 months. In fact, there is absolutely no justification for filibustering a highly qualified Supreme Court nominee put forward by the President who was just elected. That is just unprecedented.  There was an attempt to use this tactic in 2006 with Justice Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court, but he garnered sufficient bipartisan support so that cloture was invoked.  Today, it appears that we will not enjoy that same rational support. My preference would be to change the behavior of Senators rather than change the rules of the But here we are, where a nominee who would have received unanimous or nearly unanimous support just a few years ago is about to be filibustered.  My question is this: If we can't confirm a judge like Judge Gorsuch under contemporary use of Senate rules, who can we confirm?  It looks as if we will move forward later this week and make the rest of the Executive Calendar subject to the same simple majority threshold. Again, a change in Senate rules is not my preferred outcome, but this rule change will simply make de jure what was de facto prior to 2003, when filibusters were virtually never used on the President's Executive  Now, I want to make clear my steadfast support to preserve the legislative filibuster. We need to distinguish between the President's Executive Calendar, which has traditionally never been filibustered or subject to filibuster, and the legislative filibuster, which is used frequently here to ensure that we work across the aisle.  The Framers of our Constitution had the wisdom to create a Senate with a strong minority to serve as a check on runaway power. If we were to eliminate the legislative filibuster, we would cease to be that check, and, indeed, the Senate would cease to be the  We have a qualified mainstream jurist before us. That is Judge I encourage all of my colleagues to give him fair consideration and to advance his nomination to an up-or-down vote. I will be voting to confirm him, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield back the remainder of my time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

12525,topic-id,281,"Mr.Speaker, in a time when so many Americans are looking for ideas and policies we can unite around, one point of agreement stands out. There is strong consensus among Americans that they do not want their taxpayer dollars being used to fund abortions. A Marist poll released in January revealed that 61 percent of Americans feel this way.  States have always had the freedom to direct funds away from abortion providers, such as the Nation's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, and there are many reasons States may wish to do so. The most important reason, one that we should all carefully consider, is that abortion is not health care. Abortion takes the lives of unborn children and hurts women. Many States have recognized this tragic reality and, as a result, have chosen to award funds to health clinics and organizations that do not provide abortions.  But in December, the Obama administration issued a regulation that forces many States to drastically alter their previous course of action. The regulation requires States to include abortion providers as recipients of title X grant distributions. Not only does this regulation ignore the American people's wish that their tax dollars be directed away from abortion providers, it also denies States the flexibility to choose to allocate title X funds in a way that meets the needs of their citizens.  H.43 disapproves of this unacceptable regulation, allowing States to return to the status quo under which they were operating prior to the rule's issuance. If States wish to disburse title X funds away from abortion providers, that wish should be respected. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule and H.43.

I regret we had to do it this way, but when one Senator objects, then, it puts the pressure on the rest of us. One Senator can stop legislation like this.

But I want to thank Senator McConnell for putting aside floor time so that we can vote in the Senate to allow Montenegro to be a part of  Senator McCain has traveled the world as much as anybody I know. I have been to Montenegro with him at least once, if not twice. It is a beautiful place. They share our values. They want to move forward in terms of their democracy. They want to be part of They want to be part of free markets. They want the rule of law to replace the rule of the gun. Montenegro is trying to do everything that Putin hates--where you can actually vote for your own leaders, where you can have a judicial system that works, where people can walk the streets without fear, and where the leadership doesn't steal the country blind.  I want to let the people of Russia know--for those who went into the streets yesterday or the day before to protest the corruption of the Putin regime--that you have my undying respect and admiration, because I can only imagine how hard that was.  For the people of Montenegro, I know they have been waiting a long time for this day to come because Russia and, generally, Putin have been trying to overthrow their government.  To those people in this body who proclaim they are for freedom and liberty, here is what I suggest. If you are not for other people's freedom and other people's liberty, you will eventually lose yours. The idea that we can be safe and free and not engage the world and sit on the sidelines and watch people like Putin turn the world order upside down and not be affected is at best naive. It is worse than naive, but I want to be nice and say it is just naive.  What Putin is doing throughout the world is trying to break the backs of the world order, NATO, and the European He is trying to drive a wedge between the NATO countries, and he will be the biggest beneficiary of that. He is trying to break the back of the European Alliances of democracy are his worst nightmare. This is a huge step in the right direction.  I want to thank Senator McCain for being the most consistent voice in this body, and Senators McConnell and Schumer for allowing this vote. But our work is not done because it is one thing to vote in favor of Montenegro's entering NATO over Russia's objections. That is not enough. Senator McCain and myself, Senators Cardin and Rubio--Democrats and Republicans--all have crafted legislation to punish Russia for interfering in our elections. And they did. They are trying to break the backs of democracy in Ukraine, Georgia, and the Baltic nations. I hope the next thing we do in this body, in short order, on Russia is to punish them for their efforts to interfere and change and destabilize American democracy. I don't think they changed the outcome, but it was the Russians who did this to the Democratic Party, and I think every Republican should be equally offended.  I hope we can find some time on the floor, starting in the committee, to pass a Russia sanctions bill that, I believe, would get 80 votes. This is a great step in the right direction for people in It is a rebuke of Putin, but it is not enough.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today to debate a rule for a piece of legislation that many on this side of the aisle do not necessarily have a serious issue with. The attempt here today is to ensure that a thing that is already happening continues to happen.  I suppose that, the next time we meet, we will take up a bill that declares that the Moon is not the Doing so is a complete waste of time, but that does not seem to necessarily be dispositive when deciding whether we should legislate on an issue these days.  Look, I get it. My friends across the aisle took one on the chin the other week when their Affordable Care Act repeal bill--a bill they spent 17 days working on, even though they had 7 long years to prepare for it--went down in flames in a most public and spectacular fashion, and now they need some time to dust themselves off and become reoriented.  The problem is, while they are doing that, while they are recovering from the miserable failure that was their attempt to strip 24 million Americans of their health care, they are burning valuable time--time that should be used to tackle more pressing issues like addressing the debt ceiling and fixing our crumbling infrastructure.  Let me also take this opportunity to remind my Republican colleagues that, while we spend our time here today debating these filler bills, there are only 7 legislative days, including today, remaining before the government runs out of funding. But are we tackling any of these importance issues or ensuring the government remains open?  Instead, we have before us a bill that addresses an issue that is not an issue. On top of that, this legislation was actually supposed to be the third bucket of their three-bucket strategy to end health care for millions of  We saw how sturdy the first bucket was a couple of weeks ago. In fact, the bucket we are talking about today was actually referred to as the ``sucker's bucket'' by Senator That is not exactly a glowing endorsement.  Indeed, some, like Senator Cotton, have referred to all this bucket talk as simply a bunch of political spin. Whatever it is, it is certainly a bucket that has a hole in it.  In all of the uncertainty facing my Republican friends, one thing becomes crystal clear: they have no plan whatsoever to help working Americans achieve the American They are adrift, in general, and most particularly when it comes to health care.  What do they really want? At first, it was repeal, then it was repeal and replace, then it was repeal and delay, followed finally by access to coverage, and would you believe another one: patient-centered.  That is repeal, repeal and replace, repeal and delay, access to coverage, and patient-centered. We still don't have a plan. Then it turned toward a three-bucket strategy that makes little to any sense, let alone to the American people but even to powerful elected leaders in the Republican  At the end of the day, Mr.Speaker, do you know what all this talk was?[[Page H2649]]Exactly what Senator Cotton said: nothing but political spin.  My fear is that it will all come down to whatever it takes to win in the eyes of the other side of the aisle, regardless of the consequences to the American people.  While we were told there was no plan B, we now hear there is a plan Donald John Trump ``doesn't lose,'' and doesn't like to lose. So I guess they are going to pass something, even if it is just this bill that does absolutely nothing, just so our Republican friends can say they did something. I am sure Donald John Trump will tweet about this great victory.  Mr.Speaker, Republicans must end their secretive plan B option and embrace the opportunity to do what is right, which is to pursue a path that strengthens and builds upon the strong foundation that has been set by the Affordable Care  Democrats stand ready to work with my friends in the Republican Party on this task to continue to provide affordable coverage to millions of American citizens.

12557,topic-id,1327,"Mr.Speaker, I want to just conclude our earlier Special Order where many of my colleagues spoke out in strong opposition to the Muslim ban that was just signed by President  I would like to read a short paragraph from the letter that we have now[[Page H933]]submitted to Secretary It has been signed by over 110 of my colleagues in the It requests that we have an immediate emergency meeting and briefing. I include in the Record the entire letter, and I will just read a short portion.  ``The Executive Order is both controversial and confusing. For example, the International Rescue Committee called the Order `harmful and hasty' noting `America has the strongest, most successful resettlement program in the world.' Over 4,000 academics, including 25 Nobel Laureates, have signed a petition denouncing the Order, writing `this measure is fatally disruptive to the lives of these immigrants, their families, and the communities of which they form an integral part. It is inhumane, ineffective, and un-American.' ''                                     House of Representatives,                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 2017.     John Kelly,     Secretary of Homeland Security, Department of Homeland          Security, Washington,       Secretary Kelly: We write to strongly condemn the      President's executive order issued January 27, 2017, titled      ``Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry into the      United States,'' and the ensuing actions taken by the U.     Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its agencies, in      particular Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to implement      the order, and to request an urgent briefing regarding the      same. We hope you will urge the President to immediately      rescind the Executive Order, which has created profound chaos      and fear among refugees and immigrants who have been admitted      to the United States, as well as their families. As a nation      of immigrants that has been a refuge for people fleeing      persecution from around the world, these actions are contrary      to who we are as a nation.       We understand that you met yesterday at 4:30 PM with Chairs      and Ranking Members of relevant Committees to discuss      ``recent executive actions.'' You should understand that such      a time limited meeting with a subset of Members and Senators      in no way obviates the need for the briefing we are      requesting for all Such full Member briefings are a      frequent occurrence on Capitol Hill after important events      such as the issuance of the January 27 Executive They      allow all Members to benefit from the knowledge and      experiences of the executive branch so that we may be well      informed in our legislative and oversight affairs and serve      our constituents best. The full Member briefing regarding the      Executive Order is particularly needed given the unsettling      events of last evening--the abrupt firing of Acting Attorney      General Sally Yates and the termination without explanation      of Daniel Ragsdale as acting Director of Immigration and      Customs Enforcement (ICE). The need to brief the full      Democratic.Caucus is also necessary as we now understand that      guidance concerning the January 27 Executive Order has been      provided to Members of the Republican Conference, but not the      Democratic According to yesterday's Washington Post,      ``substantive guidance [concerning the Executive Order was      given] to congressional Republicans . . . late . .      . In a two-page memo that offered some details on the policy      . . .''.       The Executive Order harms our families, economy, and      national security. Over the weekend, individuals--some of      whom have been lawful permanent residents for decades--were      found stranded outside the United States, leaving families in      turmoil. Technology companies, including industry leaders      like Microsoft, Google, and Apple, report that the Executive      Order could directly impact their employees and hinder their      ability to attract the best talent from around the world. In      addition, the policy reflected in the Executive Order is      counterproductive to our national security. We understand      that scores of American diplomats stationed across the globe      are drafting a formal ``dissent memo'' to register their      objections, stating that the order will ``not achieve its aim      of making our country safer'' and will instead result in a      ``drop in international good will towards Americans and a      threat to our economy.'' We need to develop relationships      with Muslim countries and others seeking to combat terrorism.      Unfortunately, the Order alienates many of the groups we need      to have working alongside us.       The Executive Order is both controversial and confusing.      For example, the International Rescue Committee called the      Order ``harmful and hasty'' noting ``America has the      strongest, most successful resettlement program in the      world.'' Over 4,000 academics, including 25 Nobel Laureates,      have signed a petition denouncing the Order, writing ``[t]his      measure is fatally disruptive to the lives of these      immigrants, their families, and the communities of which they      form an integral part. It is inhumane, ineffective, and un-     American.'' The Order has resulted in widespread confusion,      as hundreds of individuals have been improperly detained at      our airports, at least four federal courts have issued stays      concerning the Order, and protests have broken out at      airports and other venues nationwide. At the time this letter      was sent, 16 State Attorneys General have condemned the      Executive       In the interest of exercising proper Congressional      oversight of DHS and CBP and of holding agencies accountable,      we write to urgently request an emergency briefing this week      with you and others at DHS and the Administration concerning      the Executive Among other things, we would like to      receive the following, either at or in advance of the      briefing:       Any DHS guidance, directive, or policy regarding      interpretation and implementation of the Executive Order,      specifically is it pertains to current visa holders seeking      entry into the United States, visa applicants, lawful      permanent residents, dual citizens, and U.citizens, as      well as clarification on the status of the individuals from      the seven designated countries in the Order who are applying      for or renewing immigration benefits.

In addition, and among other things, we would like to be      briefed by you on the accuracy of President Trump's assertion      that the Executive Order can be justified because then-     president Obama had ``banned visas for refugees from Iraq for      six months'' in 2011. It is our understanding that in 2011      the Iraqi resettlement program was subject to a simple      reduction for a short time while new security measures were      added, In stark contrast, Mr.Trump's Executive Order calls      for a suspension of all refugees, not just one category, in      addition to suspending the Syrian program indefinitely.       For decades both Democratic and Republican Presidents have      supported granting safe haven to families fleeing      persecution, violence, terror, sexual slavery, and torture.      At a time of unprecedented forced migration across the world,      the need for American leadership in these areas has not      subsided.       Given the urgency, widespread confusion and dangerous      impact of the Executive Order, we would appreciate hearing      from you as quickly as possible so that we may ensure the      briefing occurs by no later than Friday, February 3.

12631,topic-id,1361,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise to place in the Record a very important story from The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. It focuses on Steve Mnuchin, President Trump's nominee to be Treasury Secretary, and it raises issues of deep concern.              [From the Columbus Dispatch, 29, 2017] Trump Treasury Pick Mnuchin Misled Senate on Foreclosures, Ohio Cases                                   Show                 (By Alan Johnson and Jill Riepenhoff)       President Donald Trump's nominee for U.treasury      secretary was untruthful with the Senate during the      confirmation process, documents uncovered by The Dispatch      show.       Steve Mnuchin, former chairman and chief executive officer      of OneWest Bank, known for its aggressive foreclosure      practices, flatly denied in testimony before the Senate      Finance Committee that OneWest used ``robo-signing'' on      mortgage documents.       But records show the bank utilized the questionable      practice in       ``The guy is just lying. There's no other way to say it,''      said Bill Faith, executive director of the Coalition on      Homelessness and Housing in       The revelation comes with the committee's vote on whether      to confirm Mnuchin's nomination, currently scheduled for      Monday night.       Barney Keller of Jamestown Associates, who represents      Mnuchin, was asked to comment for this story but did not      respond before deadline. Jamestown Associates is a Washington      political consulting and advertising firm that represented      Trump in his campaign.       ``Robo-signing'' is the informal term for when a mortgage      company employee signs hundreds of foreclosures, swearing      they have scrutinized the documents as required by law when      in fact they have not.       ``OneWest Bank did not `robo-sign' documents,'' Mnuchin      wrote in response to questions from individual senators,      ``and as the only bank to successfully complete the      Independent Foreclosure Review required by federal banking      regulators to investigate allegations of `robo-signing,' I am      proud of our institution's extremely low error rate.''       But a Dispatch analysis of nearly four dozen foreclosure      cases filed by OneWest in Franklin County in 2010 alone shows      that the company frequently used robo-signers. The vast      majority of the Columbus-area cases were signed by 11      different people in Travis County, Those employees      called themselves vice presidents, assistant vice presidents,      managers and assistant secretaries. In three local cases, a      judge dismissed OneWest foreclosure proceedings specifically      based on inaccurate robo-signings.       The Dispatch found more than 1,900 OneWest foreclosures in      the state's six largest counties from 2009 to 2015.       Carla Duncan, a social worker from Cleveland Heights, was      snared by OneWest's robo-signing machinery.       On her way out of town for a short trip in 2010, Duncan      stopped by her home to get her mail and found a note from a      field inspector for her mortgage company saying that her      house was vacant and was going to be boarded up.       ``It wasn't vacant. I was living there,'' Duncan said.      ``There were curtains on the windows. The radio was playing      and the dog was there.''       What Duncan didn't know at the time was that OneWest had      begun foreclosure proceedings on her three-bedroom home even      though she was up-to-date on her payments. OneWest refused to      accept a loan modification approved by a previous lender that      had been purchased by OneWest, and it wanted to substantially      increase Duncan's interest rate and monthly payment and add      late fees. The company also put a lock box on a separate      rental property she owned in       After hiring former Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann, waging      a five-year court battle and filing personal bankruptcy,      Duncan was finally able to get the foreclosures dismissed and      keep her home and rental property. She said the experience      was devastating.       ``It's almost like being raped, like being emotionally      violated,'' Duncan said. ``It got to the point that I was      afraid to open my own door.''       Court records show that Duncan's mortgage was robo-signed      by Erica Johnson-Seck, vice president of OneWest's department      of bankruptcy and foreclosures. From her office in Austin,      Texas, Johnson-Seck robo-signed an average of 750 foreclosure      documents a week, according to a sworn deposition she gave in      a Florida case in July 2009.       Under oath, Johnson-Seck acknowledged that she did not read      the documents she was signing, taking only about 30 seconds      to sign her name. To speed up the process, Johnson-Seck said      she shortened her first name on her signature to just an      ``E.'' She said in the deposition that OneWest's practice was      to review just 10 percent of the foreclosure documents for      accuracy.       Dann, who now specializes in representing clients who have      problems with banks and other lenders after he was forced to      resign as attorney general nearly 10 years ago, said      Mnuchin's businesses were a ``major offender'' in problem      mortgages. Dann said Mnuchin's firms were known for dual      tracking (pursuing foreclosures simultaneously as they      allegedly worked with homeowners), fabricating documents and      other tactics ``that caused unbelievable devastation in      people's lives.''       In 2010, federal laws were changed, enabling borrowers      victimized by lenders to sue them. Dann said he worries that      Mnuchin, as treasury secretary, would quietly work to repeal      reforms, collectively known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street      Reform and Consumer Protection       That appears to be the case.       ``It has been over six years since the passage of Dodd-     Frank and it seems like an appropriate time to review all of      the regulations from Dodd-Frank to understand their impact on      the market, investors, small businesses and economic      growth,'' Mnuchin said in a written answer to the       U.Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, grilled Mnuchin at his      recent hearing and in follow-up written questions.       ``Mnuchin profited off of kicking people out of their homes      and then gave false testimony about his bank's abusive      practices,'' Brown told The ``He cannot be trusted      to make decisions about policies as personal to working      Ohioans as their taxes and retirement.''       Faith, the homelessness coalition director, said      foreclosure practices by Mnuchin's companies and others like      them ``created havoc.''       ``People were bamboozled into signing these mortgages,''      Faith said. ``We watched this train wreck happen. It's been      devastating, not only to the people who got caught in this      kind of scheme, but also to people who happened to live in      the neighborhood . . . . It's scary that he's going to be      treasury secretary.''       The Dispatch analysis showed thousands of Ohio homeowners--     including 245 in Franklin County--found themselves in      OneWest's crosshairs when they defaulted on their loans, the      majority of them with high interest rates. Many mortgages had      terms that housing and financial experts view as predatory:      prepayment penalties, interest-only loans and no-money-down      loans.       In addition to OneWest, which was born in 2009 from the      collapse of subprime mortgage giant IndyMac, Mnuchin's      banking group also acquired Financial Freedom, a subsidiary      of Lehman Brothers that went bankrupt because of its toxic      mortgage portfolio. The firm specialized in loans to senior      citizens cashing in on their homes' equity.       Mnuchin was labeled by critics at the time as the      ``Foreclosure King.''       Of the nearly four dozen foreclosure cases filed by OneWest      in Franklin County in 2010 that were analyzed by The      Dispatch, a quarter were filed within three years of the      homeowner taking out the loan, typically a red flag that      there was a problem with the mortgage terms and/or vetting      the borrowers.       Thirteen of the borrowers had double-digit interest rates,      ranging from 10 percent to 17.31 percent, largely because of      adjustable-rate mortgage terms.       In the cases in which the houses were sold at an auction,      two-thirds ended up in the hands of the federal government,      which had backed those loans. Collectively, more than $4      million was due on those loans.       Only seven borrowers were able to get a loan modification,      even though former President Barack Obama's administration      had been pushing since 2009 for lenders to help Americans      keep their homes by lowering interest rates and, in some      cases, the principal balance.       Mnuchin does have supporters, including the American      Bankers Association, which sent a letter to the Senate      committee saying Mnuchin's ``public statements as well as his      career in finance bring us optimism with regard to the      outlook for public policies focused on growth and      prosperity.''       Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, released      a statement supporting Mnuchin's nomination, in part because      of his stated intention to roll back some of the Dodd-Frank      legislation: ``Mr.Mnuchin has made it clear that reforming      the Dodd-Frank Act will be his `number one priority on the      regulatory side' once he becomes secretary of the treasury.''

12632,topic-id,675,"According to The Columbus Dispatch, Mnuchin was untruthful to the Senate Finance Committee regarding his company's aggressive role in hastening thousands of home foreclosures during the 2000 financial crisis and what followed, and his misdeeds deeply impacted places like  Mr.Mnuchin was the chief executive officer of OneWest Bank, which engaged in so-called robo-signing of mortgage documents. That means you really don't--you treat people like objects; you really don't go into the details of every case.  The Columbus Dispatch said its analysis of dozens of foreclosure cases in Ohio, and subsequent action, prove otherwise.  The dastardly practice of robo-signing, prevalent throughout the mortgage industry in the aftermath of that terrible financial crisis, had certain leaders, of which Mr.Mnuchin was at the top of the heap; and their employees signed foreclosure documents en masse without properly reviewing them and forcing unjust foreclosures.[[Page H756]]  The Columbus Dispatch found more than 1,900 such cases in Ohio alone. Individual cases revealed OneWest Bank declared properties vacant, even though someone was living in them. OneWest Bank, time and again, refused to abide by agreed-upon loan modifications.  Is that the kind of person that we really want in charge of the U.Treasury Department?  Nominee Mnuchin comes with a Goldman Sachs pedigree. Well, wouldn't we know that? He was nicknamed the ``foreclosure king'' after buying up IndyMac, a subprime lender that evicted about 36,000 people during the financial crisis.  Sadly, Mr.Speaker, while President-elect Trump promised to drain the swamp, his nominee for Treasury Secretary proves he is not doing that at all. He is enlarging the swamp.  The Columbus Dispatch found more than 1,900, I repeat, OneWest Bank foreclosures in our State's six largest counties from 2009 to 2015.  In addition, Mr.Mnuchin profited personally off of kicking people out of their homes. Does such a person actually deserve confirmation as Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America?  Wake up, Wake up. Pay attention to what is happening here in Washington, D.This city belongs to you. This Capitol belongs to you.  Mr.Speaker, I would also like to place in the Record a release I sent out over the weekend relating to President Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.665, the Airport Perimeter and Access Control Security Act, sponsored by my good friend and colleague, Congressman  Over the course of the last year, we have seen a disturbing number of attacks against airports and aircrafts overseas and around the world. And in every instance, the integrity of the airport security infrastructure and the insider threat have been of serious concern.  It is critical that we scrutinize the security effectiveness of our Nation's airports and ensure that the public can have confidence that their travels will be safe and secure during the high-threat environment.  This important piece of legislation requires that the TSA's comprehensive risk assessment of perimeter and access control security is more regularly updated and that TSA conducts a sector-wide assessment of airport access control vulnerabilities and mitigation efforts, something TSA has not done across the board since 2012, despite multiple security breaches at airports across the country.  We cannot solely focus on the effectiveness of our passenger screening checkpoints, while allowing lapses in security around the airport perimeter and within the sterile area of airport. A dead bolt on a front door does no good if the back door is left wide open.  As partners on the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee, Congressman Keating and I have seen firsthand disturbing vulnerabilities at airports across the United I commend his efforts to help enhance security for the American people.

Last year, at my request, the Government Accountability Office released an independent report of all airports within the Transportation Security Administration's presence.  While TSA has made some progress in assessing risks at airport perimeters and access control security points, the GAO report revealed that the agency had not taken emerging threats or the unique makeup and design of individual airports into consideration.  More and more, we have seen that terrorists are targeting the soft areas in our airport perimeters and within the airport itself. Terrorists are looking for these soft targets. We have seen it in We have seen these tragedies in We have seen it in And, sadly, we have seen it here at home in Fort  Updating the risk assessment of airport secured with information that reflects the current threat ensures that TSA bases its decision on the latest information, enabling it to focus limited resources to the highest priority risks to airport security.  The TSA's efforts to access, really, our entire airport security around the country, has been, frankly, inadequate. The numbers are startling. From 2009 to 2015, TSA conducted comprehensive risk assessments at only 81 of the 437 commercial airports nationwide--or 19 percent. Some years, this really represented only 3 percent of the airports that were assessed at all.  The Airport Perimeter and Access Control Security Act will make law the recommendations from the independent report and increase safety at airports nationwide. Further, this bill incorporates the input of major airport operators--whose concerns for lack of individualized security strategy we heard from firsthand.  Last year, the Associated Press revealed that there had been at least 268 perimeter security breaches at 31 major U.airports. From 2004 to 2015, their investigation found that intruders breached airport fences, on average, every 13 days.  This figure includes a fatal incident, a tragic incident that I investigated before I came to Congress as a district attorney when Delvonte Tisdale, a teenager from North Carolina, snuck onto the tarmac at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport and stowed away undetected in a wheel well of a commercial 737 on a flight to  The figures I mentioned really don't account for the many unreported instances of perimeter breaches, including things like trespassers or people that scale the fences around the perimeter.

Mr.Speaker, I want to thank you for allowing me to discuss the Fair RATES Act, H.587, and for bringing it to the floor today for a vote. I also want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr.Upton, his staff, and, of course, during his tenure as chairman of the full committee, his staff, along with the staff of Mr.Pallone and the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittees.

As the chairman alluded to, New England holds an energy capacity auction to ensure that we have sufficient energy supply to meet consumer demand.  Mr.Speaker, 3 years ago, during an auction where there was a shortfall, those capacity payments tripled, skyrocketing from about $1 billion to $3 billion. That rate increase hasn't even reached our constituents yet, but this June, a significant portion of their bills will triple due to that auction.  When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reviewed that rate increase, they were down to four Commissioners, and they deadlocked 2-2. One Democratic Commissioner and one Republican Commissioner raised concerns about whether those rates were just and reasonable for consumers. Because of the deadlock, those rates took effect by operation of law without any action from With no official decision from the agency, there was no[[Page H569]]decision to appeal, leaving my constituents completely voiceless.  Mr.Speaker, in 2 weeks, our region will hold that same annual auction, once again determining rates that will be passed along to families and businesses in my district 3 years down the road. Once again, FERC is understaffed, without a full complement of Commissioners to consider the new rate filings.  Although the situation may sound complex and unique to New England, there is not a corner of this country that is immune from the unpredictability of American energy markets and the resulting burden our consumers and businesses are forced to bear as a result.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.460, the Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act, a bill that earned unanimous support in the last  Consumers expect to be able to pick up the telephone and be connected with businesses, friends, and loved ones across the country. In today's connected world, that should not be a tall request. Unfortunately, for many constituents across the country, particularly in rural areas, call quality and reliability are just not up to par compared to their urban counterparts.  This is due, partly, because of the call routing process where long distance and wireless providers use so-called least cost routers. These inexpensive third-party intermediate providers try to complete calls for the lowest possible price, without taking measures to ensure the call actually goes through.  I am sure that most of us have experienced the annoyance of at least one failed or dropped call. You make a call to someone and it rings over and over again but no one, not even the voicemail, picks up. Or, maybe you place a call, only to hear a prerecorded message telling you that the number you dialed is not in service, even though you know you have the right number. Even in cases where you are able to connect, the sound might be distorted or delayed.  For many constituents, this is more than just an annoyance. These missed connections have significant consequences.  Folks rely on the networks for more than just staying in touch with loved ones. Our constituents count on reliable networks to run their businesses and receive messages from our community institutions. A failed call can mean a lost sale for a small rural business. Another failed call might mean that a message from your child's school or your medical provider goes undelivered. These are real and harmful impacts. This bill will address this situation through commonsense improvements.  For the most part, consumers are unaware of these intermediate providers, which has allowed them to be held unaccountable. H.460 takes measured steps to bring these intermediate providers out from the shadows and into the light so that we can hold them accountable to the consuming public.  First, the bill requires intermediate providers to register with the FCC, and it prohibits carriers from using any nonregistered provider. The bill also requires the FCC to establish a database and publish the list of registered providers on its Web site. Finally, the bill requires the FCC to establish quality standards for these intermediate providers, which will raise the bar for all of the providers who provide call routing services.  These straightforward measures are another step in our effort, on a bipartisan basis, to mitigate call completion and quality issues for the consuming public. This bill will build upon the work the FCC has done in recent years.  Our constituents in rural areas face significant challenges compared to their urban counterparts, but subpar call quality should not be one of them. By raising the bar, which this bill does, we will hold the bad actors to higher standards and allow consumers to benefit from the improved integrity of our networks.

From our celebrated ski slopes to our stunning and world-renowned fall foliage, Vermont draws travelers from near and far, from nearby States and from Canada, our neighbor to the north. What many don't realize is that Vermont has also become home to refugees and asylum seekers from Iraq, Syria, Bosnia, Sudan, and elsewhere. These men, women and children enrich our communities and inspire us all.  One Vermont community, Rutland, last year announced that it would welcome refugees fleeing the catastrophic civil war in The town was preparing to welcome 100 refugees. Nine arrived. When President Trump issued his appalling and disastrous executive order banning admission to refugees from Syria and six other nations, the remaining 91 individuals were prevented from coming to  I have heard from hundreds of Vermonters outraged by President Trump's Executive actions to close our borders to those seeking refuge. Also deeply concerning is the President's clear intent on targeting Muslim refugees. The freedom of religion, enshrined in the First Amendment of our Constitution and defended through the ages by generations of Americans, should not be squandered to promote an unfounded fear.  The voices raised in opposition to these executive orders cross the spectrum. I want to include in the Record some of those voices: students at Rutland High School, some of whom have formed the New Neighbors Club, to help welcome refugee students who will attend Rutland City Public  Emma writes: ``I am a 9th grader from Rutland High We should continue to support immigration in Vermont and the United These people deserve a good life and don't deserve what they have to go through.''  Carolyn writes: ``I'm from Rutland, Vermont, and I believe that refugee resettlement is an important issue. We have the opportunity to make a change in these people's lives and make new relationships and bonds in our lives. They need a support system so why can't that be us?''  Lea writes: ``This immigration ban is a big problem to me. I don't like that our country is stopping people from coming to our country. I know many people are afraid of what could happen to us. But we are all human and they are humans looking for safety.''  Lily writes, ``Everyone deserves the same amount of respect and understanding that we afford to anyone. The refugees obviously need our help and we are completely capable of building a community that is ready and willing to accept the refugees.''  Jessica writes: ``I can understand these fears, but they also clearly come from an inhumane and misinformed point of view. Without immigration in the past, no one would be here, and it is simply un-American to deny freedom from persecution to refugees and other immigrants.''  Emma writes: ``With all of the recent stigma regarding the Refugee Resettlement Plan, Rutland's program has recently gone static. At Rutland High School, we have a club that helps raise money and eventually welcome the refugees. Please make all the movement possible to make these people feel welcome in our state. We don't want to be stuck on the wrong side of history.''  Victoria writes: ``I feel that it is incredibly important for us to help refugees who are in desperate need of a second chance at life. As a global superpower of a country, it seems absurd to me that we are accepting so few refugees to our communities, as we could be helping with the global refugee crisis a whole lot more by actually trying to mitigate it.''  Ian writes: ``The refugees should come to Rutland because we are devoted to helping integrate them into our community. Several of the students here are devoting every Friday to getting together and coming up with great ideas on how we can incorporate them.''  Kjersti writes: ``As a citizen in the United States, I believe the diversity is what makes this country beautiful, and the fact that someone is exempt from the freedom and is turned away because of their diversity is not what this country stands for.''  Noah writes: ``I believe we should let people immigrate to Vermont because the people in these countries are living in terrible living conditions. Everyone in this world is equal so there's no reason not to let them in. They just want a chance at a safe life.''  Ashleah writes: ``We should continue to support immigration for the Syrian refugees into our community. This is such a great opportunity for Rutland to experience more diversity and more culture. Our small city would benefit greatly from allowing refugees to come and live with us.''  Kelsey writes: ``People who are safe and living comfortably should do their best to help those that need it. I feel by turning them away and denying them help we are being inhuman and cruel.''  Caitlin writes: ``I believe immigration should be accepted in all areas of this country. I strongly support the idea of people wanting to make a better life for themselves. I choose to take a stand against anti-immigration for I believe it is essential to make America better.''  Greta writes: ``These Syrians are people who have gone through atrocities and deserve our help. They will also promote understanding and diversity in our community amidst this political climate of fear mongering. Welcoming Syrian refugees will only be beneficial for Rutland and United States, and is upholding the value of America and human rights.''[[Page S1775]]  And Elizabeth writes: ``I am disappointed with how our current administration is portraying our nation to the rest of the world. I think the people of the United States are stronger, more loving, and kinder people than what is being shown, and I think we need to take individual action in order to show this.''

A majority of Americans believe abortion is wrong, and they do not wish to see their tax dollars pay for this gruesome procedure that ends the life of another human being. This legislation permanently puts into law a longstanding policy that has been renewed by Congress every year. It will reassure Americans that the hard-earned money they pay to the government will never be used to fund abortions.  This is necessary because the Affordable Care Act, a law that has been unaffordable for so many Americans, actually paid subsidies for healthcare plans that include abortion. This is unacceptable. A child in a mother's womb is a blessing. Americans expect their tax dollars will never be used to pay to end the life of an innocent child.

12726,topic-id,952,"Mr.President, I appreciate the remarks, as well as the working together with the Senator from Montana as we tried to make certain that a program that is so valuable to veterans across the country--in my case particularly, veterans who live in rural America, in Kansas--to make certain that veterans can attain the care they have earned and the care they deserve.  We had a scandal at the VA in which many tragic things happened, and Congress came together at that time and passed the Choice What that law basically has given our veterans is, if they live more than 40 miles from a VA facility--in other words, if they live a long distance from access to care--they can, at their choice, have that care at home: hometown hospital, hometown physician, pharmacy, physical therapy. They can see a provider in their hometown.  In so many instances in Kansas--in fact, I have mentioned this before on the Senate floor. The House district I represented as a Congressman is larger than the State of Illinois, and there is no VA hospital in that congressional district. So veterans not having to travel 2, 3, 4, 5 hours to Denver or to Wichita or to Amarillo is of such value to our veterans, particularly those who have a disability or are aging. What we did in the passage of Choice was so useful to so many veterans.  The other part of that was that if you couldn't get the care you needed within 30 days at the VA, you could then attain your care at home. Again, with the backlog that was occurring at the VA, the lack of providers, this became important to another set of veterans who, because of their health condition, couldn't afford to wait that long to see a physician, to have surgery.  This is important legislation. If you are somebody who cares about veterans, you need to be in favor of this Choice If you are someone who cares about particularly rural or veterans who need timely care, you especially ought to be supportive of  The challenge we have is that the Choice Act is expiring. It expires August 7, and it needs to be extended. There are dollars available in the program. Mandatory spending is available to pay for the services to a later date.  As the Senator from Montana indicated, there are a number of provisions that haven't worked very well in Choice because of the bureaucratic nature of the program, the way the program has been established. One of those that are most important is that you have veterans on one side who need the care and choose Choice, but you also need a willing provider. The local hospital, the local physician needs to be willing to provide that care. I have never known a provider who was not honored to provide care to a veteran, but the challenge in many instances becomes whether that provider, that doctor or hospital gets reimbursed, gets paid.  This legislation has a number of reforms, but in my view, one of the most critical and most important is to make the VA the payer, to make the VA be the entity that writes out the check to pay the hospital bill, to pay the physician for the services provided.  So this is another reform that improves really on both sides. It eliminates some of the bureaucracy that a veteran goes through and the number of times a veteran may receive a notice that he or she owes money that should be paid by the Choice Program, and it also encourages--by paying them--the physician or the hospital to provide the service. These are important reforms, important changes in the Choice Act that are worthy of our support.  What is transpiring here are a couple of reforms to the Choice Program and its extension to a later date, until the money expires, so the Choice Program can continue, and Congress can now take that time to determine what we want to do with the Choice Program into the future after that point in time. I appreciate the way in which this legislation has worked.  Often I get asked whether there is any hope that Congress can work together, that Republicans and Democrats can solve problems. This is an example of where that is taking place today, by the care and concern we all have for our veterans and the good will that exists by those who serve in Congress to make sure that good things happen for our military men and women who are now veterans.  I regret that the chairman of the Veterans' Committee, the Senator from Georgia, Mr.Isakson, is unable to be with us, but, as the Senator from Montana indicated, he is fully supportive of this legislation. In fact, he is an original sponsor of the legislation.  I add my voice and ask my colleagues to agree to the unanimous consent resolution, that this legislation be passed. It will be another step in solving problems and caring for those who served our  Yesterday, I was at the Arlington National Cemetery--a reminder of the debt we owe to so many people.

We want to make sure that good things continue to happen. We want to improve the quality of service, get the problems out of the Choice Program, and make sure those who are so deserving of quality care actually receive it.

12663,topic-id,2638,"Mr.President, President Trump said in his inaugural address that we have defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own. I think he was right. Today, the question is, Will we add another commitment to defend yet another foreign country?  For decades, NATO has been an organization in which the United States disproportionately spends our blood and our treasure. The other NATO countries have largely hitched a ride on a U.train that subsidizes their defenses and allows them to direct their revenues to their own domestic concerns. In short, Uncle Sam is the Uncle Patsy for the rest of the world.  The question today is, Will adding to NATO another country with fewer than 2,000 soldiers be in our self-interest?  It has fewer than 2,000 soldiers and is a small country in a distant part of the world. Will they make you sleep safer at night? The answer is an emphatic no.  There is no national security interest that an alliance with Montenegro will advance. If we invite Montenegro into NATO, it will be a one-way street, with the United States committing to defending yet another country and with you, the taxpayer, being stuck with the bill.  Even the advocates of Montenegro's joining NATO admit as much. The Senate hearing on admitting Montenegro to NATO was really just a punching session about Not one word was said about allowing Montenegro into NATO or how it would advance our own national security. We were going to send a message to Even the citizens of Montenegro are divided on this. About half of them want to be in NATO, and the other half does not want to be in  But it is not really about them; it is about us. Is admitting Montenegro to NATO good for us? Our national security is our national security. Is Montenegro going to defend the United States? Are they of any importance to our national security or, perhaps, will they entangle us in local, historic, regional conflicts in the area?  We must ask: Is Montenegro an asset to the defense of the United States? That is the question at hand.  The answer is a simple one. Admitting Montenegro to NATO will do nothing to advance our national security, and it will do everything to simply add another small country to NATO's welfare wagon.  Advocates for expanding NATO believe that, unless the whole world joins NATO, Russia will conquer the world, but the truth is more nuanced. During the Cold War, the myth of Russian might was endlessly circulated here at home, and the effect was the production of endless munitions and ever-expanding debt. You are still paying the tab for that. The Cold War ended, and the Soviet Union failed, not because our military might overcame them but because our economic system outlasted them. They were defeated. Capitalism defeated socialism.  If there is one message that Americans should get, it is that capitalism is stronger than socialism. We should not flirt with political leaders in our country who promote what caused the Soviet Union to fail.  Now we are told we must fear Russia again--fear the Russian bear. Yet, if you look closely, you will see that Russian aggression around the world and particularly around the former Soviet satellites is an attempt to mask a weak economy that runs the same risk of overextension that caused the Soviet Empire to collapse. Russia is weak. Russia is weak because of corruption, oligarchy, and human rights abuses. If Russia continues on this path, it may well encounter the same cataclysm that brought down the Soviet  Without question, Russia is an adversary, a country that ignores international norms, does not respect the territorial integrity of its neighbors. Yet someone must ask: Is it in our national interest to insist that countries of the former Soviet Union be in NATO?  The debate today is not just about The same cheerleaders for Montenegro's being in NATO want Ukraine in NATO and want Georgia in This is about NATO's expansion in general, and this is a chance to have a real debate.  If both Ukraine and Georgia were in NATO today, we would be involved in a world war with Shouldn't someone speak up? Shouldn't we have some sort of national debate before we commit our sons and daughters to war in a faraway land?  One thing is for certain: Russia will always care more about those lands than we will. Does that make Russian aggression right? Absolutely not.  Our decision--the decision at hand--is: Are we willing to send our sons and daughters to fight in border disputes over Montenegro? Most Americans couldn't find Montenegro on the map. Are you willing to send your kids there to fight?  That is what this is about, and this is sluffed over. They are going to forbid amendments. I forced this debate. Nobody wanted to have this debate. They want to rubberstamp it. They want no debates, and they want to send your kids to war with no debate. Today, they will pass this over my objections, but they will allow no amendments. When I finish this speech, I will ask for an amendment, and it will be denied because they do not want to debate whether your sons and daughters go to war. I find that appalling. I am ashamed of a Senate that will not have a debate and will not have a vote.  From the very beginning, our Republic was founded on a deep suspicion of entangling alliances. Our Founders wanted to do everything possible to avoid the endless, chronic wars in In Europe, for centuries, Kings from one nation fought their brothers and their cousins in other nations. This meaningless fratricide continued even into the 20th century.  The Founding Fathers were emphatic in their desire to avoid endless war. Washington wrote that our true policy was to steer clear of a permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world. Jefferson echoed this when he famously wrote of peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations and of entangling alliances with none.  Even in modern times, such military heroes as President Eisenhower opposed intervention in Hungary, even when the naked aggression of the Soviets was appalling. Eisenhower likely may have had no real opportunity, though, because the Soviet Union had rolled in with 200,000 troops and 4,000 tanks.  At least part of the decision not to go into Hungary in the fifties was not for a lack of sympathy for freedom, not for[[Page S1990]]a lack of sympathy for self-determination of a country. It was the real politic decision of a nuclear confrontation with a nuclear  Fast-forward to today. For 16 years, we have been at war in the Middle East--16 years. If I had been here, I would have voted for going after the people who had attacked us on 9/11. Our justified response, though, has drug on and on. There are people who are fighting in the war who were not born on 9/11. The Congress voted after 9/11 to go to war. It voted to go after the people who planned and plotted the attacks on the World Trade That vote from 15 years ago is used to justify all war that is everywhere on the planet.  There has been no meaningful debate on the wars we are currently involved in in the Middle We currently fight illegally and unconstitutionally in the Middle East because your representatives are afraid to have a public debate. They will stifle debate at all costs, and they will broker no amendments. They will allow no amendments to occur.  Our unrestricted, unvoted-upon involvement in war everywhere informed my opposition to expand Everyone likes to talk about NATO's article 5 obligation to come to the defense of any NATO allies that are attacked. That is in the treaty. If Montenegro is attacked, we will have to respond, but my concern is that many in Congress believe that article 5, in saying that we have to defend Montenegro, farms out to an international body this power to declare war, and they do not think they have to vote again.  You don't believe me?  They have not voted for 15 years for war, and we are still at war. We continue to go to new countries for war with no vote. Do you think that Montenegro will not be attacked and that there will not be a war without a vote? This is their history. Their history is one of not obeying the David Fromkin puts it this way: ``If it is now agreed by treaty that an attack on a . . . NATO ally is deemed an attack on the United States, then it can be argued that the President is empowered without congressional authorization to send us to war.''  Don't believe me? We have been at war for 15 years. We have been at war with dozens of new tribes, dozens of new countries, with no votes on war.  The most important vote a legislator will ever take is whether to go to war. Yet today we will vote for an automatic war if somebody invades And mark my words--they won't obey the They will say: We voted to put them in Article 5 says we have to defend them.  That is not the law of the land, and we should have to vote in But nobody obeys the law. So if you are worried about whether your kids will be sent to the Balkans or whether your kids will be sent to Ukraine or Georgia, call your representative and tell them:  This is the crux of the debate. Congress has abdicated its role in declaring war. For 16 years, we have been at war in the Middle East with dozens of different tribes and dozens of countries and yet no vote. People say: Well, we should fight Well, let's vote on it. Let's declare war or not. But you can't tell me that ISIS has anything to do with 9/11. They don't. Many of their fighters weren't even born then.  The authorization for war in Iraq was specific to a specific enemy in a specific place. So was the authorization after 9/11. The authorization for war in Afghanistan was specific. It says: necessary and appropriate force against those who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11 attacks. It was actually put in the authorization for force that it was about 9/11. None of what is going on is about 9/11 anymore. They are not the same people. Some of the people we are fighting now didn't like those people.  There is a whole confusing set of religious wars that have been going on for 1,000 years in the Middle Yet your representatives will say: Send me your son, send me your daughter, but we don't have time to vote on whether it should be a declared war.  This vote is now used to justify a war around the globe, a vote from 9/11--from 15 years ago. It is a lie, and it is a disservice to our young men and women to have them fight under false pretenses where the Senators don't seem to have time to have a debate. No active war anywhere around the globe that the United States is involved with has been authorized by  We dropped more bombs the other day in We sent a man right into Raise your hand if you know what the hell is going on in Yemen and who is fighting whom and who is our enemy. The one we killed the other day was al-Qaida--probably a bad guy. He was actually fighting against the Houthis, whom we are also fighting against.  Who are the good guys? Shouldn't we have a debate? Shouldn't we decide whether we are going to war in Yemen? Should we be giving the Saudis bombs? They bombed a funeral procession. They killed 150 civilians and 500 people. We just let it go on. We keep giving them weapons. I have tried to stop selling bombs to the Saudi Arabians, but the majority up here says: Keep giving them to them. Keep giving them the weapons, and let them indiscriminately kill whoever the hell they want.  So NATO--should we expand it? Perhaps what we should do is make it clear that the NATO treaty is not a blind, open-ended promise to go to war anywhere, anytime.  Before we go to final passage, I will offer one amendment. This amendment will be blocked because they do not want debate and because they will be embarrassed if they have to vote against this amendment. But realize what this amendment asks. My amendment states that nothing in the NATO treaty--particularly the article 5 promise to come to the rescue of anyone attacked--none of this can happen without an official vote to declare war. So what is my amendment stating? The Constitution--article I, section 8--says we don't go to war without a vote and a debate. Do you know what they will do to get around it? I think we can assume that they are against the Constitution because they are not going to allow the amendment. How long would it take? It takes 15 minutes to vote around here. I am about done speaking. We could have one 15-minute vote on an amendment. I would grant back the time if we would have a vote, but they don't want to debate it because they are embarrassed that they are sending your sons and daughters to war without ever debating or voting on it.  This, to me, is a tragedy. It is sad to me. It makes me ashamed of the body that we will do this. Probably what is worse is then they clamor to the floor, their mouths agape, ajar, calling other people traitors, acting as if I care less about your sons and daughters because I want to have a debate on war before we go to war, preventing an amendment from happening and then having the gall to come to the floor and accuse their philosophic opponents of being traitors and being allies with the  Is this what we have come to? Is this where we are as America, that you can't take a principled stand against war; that you can't stand up on principle and say: Are we really going to go to war over Montenegro, over Ukraine? Are we really going to go to war over Georgia? And then you are accused of not being patriotic to your country.  I care as much as anybody about our soldiers. When I talk to our young men and women who serve, do you know what they tell me? They want someone to stand up and have a debate. They will do what they are told. Our soldiers are brave, and they will go where they are told, and they will obey orders. But the people here who are these mouthpieces for war, who think every soldier wants to go to war, I suggest they go out and meet the soldiers and ask them whether they want the civilian Senators to debate and have a formal declaration of war.

Now, some will say: Oh, well, we would never go to war. It might not be so bad, but it would be difficult.  Do you know when we have gone to war? We have actually gone unanimously when we have done it the right way. When we were attacked on 9/11 and they came to Congress, do you know what the vote was? We are not about letting people attack us as a country, and I would have voted for that.  When we were attacked in Pearl Harbor, what did FDR do? The thing that great leaders would do--and I am not a huge fan always of FDR, but he did the right thing. He came to Congress the next day. I think it was on December 8 that they voted unanimously to go to war. That is the way it was done once upon a time.  When you are attacked, people do rally to the country and they rally to the flag, but we shouldn't have an automatic stamp that says: We are going to war anywhere without any restraint, without any control or separation of power.

The most recent issue to raise questions is President Trump's Muslim ban executive order. At face value, this action looks like yet another harmful step in his divisive agenda. Trump's hateful scapegoating of refugees will make us less safe, and it goes against our country's moral fiber and small ``d'' democratic values. It is hard to believe that these seven countries were targeted based on a serious threat that was posed by their citizens who were traveling to the United  The people responsible for some of the most egregious attacks on American soil in recent decades, including 9/11, the Times Square bombing, the Boston Marathon bombing, the Pulse nightclub shooting, and others did not come from these seven countries. In fact, refugees from these countries already face a lengthy and rigorous vetting process led by our security intelligence agencies. This 20-step process involves multiple background checks, interviews, and screenings, and it frequently takes between 18 and 24 months for approval.  However, these seven countries do have at least one thing in common. According to Bloomberg News, The Trump Organization does not have business or has not pursued business deals in any of them. President Trump does, on the other hand, have business ties to other countries in the region that were excluded from the ban. His FEC filings indicate The Trump Organization has development projects in Saudi Arabia and business projects possibly related to These countries were excluded from the executive order despite their being home to many of the terrorists who carried out 9/11. In Turkey, President Trump has a licensing deal for two luxury towers to use his name--a deal he received up to $5 million for just last year. He also has licensing agreements with businesses in other countries in the region.  I am not saying that we should ban people from these countries. I firmly oppose any ban that is based on nationality or religion, but it is unacceptable that business interests have played potentially a role in such a destructive policy that also makes our country less safe in the long run. This move will likely damage relationships with our Muslim allies who are fighting ISIS militants, and be used as a tool by the Islamic State to increase their recruitment and radicalization efforts.  Of course, my friends in the majority and in the White House claim that the seven countries under this order were similarly targeted by our previous administration. In reality, President Trump's discriminatory ban is drastically different than President Obama's specific changes to the State Department Visa Waiver Program, in which the changes focused on expedited visa privileges for dual nationals and did not target all citizens from specific countries; but I will bet you didn't hear Sean Spicer make that distinction. Instead, the administration is busy downplaying the number of people who were impacted by this decision and is claiming that only 109 people were affected--aka alternative facts. At least 700 people were denied boarding after the order was issued, and 90,000 people in these countries already have visas but will not be able to travel to the United  It is time for the President to stop defending his divisive and unconstitutional executive order and start being transparent about his business interests. Every President who has been elected in the modern era has released his tax records to ensure the American people that his actions will not be impacted by financial holdings. After promising throughout the campaign to release his tax returns, President Trump's advisers recently announced that he will indefinitely hide this information from the public. These holdings potentially put President Trump in direct violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution on day one.  The safeguard is designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence over policy decisions by not allowing Federal officials to take money from a foreign entity without there being congressional approval; but we have seen report after report of foreign leaders and diplomats choosing to stay at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., in order to gain favor with the administration. They stand to profit from foreign governments, including a big paycheck from a Chinese bank, which is a large tenant at the Trump These are just tip-of-the-iceberg examples of direct conflicts in both domestic and foreign policy under this  Mr.President, it is time for you to fix this. One, divest your business holdings immediately to remove any suggestion of there being a conflict in your decisionmaking. Two, show us your tax returns so that your business and financial interests are transparent to the American people. Three, get rid[[Page H884]]of your unconstitutional executive order, which will make us less safe and only serve to embolden our enemies.  Short of that, we will have to take other actions, including legislative directives, resolutions of disapproval, even exploring the power of impeachment.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr.Speaker, I introduced H.689, the Bolts Ditch Access and Use Act, at the request of our local community in my district, Minturn, In Eagle County, Minturn really needs this legislation because it improves[[Page H985]]public land and water management in my district.  The bill has bipartisan support. I thank Mr.Tipton and Mr.Lamborn for collaborating with me on this bill here in the I am thankful that Senator Gardner and Senator Bennet have partnered to pass this bill as well.  This legislation passed the House last session, but once again was held up in the I call upon the Senate, after House passage, to act expeditiously to put this matter to rest. I am very hopeful we can get it across the finish line soon.  I am grateful to the town of Minturn, to the conservation community, and to water utilities for working together for a commonsense solution that I am proud to support. This is an example of how we can truly solve any problem when everybody comes together and works together to solve it.  The need for this bill is to solve a vital local problem for the people of Minturn, Colorado, a town of about 1,000 people in Eagle The problem it fixes results from a mistake, an error, in the 1980 Wilderness Act, which inadvertently left Bolts Ditch off of the list of existing water facilities, where it should have been included.  This legislation would simply authorize the special use of the Bolts Ditch headgate and the segment of the Bolts Ditch within the Holy Cross Wilderness area, allowing Minturn to use rights that it already has, existing water rights, to fill Bolts  The residents of Minturn, including the mayor, whom I have met with, who brought this bill to me, as well as Coloradans across the central mountains, have long relied on water infrastructure like Bolts Ditch to access clean and affordable drinking water for our growing communities. This bill will ensure that the town of Minturn is able to utilize a crucial resource, and do so without compromising the sanctity of the surrounding wilderness areas.  I thank the Republican and Democratic staffs on the committee for working with us on this bill.

12680,topic-id,2230,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for the customary 30 minutes.  We will get to the content of the bills in a moment, but there is a procedural issue here that disenfranchises millions of American citizens in this process.  We are in the 115th Congress since the founding of this country. We were just sworn in last week to begin that. There are 56 new Members who just started serving last week that have never served in this body before, and there were 56 people that served in the last session who are no longer with us. What we are doing here is we are taking bills that those former Representatives worked on and new Representatives have not worked on and advancing them to the floor without going through committee, without going through the regular order.  So, for example, you have two bills, H.5 and H.79. We will talk about them in a moment. These are Committee on Financial Services bills. They should have gone to that committee, and members of that committee, Democratic and Republican, would have had the chance to amend those bills in that committee and mark it up before it comes to the floor. That is the normal process. Both parties are now constituting those committees; we are putting people on them.  I heard you, Mr.Speaker, read just before we began this debate how a number of Members were officially appointed to those committees. That is what we do in our first week or two.  Fifty-six new Members should have a say on these bills. They will get a vote on the floor on these bills, but they were completely excluded from the committee process that wrote these bills. That is wrong, Mr.Speaker, to not allow 56 new Members of this body to be the lawmakers that the people of their districts elected them to do. In fact, it disenfranchises the tens of millions of people collectively that those 56 Members represent. And I hope that, for future legislation, we can move through regular order and allow the new Members, as well as those who are returning, to be part of the lawmaking process.  With regards to these bills, we have largely seen these bills in prior sessions that people who are no longer in this body worked on.  The HALOS Act, I was proud to support last session and I am proud to support again. It addresses a potentially real problem. There is guidance from the SEC that--in our Rules Committee meeting yesterday I questioned the subcommittee chair--largely also addresses those concerns, but it is better to do it in statute and it is better to do it in the broader language that is included in the bill, which is why many Democrats--I hope a majority--support the HALOS  The United States is the leader in innovation in the global economy, and this is a small piece of that. What we are talking about here are demo days where entrepreneurs can pitch their idea. I, personally, have been able to attend a number of those, and it is a question of who can be in the room when that occurs.  Should it only be millionaires who are allowed in that room? Or can it be the next great generation of entrepreneurs? Can it be students? Can it be aspiring entrepreneurs? Can it be community members who want to learn what it means to pitch and how to do it and how ideas are spread, or maybe they are looking for a job?  It doesn't change who can invest in those startup companies. They still have to be qualified investors. By the way, I hope we have the opportunity to work with Republicans on the definition of ``qualified investor'' because I think it is unfair to restrict investment opportunities to multimillionaires. We need to allow educated and qualified investors of all levels.  Just because somebody is rich doesn't mean that they are a good investor, and just because somebody has not yet earned a lot of money doesn't mean that they can't be trusted to invest $10,000 or $50,000 of their own money.  We made progress in the original JOBS Act with the result of crowdfunded investing, but that is only a small piece--almost an insignificant piece. Private placements are the much larger piece of capital formation for venture-stage startups in our country. If there is a way we can have an alternative to the net worth test that allows individuals to, perhaps, take a qualitative test of their knowledge and, therefore, qualify as an investor, they ought to be able to do that, too.  This bill does not do any of that. That is a controversial area. It is one that it will take Democrats and Republicans working together on to help fund tomorrow's great companies and allow opportunity for all people, not just millionaires and billionaires.  What this bill does is it continues to restrict the actual investors to the millionaires. Okay? But it allows other people in the room at least. That is a start. It allows an MBA student who him- or herself wants to, perhaps, come up with their own company to hear 10 or 20 companies pitch so they can assemble their own deck; somebody who might have a great amount of value to give as a mentor who themselves is a veteran of a number of companies. Maybe they are not quite worth a couple of million dollars. Maybe they are worth only--only, right?--$500,000. Maybe they were a reasonably successful person worth $500,000, but they have a lot of knowledge to give.  Without the HALOS Act, it would be unclear whether that person would even be allowed in that room. So we want to make sure that mentors, up and coming, young entrepreneurs, and, frankly, up-and-coming entrepreneurs of all ages have access to the knowledge and the learning that can occur in these pitch events.  Congress has a role in making sure we have laws in place that really help build an environment that promotes innovation. When we passed the JOBS Act in 2012 that allowed for crowdfunding, Congress took a step forward. We have room to go there, room to go with private placements.  The HALOS Act is a small step, but it is a good one and a noncontroversial one. It creates a clear path for startups to participate in demo days, sponsored by government entities, nonprofits, angel investment groups, et cetera, and[[Page H252]]a clear safe harbor from the SEC with regard to the definition of general solicitation to make it clear that business experts and others can be in the room, while maintaining that only existing accredited investors can actually participate in offerings under Regulation D for the purchases or sale of securities that are mentioned in those demonstrations.  Currently, sponsors of demo days are relying on the 12-year-old, no-action letter by the SEC to make sure that they don't face the consequences of failing to comply. The guidelines outlined by the SEC's no-action letter are actually incorporated into the HALOS So, in many ways, this clarifies and puts in statute something that has been at the whim of the SEC for too long.  The gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Collins) and others will join me in talking about the importance of angel investors for early stage capital to create jobs, to allow tomorrow's great entrepreneur who might not have any resources of their own today to raise the resources they need to hire people and succeed.  The Center for Venture Research estimates that U.angel investors invested $24.6 billion in about 71,000 small businesses in every area, every congressional district of our country. Many of those were startups in the early stages of building a company.  Tomorrow's company that employs 10,000 or even 50,000 people is today's garage startup trying to figure out how to get $50,000 or raise $100,000 to make their payroll or buy their inventory.  Angel investors focus their investment on local startups and much more so than, for instance, national venture capital firms that tend to be clustered at the coast. It is an important way we can continue to grow the economy in every ZIP code in this country, across the heartland and the middle of the country, not just the coasts where the venture capital firms themselves are situated.  The Colorado-based digital home design firm, Havenly, started by two sisters, utilized demo days as networking opportunities to perfect their pitch to investors, a very common path. After participating in a 500-startup demo day, the pair received nearly $13 million in investment capital from qualified investors. Now Havenly is a thriving business, employs hundreds of interior designers across the country, and I am proud to say it has a staff of 40 people in their Colorado headquarters. Havenly is a perfect example of how demo days provide opportunities to startups that create real jobs for real people in our country.  The HALOS Act simply gives the same opportunities to other startups that thousands of others have had when getting off the ground.  I believe the HALOS Act is the appropriate approach to regulatory relief. I appreciate the bipartisan nature of the legislation. It is targeted to provide clarity around a specific potential problem and certainty around what these events can entail.  Now, there is another bill under this rule as well. It is a bad bill. It is not a strong bipartisan bill. It is called H.79. Since we began the 115th Congress here, the Republicans are promoting a deregulation agenda. Often this agenda results in this body, Congress, potentially being buried in having to do inordinate amounts of work to review the executive branch of government.  Now, we all believe in oversight of the executive branch. Believe me, Mr.Speaker, you are going to hear many Democrats speaking up about how important oversight of the executive branch is, particularly for the incoming administration.  We are not the executive branch. Congress delegates authority to agencies, under the laws we write, to fill in gaps and decide how best to implement the law. If we disagree, we can always change or amend the authorizing statute to make more clear the intent of this body.  However, these bills being brought to the floor by the Republicans would either require Congress to spell out exactly what ways to implement a policy in a changing world or give the authority of how to interpret and implement law to the judicial system, neither of which are wise or expedient choices regardless of who occupies the  While I certainly will have more sympathy with this approach with President Trump in the White House than President Obama in the White House, I still believe this is the wrong way to go about the separation of powers under our  This bill sets out 60 new analytical requirements that agency actions must meet before they can be implemented. In other words, any attempt by agencies to protect the public from toxic substances, make sure our planes and trains are meeting safety regulations, or make sure our food is toxin free would be subject to 60 new bureaucratic hurdles, effectively creating more and more red tape to tie the bureaucracy up rather than make their work quicker and more efficient, which is what Democrats seek to do.  This bill would bury the agency rulemaking process under a blizzard of bureaucratic hurdles and documentation requirements, literally burying the executive and administrative branch of government in red tape and paperwork. This bill would hold the regulatory process hostage to the whims of the very corporations and bureaucrats whose rulemaking it is designed to address.  The process that the bills call for have been roundly discredited by so many experts on regulatory policy from the left and the right and consumer advocates as well. The administrative law and regulatory practices section of the American Bar Association stated that these burdens would reduce transparency, reduce public input, threaten public safety, and, most importantly, not result in any better rules.  This bill is nothing other than a recycled effort that 56 Members of this body have not had a chance to participate in writing through the committee process to slow down the government and get in the way of agency rulemakings that are critical for protecting public health, safety, and our environment.  We are simply failing our constituents that we are elected to serve by spending time on legislation that would deliberately sabotage our own ability for our government to function efficiently. This is a bill that would make government less efficient. That is not what I hear when I am back home from my constituents--Democrat, Republican, I don't hear: Go to Washington to make government less efficient. My constituents want government to be more efficient.  Finally, this bill is being considered under a structured rule limiting the amendment process. There were over 30 amendments filed. Yet, we are only considering 16 amendments under this very overly restrictive rule. This is particularly onerous because, again, there was no opportunity for the 56 new Members through the committee process to amend this bill.  There was a new Member that appeared before the Rules Committee yesterday. Unfortunately, he was not even allowed to advance his amendment to the floor under this rule.  Another example is an amendment offered by a new Member, ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH249-6.txt,1910,VIETNAM WAR VETERANS RECOGNITION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,January

She owns a historic storefront in downtown In fact, she is the only woman who owns commercial space inthe neighborhood. She runs a gallery featuring the work of over 100 local artisans, actively supporting jobs and contributing toour community.  Jacki was also a competitive long-distance runner. In 1972, she won the first women's only road race in New York, and shecontinues to run.  Finally, she has a pacemaker. She suffers from cardiomyopathy, a rare heart disease she developed after contracting the flu.While the doctor gave her only 2 years to live, she exceeded that prognosis by three decades, but her health depends onreplacing her pacemaker every 7 to 8 years.  Jacki is one of countless Americans for whom insurance through the Affordable Care Act is literally a matter of life ordeath. She says she pays a lot for her coverage, about 900 a month, but she told me she is excited to pay it. Before theAffordable Care Act, her precondition meant no coverage at all.  When I asked Jacki what message she wanted me to share with my colleagues in Congress, she made clear that I should sharethe message that her situation is not unique. We need to act to make sure that people like Jacki continue to have healthcarecoverage rather than ending the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that they rely on.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH316-2.txt,1910,"FAIR RATEPAYER ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, AND EFFICIENCY STANDARDS",2017.0,11.0,April

We just had a big vote, over 80 votes in favor of simply saying, for the first time since 2008: Let's allow people to spend the night on this boat and go overnight on this boat, despite the fact that there is legislation called the 1966 Safety at Sea law, which prohibits wooden boats of a certain size from carrying overnight passengers. Let's make an exception here because the Delta Queen is willing to undergo the kind of renovations that are necessary to make it safe. It also requires new safety requirements for the Delta Queen going forward.  So I really appreciate the fact this vote was taken tonight. It is about a treasured part of our history. It is also about the economy because it will produce tourism and economic advancements all along the river everywhere the river stops, including in my hometown of We are going to welcome the Delta Queen back if this legislation can be enacted into law.

Mr.Speaker, H.690 is based on a bipartisan bill I introduced last year, H.5391, which passed the House in  For decades, security experts have warned of the danger that radioactive materials could be smuggled within and across our borders and used in an act of nuclear terrorism. The DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, or DNDO, brings together expertise from across the Federal Government to detect and prevent the illicit transport, storage, and assembly of nuclear and radiological weapons. These interagency partners coordinate their efforts using a multilayered framework--the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture, or GNDA describes Federal programs, guidelines, and detection technologies and identifies research challenges and security gaps.  In 2015, GAO looked at how DNDO manages its $350 million research and development program. The report found that DNDO needs to do a better job of documenting how it chooses which projects to fund and how these investments align with security gaps and research challenges--especially for vulnerabilities identified in the  H.690 would resolve these issues by requiring DNDO to document the rationale it uses to prioritize research topics, explain how selected investments align with gaps and research challenges, and develop a systematic approach to evaluate the outcomes for individual projects. Such documentation is essential to ensure that DNDO is making the right research investments to keep the Nation secure.[[Page H796]]  Mr.Speaker, my bill, H.690, would help DNDO use its limited resources toward projects that actually close the vulnerability gaps. Preventing and detecting nuclear smuggling is a complex endeavor.

12591,topic-id,237,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.655.  For over a decade, the Securing the Cities program has provided a growing number of first responders from New York City and Newark, New Jersey to Los Angeles and Long Beach to Washington, D.C., Houston, and Chicago with the tools they need to detect radiological and nuclear threats.  Securing the Cities is administered by the Department of Homeland Security's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, DNDO, which houses the Department's experts on preparing for and responding to rad/nuc events.  The program makes funding available to participating jurisdictions for planning and analysis related to radiological and nuclear threats, as well as equipment purchases, training, and exercises.  Through this program, DNDO supports grantees by providing subject matter expertise, training, coordination, and technological support. H.655 would formally authorize the existing Securing the Cities program and improve it by directing the Government Accountability Office to assess the program and offer recommendations for how it could become more effective.  Mr.Speaker, this bill passed the House last Congress by a vote of 441-4.

12747,topic-id,552,"Mr.Speaker, if today's vote on the previous question fails, we will have the opportunity to vote on my bill, H.1868, Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017, which will reverse last night's disastrous action by President Trump when he signed a partisan congressional resolution allowing internet providers to sell their customers' personal information without their knowledge or consent.  Before my time in Congress, I started my career as a systems analyst. I have firsthand experience writing code, and I can tell you that the first thing to protect vulnerable and sensitive data is to make sure it is kept private.  S.34, which the House passed last Tuesday, unraveled those vital protections for sensitive information belonging to millions of Americans nationwide.                              {time}  1330  The resolution negating essential protections for private citizens was signed by President Trump last night. The October 2016 FCC rule was the only rule that required internet service providers to obtain consumers' permission before selling their private internet browsing history and other sensitive information.  I am simply shocked that my colleagues across the aisle would vote for a measure that violates American privacy by selling your most personal and intimate information, including your email content and your app usage, all without your consent. Not only is this wrong and a blatant violation of policy, but it jeopardizes Americans' personal data and puts them at risk of hacking.  Repealing the FCC rule with S.34 allows broadband providers to turn over your info to the highest bidder or anyone else they want, including the government, without a warrant, without ever telling you. That is right. I will repeat it. Repealing the FCC rule with S.34 allows broadband providers to turn over your private information to the highest bidder or anyone else they want, including the government, without a warrant, without ever telling you.  Even worse, S.34 also tells providers they no longer have to use reasonable measures to protect consumers' personal information. This is absolutely unacceptable. We are living in a time where identity theft and internet hacking has become the new norm. We must provide consumers with these protections. No American wants their most personal information to be up for grabs.  Eliminating this rule prevents the FCC from publishing rules that are substantially the same absent additional legislation, establishing a very dangerous precedent for private citizens. Americans should have the right to decide how their internet providers use their personal information.  What this bill does, Mr.Speaker, is simple. This bill makes clear that the American people's browser histories are not for sale. The American people's health information: not for sale. The American people's financial information: not for sale. And the American people's location data: not for sale.  It is a simple concept and one I hope my colleagues across the aisle will recognize and support. The American people don't want the legislation that was signed last night. In overwhelming numbers, they are calling Congress and letting it be known that they want to keep their private information private.  I am proud to stand up for the American people by introducing the Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017, which reverses this misguided resolution and says, once and for all, that ISPs cannot sell customers' personal information without their knowledge, without their permission. This bill says that your privacy is not for sale, period.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2647.txt,99999999999999,IMPROVING RURAL CALL QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,4.0,March

12658,topic-id,1124,"Mr.President, I am pleased that in the Senate we are about to take a vote on ratifying the protocol of the accession of Montenegro to  What I wanted to do was to take a few moments to explain to people why I think this is an important vote and an important moment for our security as a nation but also to protect our interests abroad and that of our allies.  We all know that NATO--the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--was started right after World War It was primarily designed in the Cold War to confront the threats posed by the Soviet Union and its allies in the Warsaw Of course those threats have changed since the end of that Cold  Here is what hasn't changed. What hasn't changed is the need for America and her allies in a strong way to remain engaged in the world. That need has not changed. What has not changed is the need for democracies to be able to come together and collectively defend not just their interests but the interests of all people around the world where freedom is threatened. The difficult, painful lesson of history is that dictators and tyrants are never pleased with what they have. They always want more. They always need more. That is why it is so important that those nations on Earth--luckily and in a blessed way, more people than ever before find themselves living in societies where the people get to choose their leaders.  These alliances we have around the world--NATO being chief among them--help advance our strategic and economic interests, but most importantly, they help to keep our country safe.  There is a lot of talk about how much countries are paying into NATO, and it is true that the United States is by far the largest contributor to I think that is a combination of two things: one, decisions that were made by some of our allies in Europe on how they want to spend their government's money, and the other is just the reality that we are the United States of America, and as the United States of America, we will always find that we are always making a disproportionate share and contribution on everything, from global aid to fight off hunger and disease, to collective security.  While we can urge our allies, encourage our allies, and ask our allies to make a greater contribution to their own defense, we should not fall into the trap of diminishing what they are doing and what they have done.  First of all, in Europe today, many of our NATO allies are increasing their defense spending. They are doing so in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine and its increased aggression elsewhere in the region. Their soldiers are joining ours in deploying to Central and Eastern Europe to reassure our allies who are facing aggression and potential aggression from Vladimir  With all this talk about NATO and money and how much everyone is giving, I think it is important to take a moment to also understand that our NATO allies have fought beside us and have died beside Americans in Afghanistan, where more than 1,100 soldiers of the NATO-led coalition paid the ultimate price with their lives. It is important to note this because on September 11, 2001, Paris was not attacked, Berlin was not attacked, and London was not attacked on that horrible day; yet these nations and others, our partners, invoked a shared commitment that led them to stand beside us on the other side of the world in an effort to prevent another attack like September 11 from taking place again on American soil or anywhere in the world.  Montenegro is not even a member of NATO yet. Yet it sent hundreds of servicemembers to join the American-led coalition in  I have always argued that when our alliances, such as NATO, are under pressure from our potential adversaries and foes, we need to continue to expand and allow countries that meet the standards set by the alliance to join. That has never been more important than it is now, given the uncertainty and security challenges we face in Europe, especially as Vladimir Putin continues his aggression and continues to threaten stability in the region.  To be frank, Putin would love nothing more than to destroy In fact, you can see him trying to do that on a regular basis. He has tried to divide these countries, turn them against each other. He supports candidates throughout Europe who would take their countries out of NATO, constantly calling into question its viability. Vladimir Putin wants countries like Montenegro to remain in his sphere of influence and what I would call his sphere of threat, as his recent attempts to deploy his asymmetrical tools to influence Montenegrin politics have shown. That is why it is so important that we are moving to ratify Montenegro's access to NATO and to strengthen our relationship with Montenegro through  As the Senate and as a country, we are sending a clear message to Vladimir Putin that we will not accept the establishment of a Russian sphere of influence over countries that desire to[[Page S1987]]ally themselves with the free and democratic community of nations.  Today, I have tried to refrain from using the term ``Russian'' sphere of influence or ``Russia'' because the fact is, as I said to someone earlier today or yesterday, there is a difference between Russia and Vladimir Putin, and the events of the last 48 hours remind us of that. We are watching as many Russians who also desire to join the community of nations have turned out in cities and in places across Moscow and in other places in the thousands. They have turned out to protest the rampant corruption that fuels the Putin regime. And the Putin regime, as all totalitarian regimes do, has cracked down. They have arrested and detained hundreds of peaceful protesters. I ask you to compare that to Montenegro, whose membership in NATO will help the United States and Montenegro deepen our already strong bilateral relationship.  The stakes here are extraordinarily high for the United States and for our European allies. The Senate needs to send a strong message of solidarity with those in Europe who are standing up to the anti-democratic tactics of Vladimir Putin and his cronies.  That is why today I will be proud to cast my vote in support of Montenegro's accession into NATO, and I hope my colleagues here in the Senate will do the same and join me in doing so as well.

12654,topic-id,1358,"Mr.President, last week TrumpCare died, and lots of people are trying to figure out exactly what happened. In my view, it was not a lack of strategy; it was not a lack of effort; it was not a lack of personal relationship between the Speaker and the It died because the policy stank. It died because people actually--left, right, and center--decided that cutting Medicaid by $900 billion in order to provide a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans of the exact same amount was just not a good idea in policy or in politics.  Now that TrumpCare has crashed and burned, Republicans are essentially going to try to do the same thing--tax cuts for the rich. Yet, this time, instead of funding it by cutting Medicaid, they are going to charge people more for groceries. Here is their proposal: They want to cut taxes for corporations again. That is what they want to do. Whether one is talking about infrastructure or whether one is talking about healthcare or whether one is talking about so-called tax reform, their solution to everything is to cut taxes for corporations. They want to cut taxes for corporations again, but this time American families will pay for it through taxes on groceries and the other stuff they have to buy on a day-to-day basis.  We have seen this before. It is a giveaway for corporations and the wealthiest among us, but, as usual, they have to find a pay-for, a way to make the arithmetic work, a way to pay for it. They are going to keep proposing so-called solutions for healthcare, infrastructure, or in this case tax reform, but they are basically the same proposal. It is a subsidy for Wall It is because they cannot help themselves.  This particular giveaway will cost the average American family thousands of dollars. Families will have to pay more for gas, medicine, clothes, cars, food. That is how a so-called border adjustment tax works. Everything one buys in the United States will be taxed, and everything outside of the United States will not be taxed. The sort of principle behind that is that somehow we are going to stimulate exports and disincentivize imports. It is not just that you are paying more on the stuff that is imported; it is that everything in the United States that you purchase you will have to pay more for in order to incentivize exports. But all you are doing is charging the American people more. This is essentially a sales tax.  I talked to members of my staff, and they were trying to get into the sort of technocratic, legal details about whether it is technically a sales tax or a value-added tax or a border adjustment tax that fits into some other legal category. But for a regular person, it does not matter what you call it; if you pay more and the government is collecting it, it is an increase in taxes.  They are going to dazzle you with complexity, and I think some in the House Republican leadership are very skillful at trying to make this more complicated than it is. They are trying to dazzle you with complexity so you do not know what they are doing. They are raising taxes on groceries and all of the stuff you buy. That is their version of tax reform.  I can understand. The Tax Code is awful, it is a mess, and we have been trying to do tax reform for I think 30 years. It is not unreasonable for the average American to say ``Yes, you ought to reform the Tax Code,'' but, remember, when they talk tax reform, they want you to have to go to the store and buy a steak, a hotdog, a head of lettuce, gasoline, pillows, diapers, paper--whatever you need--and it is going to cost more with so-called tax reform. If they succeed, the average American family could pay up to $1,700 more per year in order that corporations can get their tax cuts. Think about what $1,700 means for families across the country. For a family of four, with two kids in middle school, $1,700 pays for a few months' worth of groceries. In Hawaii, $1,700 will cover rent for a month, and in lots of other places, it will cover rent for 4 or 5 months. For some people, it pays a year's worth of an electric bill. In the State of Hawaii, it will pay for 4 or 5 months of your electric bill.  We know for certain this will hurt consumers, but on a macroeconomic level--in other words, for the entire country--we have no idea what a border adjustment tax would actually do in terms of our international relationships.  I understand. I voted against the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the trade promotion authority. I have been very, very concerned about the extent to which we have not been getting the better of these trade deals, especially when it comes to people who are in unions across the country. But we do not want to engage in a trade war. We do not want to screw up American manufacturing, American farming. We have no idea what the impact would be. Even if one is willing to accept increasing the cost of goods in the United States for some theoretical possibility that this will incentivize exports, we have no idea what it is going to do to the American economy overall. Even in the best-case scenario, entire industries will fall apart.  Take tourism. In 2016 alone, tourism supported nearly 5.5 million American jobs directly and almost 10 million more in industries like restaurants and retail. The tourism industry pumps $2.6 billion into our economy every day. That is more than $30,000 per second.  I will say one other thing about tourism. As we worry about automation, as we worry about artificial intelligence, as we worry about a global economy that is going to eviscerate some of our core industries, tourism is one thing that cannot be taken away from us. If people want to go to Los Angeles, if people want to go to Cleveland, if people want to go to Hawaii, if people want to go to Louis, MO, or Kansas City, MO, or Florida, these are jobs that cannot be taken away. So if you want to infuse cash into an economy, create a tourism economy--all of these jobs and all of this revenue will be under threat if this works out the way they want it to work out because the dollar will be so strong that Americans will want to travel abroad and foreigners will want to travel far, far away from us.  Why are we punishing consumers and small businesses? Why are we putting entire industries at risk? House Republicans will tell you it is because they think the corporate tax is too high, but here is the truth: Right now, major corporations have huge teams of tax lawyers who set up fake shell companies so that they get around paying Federal taxes at all, or they abuse loopholes to drastically lower what they owe to the U.That is why we see some corporations that end up paying zero dollars in Federal income tax year after year even though they are making a healthy profit in the United  Together, Republicans and Democrats should be going after these tax dodgers. Instead of just getting rid of loopholes, they have decided to tax consumers. This makes no sense, and that is why we have to stop it.  Last week, we saved healthcare for 24 million Americans because people[[Page S1985]]across the country of all political persuasions stood up to fight. This week, the fight goes on. Once again, far too many people are in the crosshairs. I believe strongly that so long as we continue to stand together, we can win this one too. A huge tax cut for the wealthy cannot be funded by increasing the cost of groceries.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

12543,topic-id,1591,"Mr.President, we are in a moment of profound unease about the stability of the executive branch of our government.  The recent reports about General Flynn detailing constant, high-level contact between members of the Trump administration and the Russian Government raise serious doubts about this administration's competence in the realm of foreign policy and national security and even graver doubts about the sanctity of our democratic process.  We do not know all the facts, and in the coming days and weeks, more information may well surface about these disturbing revelations, but we already know that something is rotten in the state of  I have been in Congress a long time, and I have never, ever seen anything like this. The institutions of government are being tested in a way they have not been tested in some time.  At this juncture, we would all do well to remember that democracy--the most benevolent, desirable, effective, and just form of government devised by man--is also one of the most fragile systems of government devised by man. It requires constant vigilance and strong democratic institutions to bolster one another.  At the time of the drafting of the Constitution, Thomas Jefferson expressed doubt that a government founded on such a document could long endure. Varying factions in our founding generation worried alternatively about the threats posed by mob rule and potential autocrats.  One of the things that the Framers of the Constitution most worried about was the threat of foreign intervention in our government, what they called foreign intrigue. Federalist 68, likely authored by a famous resident of my State, Alexander Hamilton, labeled the ``desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils'' as one of the ``most deadly adversaries of republican government.'' That fear is the origin of the emoluments clause, which safeguards against bribery of government officials by foreign powers.  It cannot be that officers at the highest echelons of our governmentowe favors to foreign capitals. But it may well be that a high-level member of President Trump's campaign and administration, General Flynn, violated the emoluments clause by accepting money from the Russian Government during a trip to Moscow in 2015. The reported contact between operatives in the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials is exactly the kind of intrigue that our Founders sought to prohibit.  I mention all of this because I believe the stakes to be very high. This is not a drill. Nothing less than our system of checks and balances, the rule of law, and our national security is at stake.  Our Nation does not face moments like this often. Frankly, the fact that foreign powers would have high influence in our government has not been on the front page for decades. But the wisdom of the Founding Fathers shines through. It is a real danger, and now the possibility of that danger being real is here today.  History will look upon us and will no doubt judge our efforts to stem this wrong wherever it occurs. Our Nation does not face moments like this often.  From the earliest days of the Republic, what has always sustained us has been the strength of our democratic institutions of government. We have distinct pillars of power that check and balance one another for the very purpose of fortifying our government whenever one branch is deficient. On this matter, the legislative branch has a responsibility to be that check and balance via our oversight duties.  All of us can agree that right now what are required are the facts. We have to evaluate the scope of Russia's interference in our election and assess if agents of their government have penetrated to the highest levels of our government. Throughout the process, we have to avoid jumping to conclusions or engaging in wild speculation. We must seek the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Once we have all the facts at our disposal, Democrats and Republicans alike can debate what to do next.  The investigation should proceed along two tracks. The first is My friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, is committed to using every resource and authority in that committee to seek the truth. His committee will take the lead, but it will not be the only committee that looks into ties between the Trump campaign, transition, or administration, and The Judiciary, Foreign Relations, HSGAC, Banking, and Commerce Committees all have significant roles at getting to the bottom of this. They should also move forward in their areas of jurisdiction. These committee investigations must be bipartisan; they must have access to all intelligence officials, transcripts, documents, and other related materials that they need to answer critical questions; and they must be permitted to make their findings public to the maximum extent possible.  Of course, anything that Congress does requires Republican support because they are in the majority. I am gratified that some of our Republican colleagues have called for that. Bipartisan letters from the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee have been and are being sent last night and today. These letters will ask for document preservation, briefings, and for information related to the investigations.  As for the Intelligence Committee, Senator Burr, the chairman, originally expressed skepticism about his committee proceeding with an investigation into the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but he is now working well with Senator Warner to do this. We will be watching very carefully. If the Intelligence Committee investigation is not proceeding to unearth the entire truth, we will seek alternative tools and structures to get to the truth because get to the truth we must.  The second part of the investigation is in the executive branch, where law enforcement resides. While Congress has a constitutional oversight ability to bring facts to light, it is only the executive branch that can prosecute potential criminal liability.  The two are not mutually exclusive. They are not either/or. They must move forward simultaneously on parallel tracks.  On the executive branch side, three specific things must now happen:  First, Attorney General Sessions must follow Department of Justice guidance and recuse himself.  When the FBI looks into a matter, they do so right alongside prosecutors from the Justice Those prosecutors should not be reporting to the first Senator who endorsed Donald Trump's campaign, who served on the same campaign committee as General Flynn, and who nominated Donald Trump at the Republican convention. The Justice Department's own guidelines demand that Attorney General[[Page S1226]]Sessions remove himself from this matter immediately. If he does not, he will be breaking serious guidelines that have been in place for decades, followed by both Republican and Democratic administrations alike. To disregard or ignore these rules would be a major transgression by this administration, so early in its term, and would bode poorly for the future impartiality of the criminal justice system.  We now know that the President and the Attorney General are meeting today. Of course the President needs to meet with the Attorney General; that is important for national security. But until the Attorney General recuses himself, those meetings raise serious questions. There will be a cloud hanging over every meeting and conversation between the President and the Attorney General until the Attorney General recuses himself. We presume that they would not even think of discussing the investigation--that the Attorney General and the President would not--because if they were to discuss any investigation, it would constitute a massive, massive ethical violation.  Second, to reiterate, from the executive branch point of view, we expect the administration will order all records from administration, transition, and campaign officials to be preserved.  There is real concern that some in the administration may try to cover up its ties to Russia by deleting emails, texts, or other records that could shine a light on these connections. These records are likely to be the subject of executive branch as well as congressional investigations and must be preserved.  Third, campaign, transition, and administration officials must be made available to testify in public, under oath, on these issues.  It has been reported that campaign officials have had constant contact with Russian intelligence officials. They must testify.  Our caucus is united in these three requests, and we hope and expect our Republican colleagues to join in these appeals as well.  Senate Democrats are faithfully committed to keeping this issue above partisan politics. The gravity of this issue demands nothing less.  Throughout the history of this country, the Senate has come together to steer the ship of state through stormy seas when the times required it. Republican Senators like Howard Baker, Hugh Scott, and Bob Dole rose above politics during the Watergate, Iran-Contra, and Whitewater scandals to demand the truth. I am very hopeful my Republican colleagues on the other side will follow in that grand tradition. I am very hopeful the other side wants to get at all the facts, just as our side wants to get at all the facts.  I disagree with my friends on the other side of the aisle often on a number of issues--often, we disagree vociferously--but I have never once doubted their patriotism. This is an issue on which patriotism must prevail over politics because before we are Democrats or Republicans, we are Americans, with respect for the rule of law.  I have a hope and a faith that these reports and revelations will not pit the two parties against one another--that they will unite the parties in pursuit of the full truth.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1225-2.txt,1036,RAISING AWARENESS OF MODERN SLAVERY,2017.0,16.0,February
12603,topic-id,918,"Mr.President, I rise this morning to address the events of General Flynn's resignation as National Security Advisor on Monday night and the need for a full, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the facts of the case. It is now readily apparent that General Flynn's resignation is not the end of the story. It is merely the beginning of a much longer story.  The circumstances of General Flynn's contacts with the Russian Ambassador during the transition, the recent reports of potential high-level contact between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, including General Flynn, should raise hairs on the necks of everyone in this body and every American of goodwill--Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal, This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue about our country and how it is governed. It is also an issue about our security. We are now left with more questions than answers, and it is imperative to find the truth. With every hour that goes by, more and more questions are raised. Every White House press briefing and early morning tweet seemingly introduces new inconsistencies and contradictions that demand a full accounting. Every report that suggests deeper ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian Government needs to be followed up on and verified.  We need to get all the facts.  So in the days and weeks ahead, the Trump administration needs to answer some serious questions. These questions must be asked by an independent and unbiased law enforcement authority. They must be answered truthfully by administration officials. Any attempt to lie or to mislead must be countered with the full force of law.  There needs to be an independent and transparent investigation on two fronts: one in the legislative branch, where we have an obligation to conduct oversight, and one in the executive branch, which has the responsibility of finding and prosecuting potential criminal liability.  Today I wish to address the investigation that must occur in the executive branch.  The new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, cannot be the person to lead that investigation. In fact, Justice Department regulations specifically prohibit individuals who have political ties to the subjects of an investigation from leading that investigation. It is a clear conflict of interest. I want to read the regulations of the Department of They are right here, and every American should see them because they are clear as can be.       No Department of Justice employee may participate in a      criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or      political relationship with any person or organization      substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of      the investigation or prosecution or who would be directly      affected by the outcome.[[Page S1167]]  No employee shall participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or the prosecution.  The regulations continue. They define political relationship, again, clear as a bell:       Political relationship means a close identification with an      elected official, candidate, political party or campaign      organization arising from service as a principal advisor or      official. Personal relationship means a close and substantial      connection of the type normally viewed as likely to induce      partiality.  Jeff Sessions was chairman of the National Security Advisory Committee alongside LTG Michael He was a senior adviser in the Trump campaign, the first Senator to endorse the President's campaign, and nominated him at the Republican Convention in Those facts and the Department of Justice's own rules disqualify Attorney General Sessions from running this investigation.  The words are crystal clear; there is no wiggle room. If Attorney General Sessions were to conduct or in any way be involved with this investigation, he would be violating Justice Department guidelines.  As bad a start as the Trump administration is off to, it would make things dramatically worse to ignore these guidelines, which were set up for the purpose of getting to the truth in a fair and impartial way.  Attorney General Sessions must recuse himself immediately. Any investigation headed by, directed by, or influenced by the Attorney General will be jaundiced from the very start.  Because the rules are so clear, I expect the Attorney General will recuse himself and allow an independent and thorough investigation to go forward.  We have an additional reason to seek an independent and transparent investigation because of how the White House has treated this matter over the past few weeks.  The White House knew for weeks that General Flynn misled the Vice President and let General Flynn stay on the job. They knew for weeks that his discussion about sanctions with the Russian Government could potentially compromise our national security because he would be subject to blackmail, and they let him stay on.  The President knew for weeks about this and let General Flynn stay on in his full capacity, present at and participating in the highest level of national security discussions, until those reports were made public.  If the reports of General Flynn's incorrect statements to the Vice President were never made public by the Washington Post, would the President's trust ever have eroded? Would General Flynn ever have been fired? Would he still be in his job today? We will never know now. The answer is very troubling.  If an investigation is not independent, nonpartisan, and, most of all, transparent, there is no guarantee this administration will take the decisive and immediate actions necessary to keep our country safe.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1166-3.txt,1036,AMERICANS' TAX DOLLARS SHOULD NEVER BE USED TO END THE LIFE OF A CHILD,2017.0,15.0,January

12652,topic-id,1402,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon on a few topics. First, on the investigation into the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia, this is a matter of such gravity, we need to get it right. There should be no doubt about the integrity and impartiality of the investigation, either in the executive branch, where the FBI and Department of Justice are looking into it, or in Congress, where the Intelligence Committees of both Chambers are conducting an investigation.  Unfortunately, the House Intelligence Committee has come under a cloud of suspicion and partisanship. A few months ago, Chairman Nunes spoke to reporters at the request of the White House to tamp down stories on the links between the Trump campaign and Russia, which is exactly what his committee now must investigate. This past week, Chairman Nunes broke with the committee process and tradition to brief the President on information he had learned but hadn't yet shared with the committee. We have learned this morning that Chairman Nunes was at the White House the day before that event--doing what? We don't know. It could very well be the case that Chairman Nunes was briefing members of the administration about an investigation of which they are the subject.  Chairman Nunes is falling down on the job and seems to be more interested in protecting the President than in seeking the truth. You cannot have the person in charge of an impartial investigation be partial to one side. It is an inherent contradiction, and it undermines decades of bipartisan cooperation on the Intelligence Committee, which handles such sensitive information paramount to national security. It undermines Congress as a coequal branch of government meant to hold the executive branch accountable for its actions, and it corrodes the American people's confidence in our government.  If Speaker Ryan wants the House to have a credible investigation, he needs to replace Chairman Congress was meant by the Framers to be separate and equal, and I sincerely worry that under his direction, Mr.Nunes is pushing the committee into a direction of obsequiousness and not one that is asking the hard questions and getting the important answers.  There has always been a grand tradition of bipartisanship on the Intelligence When Members go into the SCIF, the room where they get secure briefings, they check their partisanship at the door. Chairman Nunes is right on the edge of doing permanent damage to that grand tradition of bipartisanship. Chairman Nunes seems to be more of a partisan for the President than an impartial actor. He has not been cooperating like someone who is interested in getting to the unvarnished truth. His actions look like those of someone who is interested in protecting the President and his party, and that doesn't work when the goal of the committee is to investigate Russia and its connection to the President and his campaign.  Without further ado, Speaker Ryan should replace Chairman                               TrumpCare  Mr.President, on another matter, the failure of TrumpCare this past Friday was a good day for the American people. We can finally put to bed the disaster of a bill that was TrumpCare, which would have resulted in spottier coverage, 24 million fewer Americans with health coverage, and higher costs, premiums, and deductibles for the middle class, the working poor, and older Americans, all to finance close to $600 billion in tax breaks for wealthy Americans should breathe a sigh of relief that TrumpCare will not become law. We are happy that it is gone. We can finally move on.  As I have said many times, we Democrats, provided our Republican colleagues drop ``replace'' and stop undermining the ACA, are willing to work with our Republican friends to improve the existing law. No one ever said the Affordable Care Act was perfect. We have ideas to improve it; hopefully, our colleagues on the Republican side do as well. I hope once ``replace'' is dropped and the ACA is no longer undermined by the administration, we can sit down and talk about it.  Unfortunately, the administration has already done several things that undermine the law and hurt the people. During the final weeks of open enrollment, the Trump administration discontinued the public advertising campaigns that encouraged people to sign up for insurance. The administration is working behind the scenes to give insurers flexibility to offer Americans less coverage for the healthcare they need, and the Executive order that President Trump issued directing agencies to facilitate the repeal and replacement of the ACA has destabilized the marketplace. Now that TrumpCare is off the table, the President should rescind the Executive order.  Today, I am urging the President and his entire administration to immediately cease all efforts to undermine the People's lives are at stake.  The President should not hope that the healthcare system for tens of millions explodes. He should not want premiums to go up on his watch. He should not hope that Americans lose treatment for opioid addiction on his watch. This approach is wrong, and wrong in two ways: First and foremost, it is wrong because it hurts people. The President must be a leader. It is not leadership for the President to hurt people and actively work to undermine our Nation's healthcare system simply because he is angry that he didn't get his way on repealing the That is not Presidential, that is petulance.  Secondly, this approach will not work politically. Donald Trump is no longer an outsider; he is The American people are looking to him to help solve their problems. If he doesn't, it is going to hurt him and his party. Pointing the finger of blame isn't going to solve anyone's problems. That strategy is not only bad for the American people and beneath the Presidency, it will backfire politically. He is in charge. People want him to make their lives better, not make them worse because of some political anger or vendetta.  I know many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do care deeply about fixing the Nation's healthcare problems, and we are ready to do that with them in a bipartisan way. But, of course, repeal must be taken off the table, and the President must stop hurting citizens by undermining the Affordable Care                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, finally, on tax issues, now that the jig is finally up on healthcare, our Republican friends have signaled they will turn to taxes. I hope they have learned the lessons of One of the reasons TrumpCare failed so spectacularly was that Republicans tried to rush and ram it through via a reconciliation process, even though it was deeply unpopular with the public. The last poll showed only 17 percent of Americans supported TrumpCare, so that means a large number even of Trump supporters were opposed to it.  Why was it so unpopular? Probably because TrumpCare would have given the wealthiest among us a monster tax cut while hammering older Americans and the middle class with higher costs for less care.  So I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: If you try to pass a Republican tax plan using the same reconciliation method in order to get a huge tax break for the wealthy and already profitable and powerful corporations, it will fail. The American people are not crying out for tax breaks on[[Page S1984]]the wealthiest God bless the wealthy. They are doing just fine without the tax breaks, but thus far it seems our Republican colleagues are headed in that direction.  Even though the President campaigned as a populist, his administration has been all hard-right, pro-corporate, pro-special interests, totally against the working people. If the President and Republicans in Congress continue in that direction, proposing policies that shift burdens off the wealthy and powerful, not aiming to help the middle class and working families, their efforts will continue to fail, and it will turn tax reform into a partisan issue. The White House says tax reform isn't partisan, but it surely will be if they propose massive tax cuts only for the wealthy. My prediction: If Republicans go down that road, the Republican tax scheme will meet the same fate as I hope they will not go down that road; I hope they will not.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Before I start, I include in the Record a letter from over 20 healthcare provider organizations regarding the danger of cutting certain providers off from title X funding because they also provide abortion with private funds.                                                 February 3, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Charles Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington,     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Leader Schumer and      Leader Pelosi: As organizations representing health care and      public health professionals and the people they serve across      the country, we strongly oppose any effort to prevent Planned      Parenthood health centers from participating in federal      health programs, including Medicaid and the Title X family      planning program. Any proposal to exclude Planned Parenthood      from public health programs will severely curtail women's      access to essential health care services, including family      planning, well-woman exams, breast and cervical cancers      screenings, and HIV testing and counseling. At a time when      there is much uncertainty about the future of affordable      health care in our country, it is dangerous to cut off access      to the life-saving preventive care that Planned Parenthood      provides to some of our nation's most vulnerable patients.       Planned Parenthood health centers play a crucial role in      improving the health and lives of people across the country.      In fact, 2.5 million women, men and young people rely on      Planned Parenthood for health care every year. For many      women, Planned Parenthood is their only source of care--     offering basic preventive services that are fundamental to      women's health and well-being. More than 50% of Planned      Parenthood health centers are in areas with health      professional shortages, rural or medically underserved areas.      In 2014 alone, Planned Parenthood health centers provided      nearly 400,000 cervical cancer screenings and more than      360,000 breast exams. Additionally, Planned Parenthood      provides contraceptive services for over 2 million patients      and more than 4 million tests and treatments for sexually      transmitted infections, including These services improve      women's health, prevent an estimated 579,000 unintended      pregnancies, and decrease infant mortality.       Policies that would exclude Planned Parenthood from public      health funding would hurt millions of patients and undermine      health care access in communities across the country.      Limiting access to Planned Parenthood's approximately 650      health care centers across the country would prevent patients      from having timely access to basic preventive health care      services. Approximately 60 percent of Planned Parenthood      patients access care through Medicaid and Title X, in      addition to those who rely on other essential programs,      including maternal and child health programs and Centers for      Disease and Prevention (CDC) breast and cervical cancer      screening programs. In some states, Planned Parenthood is the      only provider participating in Title X, and more than 50      percent of Planned Parenthood health centers are located in a      medically underserved or health professional shortage area.      Because federal law already requires health care providers to      demonstrate that no federal funds are used for abortion,      prohibitions on funding for preventive care at Planned      Parenthood health centers will only devastate access to these      life-saving services.       In addition to limiting patients access to health care,      defunding Planned Parenthood is not cost effective. The      Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that      approximately 390,000 women would lose access and up to      650,000 patients could face reduced access to preventive      health care within a year should Congress act to block all      Medicaid patients from receiving care at Planned Parenthood      health centers. The CBO also projects that excluding Planned      Parenthood health centers from receiving reimbursement      through the Medicaid program would result in a net cost to      taxpayers of $130 million over 10 years because of the      increase in unintended pregnancies without the contraceptive      care provided by Planned Other publicly funded      health centers would not be able to compensate for the loss      of affordable family planning and reproductive health care      services provided by Planned       Every day, we see the harmful impact that unequal access to      health care has on women and communities across the country,      and we therefore strongly support policies that improve      access to affordable, quality health care. Policies that      would deny Planned Parenthood public health funds only serve      to cut millions off from critical preventive care, and we      strongly oppose any effort to do so. We also recognize this      as part of a broader effort to undermine access to safe,      legal abortion and curtail access to other reproductive      health care by limiting the ability of abortion providers to      participate in public health programs.

12510,topic-id,1003,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from myself and 161 other Members to Speaker Ryan opposing the Republican majority's efforts to undermine title X family planning programs and women's access to health care.                                Congress of the United States,                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House of Representatives, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan: We write to express our grave concern      for efforts to undermine Title X family planning. Despite      promises to focus on jobs and the economy, Republicans have      started the 115th Congress with a total assault on women's      choices, access to care, and economic security by:       Charging ahead to sabotage and dismantle the Affordable      Care Act (ACA) while making no promises to preserve vital      protections for women;       Providing little to no details on their plans to replace      ACA, while making a point to announce that their ACA repeal      package will block access to Planned Parenthood, a high-     quality, long-trusted provider of reproductive health      services;       Rushing to impose and dramatically expand the global gag      rule, harming women around the world; and       Advancing the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion      Insurance Full Disclosure Act (H.7) through the House,      effectively banning private insurance companies from covering      comprehensive reproductive health services.       Now, with their most recent effort to weaken the Title X      national family planning program through the Congressional      Review Act, Republicans have demonstrated that they will stop      at nothing to limit women's access to vital health care.      Sadly, this includes contraception and family planning      services that all women need.       For more than 40 years, Title X has served as a cornerstone      of safety-net care. As the only dedicated source of federal      funding for family planning, Title X allows a diverse network      of providers to deliver high-quality care to low-income,      uninsured, or underinsured individuals and to those seeking      confidential care. In 2014 alone, Title X-funded clinics      helped prevent approximately 904,000 unintended pregnancies,      326,000 abortions, and 439,000 unplanned births. In addition      to direct clinical care, Title X also supports critical      infrastructure needs for health centers, including new      medical equipment and staff training that are not      reimbursable under Medicaid and commercial insurance. This      infrastructure is vital to ensuring safe, quality care at      health centers which serve and provide basic health services      to high-need populations.       Throughout both Democratic and Republican administrations,      Title X has been interpreted to prohibit state actions that      block providers or classes of providers from participating in      a Title X project based on factors unrelated to a provider's      qualifications to perform the required services. The networks      include providers ranging from state, county, and local      health departments as well as hospitals, family planning      councils, Planned Parenthood affiliates, federally qualified      health centers and other private non-profit organizations. In      fact, in instances when states have passed laws to[[Page H1195]]     limit provider participation in Title X, federal courts have      consistently held that those state laws are contrary to, and      preempted by, federal law.       In response to a growing number of states targeting family      planning providers for exclusion from key federal health      programs, including Title X, the previous Administration      proposed the regulation ``Compliance with Title X      Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting      Subrecipients.'' The regulation, which was finalized in      December 2016, helps ensure patient access to family planning      services and supplies through qualified providers by      reiterating that ``no recipient making subawards for the      provision of services as part of its Title X project may      prohibit an entity from participating for reasons other than      its ability to provide Title X services. During the      rulemaking process, the Department of Health and Human      Services received more than 145,000 comments, the vast      majority of which supported the rule.       Women across the United States, and the men who support      them, have had enough. It is unconscionable that this common      sense clarification has become a political football for      members of Congress who want to limit women's access to      comprehensive reproductive health care. We urge you to stand      in support of women and oppose this assault on contraceptive      access and care.

12511,topic-id,846,"Mr.Speaker, the majority is in the midst of an unprecedented and relentless assault on women's health--and many other regulations while we are at it--that are being overturned every day here.  Although it pledged to govern by prioritizing jobs and the economy, the majority is, instead, escalating its war on women with H.43, a dangerous continuation of its never-ending crusade against access to health care for women.  The majority started the 115th Congress by moving quickly to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act, a law that finally barred insurance companies from treating women as being a preexisting condition. Without this law, women once again would pay a higher rate for coverage than men.  Think about that for a moment. If everybody doesn't know it, before this law, single women paid from 10 to 57 percent more than men for their health insurance in States that allowed gender rating. A lot of people don't understand this, but it costs American women nearly a billion dollars every year. But Republicans are rushing to repeal the Affordable Care Act without anything to take its place.  The majority has also advanced H.7, a sweeping bill that would go beyond even the Hyde amendment, a 40-year provision that has been around for four decades too long.  This legislation wouldn't just make this amendment permanent; it would also place unprecedented limits on women's access to reproductive health services even if they wanted to pay out of their own pockets to access constitutionally protected abortion services.  These moves by the majority, along with the President signing a dramatic expansion of the global gag rule immediately after taking office, have brought millions of people pouring into the streets in protest.  During the National Women's March, millions of people marched all across the country and even around the globe to defend women's rights. These marches were likely the largest day of protests in American history. More than half a million people took to the streets right here in the Nation's They were peaceful, without a single arrest reported anywhere in the country.  Far from respecting those rights, the majority is today considering a measure that marks an entirely new front in their war against women's rights. This is the most serious threat facing women so far in this Congress, and it is only  Programs supported by title X help provide lifesaving preventative healthcare services like contraception, cancer screening, and STD testing to the men and women who need them most.  It is outrageous that the majority today is trying to allow conservative State legislatures to pick and choose who can provide this essential care with Federal money. That is one of the worst things in the world. The luck of the draw of where you live will determine whether or not you have access that is entitled to all people from the Federal money. This would threaten health centers from coast to coast.  Mr.Speaker, we are facing the same problem today we faced for a very long time: men in blue suits and red ties determining what women can and should do when it comes to their own health. They believe the majority of persons--women--in the United States are incapable of making their own decisions.  Do you think that about your own mother or your wife?  Because Washington, D.C., is controlled by this Republican majority, the stakes for women are higher today than they have been in generations, as we turn over laws passed by the elected government of the District of  Mr.Speaker, Republican leaders in Congress turn a deaf ear to the majority of Americans who oppose this dramatic government intervention into women's health care. They, unfortunately, have the votes to pass it, but they will have to reckon with the overwhelming majority of the public who understands it is time for the government to get out of the business of taking away women's healthcare rights.  Mr.Speaker, let me take a personal moment to speak about the departure of a long-time member of my staff on the Rules I have always believed that this committee is like family and that we have one of the most respected staffs on Capitol Adam Berg, the deputy staff director and counsel on the Democratic staff personifies this.  After a decade of working for the Rules Committee, Adam is beginning a new chapter on a different committee in the House of His knowledge and guidance these last years have been immeasurable.  During his time here, he has married his wife, Erika, who is beautiful and talented, and became a father to his daughter, Ariel, who was singing songs with her mother at the age of 3 months. That is a precocious child.  Adam has played a key role as this committee brought landmark legislation to the floor of the House, including Dodd-Frank, the Affordable Care Act, and legislation to raise the Federal minimum wage.[[Page H1196]]  The committee wouldn't have been as effective without Adam's counsel, and he will be greatly missed. I wish him nothing but the best in his new endeavor.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I really believe that everybody in this House understands that not a dime of Federal money is used for abortions. It never has been, never will. There is meticulous care taken by Planned Parenthood to separate those funds. They have never been questioned in any way by the IRS as to how those funds are being used.  I am sick and tired of everybody saying you can't give anything to Planned The money that goes to Planned Parenthood from this Federal Government goes to reimburse for services rendered for the things I had talked about before: cervical cancer tests, cancer tests of all sorts, and health care that they cannot get anywhere else, such as screening for That is totally separate.  Yet, that fable that Federal money is used for abortions if you fund Planned Parenthood is totally false.

Mr.Speaker, we are deeply concerned by reports from our intelligence community regarding the foreign interference in our most recent election.

Mr.Speaker, the future of our democracy is at stake. We are seeing the[[Page H1198]]same kinds of things that have happened all over Europe, as governments have been changing away from democracies. It is at stake here, and it is time this Republican-controlled Congress does its job and gets to the bottom of this.

12523,topic-id,302,"Mr.Speaker, I recently had the privilege of meeting hundreds of constituents who traveled from Rochester, New York, to Washington, D.C., for the Women's March on Some of them came with three generations, and it was most impressive, but it is troubling to me that we are fighting many of the same battles that were fought and won generations ago.  The unprecedented marches and rallies that have been happening are necessary because of efforts like this to continually chip away at women's healthcare rights. The sad reality is that politicians have always worked to put up new roadblocks between women and their health care. It has always been my personal belief that when faced with a decision that needs to be made about a pregnancy, a woman should consult whomever she chooses--certainly her husband, her spiritual adviser, her medical adviser, but no one wants to wait in the room until a Congressperson gets there to make the final decision. We are going way beyond our depth to try to make that decision for persons. The government should not be in the business of doing that. The majority has made attacking women's constitutional rights the first order of business this year, working alongside our new President, and it is shameful.  Lastly, Mr.Speaker, the other measure before us today would repeal the Alaska predator rule which protects the interests of all Americans in national wildlife refuges while banning some of the most inhumane tactics for killing, like killing black bears from an airplane and killing coyote pups in their dens.

It is our creative and innovative spirit that allows us to continue to be a leader in the world economy and raise the quality of life of the human race. We know that jobs of the present and the future will require many new students and retrained workers to pursue STEM degrees--those in science, technology, engineering, and math.  While many politicians have talked a good game about encouraging students to pursue these degrees, it is time to put our money where our mouth is. Today I introduced the ASPIRE Act, H.926, the American Science Principal and Interest Reduction and Employment This act would grant a 25 percent reduction in student loans for any student who graduates with a STEM major.  According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, one million new STEM jobs are projected to come online between 2012 to 2022, for a total of 9 million, 13 percent growth over the decade. This means we must act now to meet these needs, and I encourage all of you to cosponsor this important legislation.  It is time to create real incentives to encourage our students to aspire to new heights and create the jobs of tomorrow today.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1058-3.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,7.0,April
12725,topic-id,563,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of the bipartisan Veterans Choice Program Improvement I will start my remarks by saying that Chairman Isakson was here earlier, and he had a meeting he had to get to. Johnny has been through a tough surgery, and it is good to have Johnny back. But the fact of the matter is he supports this bill. He is an original cosponsor of this bill. The same could be said of Senator Blumenthal, who also had a meeting and wanted to be here, once again. We heard from Senator Schatz earlier. This bill truly has bipartisan support, not only in the VA Committee but also in this body.  The reason people support this piece of legislation is because it brings much needed reforms to the Choice Program while ensuring that veterans can access care in their communities. It is a good bill.  A few years back, the Choice Program was established with the very best of intentions. In my home State of Montana, it is a fact that veterans were waiting far too long for an appointment at the VA and oftentimes had to drive over 100 miles for the appointment. The Choice Program was supposed to allow these veterans to access care closer to home. Unfortunately, it has not been working out the way it should, and veterans have been inundated with redtape and a government contractor that struggles to schedule appointments and pay providers on time. That is why we all worked together--Democrats and Republicans and even Independents--on this bill to put forth these much needed reforms.  The Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act cuts redtape so veterans can access care more quickly. In fact, I made it clear from the get-go that I would not vote to extend the Choice Program until Congress and the VA have addressed some of the biggest concerns I have been hearing from Montana veterans and community providers.  Once we get the bill passed, this program reimburses community providers more quickly for the care they provide to our veterans. It reduces out-of-pocket costs for veterans receiving care through the Choice It improves the sharing of medical records between the VA and the community providers to better ensure seamless care for veterans, whether they are seeing a VA doctor or a doctor in their community. It allows the VA to access all the funding initially appropriated for this program to ensure that veterans' access to care is not disrupted.  This bill is not going to fix everything, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. With this legislation, combined with assurances that I have received from VA Montana, VA folks within the State will be allowed to schedule appointments for Montana's veterans directly instead of going through an inept government contract.  It is my hope that we can make the Choice Program work the way it was[[Page S2142]]intended when we first set it up, with the goal of serving those who have served our country.  I again express my appreciation for taking this bill up on the floor, this Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act, and I think it is a prime example of how this body needs to work together to solve problems--in this case, for our veterans community. We should push this bill out as soon as possible.

12727,topic-id,705,"Mr.President, I would like to thank the good Senator from Kansas for his comments and his leadership not only on the VA Committee on which we both serve but also as chairman of the Appropriations MILCON-VA Subcommittee, the subcommittee that really sees how the money is going to be utilized within the I think Senator Moran has covered just about all of it. I just want to go back and say one thing.  We are going to have a unanimous consent. I am told there will be an objection to it. That is truly unfortunate because this has been a bipartisan effort. It has cleared everyone in the Senate except one person, to my knowledge, and I think that is unfortunate.  One of the complaints I hear is that the primary payer provision of this bill is the problem. The primary payer provision of this bill requires the VA to be exactly that--the primary payer of the bills. My question would be, Why is this a bad thing? Right now veterans are being hamstrung and delayed, and the folks who provide the benefits, the providers, are not getting the dollars in a timely manner. I would just ask, if the VA is not going to be the primary payer, who is?  These folks have put it on the line for this country, and they come back in different shape than when they left, after they bore the battles of war. Some of the injuries are seen; some of the injuries are unseen. And we are not going to say ``You know what. Don't worry about it. We are going to make sure you get the care, and we are going to make sure it is paid for''? It is part of the cost of war. So when we send our young men and women off to war, we ought to be thinking about this stuff. And we have a solution. We have a solution to part of the problems with the Choice  If we get this bill passed, it will give us the opportunity to work together to get a long-term bill passed before the first of the year to really address the needs of our veterans so that there are wraparound services at the VA that veterans can count on.  I would just say that this is supposed to be a very deliberative body, and for the most part, it is pretty deliberative. But when you have a situation of a program that we put into effect--that Congress passed and the Senate had a big part of writing--and it is not working, we ought to fix it, and this bill fixes it in good part. We have some more to do, as I said, but this bill is a step in the right direction in cutting redtape and making it easier for veterans to find care and get care, whether it is in the VA or outside the It[[Page S2143]]is also something that the Veterans Administration sorely needs to move it forward.  I just want to say that we come in here and we have good arguments and good discussions, and sometimes politics comes into the discussion. In this particular case, folks have come to the table--whether it is Senator Isakson or Senator McCain or Senator Moran or me or any of the others on the Veterans' Affairs Committee--and we have come up with a solution that 99 percent of the people in this body agree with, but we can't get it across the finish line. And we wonder why our popularity is in the single digits in this country.  I am just going to close by saying I want to thank everybody from both sides of the aisle who worked together to get this bill crafted and get this bill to this point. I hope that at some point in time, people will take a look at this bill for what it does and realize that there aren't bogeymen in this bill, that our veterans deserve us to work together to find solutions to move the ball forward so they can get the healthcare they were promised when they signed on the dotted line to protect this country.

I would note that we passed this bill through regular order again in the last Congress, passed with bipartisan support. It is appropriate that we bring it up early this year. Again, this is another bipartisan bill. We must allow the public to have administrative process relief in those cases where FERC does not actually issue an order, and this legislation will do just that. I urge passage of the bill.  The Federal Power Act sets forth processes to set rates for electricity, including opportunities for the public to protest a rate change filed with New rates take effect if FERC approves them or if FERC fails to issue an order approving or denying the filed rate within 60 days.  The failure to approve or deny a rate may result from agency delay or, in some limited cases, from a vote that results in a deadlocked Commission, for example, a 2-2 vote. In such cases, the rates become effective by operation of law, even when these rates were not approved by a majority of  The Federal Power Act, of course, provides administrative redress for members of the public to protest Commission rate decisions. However, if these rates become effective by operation of law, for example, that 2-2 deadlock, the administrative processes are not available to the public because FERC did not actually issue an order for the public to protest. The public literally gets shut out.  I don't want to speak for the gentleman from Massachusetts, but I think some of his constituents recently experienced this firsthand. As a result of that and of the hard work by Mr.Kennedy and of his staff and certainly of the committee staff on both sides of the aisle, the legislation was drafted. We considered it in committee during the 114th Congress, where it passed on a voice vote. We have it on the floor today.  I urge all Members to support this legislation.

12660,topic-id,1460,"Mr.President, last week Republicans in Congress came within an inch of ripping health insurance away from 24 million people in order to give tax breaks to rich people. That collapsed, and it collapsed because the American people stood up and said no--no to kicking seniors out of nursing homes, no to booting kids with rare diseases off of their treatments, no to gutting funding for opioid addiction.  All across this country--in every corner of this country--for months people spoke up about how the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid are saving their lives and saving their families from financial ruin. They poured their hearts out, they raised their voices, and they demanded to be heard. Last week they won.  The collapse of the Republicans' cruel scheme is a huge relief to millions of people in this country, but I am not here to celebrate. I am here to warn the American people about what is coming next, because instead of listening to the American people about what they want, the President of the United States has threatened to sabotage healthcare in It isn't subtle. One hour after the Republicans admitted they didn't have the votes in Congress to destroy the Affordable Care Act, President Trump sat behind his desk in the Oval Office and told the entire Nation that he wants to trigger a meltdown of our healthcare system because he thinks that would be helpful to him politically.  Just so there is no confusion, I want to quote him word for word. He said: ``The best thing we can do, politically speaking, is let ObamaCare explode.''  Now let's be clear. It is deeply wrong for the President of the United States--whose one and only job is to look out for the American people--to root for the failure of our country's healthcare system. It is deeply wrong for the President of the United States to announce that he is going to drag down our entire healthcare sector--a sector that accounts for more than one-sixth of the entire U.economy--just so he can stand on top of the wreckage and waggle his fingers and say: I told you so.  Healthcare for millions of Americans is not a game. It is not entertainment. It is not a reality TV show. Healthcare is literally life and death, and it touches everyone in this country from elderly grandparents to tiny babies.  President Trump is responsible for making healthcare in this country work. It is his job. He is President of the United His party controls both Houses of A legitimate President doesn't clap and cheer when things get worse for the American people. A legitimate President doesn't pound his chest about sabotaging the health and security of the American people because it is politically expedient. A legitimate President does his job.  The President's admission that he wants our healthcare system to collapse is a dangerous sign of where things are headed. For 7 years Republicans in Congress have rooted against healthcare in this country, cheering every stumble and working at every turn to hobble the law and make it harder for people to get affordable insurance. President Trump cannot repeal the Affordable Care Act on his own, but he can strip healthcare from millions of Americans and make it too expensive for millions more. He can do that all on his own. In fact, he is already working on it.  A few days after he took office, President Trump signed an Executive order directing his agency to use every tool at their disposal to try to disrupt the Affordable Care In January, he also pulled down government's efforts to get more people signed up for health insurance. Why? So fewer people would use the health exchanges, fewer would get insurance, and premiums would go up for those who did sign up--all in an effort to make ObamaCare fail.  Senator Patty Murray and I asked the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate this reckless move, and now an independent investigation has been launched into this despicable incident. But the President has more tools at his disposal to undercut the Affordable Care Act all by himself. The President can redefine what insurance plans have to cover, stripping out critical benefits like birth control coverage. The President can withhold payments that insurers rely on to keep private health plans affordable. The President can allow States to put new conditions on Medicaid, conditions like taking away healthcare coverage if a woman doesn't get back to work soon enough after giving birth.  If the President decides to launch an all-out effort to sabotage American healthcare so he can manufacture a crisis to score political points, he can hurt a lot of people.  But there is a better way. If Republicans want to work on ideas to actually improve healthcare in America, to expand coverage, to expand access, or to reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs, I am eager to throw up my sleeves and go to work. For years, Massachusetts has led the Nation in bipartisan health reform. We have lots to contribute on this, and lots of other Democrats are ready to get to work, too.  The American people aren't stupid. They know the difference between a bill that kicks 24 million people off of their health insurance and a bill that actually improves care. They know the difference between a President who fights to make health care better and a President who plans to sabotage healthcare. They know the difference between a fireman and an arsonist. If this President and this Congress continue to play politics with the lives of millions of people, I promise you that the American people will see it, they will know it, and they will rise up once again to fight it.

I would like to point out that Montenegro's admittance into NATO is a critical test of the alliances's open-door policy. I don't ask my colleagues to take my word for it. I would just like to point out that our Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Curtis Scaparrotti, last week declared that Montenegro's accession into NATO is ``absolutely critical,'' that they have had this desire. They have met the map, and they understand NATO'S outreach and ability to bring[[Page S1988]]in those who want to determine their own means of government and become part of  If we were to lose this, it would be a setback to many of the other nations and peoples, particularly in Eastern Europe, who were looking forward to and have their eyes on the West and becoming part of  I would point out to my colleagues that the Russians attach some importance to Montenegro because they tried a coup to overthrow the government. The Russians tried a coup to overthrow the government of this small, beautiful, and strategically important nation.  I would just point out that our Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, wrote a letter urging Montenegro's membership to be ratified, saying that it was ``strongly in the interests of the United States.'' In his letter he strongly emphasized that Montenegro's accession to NATO would support greater integration, democratic reform, trade, and security and stability in the entire Balkans region.  I won't take too much time in the Senate except to say that I think this is more than an accession or non-accession of a small 750,000-person nation. It is a test in this contest that we are now engaged in with Vladimir Putin, who has committed to extending the reach and influence of the Russian Government and Russian influence to the point where he attempted a coup to overthrow the freely elected government of That coup failed, but I can assure my colleagues that if we turn down Montenegro, it will not remain the democracy that it is today.

12709,topic-id,467,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Young for being a great partner in the presentation of this bill. Many of us worked together on rural telecommunications issues, from getting broadband to all Vermonters and folks in rural parts of your districts to improving our wireless infrastructure to ensuring we have adequate choice and competition in cable markets. That is because it is our desire, and mine especially, to ensure that rural America has comparable telecom services to urban and suburban America, just as the 1996 Telecommunications Act requires. Making that happen requires constant effort and focus.  We often focus on rural broadband accessibility and affordability so that the next generation of technological innovation does not skip rural America and leave it behind. The promise of innovation, like the Internet of things, should not be earmarked just for urban and suburban America, which is why it is backwards and unfortunate that we are still talking about finding ways to ensure that traditional landline telephone calls can be completed without interruption on a consistent basis, but that is exactly what this bill that I worked on with Representative Young is getting at.  Our bill would require the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, to establish rules that require third-party providers--or least cost routers, as they are called, which is the problem in the call chain--to register their companies, for the first time, with the FCC and, therefore, have to comply with FCC service quality regulations, just like other companies.  This legislation would make it easier for the FCC to hold accountable third-party providers. The FCC will finally know who they are and make them comply with those quality standards.  This is really important in rural areas because we have got companies that do business with urban In Vermont, Dakin Farm had rural call completion problems during their busiest times in 2012. That was the Thanksgiving to Christmas holiday period.  It really hurt their bottom line. It put them at a competitive disadvantage. When people call in and the call is dropped, they think it is bad service from Dakin Farm or the company that they are calling, when it is not. Those folks have to then deal with the reputational harm that is caused.  It is important in rural school districts like Camels Hump in Vermont that rely on these calls when there is a snowstorm or ice storm--and there is one coming tonight--to check whether, in fact, they have got to get their kids to school or not. So it is a big deal when they need it.  I appreciate, by the way, the work that Representative Young has done on this. I look forward to this bill passing both Chambers and being signed into law so we can, hopefully, make rural call completion issues a thing of the past.                              {time}  1715  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH583.txt,1879,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,23.0,March
