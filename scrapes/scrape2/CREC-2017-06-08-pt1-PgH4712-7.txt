                   PULLING OUT OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my deep disappointment that 
President Trump intends to pull the United States out of the historic 
Paris climate agreement. This agreement is a powerful symbol of 
America's strength and global leadership. It promised a bright future 
for our Nation and the world powered by clean energy.
  America was poised to lead that clean energy revolution. Instead, the 
world is now making plans to move ahead without us. Jobs will be 
created without us. New industries will be born and new innovative 
technologies manufactured without us. If we stick with this President's 
decision, America will be on the outside looking in.

than 1,000 of America's most forward-thinking cities, States, 
universities, and businesses, including the cities of Albany, 
Schenectady, and Saratoga Springs, Union and Skidmore Colleges, and 
SUNY Albany. So are millions of our fellow Americans and communities in 
every single congressional district across our great Nation. Together, 
we will embrace the climate economy, even if our President does not.
  President Trump's decision is a scar on America's image, but the 
American people will continue to demand leadership on reducing carbon 
pollution. Our children and our grandchildren are counting on us. Let's 
not fail them.
