                CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF CASCADE, IDAHO

 Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins 
me today in honoring the city of Cascade, ID, in its 100th year since 
its incorporation.
  One hundred years ago, Cascade got its start as a prime location 
along the railroad tracks that crossed Valley County, ID, and developed 
into the county seat. Cascade became a central place for transporting 
the timber harvested nearby to area sawmills and a hub for mining. Like 
its neighbors in other parts of Valley County, Cascade has faced booms 
and downturns in the logging, mining, and agriculture sectors, with 
resilience and ingenuity. The beauty of the local landscapes and 
natural resources continue to attract recreation and other outdoor 
activities to this picturesque community, and residents embody the 
industriousness and warmth at the heart of the community and its 
historical roots. Cascade's chamber of commerce aptly highlights 
Cascade's ``scenic beauty, fresh mountain air, warm friendly people and 
unlimited recreational activities.'' It is truly a treasure of our 
great State.
  Congratulations to the residents of Cascade on 100 years of 
accomplishments in developing Cascade that is a wonderful home and 
destination to so many. We wish you well as you continue to work for 
the advancement of this great community and its residents.
