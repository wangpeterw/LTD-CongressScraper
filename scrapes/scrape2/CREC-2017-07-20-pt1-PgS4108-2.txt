                            VOTE EXPLANATION

 Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, due to a family related matter in 
Michigan, I was unable to attend today's rollcall vote on the 
nomination of John K. Bush to be a United States circuit judge for the 
Sixth Circuit. Had I been able to attend, I would have opposed his 
nomination.
  I also was unable to attend today's rollcall vote on the motion to 
invoke cloture on the nomination of David Bernhardt to be Deputy 
Secretary of the Interior. Had I been able to attend, I would have 
voted no on the cloture motion.
