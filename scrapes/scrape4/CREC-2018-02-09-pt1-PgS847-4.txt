                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O Sovereign Lord, at this midnight hour, show us Your greatness. In 
these challenging days, be our strength and shield. No one is like You. 
Your way is perfect; Your promises prove true. You rescue those who 
look to You for protection. Great and mighty are Your words.
  Give wisdom to our lawmakers. Remind them how brief their time on 
Earth will be. Help them to see that they are moving shadows, who bring 
nothing into this world and will take nothing from it. Remind us all 
that time is fleeting, and our hearts, though stout and brave, continue 
to beat funeral marches to the grave. And so, Lord, where do we put our 
trust? Our hope is in You.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
