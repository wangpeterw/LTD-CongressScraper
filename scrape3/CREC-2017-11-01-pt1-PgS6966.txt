            35TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNKER'S THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Unker's Therapeutic 
Products for its 35th year in business. This is an impressive milestone 
for their organization.
  Unker's Therapeutic Products' story of starting out with Patrick 
Henry's hard work in his garage to being a staple in Wyoming and even 
sponsoring racecars is the embodiment of the American dream. I am 
pleased to hear of the company's success and of the plans to continue 
this business for years to come. Unker's Therapeutic Products provides 
both good jobs and much-needed services to the people of our towns and 
communities. It is greatly appreciated. Good businesses make for 
strongly knit communities, and that helps us all.
  President and CEO Patricia Pendelton and all the folks at Unker's 
Therapeutic Products can be very proud they have served Weston County 
and the State of Wyoming for so long. Their hard work and determined 
effort have played a part in its current and continued success.
  I extend my best wishes and congratulations to Patricia and to 
everyone who is a part of this company.
  Thank you.
