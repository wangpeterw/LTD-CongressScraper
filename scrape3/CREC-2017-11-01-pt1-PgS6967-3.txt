            40TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMRO FABRICATING CORPORATION

 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize 
AMRO Fabricating Corporation for 40 years of business in our State. 
AMRO, a small family-owned business based in El Monte and Riverside, 
CA, employs more than 250 people. The company has made important 
contributions to NASA rocket programs, including building the large 
aluminum panels for the space launch system rocket and the Orion crew 
capsule. AMRO has used State and Federal grants to train high school 
and college students on how to develop critical job skills, such as 
aerospace welding and engineering, preparing them for good-paying jobs 
in the future. Founded in 1977, AMRO marks its 40th anniversary this 
year. I extend my warmest congratulations to AMRO for achieving this 
milestone.
