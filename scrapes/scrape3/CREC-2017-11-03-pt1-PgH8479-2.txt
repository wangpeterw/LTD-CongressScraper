      HONORING FRANK DOOLITTLE, CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL RECIPIENT

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Frank Doolittle 
of Bainbridge, New York. At 104 years old, Frank will be awarded the 
Nation's highest honor for a civilian, the Congressional Gold Medal for 
his service in the Civil Air Patrol.
  At a pivotal time in our Nation's history, Frank dedicated himself to 
service here at home. In 1944, in the midst of World War II, Frank 
volunteered to join the Civil Air Patrol squadron in Sidney, New York. 
His unit was active and often tasked with finding C-47s that went down 
in the Northeast.
  In addition to being on call 24 hours a day, Frank taught classes 
ranging from navigation to meteorology 3 nights a week. During World 
War II, members patrolled the country's coastline from Maine to Mexico, 
watching for enemy submarines and potential saboteurs while conducting 
search and rescue missions.
  On Saturday, November 11, Veterans Day, I will have the distinct 
honor of presenting Mr. Doolittle with the Congressional Gold Medal. 
Since 1776, only 300 of these medals have been awarded. I ask everyone 
to join me today in thanking Frank Doolittle and all serving the Civil 
Air Patrol for their service and dedication to our country.
