                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, our hope for years to come, so much seems to be 
happening in our Nation and world. Lord, we pray for those affected by 
the latest London terror attack, for the families of those killed 
aboard the USS Fitzgerald, for the police who were attacked in Paris, 
and for those recovering from last week's baseball field shooting.
  Let Your peace stay with us all during these turbulent times. 
Surround our lawmakers with Your favor, enabling them to believe that 
You will empower them to persevere through every challenge, as they 
trust You to bring them to Your desired destination. May they not lose 
confidence in the power of Your everlasting arms as You continue to 
give them a moral and ethical resilience that will not shrink in the 
heat of testing.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
