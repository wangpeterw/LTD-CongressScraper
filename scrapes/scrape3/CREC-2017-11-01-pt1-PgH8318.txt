              MAKING IN ORDER CONSIDERATION OF H. RES. 599

  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it be in 
order at any time to consider H. Res. 599 in the House, if called up by 
the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or his designee; that the 
resolution be considered as read; that the previous question be 
considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble to adoption 
without intervening motion or demand for division of the question 
except for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by 
Representative Royce of California and Representative Khanna of 
California or their respective designees; and that notwithstanding any 
previous order of the House, the provisions of section 7 of the War 
Powers Resolution, 50 U.S.C. 1546, shall not apply to H. Con. Res. 81.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Washington?
  There was no objection.
