                    REMEMBERING OFFICER JUSTIN BILLA

  (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Mobile 
Police Officer Justin Billa. Officer Billa was tragically shot and 
killed in the line of duty on February 20.
  I am not sure my path ever crossed with Officer Billa, but it may 
have. We take for granted the work our police officers do on a daily 
basis.
  Police officers hug their families good-bye and leave their home each 
day or night not knowing whether they will come home safe.
  Each and every day, our law enforcement and first responders work to 
keep us safe and support our communities, but we far too often take 
their service for granted.
  I can think of no better way to honor the life of Officer Billa than 
to encourage every American to take time to say ``thank you'' to your 
local police officers.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope Officer Billa's wife, Erin, and their young son, 
Taylor, take comfort in knowing that they are loved. Justin's service 
and sacrifice to Mobile, Alabama, and to the United States will never 
be forgotten.
