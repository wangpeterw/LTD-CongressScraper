                                 PRAYER

  Rabbi Sanford D. Akselrad, Congregation Ner Tamid, Henderson, Nevada, 
offered the following prayer:
  O source of wisdom, gathered before this august body, I ask Your 
blessings upon us.
  Decisions impacting the fate of our country weigh heavily upon our 
leaders. They stand here with backs bowed, eyes turned downward, 
shoulders formed into an amorphous shrug.
  I pray, therefore, that You will grant our leaders strength to stand 
tall.
  With eyes raised skyward, seeing today, tomorrow, and the next, let 
them govern our country with compassion, courage, and insight.
  Let them stand tall to give voice to those who feel unheard and 
presence to those too long ignored.
  Let the pursuit of justice and mercy lift them with heavenly wings, 
closer still to Heaven than before.
  Let them stand tall.
  Amen.
