       Whereas the theme for National Alcohol and Drug Addiction 
     Recovery Month in 2017 is ``Join the Voices for Recovery:

     of substance use disorder and the critical importance and

       (2) recognizing the possibility of recovery from substance 
     use disorder in this and every month; and
       (3) honoring and celebrating--
       (A) the achievements of the more than 25,000,000 people of 
     the United States who are in recovery from substance use

     those people.
