      MORRISVILLE 12U SOFTBALL TEAM WINS PENNSYLVANIA STATE TITLE

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Morrisville 
12U Softball Team. These incredible young athletes from our district 
won the Pennsylvania State title and advanced to the regional 
tournament in Bristol, Connecticut, to represent the entire State of 
Pennsylvania. Not only did these young ladies play an incredible 
season, of which they should be extremely proud, they did so while 
honoring a member of our community.
  The team dedicated their postseason play to the memory of Ms. Donna 
Rossi, a committed league volunteer and supporter who passed away 
following a battle with cancer shortly before the first district game.

  Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of the accomplishments of these young 
ladies: Ainsley McClure; Rowan Mulholland; Katey Brennan; Molly 
Milewski; Ella Visco; Laney Freiband; Caitlyn Martell; Ahlana Sesar; 
Quinn McGonigle; Emma Hause; Riley Mahony; Hannah Hawkes; Brielle 
Crawford; and managers and coaches Joe Sesar, Andy Mahony, and Tim 
Hawkes.
  Each one of these individuals should be proud of the example they 
have set both on and off the field. They do credit to themselves, to 
their families, and to our community, and we are so proud of them.
