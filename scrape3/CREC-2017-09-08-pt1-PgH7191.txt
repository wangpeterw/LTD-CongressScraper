                            Motion to Concur

  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion.
  The text of the motion is as follows:

       Mr. Frelinghuysen of New Jersey moves that the House concur 
     in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate 
     amendment to H.R. 601.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 509, the motion 
shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.
  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.


                             General Leave

  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous material during consideration of 
H.R. 601, and that I may include tabular material on the same.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New Jersey?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present a Senate amendment to H.R. 601. 
As Texas and Louisiana begin the first steps of recovery from Hurricane 
Harvey, Congress must ensure that the funding is available to meet the 
short- and long-term needs of the hundreds of thousands of victims of 
that terrible storm. As we are all seeing unfold before our eyes, the 
next hurricanes could cause even more terrible devastation. This 
legislation is the first step in what will be long and difficult 
recoveries.
  As our fellow Americans recover and rebuild their lives, we must come 
together to support the victims, the volunteers, the first responders 
on the ground from around the Nation, and Congress must ensure that the 
Federal Government provides the help they need.
  With FEMA resources running low and Hurricane Irma on Florida's and 
the South's door, providing this additional funding is even more 
critical. As I said before, our committee is ready and willing to 
address any additional funding needs that may arise as a result of 
Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and other major disasters.
  In addition to providing this desperately needed emergency aid, this 
bill also extends funding for the entire Federal Government operations 
until December 8 of this year. This continuing resolution will ensure 
that the Federal Government remains open for business and that 
important programs and services are maintained beyond the end of the 
fiscal year on the 30th of this month.
  While I don't believe that a continuing resolution is the best way to 
fund our government, it is imperative to give us time to go to 
conference and complete our 12 full-year appropriations bills with the 
Senate. It is essential that all of these bills be signed into law and 
that our Nation avoids the uncertainty caused by a threat of a 
shutdown.
  In addition, the bill also contains a short-term increase in the 
Federal debt limit and a reauthorization of the National Flood 
Insurance Program.
  All of these actions will allow for more certainty and stability for 
the Nation and for the communities and families suffering from these 
disasters.
  I urge my colleagues--and may I say I do that knowing that I have the 
full support of my ranking member, Mrs. Lowey, who I have had the 
pleasure of working with.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes, and I rise in 
support of providing critical emergency relief to respond to the 
catastrophic damages wreaked by Hurricane Harvey and the expectation of 
damages from Hurricane Irma.
  And I also want to acknowledge the cooperation and the good will 
extended to us by Chairman Frelinghuysen. It is a pleasure for me to 
work with him as well.
  My thoughts and prayers remain with all those whose families, lives, 
homes, and businesses have been upended by these disasters. This 
Congress and the American people are with you in your time of need.
  I am pleased this package provides a temporary suspension of the 
Federal debt limit to prevent a catastrophic debt default and a 
continuing resolution extending Federal funding through December 8. As 
in 2013 and 2015, when faced with government funding deadlines and 
impending sequestration, we must use the time until the CR expires to 
develop a new budget agreement with realistic caps on defense and 
nondefense discretionary spending.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter) who is the chairman of the 
Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations.
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
supplemental bill for Hurricane Harvey relief. This bill will provide 
$15.3 billion in emergency funding, including $7.4 billion for FEMA's 
Disaster Relief Fund, $7.4 billion for Community Development Block 
Grants to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and $350 
million to support the Small Business Administration's Disaster Loan 
Program to assist small business and homeowners.
  This supplemental bill is not only a critical first step to provide 
basic needs of food, shelter, and water for those in immediate need, 
but it also provides initial funding to begin the process of rebuilding 
and recovery for those communities devastated by Hurricane Harvey.
  Further resources and hard work will be required. I will continue to 
work closely alongside my colleagues and the Appropriations Committee 
to meet the present and emerging needs of our neighbors across the 
Southeast. My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by these 
devastating storms.
  This bill addresses the urgent needs of those affected by Hurricane 
Harvey. It sends a powerful message to all that we are here for them 
and we will be working hard for them throughout the recovery. Mr. 
Speaker, I strongly encourage a vote on this bill.
  As an aside, I grew up in Houston, Texas. I was born there, I grew up 
there. I remember floods, but I never remember floods that washed away 
people's homes and their livelihood. This is a once-in-a-lifetime 
situation down there, may we all pray, and it is time to get it done.

  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the supplemental 
appropriations for disaster relief, and I

[[Page H7195]]

thank the appropriators and all of my colleagues. I reflect on the 
bipartisan meeting of our Texas delegation. We said we would not be 
divided and we would not be divided amongst our friends from Florida 
and those who may be in need with Hurricane Irma.
  I do want to acknowledge that when we got up that Sunday morning and 
12 inches had fallen at that time, part of the 50 inches of the most 
catastrophic storm on the Continental United States, Hurricane Harvey, 
we saw the lives of people disappear--some who died, some who were in 
shelters as these pictures depict. The road to recovery is going to be 
long.
  I introduced a $174 billion hurricane appropriations bill to be able 
to address Hurricane Harvey. I am grateful for the $15.3 billion that 
gives us money for housing. That is the greatest need, along with the 
infrastructure, and if we can begin to expedite those dollars into our 
cities and counties, our mayors and county leaders will be grateful.
  There are people who are homeless now, there are people whose homes 
are in despair, there are people who do not have insurance. The reason 
is because these individuals were flooded in a 500-year flood area and 
1,000-year flood area. It is important to note at the same time, Mr. 
Speaker, that these individuals are elderly and disabled.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 601, which provides 
$15.3 billion in supplemental appropriations as the Congress's initial 
response to the massive damage inflicted on Southeast Texas and 
Louisiana by Hurricane Harvey and authorizes appropriations to continue 
funding for federal government operations through December 8, 2017.
  The legislation also suspends the current $19.8 trillion limit on 
federal borrowing through December 8, 2017, which will enable the 
Treasury to continue to borrow money to pay bills, and set the new debt 
limit as the amount reflecting all outstanding U.S. debt as of December 
9, 2017.
  I also strongly support the legislation before us because it extends 
through December 8, 2017, FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program 
(NFIP), which offers insurance policies to property owners in areas 
with significant flood risks.
  The bill authorizes FEMA to borrow as much as $30.4 billion from the 
Treasury general fund if it does not collect sufficient revenue from 
premiums and surcharges to cover claims payments.
  Without this extension, FEMA would not be able to issue new flood 
insurance policies after September 30, 2017, and its borrowing 
authority will be reduced to $1.5 billion.
  That would be particularly devastating to many of the constituents I 
represent who have or will be seeking flood insurance policies under 
the FEMA Flood Insurance Program.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the bipartisan leadership of both 
chambers for the speed with which the Hurricane Harvey relief package 
and the FY2018 Continuing Resolution was negotiated, drafted, and 
shepherded to the floor.
  This bodes well for the major challenges that must be met and 
overcome if the victims of Hurricane Harvey are to recover from the 
storm's awful wrath and rebuild their decimated communities.
  I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and Speaker 
Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi, and their Senate counterparts 
because this initial Hurricane Harvey aid package sends a strong signal 
to the people of Texas and Louisiana that the American people stand in 
solidarity with them in their moment of heartbreak and anguish.
  On Wednesday, September 6, 2017, the House approved $7.85 billion for 
relief efforts in Texas and Louisiana, consisting of $7.4 billion for 
the FEMA Disaster Recovery Fund (DRF) and $450 million for the SBA 
Disaster Loan program.
  To this amount the Senate added $7.4 billion in funds to be 
distributed to states and communities through HUD's Community 
Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.
  These CDBG funds can be used for disaster relief, long-term recovery, 
infrastructure restoration, housing, and economic revitalization.
  FEMA's DRF funding is mostly allocated for three programs:
  1. Public Assistance Program, which helps communities cover the costs 
of repairing and replacing public buildings, infrastructure, and 
utilities, as well as emergency costs for debris removal and other 
needs;
  2. Individual Assistance Program, which provides funding for 
temporary housing, property repairs, medical treatment, moving costs, 
and other needs; and
  3. Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which offers funding to reduce 
damages from future disasters.
  Typically, FEMA covers 75 percent of the costs for DRF-funded 
projects so I am very pleased that the President agreed that in the 
unprecedented circumstances of this case, a higher reimbursement level 
was warranted and acceded to my request that FEMA be authorized and 
directed to reimburse Harris County and other affected local 
governments 90% for debris removal, including direct Federal 
assistance; and 100% percent for emergency protective measures for 30 
days from the start of the incident period and at 90% thereafter.
  Mr. Speaker, it is not an exaggeration to regard as unprecedented the 
damage wrought on Southeast Texas by Hurricane Harvey beginning 14 days 
ago, on August 25, 2017, when it made landfall for the first time in 
the state of Texas, just north of the city of Corpus Christi.
  Before it was finished, Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons 
of rainfall on Texas and Louisiana, most of it on the Houston 
Metroplex.
  To put in perspective the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey, 
the volume of water that fell on Houston and other affected areas of 
Texas and Louisiana could fill more than 24,000 Astrodomes or supply 
the water for the raging Niagara Falls for 15 days.
  Whole sections of Houston, Beaumont, Bayou City, Port Arthur, and 
other cities were underwater for days.
  Hurricane Harvey was a 1,000 year storm that has to date claimed the 
lives of at least 30 persons, including a 34-year veteran of the 
Houston Police Department and a family of six who perished in Greens 
Bayou while trying to evacuate their flooded home and community.
  It also claimed the life of a Dreamer, Alonso Guillen, a young 
Houstonian who came to Texas from Mexico as a teenager, and who died 
when his boat capsized while he was rescuing survivors of the flooding 
caused by Hurricane Harvey.
  Neither Houston nor any city in the nation has ever experienced 
flooding of the magnitude caused by Hurricane Harvey.
  The statistics are staggering.
  21 trillion gallons of rainfall fell in Texas and Louisiana in the 
first five days of the storm.
  The estimated maximum sustained winds exceeded 130 miles per hour as 
the hurricane made landfall near Rockport, Texas on August 25.
  A record 4,323 days, which is nearly 12 years, elapsed since a major 
hurricane (Category 3 or above) made landfall in the United States 
prior to Hurricane Harvey; the last Category 3 hurricane to hit the 
United States was Hurricane Wilma in 2005, the same year Hurricane 
Katrina destroyed much of New Orleans.
  The city of Cedar Bayou received 51.88 inches of rainfall, breaking 
the record for rainfall from a single storm in the continental United 
States; my city of Houston received more than 50 inches of rainfall.
  More than 13,000 people have been rescued in the Houston area and 
more than 30,000 persons are expected to be forced out of their homes 
due to the storm.
  More than 8,800 federal personnel were staff deployed to help respond 
to Hurricane Harvey, supplying approximately 2.9 million meals, 2.8 
million liters of water, 37,000 tarps, and 130 generators.
  In the first three days of the storm, more than 49,000 homes that had 
suffered flood damage and more than 1,000 homes were completely 
destroyed in the storm.
  And today, two weeks later, thousands of Texans are still without 
permanent and stable housing situations.
  That is why the additional $7.4 billion in CDBG funding provided in 
the legislation is desperately needed.
  Mr. Speaker, valiant emergency responders in my state worked to 
exhaustion, with an invaluable assist from citizen volunteers, to 
rescue their neighbors and save lives.
  That is who Texans are and this is what we do.
  We do not yet know the full cost in human lives exacted by Hurricane 
Harvey.
  But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction 
will far exceed any natural disaster in memory; best estimates place 
the cost in the range of $150-$200 billion.
  Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of 
Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm 
that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey.
  That is why I strongly support the legislation pending before us 
appropriating $15.3 billion as the initial response of the Congress to 
the damage caused by an epic storm.
  I must emphasize that what we are considering here is the initial 
response because much more funding will be needed for Houston--the 
nation's fourth largest city--and Southeast Texas to recover and 
rebuild.
  And it is also why I have introduced, joined by more than 40 House 
colleagues, H.R. 3686, the Hurricane Sandy Supplemental Appropriations 
Act, which, when passed by Congress and signed into law, would provide 
$174 billion in aid to assist the areas affected by

[[Page H7196]]

Hurricane Harvey recover, rebuild, and restore their communities to 
their previous greatness.
  I urge all Members to join me in support of H.R. 601 and to commit to 
providing our fellow Americans in Texas and Louisiana all of the help 
and support they need to restore their communities to their previous 
greatness.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. Neal).
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, as I stand in support of this legislation, it is 
important to acknowledge that it not only addresses the needs of the 
residents who are cleaning up after Harvey, but it ensures that we will 
also avoid a first-ever default on the full faith and credit of the 
United States.

                              {time}  1000

  What is important about this moment is the following: We are adhering 
to what is known as the national principle, and the national principle 
means that, if there is an earthquake in California, we rise to the aid 
of the people of California. If there is a hurricane in Texas, we rise 
to the aid of the people in Texas. If there is a tornado in 
Springfield, Massachusetts, as there was a few years ago, we all come 
to the aid of the people of Springfield, Massachusetts. If there were 
horrific forest fires in the State of Alabama, as happened a few years 
ago, we all come to the aid of the people of Alabama.
  Now, why is that important? Because we don't check gender, and we 
don't check race, and we don't say: Is it a blue State or a red State 
or what is the political affiliation of those who are affected?
  Instead, we say: The national principle ensures that this is about 
the American family in moments of great challenge and great difficulty, 
and we don't use the opportunity to remind people of what the budget 
might look like at that moment. Instead, we come to their assistance 
and we figure out how to pay for it later on.
  So on this occasion, there is a very important consideration that is 
married, and it includes the idea that, with the Trump administration 
and congressional Republicans and Democrats on this side, we are going 
to not only do what we are supposed to do in terms of raising the 
national debt, but we will come to the assistance of members of the 
American family, as I, a moment ago, described.
  Now, let me point out something else as well. We need to stop playing 
games with the national debt limit. We had tax cuts here in 2001 and 
2003 that cut Federal revenue to 15 percent of gross domestic product, 
despite the fact that the historic postwar norm average is closer to 
17.5 percent. Actually, in some of those years before that, it rose to 
18.5 cents on the dollar--a reasonable expenditure. But instead, as 
those numbers slipped to 15 percent, the argument became somehow that 
it was about future payments.
  The argument over the debt limit is about expenses incurred, what we 
have obligated ourselves to with veterans benefits, a war in 
Afghanistan, a war in Iraq. And even though I voted against the war in 
Iraq, we need to come to the aid of those veterans and those veterans 
hospitals, and we need to come to the assistance of those 1 million new 
veterans who were created because of it. And again, not asking 
questions, is it a blue State expenditure? is it a red State 
expenditure? It is about the national principle.
  The idea that we would cast doubt on the full faith and credit of the 
United States to earn a few political points and to try to convince 
people that this is about future spending, it is not about future 
spending. This is about the credit card having come due for, in most 
instances, reasonable expenditures, not the least of which includes the 
obligations we have to Social Security, Medicare, and our senior 
citizens.
  So this agreement that we have rendered today is a reasonable and 
sensible bipartisan achievement, and we should use this as an example 
and as a template for what we might do going forward to address many of 
the challenges that are going to confront the American people.
  And be assured of this: Whether it is in Florida or it is in Houston, 
the expenditure requirements here are going to bulge, and we should not 
be dismissive of that. So raise the debt limit and come to the aid of 
the American family today.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of H.R. 601 to 
move funds quickly to those in need, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I support providing immediate emergency 
assistance for those affected by recent natural disasters and was glad 
to vote for such a bill earlier this week. I believe that raising the 
debt limit for only three months is a mistake because it does not 
provide the certainty that financial markets and our economy need.
  But most concerning to me, and the reason I am voting against this 
bill, is that it forces our military to operate under a stopgap 
continuing resolution--once again.
  Continuing resolutions do enormous, lasting damage to the American 
military. We are witnessing an alarming increase in accidents, growing 
evidence of a force under stress, and an eroding technological position 
when compared with our adversaries. Not only does this bill fail to 
remedy those problems, it makes them worse.
  This bill, like other CRs, allows no new starts--the Pentagon must 
spend the same money on the same things as last year. But the world is 
not standing still. In fact, the threats from North Korea and others 
grow every day. Yet, this CR prevents us from responding.
  The Constitution places on Congress the responsibility to ``raise and 
support'', ``provide and maintain'' the military forces of the United 
States. It is morally wrong for our nation to send brave men and women 
out on mission--even routine training or operations--without the very 
best equipment, the very best training, the very best support our 
country can provide. The dysfunction in the budget process has meant 
that we have not provided them with the best and that we have not been 
meeting our responsibilities. This bill is more of the same.
  There is plenty of blame to go around between both parties and both 
the Executive and Legislative branches of government. But this 
negligence must stop. We must fulfill our duty. We must do better.
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
hundreds of thousands of victims of Hurricane Harvey in Houston and 
Harris County and all along the Texas Gulf Coast, and urge Congress to 
immediately pass the $15.25 billion dollar emergency aid bill before us 
today.
  For six days, the Texas Gulf Coast was hammered by Hurricane Harvey, 
bringing destruction beyond anything witnessed in living memory in our 
state.
  The storm dropped four feet of rain on Greater Houston. Over 100,000 
homes and residences were flooded in Harris County alone. Authorities 
believe at least 70 Texans were killed due to Harvey, and that number 
will continue to rise.
  Houstonians and Texans are a proud and independent people. We take 
pride in our can-do attitude, as witnessed by our brave first 
responders and countless volunteers who rescued neighbors during the 
worst of the flooding.
  Full recovery from this unprecedented disaster will take years, but 
right now we need Congress to pass this emergency relief bill that will 
help the people of Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast sustain current 
relief efforts and onto the road to recovery.
  God bless America and God bless Texas.
