     United States and ASEAN can help realize their common vision 
     of a peaceful, prosperous, rules-based Asia-Pacific region 
     that offers security, opportunity, and dignity to all of its 
     citizens;
       Whereas ASEAN's 10 members, taken collectively, are the 7th

     product of $2,400,000,000,000, and represent the United 
     States' fourth-largest export market with total two-way trade 
     in goods and services reaching $254,000,000,000, allowing

     total shipped tonnage transiting through ASEAN's waters each 
     year;
       Whereas ASEAN, taken collectively, is one of the fastest 
     growing economies in Asia after China and India, expanding by 
     66 percent since 2006 and exceeding the global growth average 
     for the past ten years;
       Whereas the ASEAN Economic Community aims to create one of 
     the largest single market economies in the world,

     among its member states;

       Whereas the United States is the largest investor in 
     Southeast Asia, with total foreign direct investment stock of 
     nearly $273,500,000,000 in 2014, creating millions of jobs in

     increased more than any other region's investment in the past 
     decade;
       Whereas the United States has helped ASEAN create a Single

     and capacity building;
       Whereas the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the 
     South China Sea (DOC) was signed by all members of ASEAN and 
     the People's Republic of China (PRC) on November 4, 2002, 
     committing ASEAN and the PRC to ``exercise self-restraint in 
     the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate 
     disputes and affect peace and stability,'' and reaffirming 
     that ``the adoption of a code of conduct in the South China 
     Sea would further promote peace and stability in the region 
     and agree to work, on the basis of consensus, toward the 
     eventual attainment of this objective'';
       Whereas the leaders of the United States and ASEAN, at 
     their Special Leaders Summit in Sunnylands, California on 
     February 16, 2016, reaffirmed their shared commitment to 
     maintain peace, security, and stability in the region and 
     ensure maritime security and safety, including by respecting

     Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar and Typhoon Haiyan in the 
     Philippines, as well as the impacts that climate-caused ocean 
     acidification has had on fish stocks, coral resources, and 
     coastal agriculture, providing stark evidence of the 
     destructive impacts on the region;
       Whereas conservation and sustainable management of forests

     the 40th anniversary of the United States' diplomatic 
     relationship with ASEAN, noting that the United States-ASEAN 
     relationship ``without a doubt has benefitted both ASEAN and 
     America--diplomatically, economically, and from the 
     standpoint of national security'';
       Whereas, on this visit, Vice President Pence pledged that 
     the United States would ``redouble our cooperation with ASEAN 
     on issues of regional security'' and continue to support 
     ``increased information sharing and security efforts to 
     protect our people and our way of life across the ASEAN 
     region and across the wider world,'' and ``continue to work 
     closely with ASEAN to promote peace and stability in the 
     South China Sea by upholding a rules-based order, ensuring 
     the lawful and unimpeded flow of commerce, and encouraging 
     the peaceful and diplomatic resolution of disputes'';
       Whereas, on this visit, Vice President Pence remarked that 
     ``by strengthening our economic ties, the United States and 
     ASEAN member nations can foster jobs, prosperity, and growth 
     in new and unprecedented ways'' and that ``American exports 
     to ASEAN member nations already support more than 550,000 
     jobs in the United States, and almost 42,000 U.S. companies
