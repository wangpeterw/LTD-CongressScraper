                            HURRICANE HARVEY

  (Mr. CARTER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Harvey took a lot away from us, but 
it couldn't take away who we are as Texans. It has shown our resilience 
and brought our communities closer together as we rebuild.
  I am very proud of our volunteers and first responders who have shown 
hospitality and heroism to support our neighbors in need. When disaster 
struck, Texans came from across the State to help our communities 
rebuild and recover from this storm.
  In my district, central Texans set up evacuation shelters and donated 
clothing and other necessary supplies. Our soldiers at Fort Hood and 
our local fire and rescue teams headed southeast to assist in 
lifesaving recovery missions because that is what Texans do: we come 
together to support one another.
  I know we will continue to work together as we rebuild after Harvey 
and in the face of anything that comes our way.
  By the way, a great big Texas thank-you to all our neighbors from 
across the United States who also came to help.
  Our hearts go out to those recovering disaster areas in Florida, 
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and all other communities in need 
of help. Let's do it together.
  God bless Texas.
