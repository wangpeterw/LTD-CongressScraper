                         CUT FRIVOLOUS SPENDING

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on September 12, 2017, I released a statement 
to mark and recognize that the national debt had just exceeded $20 
trillion.
  I asked my colleagues to follow through with our commitment to reduce 
expenditures and create economic stability for our future. Since that 
date, Congress has not taken any action to reduce our deficit or to 
balance our budget. Instead, we have increased our budget caps to 
augment Federal spending by more than 10 percent above current levels.
  We suspended our debt ceiling, and this week we are preparing to pass 
our seventh short-term spending bill of the fiscal year. Our grossly 
negligent spending habits continue with no end in sight. At this rate, 
I am certain that we will see a $22 trillion national debt sometime 
around the first of next year.
  Mr. Speaker, this fiscal irresponsibility is not what we promised our 
constituents. We are directly contributing to the bankruptcy of this 
Nation that we will leave to our grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, I beg my colleagues to honor the pledge to cut our 
spending and reduce our debt before it is too late. We must act now 
before we cross another trillion-dollar threshold.
