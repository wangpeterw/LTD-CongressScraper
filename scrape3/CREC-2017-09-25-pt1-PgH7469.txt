  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.


                             General Leave

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Florida?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3819, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017.
  H.R. 3819 would extend a number of authorities impacting veterans' 
benefits, health, and homeless programs. Swift passage of this 
legislation today would ensure that many programs that veterans, their 
caregivers, dependents, and survivors rely on continue. We must 
continue these programs.
  Mr. Speaker, the programs include nursing home care, support services 
for caregivers, transportation, child care assistance, adaptive sports 
programs, and housing and home loan services, to name just a few. So 
important. Again, these are not new programs, but they are so very 
important to our true heroes.
  The costs associated with them have been assumed in the House-passed 
appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018 and 2019 advance 
appropriation.
  One program that has been extended for just 5 additional months, 
until January 6, 2018, is the assisted living pilot program for 
veterans with traumatic brain injury. That short extension would allow 
extra time for the VA to fully transition the veterans currently 
participating in that program into other existing programs more 
suitable for their ongoing support and rehabilitation.
  H.R. 3819 would also make a number of technical corrections to the 
Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017.
  This bill was drafted by and has full bipartisan support of both the 
majority and the minority Veterans' Affairs Committee members of the 
House and the Senate.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 
3819 today, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3819, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017. I want to thank the 
gentleman from Florida for his hard work on this, as the entire 
committee did.
  H.R. 3819, as the gentleman said, makes sure that some of the vital 
programs we have in place to provide for our veterans continue past the 
end of the fiscal year and continue to help our veterans.
  Included in this bill are provisions related to their healthcare, 
their benefits, homeless veterans, and other related issues.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support extending programs related to 
the support for caregivers, childcare for certain veterans receiving 
healthcare, and the pilot program on counseling in retreat settings for 
women veterans newly separated from service.
  It also has provisions to extend the authority related to 
rehabilitation and vocational benefits to members of our Armed Forces 
with severe injuries or illnesses, homeless veterans reintegration 
programs, homeless women veterans, and homeless veterans with children, 
and providing housing assistance and counseling to homeless and at-risk 
veterans.
  Also included are extensions of authority for programs to help 
disabled veterans as well as authority to enter into agreements with 
the National Academy of Sciences to review the research on links 
between diseases and dioxin exposure. This is a critical step in 
creating any new Agent Orange presumptions that still may be there. 
Both of these provisions are critical in helping our aging Vietnam 
veterans as well, as we move forward.
  The final section contains, as the gentleman said, a technical fix to 
the Forever GI Bill, an important piece of legislation once again 
crafted in a bipartisan manner with the help of our veterans service 
organizations and passed earlier this year. The correction will simply 
help make VA implement the law correctly, and all sides agree it must 
become law as quickly as possible.
  Mr. Speaker, in short, this bill that both the majority and the 
minority support, we all agree it must be signed into law as soon as 
possible.
  Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge my fellow Members to support its 
passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1745

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Mast), a true American hero and a combat veteran.

[[Page H7472]]

  

  Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Florida for 
the time.
  Without action from Congress, the authority for the VA Secretary to 
carry out many essential activities that are critical to helping our 
veterans will expire.
  I get my healthcare from the VA. I get it alongside a great number of 
my best friends in life, and I can tell you, my favorite part about 
going to the VA in West Palm Beach, Florida, is when I meet one of my 
fellow veterans in the lobby. It might be a veteran from World War II, 
Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf war, Iraq, or Afghanistan, and the first thing 
that we do with one another is we jab at one another about the 
different branch that the other person served in: Army, Navy, Marines, 
Air Force, Coast Guard. But after that, it gets back to the very 
serious work that we are all at the VA to have completed.
  The heroic men and women that I have had the honor of fighting 
alongside have earned--they have earned; that is the most important 
word, they have earned--the very best care that our country has to 
offer. But without this immediate action from Congress, veterans could 
lose those benefits--healthcare, support for the homeless, and many 
other provisions--and this is absolutely unacceptable.
  This bill, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities 
Act of 2017, does everything that was already mentioned, which is 
extremely important. It extends the number of expiring authorities to 
include nursing home support, support for our caregivers, support for 
transportation, childcare assistance, adaptive sports programs, housing 
and home loan services.
  This legislation also makes some important technical changes that 
will aid the VA's implementation of the Forever GI Bill, a critical 
priority for ensuring that as many veterans as possible can use that 
important program.
  This is the definition of must-pass legislation. I urge my colleagues 
to pass this commonsense legislation.
  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his 
strong words, for his commitment and service to this country, and I 
appreciate his support on this piece of legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Takano), my good friend, the vice ranking member of the full Committee 
on Veterans' Affairs.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 3819, which 
reauthorizes several essential veterans' programs that support the men 
and women who have served our Nation. These programs include assistance 
and support services for caregivers who so often make profound 
sacrifices to support their loved ones, grants to our vital veterans 
service organizations so they can continue providing transportation for 
rural veterans to help connect them with the services they need, and 
programs to reintegrate homeless veterans which offer opportunities for 
meaningful employment and address the complex challenges they face.
  This bill reauthorizes specialized counseling for women veterans. 
This is particularly important in light of the stunning VA report 
released this month which showed that female veterans are six times 
more likely to die by suicide than any other women.
  These programs are fundamental to the well-being of our veterans and 
their families, and they are a reflection of our gratitude to those who 
serve.
  In addition, this legislation makes important technical changes that 
will allow us to follow through on the promises of the new GI Bill, 
which we passed unanimously earlier this year. Specifically, H.R. 3819 
allows us to correct the perverse incentives that discourage veterans 
from attending local community colleges and universities, which is a 
provision I worked on with my Republican colleague, Congressman Paul 
Cook.
  It also allows for the restoration of benefits for veterans left 
stranded by the abrupt closure of for-profit colleges, which I 
championed with Republican Luke Messer.
  After the closures of ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, student 
veterans in my district and across the country were left with 
nontransferable credits, depleted benefits, and none of the job 
opportunities that they were promised. By restoring their tuition and 
housing benefits, we are restoring a measure of justice for these 
veterans and restoring their opportunity to get the education they 
deserve and earned.
  Taken together, the reauthorization of vital programs and the 
technical fixes included in this bill should earn the support of every 
Member.
  I want to thank Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and my colleagues 
on the Veterans' Affairs Committee for ensuring that veterans can 
continue to rely on these critical programs, and I am once again 
grateful for the bipartisanship that has defined our work on behalf of 
America's veterans.
  In closing, I want to note that yesterday was Gold Star Mothers and 
Families Day, and while today we are taking action to support our 
veterans, we must also remember the men and women who never made it 
home.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support 
this must-pass legislation.
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), who is also a member of the Veterans' Affairs 
Committee.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act. This much-
needed legislation will drastically increase access to healthcare and 
support services for our veterans.
  Most importantly, this bill will help ensure continued access to 
proven programs to address veterans' homelessness, healthcare, and 
benefits. It also includes provisions to assist veteran caregivers, 
husbands, wives, parents, and children of veterans who righteously 
dedicate themselves to the care of their loved ones.
  Veterans and their families have made the ultimate sacrifice for our 
country, and we must uphold our promises to them. For too long, 
Congress has ignored the needs of today's veteran population. It is 
past time we focus on supporting our veterans, no matter when they 
served. The Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act 
addresses the priorities of today's population and ensures that the 
money follows the veterans.

  As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and a cosponsor 
of several of the stand-alone bills included in this package, I am 
proud to see the committee and the House of Representatives come 
together on behalf of these patriotic Americans who risked their lives 
for our safety.
  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I want to thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his support and work 
on the committee.
  Once again, the old saying is you shouldn't get a pat on the back for 
what you are supposed to do; but around here, it is harder than you 
might think, and I am incredibly grateful and proud.
  I want to thank the majority staff for their work on this piece of 
legislation, always including the minority staff, always including us 
in decisions, so that when we get to the floor, we bring a piece of 
bipartisan legislation that we can all support. It is must-pass 
legislation, and that is why it will pass today.
  I thank the gentleman from Florida for his continued leadership. We 
have been on this committee for over a decade together, and it seems 
like it is always that way, so I am grateful for that, grateful we are 
able to move this forward.
  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3819.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for 
his leadership and working in a bipartisan fashion always, and we 
always put our veterans first, so I appreciate that very much.
  Once again, Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 3819.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
