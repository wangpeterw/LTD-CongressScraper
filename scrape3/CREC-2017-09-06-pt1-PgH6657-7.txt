                    LET'S PASS BILL TO HELP DREAMERS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as early as March 6, 2018, hundreds of 
thousands of young immigrants, who are as American as you, could be 
forced to leave our great country.
  The United States is their home, and the DACA program has afforded 
these DREAMers the opportunity to come out of the shadows, work 
legally, and pursue their educational goals. They are buying homes, 
creating businesses, working in our schools and hospitals, and 
contributing to our economy. Simply put, they are active members of our 
community.
  Mr. Speaker, Congress can save these young Americans from 
deportations. I have introduced, along with my friend, Congresswoman 
Lucille Roybal-Allard, legislation that will ensure DREAMers can 
continue to fully participate in the American way of life and one day 
even become proud American citizens. The love for this country is 
already embedded in their hearts.
  There are other alternatives that we can pass, such as the RAC Act, 
sponsored by my good friend and Florida colleague, Congressman Curbelo; 
and the BRIDGE Act, sponsored by my friend, Congressman Coffman, that 
gives DREAMers a chance to continue to build their future.
  Congress has less than 6 months to act. The clock is ticking, Mr. 
Speaker. Let's do what is right and vote on these bills.
