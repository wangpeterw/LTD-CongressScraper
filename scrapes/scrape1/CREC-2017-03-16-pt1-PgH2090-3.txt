                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Andrew Chaney, First and Calvary Presbyterian Church, 
Springfield, Missouri, offered the following prayer:
  God, You are never far, but the busyness of each day makes You feel 
distant. Inner barricades block Your guidance--fears haunt us, worries 
entangle our minds, and pressures cast shadows upon our hearts. Keep 
these anxieties of life from overwhelming us.
  Give us victory over pride so that our common humanity may provoke 
new inroads of compassion to sympathize more deeply with those in need.
  Give us victory over stubbornness. Replace the grudges that hinder 
our collaboration with forgiveness that opens minds to new 
possibilities.
  Give us victory from the stain of lustful sins. Keep us on the 
straight and narrow path. Cleanse and purify our hearts by the 
inspiration of Your holy spirit.
  O God, give these Members of Congress a courageous perseverance, an 
unshakeable integrity, a spirit that cannot be broken. Secure the faith 
of this House, thereby securing the heritage and the future of America.
  Amen.
