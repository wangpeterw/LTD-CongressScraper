                          HONORING LUKE NEWMAN

  (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity 
to commend the life and the legacy of an outstanding resident of my 
community who served in World War II, which is a long time ago, but he 
also became an outstanding citizen, steeped in the Lutheran church, 
provided resources to the community where he lived and worked, so I 
commend Mr. Luke Newman, and I just simply say that we have enjoyed 
knowing him.
