                     URGING SUPPORT OF MICAH'S LAW

  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, at 20 weeks into a pregnancy, babies can 
hear music, respond to human voices, and, most importantly, they can 
feel pain. These are our children at their most vulnerable, yet current 
law continues to allow for abortions to take place even after this 
point in a pregnancy.
  That is why I have been a strong supporter of Micah's Law, which is 
legislation that would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks.

[[Page H7685]]

  This bill is not a partisan issue but, instead, a moral issue. By 
passing this law, every year we would be saving over 12,000 babies who 
can feel pain and hear our voices. It should be noted that this 
proposal has seen bipartisan support across the country. In fact, 60 
percent of Americans support prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks, 
including 63 percent of those who consider themselves pro-choice.
  This legislation is about nothing less than protecting those who 
cannot protect themselves. We remain one of only seven countries in the 
entire world that continues to allow abortions after 20 weeks.
  We must act to change this. I urge my colleagues to join me today in 
supporting the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, or Micah's 
Law.
