                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, the center of our joy, You are our strength. Thank You 
for Your guidance and protection.
  Lord, be a stronghold for our lawmakers, providing them with strength 
for today and hope for tomorrow. May they cast their cares on You, 
knowing that no one is more concerned about the things that threaten 
their peace. Show Yourself faithful to the faithful, rewarding 
integrity with Your bountiful blessings.
  Lord, arm our Senators with courage for life's battles, keeping them 
humble and faithful in their work. Help us all to do the best we can 
each day and leave the results to You.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
