                          NATIONAL FARMERS DAY

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the people of 
west Texas, home to 14 million acres of farmland, making it one of the 
largest agriculture production regions in the world.
  I have spent a lot of time with these plowboys and cowboys over the 
years, and I can tell you this: these men and women don't work our land 
and our cattle for the money, and they certainly don't do it for 
recognition.
  But today is National Farmers Day. Let's pause and pay tribute to the 
American farmer.
  Farming was man's first profession. Farming saved and sustained our 
first colony at Jamestown. Farming helped fund the Revolution, securing 
the very freedoms we have and cherish today.
  Farming has allowed us to feed and clothe our own people, and that 
food and fiber independence has contributed to America being the most 
powerful, most prosperous, and most generous Nation in the history of 
the world.
  God bless our farmers.
