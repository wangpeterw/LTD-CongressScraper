                       USS ``FITZGERALD'' TRAGEDY

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I would also like to express my 
heartfelt condolences to the families of the seven U.S. Navy sailors 
who were lost in the crash of the USS Fitzgerald. The loss of these 
seven men in peacetime, in such a bizarre and rare accident, is nothing 
short of a tragedy. I expect the Navy will conduct a thorough and full 
investigation to figure out what went wrong and hold all responsible 
parties accountable. For now, our prayers are with the families of the 
seven sailors who lost their lives in service to this great country.
