                BALTIC STATES CELEBRATE THEIR CENTENNIAL

  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the upcoming 
centennial anniversaries of the statehood and independence of the three 
Baltic States.
  This year marks 100 years since the restoration of the state of 
Lithuania on February 16, and the proclamations of independence of 
Estonia on February 24, and Latvia on November 18. Thus, in the 
aftermath of World War I, in 1918, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia 
declared their independence and marked their beginnings as new 
republics and their emergence as modern democratic societies.
  Despite a history of turmoil, the people of the Baltics have always 
stood up for their values and worked to maintain their independence, 
freedom, and sovereignty.
  Today, 100 years later, the three Baltic States are strong allies of 
NATO and full-fledged members of the European Union. They are committed 
to making the transatlantic community an area of cooperation, 
partnership, and prosperity. The United States is proud to be strong 
allies of the Baltic States, and our nations stand together to defend 
our shared values of freedom and democracy.
  Mr. Speaker, I extend sincere congratulations and send best wishes to 
Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia on their centennial observations and 
anniversary
