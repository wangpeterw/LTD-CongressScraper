   SENATE RESOLUTION 242--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ABOUT A 
 STRATEGY TO DEPLOY FIFTH GENERATION MOBILE NETWORKS (5G NETWORKS) AND 
  NEXT-GENERATION WIRELESS AND WIRED TECHNOLOGIES TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC 
    DEVELOPMENT AND DIGITAL INNOVATION THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES

  Mr. WICKER (for himself, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Gardner, Ms. Hassan, Mr. 
Moran, and Mr. Peters) submitted the following resolution; which was 
referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:

                              S. Res. 242

       Whereas wireless and wired broadband networks are essential 
     to economic growth, job creation, and the global 
     competitiveness of the United States;
       Whereas wireless and wired broadband networks provide 
     connectivity to billions of devices, applications, and 
     services that are increasing productivity and efficiency 
     across every industry and economic sector;
       Whereas wireless and wired broadband networks create and 
     support millions of jobs;
       Whereas wireless and wired broadband networks are vital to 
     providing communications services and access to internet 
     connectivity to people in the United States living in rural 
     and remote geographic areas;
       Whereas wireless and wired broadband networks are a 
     platform for innovation and ingenuity, powering advancements 
     in the Internet of Things and other revolutionary 
     technologies;
       Whereas 5G networks will have the capacity to deliver 
     enhanced mobile broadband with significantly faster data 
     transmission speeds, low latency, more reliable connections, 
     and greater data capacity, which will provide for seamless 
     internet connectivity throughout all regions across the 
     United States;
       Whereas 5G networks are expected to create more than 
     3,000,000 new jobs in the United States, generate 
     $275,000,000,000 in investment from the wireless industry, 
     and add $500,000,000,000 to the economy of the United States 
     over the next decade;
       Whereas next-generation, gigabit Wi-Fi solutions that rely 
     on unlicensed spectrum bands are poised to unleash a new 
     round of innovation and consumer benefit from an industry 
     that generates an economic surplus of $547,000,000,000 and 
     contributes $50,000,000,000 annually in gross domestic 
     product to the economy of the United States;
       Whereas 5G networks will enable innovative consumer and 
     industrial applications that will enhance and maximize the 
     capability, uses, and quality of technological developments, 
     including telemedicine, precision agriculture, self-driving 
     cars, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, smart 
     communities, and advancements in public safety;
       Whereas the United States is a global leader in developing 
     new technology and fostering digital innovation that has 
     generated significant economic and social advancement and 
     opportunity in the United States and around the world;
       Whereas many states and localities are streamlining 
     policies to facilitate siting and small cell deployment in 
     support of 5G networks;
       Whereas modernizing the infrastructure policies of the 
     United States and securing adequate spectrum bands will be 
     essential to the deployment of 5G networks and next-
     generation wireless technologies, and the realization of all 
     its promised economic and social benefits;
       Whereas wireless and wired broadband networks, in addition 
     to other technologies, are essential to closing the digital 
     divide, delivering broadband service to rural areas, creating 
     jobs, and powering economic development and innovation across 
     the United States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the 
     United States should--
       (1) promote the deployment of 5G networks in a manner that 
     encourages robust investment, job creation, economic growth, 
     and continued United States leadership in developing next-
     generation wireless technologies;
       (2) advance 5G networks as a way of closing the digital 
     divide and reducing the disparity in quality communications 
     services available in rural areas;
       (3) recognize that 5G networks will facilitate the 
     development of a new generation of technologies that will 
     open opportunities for increased efficiency, mobility, 
     accessibility, economic development, and prosperity in 
     communities throughout the country;
       (4) commit to modernizing the infrastructure policies of 
     the United States and identifying additional spectrum in low, 
     mid, and high bands for licensed and unlicensed uses and to 
     support the deployment of 5G networks and meet the increasing 
     demands for wireless broadband service;
       (5) recognize that 5G networks will give consumers access 
     to more choices and enable them to derive greater value from 
     mobile connections;
       (6) commit to deploying 5G networks that are resilient and 
     secure;
       (7) continue to participate in global efforts to create 
     standards for 5G networks that improve user experiences, 
     maximize use-cases, enable interoperability, sustain 
     multiple, simultaneous connections, increase network capacity 
     through virtualization or other software developments, and 
     adapt to new technologies and future network applications; 
     and
       (8) promote the deployment of broadband technologies to 
     expand the availability, affordability, and quality of 
     broadband service throughout the United States.
