                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Roger L. Story, National Children's Prayer Congress, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Heavenly Father, we come in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. We thank You for the Biblical foundations which undergird our 
Nation.
  We ask Your Holy Spirit's presence be very real in this House, giving 
counsel and wisdom when asked, comfort and conviction when needed. May 
Congress, and we, the people, bring honor and glory to Your name, as we 
confess our sins and ask for Your unmerited favor.
  We pray this very day Congress will make a commitment to be 
responsible to You, O God, for actions that reflect godly character as 
an example to our children and a personal commitment to uphold God's 
desire for the life of our Nation's children, through the words 
Congress proclaims and decisions they make.
  We now humbly ask that, in Your mercy, You will heal our land, not 
just on the surface, but deep down to our very core.
  We pray in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy 
Spirit.
  Amen.
