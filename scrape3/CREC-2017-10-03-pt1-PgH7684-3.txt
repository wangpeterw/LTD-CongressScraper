                    RAW DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, Republicans have once again presented a 
budget that is reckless, regressive, and reprehensible. It is a budget 
that would hurt working families, the middle class, the poor, the sick, 
the afflicted, veterans, and rural America. It is even a budget that 
would cut Head Start, Meals on Wheels, and Special Olympics.
  It is a raw deal for the American people. That is why Democrats are 
focused on better jobs, better wages, and a better future. Democrats 
are focused on higher pay for the American people, lower costs for the 
American people, and providing the American people with the tools to 
succeed in the 21st century economy.
  Democrats are focused on providing the American people with a better 
deal.
