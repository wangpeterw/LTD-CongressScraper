               REMEMBERING BISHOP LEWIS NATHANIEL TAYLOR

 Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, today I would like to take a 
moment to recognize and honor the life of Bishop Lewis Nathaniel 
Taylor, a great South Carolinian, who departed this life on October 2, 
2017. Bishop Lewis Taylor deeply loved his family, church, and 
community. He pastored in San Diego, California, Washington, DC, and 
New York. He eventually returned to his native Walterboro, SC, where he 
continued the legacy of his father and became pastor of Greater Saint 
James Church. He encouraged, inspired, and mentored many people in the 
community and abroad. Bishop Taylor served not only as a pastor, but as 
a carpenter and general contractor as well. In short, Bishop Taylor was 
a builder-visionary who helped design and construct churches across 
South Carolina. In 2008 and 2017, the mayor of Walterboro presented 
Bishop Taylor with the Key to the City. He was known to many as ``the 
little man, with a big vision'' and served his community tirelessly and 
earned the respect and admiration of all people he came in contact 
with. He will be greatly missed by the Walterboro community and the 
people of South Carolina.
