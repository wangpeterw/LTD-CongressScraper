     participants is closed shall be the effective date of the 
     later amendment.

     paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of subsection (b) shall apply to 
     distributions after December 31, 2017.
       (e) Normalization Requirements.--
       (1) In general.--A normalization method of accounting shall 
     not be treated as being used with respect to any public 
     utility property for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the 
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if the taxpayer, in computing 
     its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and reflecting 
     operating results in its regulated books of account, reduces 
     the excess tax reserve more rapidly or to a greater extent 
     than such reserve would be reduced under the average rate 
     assumption method.
       (2) Alternative method for certain taxpayers.--If, as of 
     the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of 
     enactment of this Act--
       (A) the taxpayer was required by a regulatory agency to 
     compute depreciation for public utility property on the basis 
     of an average life or composite rate method, and
       (B) the taxpayer's books and underlying records did not 
     contain the vintage account data necessary to apply the 
     average rate assumption method,
     the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method 
     of accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the 
     taxpayer uses the alternative method for public utility 
     property that is subject to the regulatory authority of that 
     jurisdiction.
       (3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--
       (A) Excess tax reserve.--The term ``excess tax reserve'' 
     means the excess of--
       (i) the reserve for deferred taxes (as described in section 
     168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as in 
     effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this 
     Act), over
       (ii) the amount which would be the balance in such reserve 
     if the amount of such reserve were determined by assuming 
     that the corporate rate reductions provided in this Act were 
     in effect for all prior periods.
       (B) Average rate assumption method.--The average rate 
     assumption method is the method under which the excess in the 
     reserve for deferred taxes is reduced over the remaining 
     lives of the property as used in its regulated books of 
     account which gave rise to the reserve for deferred taxes. 
     Under such method, if timing differences for the property 
     reverse, the amount of the adjustment to the reserve for the 
     deferred taxes is calculated by multiplying--
       (i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes for the 
     property to the aggregate timing differences for the property 
     as of the beginning of the period in question, by
       (ii) the amount of the timing differences which reverse 
     during such period.
       (C) Alternative method.--The ``alternative method'' is the 
     method in which the taxpayer--
       (i) computes the excess tax reserve on all public utility 
     property included in the plant account on the basis of the 
     weighted average life or composite rate used to compute 
     depreciation for regulatory purposes, and
       (ii) reduces the excess tax reserve ratably over the 
     remaining regulatory life of the property.
       (4) Tax increased for normalization violation.--If, for any 
     taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this 
     Act, the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of 
     accounting, the taxpayer's tax for the taxable year shall be 
     increased by the amount by which it reduces its excess tax 
     reserve more rapidly than permitted under a normalization 
     method of accounting.

                             General Leave

  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 1, the bill 
currently under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, today the full House begins consideration of H.R. 1, the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, historic tax reform legislation that will 
revitalize our economy and provide lasting tax relief to Americans of 
all walks of life.
  Over 30 years have gone by since the last overhaul of our Nation's 
tax system. In that time, our Tax Code has become one of the most 
complicated, unfair, and uncompetitive in the world. Today it is 
impacting nearly every aspect of Americans' lives, and not for the 
better.
  The overwhelming complexity of today's system forces American 
taxpayers to spend billions of hours and billions of dollars every year 
just filing their taxes. Trillions of dollars in carve-outs and 
loopholes give favoritism to Washington special interests while 
hardworking Americans get nothing but frustration.
  With some of the highest tax rates in the world for our businesses, 
we are seeing good-paying American jobs and manufacturing plants move 
overseas one after the other.
  Today, with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we change all of this. With 
this bill, we have an opportunity to deliver the most transformational 
tax overhaul in a generation. But make no mistake, this bill is not 
about us. It is not about Congress. This bill is about--for the first 
time in decades--providing the American people with a simple and fair 
tax system, so much so that nine out of ten Americans will be able to 
file using a simple postcard-style system. It is about finally 
rewarding hard work, growing jobs and paychecks, and allowing Americans 
to keep more of their hard-earned money to use on whatever is important 
to them.
  So if you are one of the millions of Americans who is sick of today's 
Tax Code, you are going to see a remarkable difference. You will see 
the standard deduction doubled, increasing to protect more of every 
paycheck from taxes. You will have a larger child tax credit, providing 
more support as you raise a family and care for your loved ones. More 
Americans will get help raising their kids.
  You will have peace of mind when it comes to life's most important 
investments because this bill preserves tax benefits to help you afford 
your home, to pay your property taxes, and put your kids through 
college.
  So if you are a typical middle-income family of four making $59,000 a 
year, you are going to get a tax cut of nearly $1,200. More than that, 
you are going to enjoy the benefits of a strong, healthy, and growing 
American economy. You are going to see more jobs on Main Street.
  With this bill, our small businesses will finally have low tax rates 
and a fair Tax Code that works with them as they grow and create jobs. 
You are going to see our larger businesses--our iconic American brands 
and our major manufacturers--win throughout the world and create new, 
good-paying jobs right here at home because, with this bill, we are 
going to have one of the most modern and one of the most competitive 
Tax Codes on the planet. That includes lowering our corporate rate from 
35 to 20 percent, which beats many of our international competitors.
  Not only are you going to see jobs stop leaving the United States, 
you are going to see our Nation become a 21st

[[Page H9346]]

century magnet for job creation and business investment.
  With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the American people will see and help 
lead the way in launching a new era of Made in America innovation. In 
the end, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a striking alternative to the 
broken Tax Code we have today. It represents a bold path forward that 
will allow us as a country to break out of the slow-growth status quo 
once and for all.
  Mr. Speaker, the American people have waited years--decades--for a 
fair, simple, and competitive Tax Code. Right now, in this moment, we 
stand on the doorstep of delivering the most sweeping tax overhaul 
since President Reagan's reforms in 1986. Like President Reagan back 
then, President Trump is now putting his full support behind this 
effort.
  Let's pass this historic bill and take another step forward in 
delivering bold, pro-growth, pro-family tax reform for Americans 
throughout this Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted the chairman mentioned President Reagan. 
But he made it sound as though President Reagan did tax reform on his 
own. Tax reform in 1986 was done in a bipartisan manner. I guess we 
just leave out Speaker O'Neill and we just leave out Chairman 
Rostenkowski and we just leave out Senator Bradley or Congressman 
Gephardt. The reason that they are left out is because even though it 
was accomplished in 1986, it started in 1982 when Mr. Gephardt and Mr. 
Bradley introduced the first tax reform act.

                              {time}  1700

  What happened in those intervening years?
  The Ways and Means Committee took testimony from 50 witnesses. They 
held 30 markups and an untold number of hearings.
  Contrast that with what we did in the Ways and Means Committee: not 
one witness, not one hearing, not one opportunity to hear from renowned 
economists, labor leaders, or individuals who would have great 
knowledge not just of what happened in 1986, but what could happen in 
this Chamber. Instead, we are going forward with this ill-considered 
effort.
  This is a missed opportunity. This is a bad deal for millions of 
Americans in the middle class. The legislation puts the wealthy, the 
well-connected, and the strong, once again, at the top. Thirty-six 
million Americans are going to receive a tax increase.
  When they talk about tax simplification, take a look at the phase-ins 
and phase-outs of this measure. That is hardly simplification. It is 
greater complexity.
  Oh, by the way, the corporate rate is made permanent. The individual 
issues phase out after 5 years.
  Consider this: 13 million people will lose their health insurance 
based on what Republicans are doing in the United States Senate. They 
are going to lose their healthcare to pay for a tax cut for people at 
the very top.
  Let me just walk you through some of these provisions because I think 
that they deserve our attention and the magnifying glass of critical 
analysis.
  We are being asked tonight to borrow $2.3 trillion to pay for this 
tax cut. This is from people who regularly lecture the American 
electorate on the need for fiscal austerity and balanced budgets.
  When Barack Obama was President, the budget should be balanced. When 
Bill Clinton was President, the budget should be balanced. But in the 
intervening period of time, apparently, we don't have to balance the 
budget.
  Also, $2.3 trillion is being added to the debt and deficits. We are 
witnessing what they are attempting to do because they are going to 
scale back the tax benefit for buying a new home by lowering the cap on 
mortgage interest deduction to $500,000. That is going to lower home 
values.
  H.R. 1 repeals the new markets tax credit. The historic tax credit 
that has transformed American cities is being eliminated. They beat up 
on the municipal bond market.
  As a former mayor, I have some knowledge of the municipal bond 
market.
  They are getting rid of the private activity bonds. Years ago, I 
raised the cap so that we might do more intervention and innovation in 
terms of rebuilding our airports across the country. Private activity 
bonds are a key for financing affordable housing. It is going to go by 
the wayside if they have their way. It is going to have a profound 
impact on the housing market.
  They eliminate several deductions and exclusions that help pay for 
college education, including a deduction for interest on student loans.
  Pay attention to this number. Student debt in America is at $1.3 
trillion, and they are taking away the ability of students to deduct 
that interest on those loans.
  They also impose a new tax on universities and colleges.
  They repeal the above-the-line deduction for teachers' out-of-pocket 
expenses. You know, those teachers who, in September, might be short 
some school supplies and they are good enough to pack the car up and 
bring it to school? We give them a $250 deduction. They are going to 
take it away.
  They create a health tax, an Alzheimer's tax, by repealing the 
medical expense deduction. This change basically scraps a family's 
ability to receive financial relief when dealing with serious medical 
conditions.
  Think of it this way: We celebrate annually the increases in life 
expectancy in America--80 for a male, 81 for a female. But if we are 
going to celebrate that, we also have to acknowledge something else: 
more dementia and more Alzheimer's as people grow older in America. So 
their decision is: Let's take away the ability of individuals to deduct 
those expenses.
  They also want to write off a very important consideration for the 
middle class in their ability to deduct real property tax costs up to 
$10,000.
  Contrast this with what these tax cuts do for the wealthy.
  H.R. 1 repeals the estate tax, which is paid by a small number of 
families in America. They are going to repeal it. I guess the slogan 
becomes: We are rich, and we are not going to take it anymore. That is 
not a tax on Conrad Hilton; it is a tax on Paris Hilton. That is what 
we should be considering with the greater efforts on their side to 
further concentrate wealth.
  By the way, there is an issue I have worked on for decades here, 
successfully, because 27 million middle class families no longer pay 
the alternative minimum tax. But guess what they are going to do? They 
are going to eliminate it for 4.5 million of the richest families in 
America. They are going to take away that payment.
  This is a missed opportunity, Mr. Speaker. This could have been done 
the way Chairman Brady indicated in 1986: hearings, markups, a genuine 
effort to find common ground on this.
  On our side, I have waited all these years to do this. Tonight and 
tomorrow, what you are witnessing is that they need a victory. That is 
what this is about. It is a victory in search of a policy.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.
  Mr. Speaker, I will note that, in the district of my good friend from 
Massachusetts, the average family of four making $87,000 will see a tax 
cut of $2,032.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
Roskam), chairman of the Tax Policy Subcommittee and a leader in the 
tax reform effort.
  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Massachusetts said this is a 
missed opportunity. This is no missed opportunity. What we are 
witnessing is the seizing of an opportunity.

  During the debate, our friends on the other side of the aisle, in 25 
hours of markup last week, offered amendment after amendment after 
amendment. I think it was about 25 amendments.
  Do you know what every one of the amendments did, Mr. Speaker? It 
restored the status quo. It put something back in, put another thing 
back in, defended something else, and so forth. There was no 
comprehensive offer of an amendment in the nature of a substitute that 
would have been transformational.
  There is no exclusion here. We debated. We are now here, and for the 
first time since 1986, we are on the cusp of seizing an opportunity and 
having a transformational moment.
  Here is the transformation:

[[Page H9347]]

  When the Tax Code was last amended 30 years ago--think about it--the 
internet didn't exist as a commercial enterprise. Yes, it has fully 
developed, and we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday.
  The global nature of supply chains were nowhere nearly as intricately 
interlinked, yet we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday.
  The shared economy--Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, all of those things--didn't 
exist, yet we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday.
  Who does the status quo benefit, Mr. Speaker? It benefits the few. It 
benefits the privileged. It benefits the folks at the top of the 
economic scale of things.
  So what this is doing is proposing a very different approach. It says 
we are going to make the United States the most competitive 
jurisdiction in the world by giving business tax relief and welcoming 
back commercial enterprise and growth and prosperity and ingenuity and 
investment--that does what? It creates paychecks and it expands 
opportunities.
  Kids graduated from college shouldn't have to grub around piecing 
together two jobs and living in their parents' basement. How absurd. We 
can do much better. We are the biggest, best economy in the world, and 
it is time we acted like it.
  This is transformational. To lean back and away from this and say, 
oh, this Tax Code is a natural disaster; it is too big and too 
overwhelming and we can't deal with it is nonsense. We fundamentally 
reject that.
  We are going to be measured in the future, Mr. Speaker, by this 
moment. I thank Chairman Brady for his leadership in creating this 
crescendo, because now is the time to act. Let's not defend the status 
quo. Let's move forward, and let's transform this economy.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I am for maintaining the status quo by 
allowing students to deduct their student interest loans.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
Schakowsky).
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that the Republican tax 
scam gives massive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires and 
corporations, and they do it, in part, by increasing healthcare costs 
for millions of Americans. Over 36 million middle class households will 
see a tax hike under this bill.
  Families with big medical bills will take the hardest hit. That is 
because Americans will no longer be able to deduct major medical 
expenses such as cancer treatment or Alzheimer's from their Federal 
income taxes.
  This is a middle class tax hike. Seven in ten households using the 
medical expense deduction make under $75,000 a year. Repealing the 
deduction would especially hurt seniors who use it for long-term care 
expenses.
  The bill takes a second swipe at American seniors and people with 
disabilities. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by not 
paying for tax cuts for the wealthy, Republicans would trigger 
automatic cuts to Medicare, slashing $25 billion from Medicare in 2018 
alone.
  But the $25 billion cut to Medicare is just the beginning. The same 
Republican budget that cleared the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts 
for the superwealthy proposed cutting Medicare and Medicaid by, no 
coincidence, $1.5 trillion.
  Now, Senate Republicans want to pay for additional tax cuts by 
repealing a key part of the Affordable Care Act. This change would 
increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million and increase 
premiums by 10 percent.
  Middle class families, people with disabilities, and seniors 
struggling to afford healthcare should not foot the bill for 
billionaires to get a tax cut. I urge my colleagues to make the healthy 
choice for Americans and vote against the Republican tax scam.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. Reichert), chairman of the Trade Subcommittee and 
a champion for working families.

  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for 
his leadership in bringing this tough piece of legislation. I mean 
tough in the sense that it has taken years to put this together and at 
least 40 hearings on the legislation that is presented today.
  Mr. Speaker, when I travel my district from the suburbs of Auburn, 
Washington, to the orchards of Chelan, I hear the same thing from 
middle-income, hardworking families, from the apple grower in 
Wenatchee, the tech entrepreneur in Issaquah, and the growing family in 
Maple Valley, Washington: They want to keep more of their hard-earned 
money, plan for the future, and they want to have some certainty in 
their future. They want to care for those they love.
  They deserve a plan that gives them the opportunity at their first 
job or a better job. They deserve a chance to decide how they want to 
spend their money.
  It is their money. Why wouldn't they deserve that chance?
  They want a Tax Code that is simpler, fairer, and that works for 
them. They want the same bright future for their children.
  This is a bill that is not just a tax bill, but it is a bill that 
reignites, in my opinion, the belief in the American Dream.
  In the Eighth District of Washington State, the median income family 
of four will receive a tax cut of $3,654. In Washington State, 21,875 
new jobs will be created.
  This plan will change lives. It will energize our economy and get our 
economy booming again.
  As we went through this process, I asked myself several questions 
over the last few years, to be honest with you. Here are the questions:
  Will this plan make the American economy boom again?
  Will this plan create jobs in America?
  Will this plan increase paychecks?
  Will this plan put more money in the pockets of hardworking 
Americans?
  Will this plan make the Tax Code fairer and simpler?
  The answer I came to and I think that Americans will come to, Mr. 
Speaker, is a resounding ``yes.''

                              {time}  1715

  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, this bill phases out the deductions that 
benefit middle-income families.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
Schneider).
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, we absolutely must reform our outdated 
and overly complex Tax Code, but the current bill this House is 
considering is not the way to do it. I have heard from constituents and 
local elected officials about how this plan will hurt them and their 
communities.
  Rather than lifting our economy and making our local communities 
stronger, this bill before us is an unfair and fiscally reckless step 
backwards. My constituents are deeply concerned with the restrictions 
placed on the State and local tax, or SALT, deduction. This puts a real 
burden on the residents of States like Illinois.
  One in three Illinois taxpayers uses the SALT deduction. Let's be 
clear. The SALT deduction is not a tax break for the very wealthy. It 
is used by the hardworking families we need to be helping with tax 
reform, not hurting.
  I am also profoundly concerned about what this reform means for our 
growing debt. An additional $2.3 trillion in debt is irresponsible in 
the extreme, burdening our children and our grandchildren with the 
consequences.
  Now, with the most recent Senate version, the GOP is taking aim at 
the Affordable Care Act, repealing the individual mandate without a 
workable replacement to further reduce enrollment in the individual 
health insurance markets, making coverage more expensive for millions 
of Americans and their families.
  There are things we can do to improve the ACA. For example, delaying 
the looming taxes on medical devices and health insurance premiums has 
broad bipartisan support. We should be focused on solutions like these 
that improve, not dismantle, the ACA.
  Despite our willingness to work across the aisle, there was virtually 
no bipartisan engagement on the plan this House is rushing to vote on. 
It is not too late to change course.
  I urge my colleagues to take the time for full deliberation in a 
complete and bipartisan process. Together, we can produce real tax 
reform that is fiscally responsible, prioritizes the middle class, and 
grows our economy for the next generation.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from

[[Page H9348]]

Nebraska (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee and 
a champion for agriculture.
  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for the 
time and for his leadership as we continue our efforts to pass this 
historic legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, after nearly 7 years of work in the Ways and Means 
Committee and more than 31 years since our last true tax reform, many 
hearings along the way, it is time to pass historic comprehensive tax 
reform. Our current Tax Code is antiquated, as we know. It is complex, 
and it ignores many of the improvements and competitiveness, which have 
been adopted by every other major economy worldwide.
  The time for tax reform is now. Others have already outlined many of 
the highlights of this bill, but I think they warrant mentioning again.
  Simplified compliance and rates for individuals and families means 
more than 95 percent of Americans will be able to file their returns on 
a postcard. Lower rates for small businesses recognize the important 
role they play as job creators in our economy. A 20 percent top 
corporate tax rate and transitioning to a territorial system will 
ensure our businesses remain competitive with the rest of the world.
  In addition to lower rates, expanded expensing will further encourage 
entrepreneurs to invest in capital to grow their businesses, and full 
repeal of the death tax, including the continuation of step-up in 
basis, will ensure our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and small 
manufacturers can continue creating opportunity for generations to come 
without the threat of double taxation.
  Our Tax Code shouldn't reward businesses and investors because they 
hired accountants and lawyers to help them avoid taxes, and the estate 
tax does exactly that right now. I think it is equally important to 
praise what the bill leaves alone in the Tax Code. With our impending 
entitlement crisis, we want Americans to save everything they can for 
retirement. This bill leaves those incentives intact.
  It also excludes a proposal, which had initially been included in the 
bill, to apply self-employment taxes to rental income. This could have 
had serious repercussions for ag land rental, and I am glad it was 
dropped. And I particularly appreciate how this bill continues the 
deductibility of State and local taxes for businesses, including 
farmers and ranchers.
  U.S. producers have made great strides in increasing production on a 
per-acre basis, but land remains a primary input as they work to feed 
the world. Ensuring the property tax on land and production remains 
deductible as business cost is vital to their continued success.
  This is the moment to finally provide the tax relief Americans have 
been asking for and to make our country competitive again. I urge the 
passage of this progrowth bill.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, more than 100,000 Nebraska households making 
under $137,000 a year will see a tax increase under this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. Capuano), my good friend from Somerville, Massachusetts.
  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am a 
former tax lawyer. My wife is a practicing CPA. We have heard this 
before: simplification is going to help. It has never put a single 
accountant out of business, and it won't do it now. It is another part 
of the big scam going on.
  Why? Sure, I will probably get a tax break out of this; some of my 
constituents will. But what do we get in return? We don't get 
healthcare. We don't get better roads. We don't get better education. 
But we do provide a $5,000 to $10,000 debt for our children. We do tell 
our seniors: Too bad if you have a heart attack or cancer; no more 
medical deductions for you. We tell our current graduate students: Too 
bad, no deductions for you. And on and on and on.

  And by the way, we have a new provision in here that I like to call 
the ``Dynasty Protection Act.'' Why? Because if you have a dynasty, if 
you are worth $30-, $40-, $50-, $100 million, your children get to keep 
it all. Not because they have done anything, but because they won the 
genetic lottery. Good for them.
  And then if they do get up off their butt and get a job, maybe start 
a hedge fund with all the money they inherited, they get another tax 
credit by not touching the special tax deals--you have the hedge fund 
managers. And if they earn a little extra money, they get to keep more 
of it because there is no alternative minimum tax left.
  I know that President Trump will particularly appreciate that 
provision because we all know--the only tax return we have seen--the 
AMT cost him $31 million. So thank you from the rich.
  Now, I don't have any problem with people being wealthy. I represent 
many of them. They don't want this tax cut because they know it is bad 
for America.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman from Massachusetts.
  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, as a final insult, the corporate tax you 
have encourages businesses to send jobs offshore by not taxing profits 
made offshore when they expand jobs, if they do. They will do it 
offshore, not here in America.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Massachusetts will gain 24,000 jobs; 
families will see a $3,000 increase in their paychecks.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
Paulsen), a key member of our committee and a leader in technology and 
employee stock options.
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, for the first time in a generation, middle-
income and hardworking Americans are closer to a Tax Code that works 
for them rather than against them.
  It has been 31 long years since we last reformed our broken tax 
system, and, in that time, our Tax Code has become one of the most 
complicated, unfair, and uncompetitive in the world. It has led to a 
stagnant economy and sluggish growth. American businesses of all sizes 
have some of the highest tax rates in the world, sending our jobs, our 
manufacturing, our research, and our headquarters overseas.
  And you know, the economic recovery hasn't been all that great since 
the Great Recession--not that great for a lot of Americans. Half the 
population is living paycheck to paycheck. Many either have or are at 
risk of having a lower standard of living than their parents. Young 
people, like my daughter's generation, will go backwards if this 
country is not fundamentally more competitive. And then seniors and 
those baby boomers preparing for retirement, who have a lifetime of 
savings, are now at risk without a growing economy.
  The reforms in this bill today will help real people with tax cuts 
aimed to help middle-income families that want to save for the future 
and improve their own standard of living. The bill focuses on helping 
small businesses, Main Street Minnesota businesses with a simpler, 
clearer, and fairer Tax Code that is critical for job creation. It 
lowers small business rates to 25 percent and even provides a 9 percent 
rate for the smallest Main Street startups.
  Modernizing the Tax Code is essential to allowing American businesses 
of all sizes to compete around the world and bring those jobs home. We 
need to be able to sell where the customers are, and 95 percent of the 
world's customers are outside the United States. The international 
reforms in this bill will incentivize businesses to bring their money 
home to invest in our communities.
  And importantly, this bill includes bipartisan legislation that I 
authored, the Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act, which 
helps those entrepreneurs and startups attract and retain talent. 
Hardworking taxpayers, Mr. Speaker, deserve a Tax Code that is simpler, 
flatter, and fairer so that every American family and employer can file 
their taxes without having to hire an Army of lawyers and accountants.
  Mr. Speaker, we have a choice. The choice is Americans. We can either 
truly grow the economy and put ourselves back on the path to real 
prosperity, or we can continue the actual trend we have right now of 
weak economic growth, which only benefits the few and the privileged 
and will do nothing for regular folks when the next economic downturn 
hits.
  Tax reform for me is about one thing and one thing only. It is about 
restoring hope for a prosperous future for

[[Page H9349]]

ourselves, our parents, and, most importantly, our children. I want to 
thank the chairman for his guiding leadership through this effort.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, 40 percent of Mr. Paulsen's constituents claim 
the SALT deduction, a benefit of over $15,000. They are lucky to break 
even after this tax bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
Kind), a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee.
  Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, there are certain phrases that we have learned 
to grow to accept with great suspicion: The check is in the mail. It is 
not you; it is me. Don't worry, I will respect you in the morning. I 
have had just a few drinks; I am fine with driving.
  And now we have to add to that: Don't worry. Large tax cuts for the 
most wealthy will pay for themselves, and I am a fiscally conservative 
Republican who cares about debt and deficits.
  The Joint Committee on Taxation has determined that, with interest 
payments, this bill will add over $2.3 trillion, with a T, to our 
national debt over th next 10 years. That is why last week, in 
committee, I was offering an amendment that would expand the endangered 
species list to include fiscally conservative Republicans because your 
vote on this bill will make you extinct.

  And what is unfortunate is, unlike past tax cuts that weren't paid 
for, we have run out of time. We no longer have the luxury of time to 
recover from a huge fiscal mistake, not with 70 million baby boomers 
beginning their massive retirement--10,000 a day joining Social 
Security and Medicare. Those programs and the solvency of Social 
Security and Medicare will be in jeopardy with another $2.3 trillion of 
debt over the next 10 years.
  And what is unfortunate, it didn't have to be this way. There was 
bipartisan interest in simplifying the Code, making it more 
competitive, broadening the base, making it fair for working families 
and small businesses and family farmers, but doing it in a fiscally 
responsible way.
  Asking 34 million Americans to accept a tax increase to pay for a 43 
percent marginal rate reduction to the largest companies is hardly 
responsible, and it is hardly fair. I encourage my colleagues to let us 
take a different approach and reject this bill.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Tennessee (Mrs. Black), the chair of the Budget Committee who 
cleared the path for this progrowth tax reform.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his endless hours 
of work listening to everyday people, listening to small businesses, 
listening to large businesses, listening to how what we put in this 
bill was going to affect the American people who, at the end of the 
day, are going to be the winners.
  So it has been more than three decades since Congress has worked with 
the White House to modernize our Nation's very confusing and 
complicated tax system. Just ask anybody who has filed their taxes on 
their own.
  But we are closer to changing that day with H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act. And with this budget, with the budget passed in both Chambers 
and following last week's productive markup in our House Ways and Means 
Committee, tax relief is on the horizon.
  With this legislation, Republicans clearly recognize the need to do 
something about our heavy tax burden weighing down the hardworking 
Americans and holding back job creators.
  We also recognize the need to bring simplicity to the Tax Code. In 
our tax reform plan, we will help low- and middle-income Americans see 
more of their hard-earned paychecks by lowering the tax rates and 
nearly doubling the standard deduction for individuals and married 
couples.

                              {time}  1730

  For instance, for an average middle class family of four, that 
translates to a $1,200 tax cut. Now, I will tell you, that is real 
money.
  We also establish a new family credit that raises the child tax 
credit and introduces new credits for family members and other 
dependents.
  The Tax Code will also become less confusing, making it possible for 
most Americans to file their taxes on a single postcard.
  Our plan, rightly, provides tax relief for job creators, empowering 
entrepreneurs and small businesses to continue opening, operating, and 
expanding on Main Street.
  For my home State of Tennessee, H.R. 1 will allow families to see an 
estimated $2,200 increase in wages. Again, that is real money.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to 
the gentlewoman.
  Mrs. BLACK. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, this bill 
would also mean 20,000 new jobs for my State. This will provide a 
welcome jolt to our economy, which is badly needed following eight 
lackluster years under the Obama administration.
  Without question, enacting tax reform is a challenge, but the 
benefits of seeing it through will be felt for generations to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation, and I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. We cannot miss this historic opportunity.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, over 350,000 Tennessee households making under 
$132,000 will see a tax increase with this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. 
Courtney), a leader on the Higher Education Subcommittee and well known 
nationally as a spokesperson on education issues.
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Neal for his tireless leadership pointing 
out the trail of broken promises that are in this bill for middle class 
families, who will pay dearly with higher costs for healthcare, home 
ownership, and, in many cases, Federal taxes.
  I would like to zero in for a minute during National Apprenticeship 
Week on the broken promise that the bill represents to growing the U.S. 
economy, which has a shortage of skilled workers. The obliteration of 
the student loan interest deduction, which will add $24 billion to the 
cost of higher education; the taxation of graduate students' tuition 
waivers, 60 percent of which are concentrated in STEM curricula; and 
the elimination of tax-free employer-funded tuition assistance, to 
enhance workplace skills, often using apprenticeship programs, moves 
this country in exactly the wrong direction to close the skills gap in 
our workforce, which we all know every Member in this body has heard 
about from employers back home.
  Indeed, America's CEOs told the President last February at a White 
House manufacturing summit: Jobs exist, skills don't.
  In fact, the Trump's Labor Department reported 6.1 million job 
openings in the month of September, a near record high.
  Sadly, this antigrowth tax bill robs American job seekers and 
employers of the tools to fill those jobs, ironically, during National 
Apprenticeship Week.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members of this body to vote ``no.''
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan), one of the key members of our Tax 
Policy Subcommittee and a champion for working men and women.
  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to take 
advantage of this historic opportunity that we have before us.
  As I travel across my district, I hear from families that are 
struggling to get ahead. I hear from families that can't make ends meet 
most months. They don't have a whole lot left over. In fact, 63 percent 
of American families don't have $500 to handle an emergency. I hear 
from businesses that say they would love to be able to hire, expand, or 
buy that new piece of equipment, but they just don't have the cash to 
do it.
  Our Tax Code is taking too many dollars from Pennsylvania and sending 
it to Washington. It is sending good-paying, middle class jobs overseas 
and it is holding our economy back, making it harder for so many to get 
ahead.
  This is our chance to change the status quo. We have an opportunity 
to jump-start our economy and let more hardworking families keep what 
they earn.
  We rewrite the Tax Code for American job creators, taking away the 
incentives to send jobs overseas and dollars offshore. Putting those 
dollars to

[[Page H9350]]

work will put more Americans to work as businesses expand and invest 
here at home--American tax cuts for American workers with American 
jobs.
  We give these small businesses a break--the mom-and-pop shops that 
employ Pennsylvanians. We give entrepreneurs, who have so much 
innovation and creativity, a wider cushion to take a risk. We are 
putting more money in the pockets of hardworking families. We are 
doubling the standard deduction, which means that 94 percent of 
taxpayers won't need to itemize at all. Let me say that again: 94 
percent of taxpayers won't even need to itemize at all.
  By expanding the child tax credit and creating a new $300 credit for 
parents and nondependent children, we put an additional $1,800 back in 
the pockets of every family of four. That is money that they can use as 
they see fit. We have streamlined the maze of education tax credits, 
and included in my bipartisan bill are apprenticeship programs that can 
now be made affordable.
  The taxpayers I hear from say they want to pay less in taxes, not 
more. If limiting some deductions and lowering your rates means your 
tax bill is lower at the end of the year, that is a good deal for 
taxpayers.
  We owe it to the hardworking, taxpaying families we represent to 
deliver that.
  I urge my colleagues to support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, all of those projects in Philadelphia are 
about to come to an end with the abolition of the historic tax credit.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Sherman), who, incidentally, is a CPA and a tax attorney
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, by 2027, roughly one-third of middle class 
families will be paying more in taxes, and that average family will be 
paying $1,300 more.
  The personal exemption, worth $4,150 per person in a family, that is 
$21,000 for a family of five, and they take it away.
  The moving expense deduction, if you have to move to keep your job, 
you don't get to deduct that. But if you move a factory to China, you 
get to deduct all of the moving expenses.
  The student loan debt, they won't let you deduct it.
  As for the effect on simplicity, my CPA and tax law homeboys are 
going to be rolling in big dollars. Just from the provisions that 
define the difference between personal service income, passive income, 
active business income, the litigation and planning opportunities--talk 
about complexity--it is all there, and my homeboys love it.
  We currently deduct extraordinary medical expenses. That is important 
to those with disabilities and families with children with special 
needs. They wipe it out.
  The extraordinary casualty loss deduction, they wipe out. That is 
very important to people who face floods and fires.
  They change the rules so that we don't have adequate indexing for 
inflation, so everybody is pushed into a higher tax bracket by 
inflation, except those at the very top; they are protected.
  But look at the effect on our Nation's economy. This is a job-
killing, deficit-exploding, growth-reducing disaster. Look at what 
happened to Kansas. These policies have already devastated one of our 
States.
  You are going to be taking $1.5 trillion out of the money available 
for business investment. The Federal Government will come in and borrow 
all of that money, leaving less money for factories, farms, and homes.
  As Ron Kind pointed out, there is an extra $800 billion of interest 
on top of that just in the next 10 years. Keep in mind, this increase 
in our debt is forever. Your grandchildren will be paying taxes on this 
debt.
  Look at the chart. We had the policies of Ronald Reagan from 1988--
when his 1986 law became effective--through 1993, and we had 2.67 
percent growth. In 1994, we got Clinton tax policies and we exploded to 
over 4 percent annual growth. Then with George W. Bush, we dropped to 
1.7 percent growth. Then when we adopted Obama tax policies, which are 
in force today, we are back up to 2.2 percent economic growth.
  Which policies give you economic growth?
  Let's look internationally. You can manufacture and pay zero percent 
on the profits you earn by a factory, but only if it is a foreign 
factory.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman.
  Mr. SHERMAN. Finally, Mr. Zandi, one of the top economists in the 
country, testified before our Financial Services Committee that this 
bill means double-digit declines in the value of homes in American 
metropolitan areas.
  What effect does that have on the economy? Who is going to go out and 
spend in the middle class when they are told that the equity in their 
home has been virtually wiped out?
  So you can vote against this bill because it is unfair, or you can 
vote against this bill because it will be a crushing weight on our 
economy, but don't engage in the fantasy that you can cut taxes and 
make it up through ``economic growth.''
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, under tax reform, California will 
grow 111,000 new jobs, and paychecks will increase by nearly $3,000.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from South Dakota 
(Mrs. Noem), a champion of family-owned farms and businesses.
  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act of 2017.
  We have worked hours--literally hundreds of hours--on this 
legislation, and I commend Chairman Brady and the staff of the Ways and 
Means Committee for all of their hard work.
  Mr. Speaker, we have gone through this bill line by line. I have 
personally fought for policies and ideas in this bill to make sure that 
it works for families, to make sure that it increases wages, and 
creates more opportunity for folks all across America.
  My goal in this was two-fold. Number one, I wanted to strengthen 
families. Number two, I wanted to create a stronger future for America. 
This tax reform package puts us well on our way to achieving these 
goals and achieving some remarkable wins for the American people.
  I say this because this plan simplifies the Tax Code. It simplifies 
it to the point that most people can file their taxes on a form the 
size of a postcard. It also gives significantly lower rates. It 
dramatically expands the child tax credit. It keeps the child care 
credit. It protects flexible spending benefits.
  These provisions for working families are important to me. My home 
State of South Dakota has the highest rate of working families in the 
Nation. The moms and dads in my State aren't working just for fun. They 
are working to pay the bills to provide for their families. They need 
money to put food on the table and to put a roof over their kids' 
heads. These provisions are going to help them pay their bills, take 
care of their kids, go to work, and maybe, just maybe, get a little 
extra money that they can take their kids off for a weekend and do 
something fun together. That is important.
  When these kids grow up, I want them to be able to find good, high-
paying jobs. So I fought hard to make sure that our farmers, our 
ranchers, and our small businesses could thrive under this new Tax 
Code. We got some pretty big wins for those folks.
  In this bill, we fully and permanently repeal the death tax--that un-
American, unfair double tax. W give people better expensing tools and 
we drive down the rate for small businesses. If we are going to make 
sure that our kids can thrive, we need to create opportunities for them 
to make sure that they can do it right here in America, and this tax 
reform package lets hardworking job creators do that better.

  Mr. Speaker, I understand that no tax reform plan is going to be 
perfect in everybody's eyes, but this proposal is a strong step 
forward. It reflects real, sustainable policy changes that are going to 
let people keep more money in their pockets.
  I have heard from many throughout this debate, who have spoken up 
against these tax cuts and these reforms--people who trust the 
government with this money more than they trust the American people.
  Mr. Speaker, I fundamentally disagree. The American people deserve 
more control over their paychecks.

[[Page H9351]]

They have worked hard to earn that money. They have taken time away 
from their families to earn that money. They ought to be the ones 
deciding how, where, and when to spend it.
  So for the purposes of strengthening families and offering folks a 
stronger future here in America, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
1.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, 38,000 South Dakota households making less 
than $113,000 a year will see a tax increase under this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the highly regarded gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the son of Massachusetts and my friend.
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) for yielding me this time.
  Mr. Speaker, you can put all the lipstick you want on this pig, and 
it is still a pig.
  Let's be honest, this isn't tax reform. This is a cut on taxes for 
corporate America, the corporate friends and my friends on the other 
side of the aisle, and they had to squeeze all kinds of things in to 
justify it and pay for it. That is why the middle class is going to 
suffer. That is why their kids in college are going to start losing 
their ability to deduct interest on student loans, and they are going 
to pay taxes on waived tuition when they get a teaching assistant 
position or a benefit from the university.

                              {time}  1745

  That is why your local municipalities are going to lose tax exemption 
for private activity bonds that fund tens of billions of dollars of 
public improvements all over the United States.
  That is why 8.8 million Americans are going to lose the ability to 
deduct medical costs. Good luck to families who have to put people in 
nursing homes for long-term care, patients suffering dementia. How will 
they work that financing out when they lose this deduction, and how 
will they feel when they know the reason they are losing this deduction 
is to finance a corporate tax rate?
  What about homeowners losing the ability to deduct mortgage interest 
or to have it capped artificially so corporate America can get the 
biggest tax cut in history?
  And, by the way, they get to continue to deduct State and local taxes 
and other kinds of financial interest-related expenses, but not you, 
not you the middle class.
  It adds $1.5 trillion, and that is with dynamic scoring. Dynamic 
scoring is another way of saying: We kind of fudged the real number. It 
is more than that, at least $200 billion more than that.
  I thought my friends on the other side of the aisle were fiscal hawks 
dedicated to making sure we didn't have deficits.
  This is an inconsistent bill. This is going to harm middle class 
America.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill, and let's 
start over in a bipartisan way.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman's constituents in 
Virginia's District 11, with average household earnings of $136,000, 
with two kids, will see a tax cut of $5,008.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
Barr).
  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to engage in a colloquy.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to first commend Chairman Brady and the Ways and 
Means Committee for their outstanding work on the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act, which will provide tax relief to millions of hardworking families 
and businesses.
  I would like to address a small provision in the bill that 
inadvertently impacts Berea College, a small private college in Berea, 
Kentucky, that is a member of the federally recognized Work Colleges 
Consortium.
  Work colleges, by definition, do not charge their students tuition, 
and they also require their students to hold jobs. For over 125 years, 
Berea College has fulfilled its mission of providing a tuition-free 
education to students with limited economic resources, primarily from 
Appalachia, and who are often first-generation college students. Berea 
pairs its strong academics with a student labor program, honoring the 
dignity and utility of all work.
  Berea could not fulfill its unique and special mission of providing 
free tuition to all students without a healthy endowment. The Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act includes a 1.4 percent excise tax on private college 
endowments over $500,000 per student. There are two federally 
recognized work colleges with endowments above this level, including 
Berea College in my district.
  I was pleased to learn that the Senate version of the bill exempts 
schools with fewer than 500 tuition-paying students from the excise 
tax. This provision would effectively exempt work colleges from the 
tax, because they do not charge tuition.
  I understand it was never the committee's intent for this legislation 
to negatively impact work colleges that use their endowments to provide 
tuition-free education. In fact, I understand the intended purpose of 
the excise tax is to encourage colleges to use their endowments to keep 
college costs down. In this case, Berea College uses its endowments to 
defray 100 percent of the cost of tuition.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his willingness to work with me 
on a solution in conference, either acceding to the Senate position or 
another mutually accepted solution that exempts work colleges and 
allows them to continue their unique mission.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. BARR. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the gentleman from 
Kentucky for his leadership here.
  Mr. Speaker, we will work together for a mutually accepted solution 
to make sure we exempt work colleges to use their endowments to provide 
tuition-free education.
  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Lee), a well-regarded champion of middle-income people.
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and also for 
his tremendous leadership on the Ways and Means Committee and for 
really telling the truth.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, H.R. 1, which 
really is a tax scam. Republicans are really trying to pull a fast one 
on the American people.
  This bill would steal from the hard-earned paychecks of millions of 
middle-income families to line the pockets of billionaires and 
corporations. In fact, 80 percent of the tax breaks would go to the top 
1 percent. It also eliminates student loan deductions and eradicates 
medical expense deductions.
  If this isn't cruel enough, this bill makes it easier for 
corporations to ship jobs overseas, so people will actually lose their 
jobs. This tax plan does nothing to create better jobs or better wages 
or a better future for the middle class. It does just the opposite.
  In my home State of California, one in five middle-income families 
will see a tax hike next year. The State and local tax deduction would 
be particularly hard on my State, where 6.1 million households will see 
a tax increase.
  Public sector jobs, like firefighters, will lose their jobs, not to 
mention the vital services our most vulnerable will need. These will be 
cut.
  This bill really is a disgrace. Stealing from families who need help 
the most to give more to donors--millionaires and billionaires and 
corporations--this is really a new low.
  Thirty-six million middle-income households, working families, will 
pay more in taxes.
  We can't forget, also, that this tax scam sets the stage, really, for 
a heartless $1.5 trillion cut to Medicare and Medicaid, as we saw in 
the Republican budget.
  We need to reject this mean-spirited tax scam and vote ``no'' and 
then come back and look at how we can support middle-income families, 
working families, so everyone has a chance and an opportunity at the 
American Dream.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would note that the constituents 
in California's 13th District, a median family of four earning $107,000 
will see a tax cut of $2,589.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia 
(Mr. McKinley).
  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this opportunity 
to discuss the historic preservation tax credits that historically have 
stimulated nearly $150 billion in private sector investment.

[[Page H9352]]

  As we have discussed over the last month, the tax credit is 
critically important for economic development and revitalization, 
especially in small, rural areas of this country. Without the credit, 
projects that transform communities in all 50 States, from West 
Virginia to Texas, to Wisconsin, simply will not happen.
  Mr. Speaker, the chairman's word means something to me, so I am 
asking for his commitment to continue working with me to ensure that 
the Federal historic preservation tax credit is preserved in the final 
tax reform package.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. McKINLEY. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McKinley for his passion 
about making sure our smaller communities can revitalize and grow and 
about the role of the historic preservation tax credit in doing that. I 
commit to working with him and continuing to work with him on this 
issue because I know the importance of it.
  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and I look forward to 
working with him as well. We have had a good working relationship over 
the years. I want to continue this process because I understand this 
process. I will be voting to continue the process in anticipation that 
it will be in the final bill.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), a valued member of our delegation.
  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member 
for yielding and for all of his incredible work on this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, we were promised tax reform, but that is not what we are 
seeing in this bill. In fact, you don't have to dig far into this 429-
page bill to see that it is a con, a cynical bait and switch for 
families at home.
  When this bill was released just 2 weeks ago, I started getting calls 
from families at home wanting to know how it would affect them. We dug 
into it, and I want to share just a few of those examples, but it 
didn't take long to see why it was developed in secret and why it is 
being rushed to a vote.
  On page 254, Republicans propose getting rid of a program that helps 
veterans find work when they come home. 300,000 veterans have been 
helped by the work opportunity tax credit. The repeal of this provision 
to reduce taxes for the very wealthiest is a coldhearted way to say 
thank you for your service.
  On page 113, this tax scam sends a bill to 9 million households who 
have extremely high medical costs. Tax breaks for billionaires are 
expensive; we get that. Under this plan, Americans who live in nursing 
homes, have a sick child, high medical costs will foot the bill.
  On pages 95 and 97, students get added to the list of Americans who 
will be forced to pay for the GOP's tax breaks for corporations. They 
will see increased debt and taxes.
  This bill says: Good luck, students. Building an economy that will 
not allow you to pay off the $1.3 trillion of existing student debt 
but, instead, will add $2.3 trillion in deficit, this bill was created 
for you.
  Just yesterday, the President's chief economic strategist was 
surprised when the CEOs gathered admitted they would not be investing 
their tax cuts in jobs and wages.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Garrett). The time of the gentlewoman 
has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman.
  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, he should not have been 
surprised. Corporations are already sitting on record amounts of cash 
while generations of hardworking Americans have had to pay for tax 
experiments like this based on disproven economic theories.
  Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past. Let's reject this bill and 
work together to create bipartisan tax reform that is fair and benefits 
all families.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act, in the Fifth District of Massachusetts, a median household of four 
earning $143,000 will see a tax cut of $5,208.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Reed), one of our key leaders on tax reform on the Ways and Means 
Committee.
  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his hard work 
in putting this bill together.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill has been in the process for over 7 years in 
regards to the time I spent on the committee. There have been multiple 
hearings on the issue of tax reform, well over 40-plus. There have been 
hours upon hours of debate.
  There were efforts done by our former chairman, Dave Camp. I know my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle have recognized, during our 
committee markup process, the hard work that Chairman Camp did with 
rewriting the entire Code from the bottom up.

  These issues have been out there for the American people and for the 
people from across the country to look at, to digest. Now is the time 
to rise in support of this legislation, Mr. Speaker, because what we 
have before you is a new Tax Code for the 21st century.
  Mr. Speaker, we have a Tax Code that is going to, for once in 31 
years, put our corporations on the multinational level across the world 
in a competitive position by lowering the rates and getting to a 21st 
century taxing program on a territorial basis.
  Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, we deliver tax relief. I know the 
folks on the other side aren't going to agree with this because they 
are going to say this is a Tax Code for the rich, this is a Tax Code, 
tax reform for the rich and the almighty 1 percent.
  But, Mr. Speaker, I have done the math. I have looked at this bill 
inside and out, and it delivers a simplified Code where $1,600 is left 
in the pockets of my constituents in western New York. That is $1,600 
that they earned that the government won't have to take from them 
anymore; $1,600, Mr. Speaker, that will allow them, as senior citizens, 
to go visit their grandkids in the South because New York State has 
driven them out of New York State with its high tax policies at the 
State capital. That is $1,600 that maybe they can go on a trip with 
their family and experience a little relaxation because of the hard 
work that generated those moneys and those dollars in their pockets.
  Mr. Speaker, these are the people whom we represent, the Perrys. Mr. 
and Mrs. Perry are hardworking people of western New York, and those 
are their two beautiful children. What this is going to allow them to 
do is get a little bit more of their money kept in their pocket so they 
can spend a little bit more time with their kids and enjoy the fruits 
of their labor.

                              {time}  1800

  Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues on the other side advocate because 
there is another issue with tax reform that I want to highlight real 
quick.
  The easy approach of government is to spend more money, develop more 
programs, and maybe give a little bit in regards to a government 
welfare check. But what this Tax Code and reform does is deliver a job 
opportunity for these people, and I don't know a better program in 
America that serves more people than an honest day's work and an honest 
paycheck and an honest job, and that is what this Tax Code will do.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, correction. Not one hearing was held on this 
tax bill. Thirty-eight thousand people in Mr. Reed's district will lose 
the student loan interest deduction.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
Kaptur), a real champion of the working class in America.
  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from 
Massachusetts, Ranking Member Richard Neal, for his exceptional 
leadership in trying to fix this horrendous bill.
  Madam Speaker, the GOP-led tax and deficit disaster rewards the big 
corporations and billionaires. It will accelerate job outsourcing. 
Indeed, 50 percent of the tax benefits go to the top 1 percent.
  This tax scam locks in--get this--a $621,500 tax bonus to each 
billionaire in the billionaire class, the top one-tenth of 1 percent. 
Do you really think they need it?
  Meanwhile, this tax scam raids money from the pockets of 38 million 
middle class taxpayers, likely those caring for their sick relatives or 
trying to help their kids in college. Do you

[[Page H9353]]

really think the one-tenth of 1 percent need more?
  Money-trading Wall Street megabanks like Goldman Sachs and J.P. 
Morgan, already making billions, will get more tax bonuses courtesy of 
the middle class.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Cheney). The time of the gentlewoman has 
expired.
  Mr. NEAL. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.
  Ms. KAPTUR. This job outsourcing tax bill of the rich, by the rich, 
and for the rich, well, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, 
it must be a duck, and this duck belongs in a swamp, which voters may 
have thought they were draining in the last election.
  Well, folks, this bill makes the swamp wider and deeper, and the fat 
ducks will be even fatter and happier in it.
  I urge my colleagues to vote for the middle class, not the 
billionaire donor class. Vote ``no.'' Drain the swamp.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I am proud the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act for that family of four in Ohio, in the Ninth District, a $64,000 
household, will see a tax cut of $1,284.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
Turner).
  Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for working 
diligently to create the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will give a tax 
break to the middle class.
  After speaking to both Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Committee 
member Tom Reed, I believe that an unintended consequence of this bill 
would hinder middle class Americans pursuing a higher education degree 
in an attempt to better their lives. These consequences will affect the 
education of employees of universities, graduate students, and 
employees receiving employer-provided education benefits.
  Madam Speaker, under current law, higher education institutions can 
provide tax-free tuition waivers or reimbursement to employees, 
spouses, and dependents.
  Secondly, many universities provide graduate students, including 
Ph.D. candidates, with tuition relief and stipends, which they can 
utilize while pursuing their degree. Several of my constituents, 
including my niece, Sarah Schiavone, who is a Ph.D. student, would be 
impacted by this.
  Thirdly, employer-provided education incentives are currently not 
taxed. I offered two amendments, amendments 20 and 21, to H.R. 1 that 
would have kept these qualified tuition reduction benefits and 
currently would have provided for them to continue.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I inadvertently cut the gentleman 
short. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.
  Mr. TURNER. I know the Senate is working on their version of the tax 
reform package, and, as of today, the Senate bill does not include the 
repeal of these vital education permits.
  Mr. Chairman, I would like your assurances that the current status of 
these education benefits will be protected during conference debate. I 
am requesting you continue to work with my office as we, together, 
address this issue.
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. TURNER. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. It is a privilege to be able to work 
with the gentleman on this issue, and, Mr. Chairman, it is a privilege 
to work with you.
  With eight colleges and universities in my district, I cannot ignore 
the impact that eliminating this section that Mr. Turner eloquently 
explained--the impact it may have on the students and the employees in 
my district at all of those institutions.
  The University of Illinois, the largest university in my district, 
provided $184 million in tuition waivers to 1,387 faculty and staff 
last year alone; 1,100 of those employees made less than $75,000.
  I am worried, too, that that is going to have a tremendous impact on 
graduate students. I am worried it is going to have an impact on the 
custodians and the assistants in the Registrar's Office who are just 
working at these institutions to be able to send their son or daughter 
to college. So I look forward to working with Mr. Turner and Mr. 
Chairman and working toward a solution.

  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. TURNER. I yield to the gentleman.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Turner 
and Mr. Davis for raising this important issue. On the committee, 
Representatives Meehan and Lynn Jenkins led the discussion and share 
your sentiments.
  I have a keen interest in this issue. I will work with you toward a 
positive solution on tuition assistance in conference with the Senate.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Vermont (Mr. Welch), who is a son of Springfield, Massachusetts, and a 
very distinguished gentleman.
  Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I have a few questions for the authors of 
this bill.
  What do you have against students? You are imposing an opportunity 
tax. A young Vermonter who wants to get a certificate in welding, or 
get a degree from our community college, and gets tuition assistance 
from an employer, they have to pay taxes on that. If they borrow money 
from the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, they have to pay more 
because they can't deduct that interest.
  By the way, the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation has to charge 
higher interest because we are eliminating private activity bonds, and 
they don't get the benefit of their municipal bonds rate.
  I have another question. What do you have against teachers? They 
reach in their pocket at the beginning of school to help out with 
school supplies. They lose the deduction.
  I have another question. What do you have against people who have a 
loved one with Alzheimer's? They can't deduct the cost of that medical 
care.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend.
  Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair.
  Mr. WELCH. Well, I have another question for the Chair, and I ask it 
of the leadership.
  What happened to democracy? We were promised an open process. And 
there was a model for this. It was President Reagan and Dan 
Rostenkowski, 4 months of actual hearings, witnesses testifying about 
the bill.
  This was written in secret. Oh, by the way, no amendments.
  Now, we could ask 435 Members of Congress whether we should stick it 
to the students like we are doing in this bill, and 435 of us would all 
stand up for the students. But you know what? Not a single one of us is 
given the opportunity to ask the question: Do we want to stick it to 
our students who want to get a welding degree or a college degree?
  That is disgraceful, it is inexcusable, it is within the control of 
the majority, and they are denying us the opportunity.
  Here is the big deal that we know. This bill was written by and for 
the donor class that has flooded and contaminated this political 
process with billions of dollars in our campaigns.
  Madam Speaker, I say defeat this bill.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for 
families of four in Vermont, making $89,000, will see a tax cut of 
$2,030.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana 
(Mrs. Walorski), one of our key leaders championing for small business.
  Madam Speaker, I also ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Roskam) be permitted to control the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his 
work.
  Madam Speaker, I can't tell you how grateful I am to cast a vote to 
move our Tax Code one step closer to its first overhaul in 31 years.
  We know the Tax Code is broken. The American people know the Tax Code 
is broken. They are reminded every time they look at their paycheck. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will deliver progrowth tax reform to the 
families, farmers, manufacturers, and workers in my district.

[[Page H9354]]

  For families, we are delivering tax cuts so that hardworking Hoosiers 
can keep more of their hard-earned money. We are enhancing the child 
tax credit, preserving the Adoption tax credit, encouraging retirement 
savings, and streamlining 15 different education tax incentives.
  We are delivering a Tax Code so simple that most Americans can file 
taxes on a postcard. In my district, 80 percent of filers already take 
the standard deduction. They will be able to keep even more of their 
money, because the standard deduction is doubled, and most itemizers 
will now be able to save time, money, and stress by taking the double 
standard deduction instead.
  No one is ever excited to file their taxes, but I am all for a 
simpler, quicker process that makes it much more pain-free.
  H.R. 1 helps job creators grow. Small businesses get a lower rate and 
more simplicity. Family businesses passed down for generations won't 
have to worry about the estate tax anymore, and America will be a more 
attractive place to do business.
  Our antiquated Tax Code keeps investment in jobs out. This bill 
incentivizes companies to bring profits back, to locate facilities 
here, and to grow American jobs and raise wages.
  Madam Speaker, I was so proud to vote for this bill in the Ways and 
Means Committee, and I am proud to be a part of this House that is 
delivering yet another crucial step toward tax cuts, simplicity, and 
fairness.
  Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, the University of Notre Dame is about to get 
slugged with a new tax, and the clock is running out.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
David Scott), who has been a champion of the working class.

  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
Neal. I appreciate this time.
  Madam Speaker, my heart is heavy tonight, and it is heavy because we 
are faced with the absolute, most dangerous, destructive, and deceitful 
tax reform bill in the history of this Congress. Now, let me tell you 
why.
  On the other side, you have heard Member after Member on the other 
side get up and tell you: This is going to get a tax cut, we are going 
to give the wealthy a tax cut, we are going to give the corporations a 
tax cut. But none of them have told you, or the American people, how 
they are going to pay for it.
  And the great tragedy is, the most deceitful thing about what my 
colleagues on the other side are doing to the American people is they 
are doing these tax cuts for the wealthy, the tax cuts for the 
corporations, on the backs of the poor, the middle class. Let me tell 
you why.
  They won't tell you that they are paying for this tax cut because 
on--$1.5 trillion that they will cut from Medicaid, from Medicare.
  Madam Speaker, Medicaid is for the children. There are literally 
millions of children on there.
  You heard one of my colleagues go down. We are losing 20 veterans to 
suicide every single day. No mention of that. Yet they will cut the 
veterans program designed to help them to pay for this tax cut.
  Not to mention the student loan interest rate. Young people across 
this country, you need to rise up. Seniors, we need to rise up.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.
  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. We need to rise up and stand and fight 
for this country. Let our minds go back to 1770, in Boston, at the 
harbor, when they threw the tea over that founded the foundation of our 
great democracy.
  I ask the American people to stand up and help us Democrats defeat 
this dangerous bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their 
remarks to the Chair.

                              {time}  1815

  Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, the good news is that the good people of 
Georgia's 13th District median household income, family of four, at 
$80,000 would receive a $1,700 tax break.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. 
Schweikert), former treasurer of one of the largest counties in our 
country.
  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, this is one of those moments where--
and forgive me, but I sometimes feel like I live and work in a math-
free zone, because you can't intellectually have it both ways, where 
you are talking about the great difficulties coming, and then when you 
bring in the actual data and you actually start to look at the charts 
that we all see, it isn't in the future, it is right on the cusp of us, 
and that is the debt and entitlement crisis.
  If we do not start to get some economic growth, we are in so much 
trouble. If you really care about Medicare, Medicaid, the children, 
this education program, this health research, where is the money coming 
from?
  It is on the cusp. This is less than a decade away. In just a few 
years, we cross 100 percent of GDP, and that is publicly held, and then 
the ability to sell the bonds if we do not get economic growth.
  But if you look at the last 30 years in the charts and the data--and 
I am sorry, I know this is small and I know it is math, so it is 
uncomfortable for a lot of people in this body. If you actually look 
across here and you see, this is entitlements to GDP, when we have been 
in times of economic expansion, all of a sudden our ability to finance, 
to maintain the promises we have made as a society, if the math works. 
And this is a commonality we both understand, economic growth is our 
only path. Because if it is not, are you on your side ready to do 
fairly draconian cuts?
  If we actually look at some of the data that has come from the Tax 
Foundation, the Tax Foundation's modeling says $1 trillion of 
additional taxes, but almost $300 billion in additional payroll taxes 
over the 10 years.
  I have already heard a couple people get behind the microphone here 
and use the term that the trillion and a half is dynamically scored. 
No. That is a static score. All dynamic scoring is--so we all have a 
commonality--you calculate back in the size of the economy. You loop 
back in the size of the economy, and you can't have it both ways. You 
either support dynamic scoring or you oppose it for global warming. You 
oppose it for immigration. You oppose it for the stimulus, because we 
actually, as a body, every March, when CBO brings us the numbers, they 
give us a number that has been dynamically scored.
  I know we all want what is best for this Nation, but as I dig through 
the math, if we get the economic growth that I believe this tax model, 
so many of the very difficult decisions we as a body have to make over 
the next decade get much easier. Let's hope we get there.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's sincerity as we 
proceed to watch them borrow $2.3 trillion on the deficit.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
Kildee), from a well-known family.
  Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time 
and for his incredible leadership on this subject.
  You can't have it both ways. I just heard it said. You can't have it 
both ways. So what I suspect will happen after I get done, as has been 
the case with every one of the speakers on this side, the gentleman on 
the other side will say that residents in my hometown will get a tax 
break of X, $1,000.
  I would ask the gentleman if he would add to that the amount of the 
debt that is being borne by each one of those families. Because the way 
I have got it calculated, it costs a family of four about $20,000 for 
your debt that you are willing to levy against our children and 
grandchildren in order to give the richest 1 percent of Americans a 
massive tax break.
  You can't deny the math that almost all the benefit goes to the 
people at the top. The top 1 percent are huge beneficiaries. You can't 
deny the math that 5,400 families will get a massive tax break. You 
can't deny the math that says that every single American will take on 
additional debt; a family of four, $20,000 in debt.
  I also was intrigued by the colloquy where Members came to ask the 
leadership if they will work with them to take out egregious elements 
of this tax

[[Page H9355]]

proposal. We get this sort of ``Yes, I will work with the gentleman'' 
answer.
  I have a question: Why did you put it in in the first place? Why are 
you cutting brownfield tax credits? Why are you cutting new market tax 
credits? Why are you cutting historic tax credits in the first place? 
Why did you put it in in the first place?
  You just wrote the bill. You just wrote it. It makes no sense. It 
makes no sense.
  We can't pass debts to our children in order to finance tax breaks 
for the people at the very top.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would like to remind all Members 
that they should address their remarks to the Chair and not to others 
in the Chamber.
  Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.
  Madam Speaker, the good news is it is not just $1,000 for the 
gentleman's district, it is $1,200.
  Let's go right to this student issue. It was the Obama administration 
that proposed in the 2017 budget for the elimination of the student 
deduction. I think the sanctimonious need to just walk out of the 
Chamber.
  The other thing is, at a tax rate of 15 percent, an annual $2,500 
above-the-line deduction is a $375 tax break. We are proposing 
something far greater than that with doubling the standard deduction, 
lowering the rates and so forth.
  Madam Speaker, let's just take the student deduction and chuck it in 
the garbage.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Missouri 
(Mrs. Wagner).
  Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, it is about time we ge something real 
done for the American people. The people of Missouri's Second District 
sent me to Washington to secure their jobs and to keep a little more of 
their hard-earned money, and at long last we are finally doing just 
that.

  I vote ``yes'' to fix our broken tax system. I vote ``yes'' to help 
reignite the American economy. I vote ``yes'' to make it a little bit 
easier for that single mother of two, that firefighter, that teacher, 
that shopowner, that family of four, that veteran. I vote ``yes'' for 
bigger paychecks, better savings, and a more secure future.
  I ran for Congress to fight for the people of Missouri and to ensure 
that every hardworking American can realize their own American Dream.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), a conscience of the House and a 
champion of all things Pittsburgh.
  Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
opposition to this terrible bill. Many of my colleagues have called it 
a scam, and they are absolutely right.
  Supporters of this bill have said that everyone gets a tax cut. That 
is not true. Millions of Americans get a tax increase; more and more 
each year, in fact.
  Supporters of this bill have called it a middle class tax cut. That 
is not true. The lion's share of the money goes to corporations and 
households making $1 million or more, not to the family struggling 
paycheck to paycheck.
  What this bill gives to the middle class in one hand, it takes it 
away with the other with devastating consequences for households with 
high medical costs, student loans, or high State and local taxes.
  Supporters of this bill have claimed that it will keep companies from 
moving jobs overseas, create new jobs here at home, raise wages for 
American workers. That is not true. While this bill cuts corporate tax 
rates, it creates new incentives for shipping our jobs abroad.
  Finally, does anyone really believe that tax cuts for corporations 
and the rich will trickle down to the rest of us?
  It didn't work in the Reagan administration. It didn't work in the 
Bush administration. It didn't work in Kansas, and it is not going to 
work today.
  Make no mistake, this massive tax cut for corporations and the rich 
will increase deficits and the national debt by trillions of dollars, 
sticking the rest of us, especially our kids, with the bill.
  Madam Speaker, this massive tax cut for corporations and the wealthy 
is not a middle class tax cut. It won't create jobs or raise wages. It 
isn't simple, it isn't reform, and it certainly won't pay for itself.
  If we want to increase economic growth, let's give a real break to 
the middle class and the small businesses. They will put that money 
right back into the economy. That is the way to create jobs and boost 
wages.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this giveaway to the 
rich and to start over with a bipartisan bill that truly benefits the 
middle class.
  Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle 
need to make a decision: Do they want to lionize Ronald Reagan or 
criticize Ronald Reagan?
  I will leave it to them to decide which.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
Barr).
  Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to adamantly dispute this false 
narrative that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is only intended to benefit 
the wealthiest Americans and does not benefit the middle class.
  When you hear this fiction from the other side of the aisle, remember 
these facts: this bill lowers tax rates on low- and middle-income 
Americans. It takes the lowest 10 percent bracket to zero. It doubles 
the standard deduction, meaning hardworking Americans can immediately 
take home more of their paychecks. Specifically, the first $24,000 of 
family income will be completely tax free under this plan.
  By slashing our noncompetitive corporate tax rate, this bill will 
result in more jobs and, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, 
it will deliver average American households a pay raise of at least 
2\1/2\ percent.
  With this legislation, a typical family of four earning $59,000, the 
median household income, will receive a $1,182 tax cut.
  Madam Speaker, that is not a tax cut for the rich. That is a tax cut 
for low- and middle-income hardworking Americans, and that is a fact.
  This will benefit people like Jared from Frankfort, Kentucky, who 
told me: ``The extra income from the tax cut will enable us to have 
some breathing room.''
  It will also help constituents who are living paycheck to paycheck, 
who have told me they would use these tax cuts to save for a rainy day, 
make car repairs, occasionally go to a restaurant, and invest in higher 
education for their kids.
  I heard from my constituent in Lexington named Gary, who told me: 
``It doesn't matter how I plan to use my money. By definition, it is my 
money to begin with. Trust me to spend it in the way that applies for 
me.''
  Gary, you are absolutely right, it is your money.
  Tax relief is not about handouts. It is simply about allowing the 
American people to keep more of the hard-earned income that they made.
  On behalf of all of the hardworking people of central Kentucky, I 
urge my colleagues to vote for Gary and to vote for all other taxpayers 
who deserve to keep more of what they earned. Vote ``yes.''
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. Ryan), who is well known and well regarded as he addresses 
national economic issues.
  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
leadership on this.
  The last time there was tax reform was 31 years ago. Since then, 96 
percent of income growth went to the top 10 percent of the people in 
the country. Ninety-six percent went to the top 10 percent. The top 1 
percent control 90 percent of the wealth in this country.
  Sixty-three percent of average families in the United States of 
America could not withstand a $500 emergency.
  We have pensions collapsing, we have communities that have eroded, 
wiped out, and the Republican plan to fix all of this is to go to the 
Chinese Government, borrow $2.3 trillion and bring it back to the 
United States and give it to the wealthiest people in this country.
  That is not going to fix a damn thing in the United States. It is not 
going to help Flint, or Springfield, or Youngstown, or Pittsburgh, or 
Gary. I am talking about Gary, Indiana, will get hammered from this 
thing.

                              {time}  1830

  We have tried this before, and many of you were here. President Bush 
did

[[Page H9356]]

this. He said: We are going to cut taxes for the wealthy. It is going 
to lead to growth. Wages are going to go up.
  We had the most stagnant decade of growth since the Great Depression, 
and it ended in a complete economic collapse. This is a canard. This 
economic philosophy stinks. It doesn't work, and it hammers working 
class people.
  To put a little salt in the wound, Madam Speaker, you keep the 
deduction that allows a corporation to outsource jobs from our 
communities to other countries.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman.
  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, the only place this is going to 
create a job is in Beijing, China.
  Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, as you know, the good news is, according 
to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 70 percent of the individual tax 
relief goes to families earning under $200,000, according to their 
publication on November 13.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
Rutherford).
  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I think no one in this Chamber can dispute when I say 
that America's Tax Code is broken. I rise today to stand with my 
colleagues in support of progrowth tax reform because our Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act works for the middle class.
  For too long, a complex Tax Code, high rates, and burdensome 
regulations have held back opportunities for hardworking families. The 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act offers much-needed tax relief for low-income and 
middle-income Americans.
  It focuses on middle class tax cuts that allow hardworking Floridians 
to keep more of their paychecks so that they can save for their 
children's college fund, so that they can invest in their retirement, 
so that they can enjoy vacations with their family.
  Florida families know how to spend their money better than the 
government, and this plan allows them to keep more of the money that 
they earn instead of waiting for tax returns and deductions to give 
them their money back.
  This bill is profamily. It is probusiness, and it will give our 
economy a boost. Nothing will address our debt more than growth.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. McNerney), well-known as a champion of America's middle 
class.
  Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member of 
the committee for his hard work on this. He has been a great voice.
  Madam Speaker, this is a harmful and deceitful bill. It is strictly 
partisan. We have learned over the years, if you do something strictly 
on a partisan basis, it isn't going to work. It is going to fall apart. 
It will come back to you. I am telling you, learn from our mistakes. 
Work with us.
  There hasn't been a single hearing on this bill.
  Is the public out there confused? They should be because they haven't 
been informed about what this bill does.
  It was rushed through in 1 week. It takes more than a week to name a 
post office around here.
  What is the deal? What is going on here? No one really understands 
the consequences of this bill, but I can tell you what it does.
  It will greatly reduce taxes for corporate America. It will reduce 
taxes for the wealthy.
  So where do you think the money is going to come from to pay for 
Social Security? to pay for our roads and highways? to pay for our 
education? to pay for Medicare? If you haven't guessed, it is going to 
come from the middle class. There is no other way we can pay for this.
  So I will be kind and say maybe they are being overoptimistic. Maybe 
they don't really understand what is going on there, but don't believe 
it. You are going to pay more taxes. It is going to come out of your 
hide.
  And when I sit down, the Member from Nebraska is going to say that, 
in my district, you are going to get $1,200 more or $1,700 more. No. 
You are going to pay more. You are not going to get more money back.
  In California, 6 million people will lose their tax deductions, the 
State income tax deduction. What does that mean? That means you are 
going to pay taxes twice on your earned income. In California, 
homeowners are going to get hit hard. I don't see how anyone from 
California can vote for this bill.
  Education will be more expensive; student loans will not be 
deductible. This bill will hurt our Nation's ability to compete.
  What does that mean? It means lower pay. It means layoffs.
  This tax overhaul is a big lie. We should oppose this bill and start 
over and do it right.
  Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, the good news is it is not $1,200. It is 
not $1,700. It is $1,900 for the median household in California's Ninth 
District.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
Smith), a great friend of agriculture and a great friend of small 
business.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, a lot has been said today on 
the floor about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from my friends on the other 
side of the aisle. They think that this bill before us will make losers 
of the American workers or of the American economy. The truth is the 
status quo--our current broken Tax Code--is causing our workers and our 
economy to lose.
  Back in southeast Missouri--I will give you an example under the 
current Tax Code--a machinist in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, working 40 
hours a week is fearful to work harder because the more money that they 
make, the less that they will have percentagewise unde our current Tax 
Code. That is simply not right, Madam Speaker.

  Back in southeast Missouri, a cotton farmer in Hayti has worked for 
decades to build his family farm hoping to pass it on to his daughter. 
Yet, under the current system, his daughter would have to sell portions 
of the farm or take out a massive loan to continue the family 
operation.
  The status quo in our Tax Code is rigged against the American 
taxpayer. They can't afford an army of lawyers, accountants, and 
lobbyists to find all of the loopholes and the bailouts available only 
to a select few.
  The status quo are tax rates for businesses that are so high that the 
American companies are not able to grow, hire new workers, or be 
competitive with other countries around the world.
  The other side of the aisle was arguing to keep a broken Tax Code 
that is punishing hardworking taxpayers. All of the grandstanding 
leaves us with one question that needs to be answered for the American 
people: What do these tax cuts mean for you? It means that the 
hardworking family in southeast Missouri will keep more of their 
paycheck.
  Instead of being penalized for success, this bill is about employees. 
It is about wages. It is about getting to keep more of what you earn. 
For families and couples, the first $24,000 you earn under this bill 
will be tax free. You get to keep it. You get to decide how to spend 
your own money, not the government.
  It means that the small businesses and family farms won't feel the 
sting of the IRS and the death tax when tragedy strikes their family.
  It means that lobbyists and special interests become the losers. We 
close loopholes in handouts that the hardworking taxpayer can't get.
  We are ending a Tax Code that isn't built for the everyday American. 
We are making it simple and fair. It means that America can now compete 
and win again.
  With this bill, we lower the business rate to historic levels. We are 
making our economy healthy again. We know from history that a healthy 
economy takes care of itself. It is more stable and sustainable. It 
provides for full employment, better jobs, and higher wages.
  Former President John F. Kennedy knew this when he said: ``Our true 
choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance 
of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that 
no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security 
needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will 
never produce enough revenue to balance our budget just as it will 
never produce enough jobs or enough profits.''

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, surely, the lesson of the last 
decade is that budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but 
by slow economic growth and periodic recessions. Any new recession 
would break all deficit records.
  This bill makes the American worker, the American family, the 
American farmer, the American small businesses, and the American 
economy winners once again.
  Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, 28,000 people will use the student loan 
interest deduction in Missouri's Eighth District, claiming nearly $33 
million in deductions.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. Ruiz), a medical man and Congressman.
  Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Neal for the 
opportunity to speak on this bill.
  The fact is I do want to simplify our Tax Code and I do want tax 
reform, a tax reform that relieves the burden on our middle class, our 
seniors, our veterans, and our students. But let's just see how this 
bill fares with the middle class, seniors, veterans, and students.
  My middle class constituents in California will be double-taxed on 
their income, but big corporations will get tax relief.
  Veterans in my district will find it harder to find work or a home 
because this bill eliminates tax credits for hiring veterans and harms 
efforts to end veterans' homelessness.
  Middle class homeowners across California will see the value of their 
homes decrease by as much as 10 percent.
  Students will get hit with the largest relative tax increase in this 
bill.
  Seniors will see a Medicare cut by $25 billion a year. That is over 
$100 billion of Medicare cuts over the next 4 years.
  And 38 million middle class families will see their taxes increase. 
They always point to this family of four earning $59,000 getting a 
certain amount of tax cuts, but 38 million middle class families will 
see their taxes increase, all this while giving tax breaks to 
millionaires, billionaires, and corporations who ship jobs overseas and 
raise the deficit by $1.44 trillion within 10 years. In fact, nearly 80 
percent of the tax cuts in this bill go to millionaires, billionaires, 
and multinational corporations that ship jobs overseas.

  The bottom line is this bill raises taxes on the middle class and 
gives tax breaks to billionaires. This is irresponsible and 
unacceptable.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and protect 
Medicare, protect the middle class, protect seniors, protect veterans, 
and protect students.
  Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, if you are in California's 36th District 
and your median household income is $58,000, it looks like a tax cut of 
$1,090.
  I am informed that our friends on the other side have more time, and 
my suggestion is that our friends use some of their time to get back in 
balance.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 1 hour 
16\1/4\ minutes remaining.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I just happen to have the nephew of former 
President Kennedy here who is going to set the record straight on that 
quote that was attributed to President Kennedy just a few moments ago.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. Kennedy), a very good member of the Massachusetts congressional 
delegation and my friend.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and mentor in the 
House, the dean of our delegation from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), for 
his leadership on this issue and so many others.
  Madam Speaker, I am always heartened by the quotes of President 
Kennedy offered by any Member of this body. I would like to think that 
they would seek to emulate him not just on the marginal tax cuts that 
were put forth some 50 years ago, but also on his stance on 
immigration, on civil rights, and on Russia.

                              {time}  1845

  But those are issues for another day, Madam Speaker.
  The issue today is a vote that we will take on this floor tomorrow to 
rewrite an American Tax Code that will touch every single American 
life.
  True tax reform is complicated, it is cumbersome, and, above all 
else, it is deeply personal. But this bill is none of those things. It 
is a massive, permanent handout to corporations passed off on American 
families. It is a terrifyingly precise attack on patients with chronic 
illness, a heartless roadblock for low-income students, and a choice to 
value inherited wealth more than hard-earned income.
  It is a gift to corporations paid to the richest among us, and it is 
paid for by long nights, by double shifts, by vacations not taken, and 
of hardworking American families sacrificing for their hope for a 
better tomorrow.
  You are asking them to fortify your tax cuts and stock options with 
their classrooms, your corporate profits with their roads and bridges, 
your balance sheets with their hard-earned retirement and healthcare 
benefits.
  For all the talk about the boost to corporate profits, 80 percent of 
the stocks in this country are owned by 10 percent of Americans. Ask 
yourself who is going to actually be the beneficiary of all that money. 
That is what this bill does.
  You have heard from my Republican friends over the course of the past 
couple days about how much this will save the average American family, 
but not about the 36 million people and families who will experience a 
tax hike.
  What they aren't telling you is what is going to happen the moment 
this bill is passed. Luckily for the American public, one of the chief 
economic advisers to the President has said so. He said that after this 
bill is done, they are turning directly toward welfare cuts, Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. So when you hear questions about how 
much this bill is going to save you, ask how about your retirement. 
These cuts go right to Social Security.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts an 
additional 30 seconds.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, ask them how much more money that $1,000 
is going to save you when your healthcare benefits are taken away. By 
the way, that clause just got added over in the Senate.
  Ask them how much more some savings might go for one family when you 
gut and shred a social safety net that has powered the greatest 
expansion of economic growth that this country has ever seen.
  That is what your bill does. That is what this bill means. That is 
what this bill is about. It is about the values envisioned of an 
America, about a tax structure that should reflect the values of the 
American family, not the values of corporate balance sheets.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their 
remarks to the Chair.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. Raskin). Congressman Raskin is a well-known champion of 
civil liberties and a scholar of the law.
  Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, as my friends across the aisle prepare 
their statistics about my congressional district where 500 people 
rallied against the tax plan this last weekend, I want to invite them 
to come to my district and to debate me and several other members of 
our caucus. I am happy to come to the gentleman's district and debate 
it, too, because the American people should be able to be part of this 
decision.
  When the majority voted to throw 30 million Americans off of their 
health insurance plans, they went over to the White House where they 
celebrated like it was Mardi Gras, the Super Bowl, and Herbert Hoover's 
birthday all put together. When millions of middle class Americans 
rebelled and defeated that monstrosity of a bill, Donald Trump pointed 
at them and said that they had all voted for a mean bill; and he was 
right.
  Now like lambs to the slaughter, they are about to vote for another 
mean bill, a tax scam written by corporate lobbyists in the dark of 
night

[[Page H9358]]

now moving through Congress at the speed of light.
  While our poor colleagues grimly walk the plank for the billionaires, 
Wall Street tycoons, and the Trump Cabinet, who are getting ready to 
laugh all the way to the bank when middle class Americans rebel again 
this week, next week, and the week after that, and this tax scam bites 
the dust, President Trump can turn around again and call this 
monstrosity not only mean, but greedy.
  This mean and greedy tax scam puts $1.5 trillion on America's credit 
card so the sons and daughters of the middle class can pay the rest of 
their lives for a gigantic corporate tax cut in a period of record 
corporate profits.
  One-third of the windfall raining down on corporate investors will go 
abroad because more than one-third of corporate wealth is owned by 
foreign investors. That is more than $500 billion that goes not even to 
our own rich people but to Saudi Arabia, China, and other foreign 
investor havens, and it will not go to Medicare or Medicaid or other 
public purposes at home.
  Then they move to the so-called territorial tax system so that 
corporate profits moved abroad will escape our normal system, giving 
incentive to record job flight. Somebody tell Donald Trump about this 
because this tax scam puts foreign jobs first.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an 
additional 1 minute.
  Mr. RASKIN. In the meantime, Madam Speaker, 34 million middle class 
Americans get hit with a tax increase. Good-bye to the healthcare 
deduction. Good-bye to the college loan interest deduction. Farewell to 
a meaningful State and local tax deduction--oh, and farewell to the 
estate tax which applies only to billionaires and the richest 
millionaires in the country, 2 out of 1,000 families. Where is the 
democracy? Where is the legislative process?

  When we had a bipartisan bill in 1986, we took more than 2 years. It 
passed with overwhelming support. Now this tax scam has had no 
hearings, no experts, and no citizen testimony. What a scandal it is. 
We do need tax reform, but we don't need a corporate tax scam imposed 
against the middle class.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Maxine Waters), who is the ranking member of the 
Financial Services Committee.
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
opposition to H.R. 1, which is just a continuation of Republicans' 
relentless attack on working families. This is not a tax plan; it is a 
tax scam.
  This President won't disclose how he is going to benefit from this 
tax scam. He has disrespected us all. This tax scam will eliminate the 
student loan interest deduction. It will eliminate State and local tax 
deductions on income. It will restrict the mortgage interest deduction.
  It is estimated that 47 million taxpayers face a tax hike. Almost 
half of any tax cuts will go to the richest 1 percent. Residents of my 
State of California will face the largest net tax increase totaling 
$12.1 billion in 2027 alone.
  Madam Speaker, I call on the President of the United States of 
America to show his tax income and to show his tax plan. He needs to 
let us know what he is all about and what his taxes are. From the very 
beginning, he said he couldn't show them at the time that he was asked 
when he was first inaugurated into this Presidency, but time has 
passed. It is time for the President to show us his tax returns, rather 
than coming up with a tax scam asking everybody else to pay up, to pay 
more, and saying that this is a middle class tax cut when it is not.
  We want to know more about him and his plan. So with my 1 minute, my 
2 minutes, whatever it is, this evening is all about saying a message 
to the President.
  Even though I will be cautioned that I am not to talk to the 
President, I am calling on the President: Show your tax returns.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their 
remarks to the Chair.
  Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, there is a message for California's 43rd 
District, and that is a benefit of $1,395 if H.R. 1 is passed into law.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. LaHood).
  Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois 
for his commitment and dedication to this terrific bill that we have 
before the House tonight.
  Madam Speaker, the people of Illinois are unfortunately all too 
familiar with high taxes and the burden they put on families and our 
local businesses. At the Federal level, things have become just as bad 
with a Tax Code that is over 74,000 pages long and riddled with 
loopholes.
  Over 30 years have passed since the last time Congress passed 
comprehensive tax reform, and you can see the effects of our outdated 
Tax Code everywhere. We have stagnant hiring, stagnant wages, and a 
stagnant economy that is holding back our middle class instead of 
helping them get ahead.
  H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is our chance to change all of 
this. By simplifying our Tax Code and bringing real relief to everyday 
families, we can, once again, jump-start the American economy and get 
it back to working for the middle class.
  The choice before us is a simple one: Do we support this bill and 
support the middle class, or do we embrace the status quo? That is why 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together and 
vote for this bill. Let's send a signal that we don't stand for the 
status quo. We stand for growth and economic opportunity for the 
American people. Let us bring relief to the middle class. Support this 
bill.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. Sewell). Congresswoman Sewell is an attorney and a 
Marshall Scholar.
  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, our Tax Code is a statement of 
our values, and I can tell you that this tax bill doesn't reflect my 
values nor those of the American people. This bill favors the wealthy 
over the middle class, it favors corporations over the working 
families, and it favors special interests over everyday Americans.
  Madam Speaker, this tax bill raises taxes for 36 million middle class 
Americans, and it cashes a check for $2.3 trillion worth of debt that 
will be left for our children and grandchildren to pay.
  This tax bill gives permanent tax cuts for corporations and 
multinationals while making the tax cuts for regular taxpayers 
temporary.
  This tax bill preserves tax deductions for certain industries but 
does away with tax cuts in the Code that help everyday Americans. It 
eliminates the deduction for State and local taxes. It also limits 
mortgage interest deductions and limits the medical expense deduction 
affecting 9 million households.
  The independent group, the Tax Policy Center, estimates that almost 
half of the tax cuts, 47 percent of the tax cuts, will go to the top 1 
percent.
  Madam Speaker, this bill devastates education. Education is truly the 
investment in our human capital, our workforce. It eliminates 
deductions for interest on student loans. It eliminates deductions for 
teachers who buy supplies. It eliminates lifetime learning credits, and 
it eliminates employer tuition assistance.
  This bill adds a special tax on the endowments of colleges and 
universities which will reduce scholarships and increase the cost of 
college for average, everyday Americans.
  Cities and towns will be decimated by this bill. This bill eliminates 
tax incentives such as private activity bonds, new markets tax credits, 
and historic tax credits which dramatically affect the ability to 
build libraries and hospitals, and to fund roads, bridges, and 
broadband infrastructure. These are critical investments, Madam 
Speaker, in the public service that spur economic growth.

  Madam Speaker, this tax bill has it backwards. This Congress should 
value its constituents first, not Wall Street, and not special 
interests--its constituents first.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this tax bill 
because it doesn't represent the values that our constituents sent us 
here to this hallowed place, Congress, to represent. We should be 
representing them and not the special interests.

[[Page H9359]]

  

  Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to just do a 
quick, little cleanup.
  There was a discussion a minute ago by the gentlewoman from Alabama 
where she was talking about teachers, for example. Let's get right to 
that. Teachers won't be harmed by shifting the status quo because what 
they are getting right now is a $250 deduction which is worth about $37 
at the 15 percent tax rate, receipts that they have to keep all year 
long in an envelope and apply it at the end in terms of doing their 
taxes.
  We say: Dump that. Let's get away from that. Let's double their 
standard deduction, lower their rates, and give them some real money.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California 
(Mrs. Mimi Walters).
  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Brady) control the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Illinois?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise to engage the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) in a colloquy.
  Madam Speaker, tax reform will result in economic growth across the 
country, especially in my home State of California. I thank the 
gentleman for his dedication to this important effort.
  Madam Speaker, my home State is uniquely positioned in this tax 
debate. Due to the liberal tax-and-spend policies enacted by the 
California State Legislature, my district in Orange County is one of 
the most expensive places to live in this country. California has the 
highest personal income tax rate in the country, reaching a crushing 
12.3 percent. The median home price in my district is almost $800,000. 
California also has the highest gas tax in the country.
  While this bill makes important reforms that will grow our economy, I 
have serious concerns that some of my constituents may be worse off. As 
Sacramento continues to confiscate more and more of California's hard-
earned paychecks, we must ensure that Washington does not put similar 
tax burdens on our constituents.
  I ask the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to assure me that 
we will ensure that individuals and families in my district are 
protected from such unintended outcomes.
  Mr. KNIGHT. Will the gentlewoman yield?
  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. I yield to the gentleman from 
California.

                              {time}  1900

  Mr. KNIGHT. Madam Speaker, if you want to demonize or scare people, 
you come down and yell and scream and raise your hand and you say 
things that they haven't looked into.
  What I did was talk to people in my district and looked at their 
rates and said: Let's look at your taxes and kind of work them through.
  I found that people in the lower-income rate in my district got 
relief. People in the middle-income rate got relief. This happened 
right across the board to everyone we kept talking to.
  So I would say that, before you come down and yell and scream and try 
and scare people on something you might have heard from a talking head, 
actually work with your people. It works.
  Madam Speaker, if this bill is enacted, it will result in economic 
growth across the country, especially in my home State of California. 
The lower rates for individuals, families, businesses, and the tax 
simplicity and certainty offered by this bill will provide net tax 
relief to the middle class and our country's job creators.
  We expect this bill to create nearly 1 million jobs nationwide, and 
nearly 10 percent of those in California.
  While the bill makes commendable strides toward a fair, simpler Tax 
Code, I am concerned about how the bill could impact some of my 
constituents as a result of the high level of income taxes imposed on 
them by our State government.
  I would ask the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee if he can 
assure me that we continue our work and ensure the families in my 
district are protected from such unintended consequences and that they 
will be able to fully enjoy the benefits of this bill.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Will the gentlewoman yield?
  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. I yield to the gentleman.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank both the gentlewoman and 
the gentleman for stepping forward and being such strong advocates for 
taxpayers in a State that taxes its families and businesses, I think, 
almost beyond belief.
  Our goal in tax reform is to achieve tax relief for families and 
individuals across the country, regardless of where you live, and 
across all incomes, while, at the same time, unleashing the economic 
engine for American economic growth.
  California, by the way, under tax reform, is the number one job 
creator under the new Tax Code.
  So I agree with the gentleman and the gentlewoman. There are still 
some areas where we want to make and will make improvements in this 
bill. If they will work with us to continue to move this process 
forward, I am happy to commit to working with both of them to ensure we 
reach a positive outcome for their constituents and families as we 
reconcile our differences with the Senate.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, 33 percent of Mr. Knight's constituents derive a 
$16,000 annual benefit from the State and local tax deduction.
  In the case of the gentlewoman from California, 37 percent of her 
constituents enjoy an $18,200 State and local tax deduction benefit.
  Madam Speaker, in closing, more than anything else, this is, as I 
opened with, a missed opportunity.
  We all know what is wrong with this Tax Code. We could have found 
areas of compromise emphasizing the middle class and middle-income 
earners. We understand that the Tax Code that American corporations use 
is not competitive now internationally, but we wanted some relief for 
middle-income people.
  So here is where the investment could have taken place. We could have 
begun an investment in human capital. You have heard it tonight. We 
should all be alarmed by labor participation rates in America. We all 
should be alarmed by what has happened in the post-war period where, at 
one time, it was 63 percent, and now it is 63.8 percent.
  It is about technology; it is about globalization, for sure; but it 
is also about skill set. Eighteen thousand precision manufacturing jobs 
in New England go unanswered, the smallest geographic region of the 
country. The Department of Labor reported this week that 6 million jobs 
in America go unanswered. It is part of a skill set issue.
  You know what else we need to be concerned about?
  Two million people in America are addicted to opioids. That is what 
we should be concerned about as well as getting them back into the 
workplace through the trampoline effect, where they hit it and bounce 
back up into the mainstream. But that is not what we did.
  Without any hearings, without any chance for the minority to 
participate, in terms of substance, we moved forward.
  I want to say to the last two speakers, they are sincere enough. We 
have heard now four different people come to the well of this House on 
the other side and say to the chairperson of our committee and a 
friend: Are you going to fix this after the bill leaves here?
  Four different people asked for a fix. I want to tell you, based on 
long experience in this House, the path gets more narrow as it leaves 
this House. It doesn't grow more expansive. It will be harder to fix 
these things because of the budget score that was embraced.
  In 2001, we were promised widespread economic growth when President 
Bush took the Clinton surplus and offered $1.3 trillion worth of tax 
cuts. When you look at the distribution tables, they were right about 
one thing: everybody did get a tax cut. But then you look at those 
tables and you say: Let me examine who got what.
  In 2003, we came back and the President proposed $1 trillion worth of 
tax cuts based on the premise of economic growth, which didn't happen.

[[Page H9360]]

  By the way, in 2004, there was repatriation, which may be the 
granddaddy of them all. Well, we are going to repatriate those holdings 
offshore at 5\1/4\ percent o the premise of job growth. And there was 
none.

  We had this opportunity to do this together, as I described with 
worker participation rates, understanding that most families now are 
not having large numbers of children any longer. This should have been 
about immigration reform attached to it as well. We all know skilled 
workers from overseas are going to be an important part of the American 
economy, and we should be embracing that, along with sensible tax 
policies based upon some relief for the middle class.
  Instead, we are taking away the ability of American students to 
deduct interest on their loans to pay for a tax cut for people at the 
top?
  We are taking away a medical expense deduction for people who have 
Alzheimer's disease to pay for the tax cut for people at the top?
  We are assessing universities and colleges a new, special tax to pay 
for tax cuts for people at the top?
  We could have had this conversation. We acknowledge what President 
Reagan and Speaker O'Neill did because it was based upon good will and 
commonality and not needing just a political victory. Day after day 
they plowed through with 450 witnesses in front of the Ways and Means 
Committee.
  How many witnesses did we have in front of the Ways and Means 
Committee?
  Zero.
  How many hearings did we have on this tax bill?
  Zero.
  We saw the manager's amendment and were given 20 minutes to review 
it. I don't mean 25 minutes. I mean 20 minutes. Back to regular order. 
We should scrap this bill.
  To those who are vulnerable on the other side, I would not be 
trusting of the idea that these issues are going to be fixed after you 
cast this vote tomorrow morning. There will be an opportunity to go 
back and redo this if the other side would say: Let's find a meaningful 
path to cooperation between the two parties.
  That is all we are asking for on this side: include us in this 
discussion so we might invest in community colleges, vocational 
education, internship programs, skill set training, and answer the call 
of globalization.
  We still have innovation and creativity that far surpasses the rest 
of the world. There is nothing we can't answer in America without those 
healthy investments that we need.
  Instead, when you look at these distribution tables that are proposed 
as to who is going to get what; taking away the alternative minimum tax 
for the 4.5 million families that pay it; asking students to give up 
their student interest deduction; the estate tax, which we are 
repealing; and we are asking that loved ones who have Alzheimer's and 
being cared for at home to give up that medical deduction to pay for 
all of that, it makes no sense whatsoever. But there is an opportunity, 
Madam Speaker, to reverse course.
  In my years here, I can tell you this: Anybody who thinks that the 
United States Senate is going to accommodate their wishes, when they 
see the goalpost and the goal line of a handful of Members of this 
House, they are making a miscalculation.
  We have heard tonight they are going to do something about state and 
local tax deduction, they are going to do something about the historic 
tax credit, and they are going to revisit these issues.
  Do you know how difficult that is going to be, Madam Speaker?
  That is going to be nearly impossible.
  On top of that, they are going to go back and try to appeal the 
Affordable Care Act again and take 13 million people away from their 
insurance so that we can have a tax cut that further concentrates 
wealth for a handful of people in America?
  This is the House of Representatives, Madam Speaker, not the House of 
Lords. We don't serve here by peerage. We are not entitled to anything 
here. Most of us come from pretty modest backgrounds. That is the 
principle we should be honoring in this tax debate as we discuss who is 
about to pay what and what the rewards ought to be for the hardworking 
men and women.
  This is last note I am going to express before I yield back my time. 
What about those 1 million veterans who have served us honorably in 
Iraq and Afghanistan?
  New veterans, what about them?
  Are we going to eventually cut their benefits with Social Security 
and Medicare and Medicaid and put it all on the chopping block as we 
attempt to further concentrate wealth in America, particularly for 
unearned income, by the way?
  That is where we are heading.
  We should honor the skills of those men and women who get up every 
day and strive and work hard in this country with a sense of purpose 
and great patriotism. That is what we should be acknowledging in this 
debate.
  I am looking forward to tomorrow morning, when we conclude this 
debate and spend the 2 hours discussing more of what we have witnessed 
here tonight. There will be more than enough enthusiasm on our side. 
They will be lined up to RFK Stadium to participate tomorrow morning in 
this debate. That is how important this is to the future of the 
American people.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, Washington is just hilarious.
  Lawmakers back home tell everyone they are for tax reform, until it 
comes actually time to do it. Everyone says they want a fairer, 
flatter, simpler Tax Code, as long as you keep every special interest 
provision in this big, fat, messed-up Tax Code.
  Everyone says they want to give people back more of what they earned 
and get Main Street businesses going, as long as you don't change 
anything in the Tax Code. As long as the lobbyists win and the American 
people lose, they are willing to talk about it.
  House Republicans are actually acting on tax reform for the first 
time in 31 years.
  In Washington, they sneer at that family of four back home making 
$59,000 a year. That is the average household. Under our tax reform, 
they pay $1,182 less that they keep in their pocket. Washington makes 
fun of that. That is real money for families.

  A firefighter making $48,000 a year keeps over $1,300. That single 
mom working hard every day making $30,000 a year has a $700 larger 
refund than she gets today.
  That Main Street startup business working I don't know how many 
hours, making $62,000 a year--that was my Chamber of Commerce member 
right there--in that startup business, they keep $3,007 more than they 
do today. Washington just laughs at that. But it is real money for real 
people.
  In my district, a family of four making $90,000--two teachers--keeps 
$2,176 more every year of their life from this.
  My friends on the Democrat side now worry about the debt. I remember 
the first year Democrats took control of the House, they doubled the 
deficit. The second year, they tripled it. The third year, it went to 
$1 trillion. It stayed that way until the American people gave the 
House back to Republicans.
  They love spending money and raising the deficit when they let 
Washington grow, but when it is time to grow jobs and paychecks, all of 
a sudden they are worried about the debt.
  The truth of the matter is we want to keep this debt and deficits 
going. Don't change anything. Keep this slow-growth economy, keep 
spending, and I guarantee you debts and deficits will grow.
  We are talking about growing jobs, growing paychecks, and getting 
back to a balanced budget by getting this economy moving in a big way.
  At the end of the day, it is time to end the status quo in 
Washington, D.C. Americans deserve a fair, flatter Tax Code, one that 
closes loopholes and ends special interest deductions so that Americans 
can keep more of what they earn, so their paychecks can raise and our 
businesses can compete and win anywhere in the world, especially here 
at home America.
  It is time our jobs start coming back to America, rather than 
watching them go: our jobs, research, manufacturing patents, our 
headquarters. That era is over, and it starts with H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act.

[[Page H9361]]

  We will continue this debate tomorrow, Madam Speaker, so we will 
continue to deliver tax reform and tax cuts for the American people.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of H.R. 1 is postponed.
