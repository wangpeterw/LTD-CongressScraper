  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the next set of nominations to the 
Treasury Department are critical for tax reform.
  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the en bloc 
consideration of the following nominations: Executive Calendar Nos. 
111, 113, 114, 184, and 244.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nominations en bloc.
  The bill clerk read the nominations of David Malpass, of New York, to 
be an Under Secretary of the Treasury; Brent James McIntosh, of 
Michigan, to be General Counsel for the Department of the Treasury; 
Andrew K. Maloney, of Virginia, to be a Deputy Under Secretary of the 
Treasury; David J. Kautter, of Virginia, to be an Assistant Secretary 
of the Treasury; and Christopher Campbell, of California, to be an 
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the 
nominations en bloc.
  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the 
nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate; that if 
confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon 
the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the 
Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any 
statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Malpass, 
McIntosh, Maloney, Kautter, and Campbell nominations en bloc?
  The nominations were confirmed en bloc.
