                         TRIBUTE TO MARY REGULA

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, at this spring season of new life, please 
let us pay tribute to the spirited life of a visionary woman dedicated 
to high learning and civic improvement, Mary Regula from Ohio, who 
tragically passed this last week.
  As an educator first, her love of history drew her to national 
causes. Mary had a style and a spirit all her own. I vividly recall her 
dressing as Mary Todd Lincoln at the dedication of the First Ladies 
Museum in Canton, Ohio, which she had spearheaded, as she dutifully and 
lovingly put in place fascinating historical truth about a long-
neglected dimension of American political life.
  A soulmate to her beloved husband, the very honorable Ohio 
Congressman Ralph Regula, Mary was a beautiful and engaging force for 
good and for progress on many levels.
  On countless late nights here in the Capitol, she would work into the 
evening with her husband. Then, when votes were complete, they would 
drive home together, usually in Ralph's red pickup truck. Their service 
was a patriotic love of America.
  May Mary Regula's family and friends, and the people of greater 
Canton, Ohio, which Mary and her husband served for 36 years, know our 
abiding gratitude for their service and for electing such an 
extraordinary Congressman, a seasoned appropriator, and his awesome 
life partner, beloved Mary.
