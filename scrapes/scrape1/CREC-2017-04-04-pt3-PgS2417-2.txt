                          TRIBUTE TO FREY TODD

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today it is my privilege to celebrate 
the retirement of Frey Todd, the ``Mayor for Life'' of Eubank, KY.
  In the last census, Eubank was home to fewer than 400 Kentuckians, 
but despite their small number, the Eubank community is proud of their 
town and their mayor.
  Since the 1960s, Todd has served his community on the town board. He 
spent 10 years as the chair of the board, and when Kentucky reorganized 
municipal governments in 1982 and the position of mayor became 
available, he proudly was elected its first mayor. And every 4 years 
since, Todd has been elected by his constituents to be their mayor.
  Over his 35-year tenure as mayor, Todd has overseen major projects 
like the construction of the senior citizens center and the Eubank 
Water System.
  In a small town like Eubank, the people and their government are 
almost as close as family. Throughout his entire career, Mayor Todd has 
shown his passion for his constituents, and they have returned the 
affection.
  At the age of 82, Todd announced his retirement from public service. 
I would like to join with all the people of Eubank to thank him for his 
years of dedication and congratulate him on an impressive career.
