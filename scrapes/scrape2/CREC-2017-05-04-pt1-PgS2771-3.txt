                    TRIBUTE TO J.P. AND TIARA THOMAS

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct 
honor of recognizing the Thomas family for giving their time and talent 
to serve as foster parents for children in Lake County. J.P. Thomas and 
his wife, Tiara Thomas, have done honorable work by providing structure 
and consistency in many young lives.
  J.P. and Tiara began serving as foster parents in their early 
twenties. The young couple took a short break from fostering as their 
own family began to grow, but soon returned to serving as foster 
parents in order to help their community. They have provided a positive 
environment for 15 Montana children in their home on the Flathead 
Indian Reservation. Throughout the challenging journey of serving as 
foster parents, J.P. and Tiara give credit to the Cornerstone Faith 
Center in St. Ignatius for helping them find the balance to meet the 
demands of faith, family, fostering, youth sports, and work.

  Montanans that provide structure and consistency to youngsters in 
need are deserving of our support. When those Montanans are like J.P. 
and Tiara and simply do what is needed in a humble and gracious manner, 
their service can inspire others. Thank you, J.P. and Tiara, for all 
you have done and are still doing to help others.
