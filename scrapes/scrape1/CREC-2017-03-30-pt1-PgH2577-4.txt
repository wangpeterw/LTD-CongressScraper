                   NATIONAL VIETNAM WAR VETERANS DAY

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this week was the first-ever celebration of 
National Vietnam War Veterans Day.
  Over 40 years ago, after the last remaining Vietnam veterans returned 
home, many faced poor treatment from the country they were fighting to 
protect. These brave men and women are getting the welcome home finally 
that they deserve.
  Earlier this week, the U.S. Senate introduced a bill that was passed, 
which introduced the Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act, which 
unanimously passed both the House and Senate, and President Trump 
signed it into law earlier this week.
  I was proud to join my colleagues in supporting this bill. The 
overwhelmingly bipartisan support is proof that finally the perception 
of Vietnam veterans has shifted over the years as folks begin to better 
understand the sacrifices they have made.
  Over 9 million Americans served in the military during the Vietnam 
war, and over 2.7 million actually served in Vietnam. I personally know 
many who came from my district and now live in northern California.
  Over the course of the war, the United States of America suffered

58,000 casualties, with hundreds of thousands more wounded and 
disabled. We need to remember the sacrifice they made, whether it was 
from Agent Orange or disabilities, or even the 22 veterans we lose each 
day to suicide.
  We welcome home the Vietnam veterans. I am glad we could have this 
recognition for them.
