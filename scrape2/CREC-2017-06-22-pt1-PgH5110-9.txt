            By Mr. GOSAR:
        H.R. 3005.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
        Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 (The Property Clause). The 
     Property Clause states that Congress has the power to make 
     all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or 
     other property belonging to the United States. The Supreme 
     Court in Fort Leavenworth Railroad v. Lowe (1885), reasoned 
     that the authority of the federal government over federal 
     lands is ``necessarily paramount.'' The Court opinion went on 
     to further reason that state governments also have rights 
     though with regards to certain activities that take place on 
     federal lands within state borders. The Act provides 
     guidelines for controlling populations of bison in Grand 
     Canyon National Park and requires the Secretary to coordinate 
     with the appropriate State Wildlife Management Agency, thus 
     making it constitutionally permissible.
