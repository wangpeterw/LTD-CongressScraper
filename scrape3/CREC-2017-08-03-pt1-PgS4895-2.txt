       (A) to mitigate the risk of land-based marine debris 
     contributed by such countries reaching an ocean; and

  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to take a brief detour and 
congratulate my colleague who has been working aggressively as we 
worked to address the issue of marine debris. This is something on 
which, as members of the Oceans Caucus, we have been working with 
Senator Sullivan, Senator Whitehouse, and so many. I want to 
acknowledge the good work that has gone into this particular piece of 
legislation we have just passed.
