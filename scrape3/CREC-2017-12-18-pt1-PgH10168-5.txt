          TAX BILL IMPACTING VETERANS AND ACTIVE-DUTY MILITARY

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, wherever I go throughout my district 
and speak to an audience, I always acknowledge the veterans and Active-
Duty military. I think that is one unifying factor for this Congress 
and for this Nation.
  Today, the President offered a national security strategy. During his 
first 12 months, that strategy has been haphazard and lacking 
understanding. All of us, however, want to have a strong military, 
strong military families, and strong resources for our Active Duty and 
our veterans.
  It is sad, however, that in the next 2 days we will be voting on a 
tax bill that will take $2.3 trillion out of our budget and create a 
debt. It will raid Medicare and Medicaid, impacting some of those very 
soldiers and veterans' families. As well, in this new bill, the top 1 
percent will get 83 percent of this tax bill.
  Isn't it interesting, if you are a family of four making $59,000, 
there will be $1,800 not given to you but taken away?
  We can't have it all, Mr. Speaker. We can't have a strong strategy, 
of which

there was none today, by taking $2.3 trillion away from the men and 
women of this Nation.
