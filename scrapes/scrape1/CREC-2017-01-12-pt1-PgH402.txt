                THE TRUE DRIVERS OF MINNESOTA'S ECONOMY

  (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate three small 
businesses in Elk River, Minnesota, who have been recognizedby the Elk 
River Chamber of Commerce for their outstanding track record over the 
past year.
  I want to congratulate the First National Bank for being named 
Business of the Year, Serrano Brothers Catering for beingrecognized as 
the New Business of the Year, and Sportech for being honored as the 
Employer of the Year.
  Small businesses are a huge driver of our economy in the State of 
Minnesota, and they are what make each city and townunique. Running a 
small business is no easy task, and the entrepreneurs who open these 
businesses take a personal risk to bringjobs, commerce, and excellent 
products and services to our communities.
  We cannot thank them enough for their valuable contribution, which is 
why I am proud today to thank and congratulate FirstNational Bank, 
Serrano Brothers Catering, and Sportech for everything they do for our 
community and for the great State ofMinnesota.
