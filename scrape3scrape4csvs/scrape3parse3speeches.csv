538,topic-id,1474,"Mr.President, I see Senators Isakson and Tester are here. I think they want to make remarks before the vote.  Let me say a few words following up on Senator Murray, and then I will place the rest of my comments in the  This is very important legislation. Last year, we passed the 21st Century Cures Act to move these modern medical miracles into medicine cabinets and doctors' offices more rapidly. This is funding that pays for one-quarter of the Food and Drug Administration, which has a critical role in approving the safety and effectiveness of drugs, treatments, and devices. As with most things in the Senate that actually are important and work well and get a result, a lot of hard work has gone into this.  It started 2 years ago with Republicans and Democrats; Senator Murray and I and our staffs working together with the House of Representatives at the same time, working with manufacturers, the FDA, many others, working out many differences of opinion. So now we are going to get to a result within a few minutes. We are probably going to adopt this by voice vote almost unanimously. Everyone will say that must have been easy. It wasn't that easy, but it is how work gets done in the U.Senate when we do it well.  I want to comment on our colleagues and the staff and the House of Representatives on what they have done. We will continue to focus our attention on the 21st Century Cures A piece of legislation is not worth the paper it is printed on unless it is implemented properly, but this funding today, done in a timely way, says to the men and women who work at the Food and Drug Administration and to their leader, Gottlieb: We value what you do.  In the 21st Century Cures Act, we gave the Commissioner more authority to hire and pay talented people to work at FDA and approve these medical miracles that are coming. We are reauthorizing the user fees in a timely way so the FDA's work will not be interrupted.  I thank Senator Murray for the way she worked on this. This is typical of our committee when we work well, which we most always do.  I will make remarks in the Record concerning the staff. They are almost too numerous to mention. Senator Murray's staff, my staff, Chairman Walden's staff, Ranking Member Pallone's staff, Food and Drug Administration staff, Congressional Budget Office legislative counsel, and Senator McConnell's staff--they have all been critical to the success we are about to have today.  I would like to thank the staff who have been devoted to reauthorizing these important programs. Some of them have been working on this bill for over 2 years. I am deeply grateful to them. I have deep appreciation for their hard work, their ingenuity, and their skill in helping us come to this result. Without their hard work and tireless effort, we wouldn't have been able to pass this before the deadline, ensuring the FDA can continue its important mission.  On Senator Murray's exceptional staff, I would like to thank Evan Schatz, John Righter, Nick Bath, Andi Fristedt, and Remy  On my hard-working and dedicated staff, I would like to thank David Cleary, Lindsey Seidman, Allison Martin, Mary-Sumpter Lapinski, Grace Stuntz, Margaret Coulter, Curtis Vann, Lowell Schiller, Bobby McMillin, Liz Wolgemuth, Margaret Atkinson, Taylor Haulsee, Elizabeth Gibson, and Anthony  On Chairman Walden's staff, I would like to thank Ray Baum, Paul Edattel, and John  On Ranking Member Pallone's staff, I would like to thank Jeff Carroll, Tiffany Guarascio, and Kimberlee I would also like to thank much of the hard-working staff from the Food and Drug Administration who provided great help in getting this bill completed and working out the user fee agreements in a timely manner. From legislative counsel from the House and Senate, I would like to thank Warren Burke, Michelle Vanek, Kim Tamber, and Katie  From the Congressional Budget Office, I would like to thank Darren Young, Andrea Noda, Chad Chirico, Holly Harvey, Ellen Werble, and Rebecca  On Senator McConnell's staff, I would like to thank Scott  On Speaker Ryan's staff, I would like to thank Matt  Finally, I would like to thank all the patients, doctors, researchers, innovators, thought leaders, and experts who dedicated time and expertise to helping improve the legislation and supporting its approval.  To reiterate, today the Senate will take up and I expect it will pass the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017 to speed cures and treatments into patients' medicine cabinets.  Last year, 94 Senators voted to pass 21st Century Cures and send $4.8-billion to spur medical research at the National Institutes of  Leader McConnell called it the ``most important piece of legislation'' that year.  Today's passage of the FDA user fees will help ensure advancements in research supported by 21st Century Cures actually make it to patients who are waiting.  The Food and Drug Administration is the agency responsible for making sure promising research supported by 21st Century Cures can turn into lifesaving treatments and cures.  This legislation we will vote on today includes four FDA user fee agreements--which are set to expire on September 30--and will speed the agency's ability to review new prescription drugs, generic drugs, biosimilar drugs, and medical devices and bring those treatments and cures to patients more quickly.  This legislation will reauthorize the authority for the FDA to accept user fees--paid by manufacturers of drugs and medical devices--that account for $8 to $9 billion over 5 years and is over a quarter of all FDA funding.  The reauthorizations are based on recommendations from industry and FDA after a thorough public process.[[Page S4791]]  FDA posted meeting minutes after every negotiation and held public meetings before discussion began and to hear feedback on the draft recommendations last fall.  We began almost 2 years ago working in a bipartisan way to reauthorize and update the user fee agreements. We held 15 bipartisan Senate health committee briefings, including several with the House Energy and Commerce  In the Senate HELP Committee, we held two bipartisan hearings on these agreements--one in March and one in April of this year.  We heard from the FDA, witnesses representing the manufacturers of drugs and medical devices, and witnesses representing the patients who rely on the products they make.  Throughout this process, we have worked closely with the In April, the leaders of the Senate and House health committees released a discussion draft of bipartisan legislation to reauthorize and update the user-fee agreements and which reflected the recommendations sent to Congress by the FDA in  In May, the Senate HELP Committee overwhelmingly approved this legislation reauthorizing the user fees by a vote of 21 to 2. This also included over 20 provisions that were adopted in committee and were priorities for HELP members.  The bill includes provisions from Senators Isakson and Bennet to improve the medical device inspection process; Senators Hassan and Young to improve communication about abuse-deterrent opioid products; Senators Enzi and Franken to encourage medical device development for children and make sure FDA has appropriate expertise to review devices for children; Senators Roberts, Donnelly, and Burr to allow more appropriate classification of accessories used with medical devices; Senators Collins, Franken, McCaskill, and Cotton to improve generic drug development and help lower prescription drug costs; Senators Hatch, Bennet, Burr, and Casey to improve access to clinical trials for all patients; and Senators Bennet, Rubio, Van Hollen, and Gardner to increase the development of new drugs to treat pediatric cancers and other diseases.  The House passed this user fee legislation on July 12 by voice vote.  Now it is our turn to pass this bipartisan legislation that is integral to helping patients and families who rely on the lifesaving medical innovation that FDA is responsible for reviewing.  The goal of getting this to the President's desk is an important one. If we do not pass this legislation before the end of September, FDA will begin sending layoff notices to more than 5,000 employees to notify them that they may lose their job in 60 days.  If we do not pass this bill, a FDA reviewer who gets started reviewing a cancer drug submitted to the agency in April could be laid off before the reviewer is able to finish his or her work.  A delay in reauthorizing the user fees would not only harm patients and families who rely on medical innovation, but it would threaten biomedical industry jobs and jeopardize America's global leadership in biomedical innovation.  I am glad the Senate is taking the step of voting on this legislation today. I look forward to supporting this important bipartisan bill and sending it to the President's desk. I urge my colleagues to support it as well.

The 88th Regional Support Command, RSC, began as the 88th Infantry Division, Organized in August 1917 at Camp Dodge, IA, the members of the ``Cloverleaf Division'' fought among the Allied Forces in the Alsace They returned home following the war, and the Army demobilized the unit in June 1919.  Three years later, the 88th reformed within the Organized Reserve, with headquarters in Minneapolis and subordinate units elsewhere in Minnesota, Iowa, and North The 88th ID mobilized in 1942 to serve the United States in World War It was one of the first units comprised solely of drafted soldiers. Despite a lack of experience, the 88th quickly gained a reputation as an effective unit of well-trained soldiers, which the Germans referred to as the ``Blue Devils.''  The 88th ID fought on the front lines during the 1944 Italian campaign. Its arrival provided much-needed relief to the allied soldiers fighting on the Italian front. Led by Major General John Sloan, the 88th was the first division to enter the newly liberated After 100 straight days of activation, the Blue Devils were finally scheduled to receive a much-needed respite from the war. However, MG Sloan quickly instituted a training regimen that kept his soldiers in fighting condition, and they were ordered to head north to combat the Germans and provide support for American soldiers in Northern  For 344 days, the 88th Infantry fought to protect our American values during World War At the beginning of the war, MG Sloan promised, ``the glory of the colors will never be sullied, as long as one man of the 88th still lives.'' Although many lives were lost, the 88th Infantry Division was deactivated in October 1947, having fulfilled MG Sloan's promise.  In April 1996, the 88th ID was redesignated as the 88th Headquartered in Fort McCoy, WI, the 88th RSC provides logistical and administrative support for Army Reserve soldiers. Whether they are providing training logistics, equipment maintenance or medical support, the members of the 88th RSC are making a difference for servicemen and servicewomen from Wisconsin all the way to the Pacific  Today the 88th ID lives on through the 88th Regional Support Having fought in the Vietnam war, Operation Desert Shield/Storm, Bosnia, Kosovo, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the soldiers of the 88th RSC continue to support the more than 55,000 U.Army Reserve soldiers, families, and civilians across the United I am proud to recognize 100 years of their remarkable service and accomplishments.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-03-pt1-PgS4823-3.txt,1558,SPOOFING PREVENTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,3.0,August

186,topic-id,745,"Mr.President, I feel sorry for the Presiding This is the second time in a week he has had to listen to me talk on the floor.  I thank the Senator from Nebraska for her graciousness in letting me go first.  America, the Senate has passed the bill. We passed the bill. Today, the Senate passed the RACE for Children Act as part of the FDA user fee bill.  The RACE Act represents a breakthrough for kids fighting cancer. Each year, over 15,000 children will be diagnosed with the disease; 2,000 will lose their lives.  Across America, pediatric cancer is the leading cause of death for our children. Previously, companies with new treatments for adults studied their potential benefits for kids. Companies exploring medication for adult diabetes, for example, also researched its potential for use in children. This research is vital because it provides critical information to doctors for treating sick children. Specifically, it helps them ensure that the treatments and dosages they prescribe are safe for young bodies. But there was a gap in the law as it existed before we passed this law.  Drug companies with new, precision medicine for adult cancers did not have to study possible value for pediatric cancers. That meant our kids continued to receive older treatments--some from the 1960s--which often had harmful side effects and consequences that can last a lifetime.  At the same time, breakthrough treatments have become available for adults, with better results and fewer harmful effects. While these treatments have great promise for kids, we were not doing enough to explore that potential.  Over the last 20 years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved 190 new cancer treatments for adults but just 3 new treatments for children. The FDA saw that gap, and they asked us to close it. That is precisely what the RACE for Children Act will do. For the first time in the country's history, it would require drug companies to study the potential of promising adult cancer treatments for children, closing this gap in the law and opening the door to promising new treatments for children in need.  Before this bill, thousands of kids in America lacked access to cutting-edge treatments and precision medicine that could have made the difference in their struggle against cancer.  During my time in the Senate, I have seen the anguish of too many parents who learned not only that their child has cancer but that they have little or no options for treatment. This bill will give them more options. It will give them more hope.  For Delaney from Grand Junction, CO, this bill could have been lifesaving. She battled cancer for over 5 years but passed away a year ago when she was out of treatment options. I wish to dedicate our work on this bill to her and to all kids who are bravely battling cancer day in and day out around the world.  We also should dedicate it to everyone who called and wrote and shared their family stories over the past months. This bill would never have passed without their voices. For people interested in keeping the system the same way, it was the voices of these families--in many instances, people who faced horrible tragedies in their lives--who made this possible. Because they engaged in this process, we passed a bill that will give thousands of kids a better chance to beat cancer and reclaim their lives.  America leads the world when it comes to treating cancer. We pioneer the latest and safest treatments. Every American should have access to them, especially our kids, whose bright lives have just begun.  I want to recognize and acknowledge all of the pediatric cancer groups that came together to advance this bill, including pediatric advocates, cancer advocates, and hospitals in Colorado and around the country.  I also want to acknowledge, as always, the great leadership provided by Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, and their staff for their work on this and the FDA user fee bill.  Finally, I wish to thank my partner in this work, Senator Rubio, from Florida, for his leadership and passionate advocacy on behalf of our kids.  This bill is a reminder that, when we drop the political fights, we can focus on fights that truly matter, such as the fight against cancer, the fight for better healthcare in this country, and the fight for our kids and their future.

463,topic-id,1840,"Mr.President, tonight I rise to address another issue--the Trump administration's decision to end the program known as  DACA provided deportation relief to nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came to this country as children. Those kids grew up in America alongside America's children, playing on our Little League teams, running for student government, marching in the school band. Just like America's kids, they showed up to class, they did their homework, and they pushed forward with every expectation of building a future for themselves and for their communities. The only difference between them is that the kids covered by DACA came to America as undocumented immigrants.  Many of these kids didn't even know they didn't have legal status. I know this firsthand because I used to be the Superintendent of the Denver Public It was about ninth grade that children would realize--children who had no country other than the United States as their home--that they didn't have legal status because they had come here through no fault of their own without documented status.  A lot of these kids found out the hard way, applying for jobs that asked for papers they didn't have, applying for financial aid they were ineligible to receive, and coping with the possibility of being ripped away from friends and family at any time. DACA ended that. It stopped it. Nationwide, it protected nearly 800,000 young adults from deportation and gave them lawful presence in the only country they knew to build a future. That is precisely what they have done.  Since DACA was enacted, the young people who enrolled in the program have grown into young adults. They have found jobs. They pay taxes. They have started businesses. They have bought homes. They are raising families.  In Colorado, over 17,000 young people came forward to take the government at its word, to share their information, and to apply for deferred action. Each one of them placed their faith in us to protect them and their families until we came to a long-term solution about their status. Today, President Trump has betrayed that trust. Worse, his decision to rescind DACA betrays the very character of our country.  America does not strip parents from their children. We do not strip brothers from sisters. America does not round up neighbors to send them to places they have not known since they were 2 years old or 6 months old, if they knew them at all. We do not use kids and families as some kind of bargaining chip for legislation. That is not who we are. This decision will not only hurt families and communities, but it will hurt our economy, as 90 percent of DACA recipients work, and 7 in 10 have bachelor's degrees or higher. They pay taxes. Over the next 2 years, ending DACA could force hundreds of thousands of people to lose their jobs. Colorado alone stands to lose over $850 million in economic activity every single year as a result of this rash decision. That is why business leaders all across my State have decried this decision as not only cruel but costly.  President Trump campaigned to strengthen families and our economy. With this decision, he is taking aim at both. Now parents all across America are planning where to send their kids if they are deported. Young professionals worry about what will happen to their mortgages, their car payments, and their student loans if they are fired and[[Page S4957]]forced to leave. Business owners wonder how they will make up for the hard workers whom they have come to rely on over the years. Once again, President Trump has unleashed needless anxiety and uncertainty across  This weekend, I was thinking we would never have been in this position if Congress had acted to fix our broken immigration system to ensure legal status for everybody protected by deferred action. Like the Presiding Officer, I was part of the Gang of 8, which wrote the immigration bill in the It was four Democrats and four Republicans who worked together over a period of 8 months in a process that I think the American people would be justifiably proud of. For once in Washington, people sat down in a bipartisan way to actually solve the problems that face this country. We were not making trades. We were not holding each other hostage in that room. We knew that securing the border was an important good, and we knew a pathway to citizenship was an important good.  We delivered both to the floor of this In fact, the bill had very meaningful border security. It is the only bill that has passed either the House or the Senate that has had any border security and internal security as well and, as I mentioned, a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented people who are here, including everybody who is protected by It was a good bill--I think it was a great bill--and it got 68 votes in the If the House had done what the American people had wanted us to do, it would have passed our bill, and we would not have had to go through the agony of what the Trump administration is doing to immigrants in this country right now.  I think Congress needs to act swiftly to clean up the damage the administration has unleashed, and that starts with passing the Dream Now is the time for our Republican colleagues to come forward on this important piece of legislation that historically has been supported by  Tonight, I thank my colleague from Colorado, Senator Cory Gardner, for doing just that and joining me as a cosponsor of the Dream We have an opportunity to come together as Republicans and Democrats in order to give young people the certainty they deserve and the legal path to stay in the only country they know. This is not about left versus right, although I say that about everything in this place, but in this case it really is true. This is about doing right for the young people who are, in every sense, our fellow  It is about doing the right thing for people in Colorado, like Marissa Marissa was 9 years old when her parents took her from Mexico to She grew up in Glenwood Springs on the West She worked hard and planned on going to college until she realized, like so many young people whom I have met, that she was ineligible for in-state tuition because of her legal status, but she was determined to make it work anyway. She cleaned houses with her mom and tutored other students in All of that helped, but it was not enough. By her junior year, Marissa's family had little money left, and she nearly had to drop out.  Then DACA went into effect, and Marissa was able to secure Federal student loans and graduate summa cum laude from Fort Lewis College in Determined to give back, Marissa spent 2 years teaching in my old school district, in the Denver Public She did not have any background in education, but she wanted to pay it forward by helping other kids achieve.  Like Marissa, Marco Dorado came to Denver when he was just 3 years old. His parents have worked in our community for over two decades in order to provide for him and his three siblings. Marco was the first person in his family to graduate from high school, but after graduating, he could not get a job because he did not have a Social Security card. He could not get a driver's license, and he could not get a student loan--a bright future frozen in place. Marco felt trapped in a system with no way forward.  Then the last President announced DACA in 2012. Marco got his Social Security card, his driver's license, and financial aid to attend the University of As he studied for a degree in finance, he worked between classes and interned at our State capitol. There, he learned something about politics, and he was voted student body president by his peers at CU, at the University of  In every practical sense there is, Marco is an He has no memory of life before He grew up in our schools, played alongside our kids, attended our colleges, and has been working to improve this democracy. His two younger brothers and sisters, as is so often the case, were born here.  A decent and compassionate administration would find a way for Marco to stay in the only community he knows. A smart and forward-looking administration would seize on this young man's talent and commitment to our A wise administration would recognize in Marco and Marissa the best qualities of America--hard work, family, perseverance, and service. Instead--and I regret this--we have the Trump administration, which threatens to rip them from their families, tear them from the communities they have built in Colorado, and deprive our Nation of their obvious and considerable talent.  The administration's decision today has thrown hundreds of thousands of people like Marco and Marissa into needless chaos and fear. For what--to satisfy the smallest fringe of the far right? A majority of the Republicans in my State not only support the Dream Act but support a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented people who are here. Unfortunately, today's decision is just the latest example of the violence this President has done to our country's traditions.  Because of his rhetoric against immigrants, against Muslims, his equivocation about White nationalists, there is a deep unease in this country. I have heard it in townhalls across In times like these, it falls on all of us--not just on the people in the Senate--to put our hands on someone else's shoulder and say: I am glad you are here. Thank you for the contribution you have made by working in our fields and in our factories. We are grateful for what you have done for our communities. We are glad you are studying at the University of Denver or CSU or Though we need legislation to undo the administration's actions today, this goes well beyond any law on the books. It goes to who we are as a nation.  Earlier this year, at my home, I hosted five college students who had received protection under the DACA I made them breakfast, and we sat around the backyard to talk. I heard the worries they had that no young person in this country should have to bear, but I also heard an incredible sense of aspiration that any American would recognize--dreams of finishing college, launching a business, leading a nonprofit, starting a family. That is no surprise because these kids are American in every way that counts, and like young people across the country, they envision a bright future for themselves. We have taught them to do that since they were kids. Now we should let them realize it.  I thank my colleague from Washington for her patience.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Daines).

We lost her a year ago, and I take this moment today to pay tribute to her and the impact she had on our  There is no doubt that the name Phyllis Schlafly will be mentioned in the history of conservatism.  Upon Phyllis's receiving of the Women of Achievement Award in 1963, publisher of Louis Globe-Democrat Richard Amberg stated that ``Phyllis Schlafly stands for everything that has made America great and for those things which will keep it that way.''  Our late President, Ronald Reagan, said to Phyllis Schlafly, ``Eagle Forum has set a high standard of volunteer participation in the political and legislative process. . . . You've been out front on so many of the most important issues of our time. . . . Your work is an example to all those who would struggle for an America that is prosperous and free. . . . Our nation needs the kind of dedicated individual volunteer service you and Eagle Forum have demonstrated over the last 20 years.''  Phyllis was born and raised in Louis, She attended college at Washington University and received her master of arts degree at Radcliffe She married John Fred Schlafly, Jr., in 1949 and had six children. In 1972, Phyllis established Eagle Forum, and her work to strengthen conservative principles flourished from there. Her voice became the conservative conscience of the GOP, and she was never afraid to let me or any other member of the Republican Party know when she felt we were not true to those ideals.  While I wish today to commemorate her upon the anniversary of her death, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that her passing did not end her life's work.  Her legacy of strong conservative values continues today through organizations, books, and through the passion[[Page S4928]]she ignited in fellow conservatives. Whether or not one agrees or disagrees with her points of view, one must acknowledge her crucial part in the history of American politics.  When she began speaking publicly in the 1960s, Phyllis blazed a trail and encouraged women and mothers everywhere to step into American politics and issues of the day. She wasn't afraid to voice the thoughts she had that others agreed with, yet were too afraid to speak; nor was she afraid to challenge those with whom she disagreed. Phyllis demonstrated to all of us that every voice matters and reminded us that a powerful voice lies not in whoever is talking the loudest but whoever sees potential for change.  Phyllis was a pioneer for women in the world of politics, especially for conservative women, and simultaneously encouraged all Americans to get involved in issues bigger than themselves.  She advocated tirelessly throughout her life and never retired. She was one of the first conservatives to publicly endorse then-candidate Donald At her 2016 funeral, President Trump said, ``Her legacy will live on every time some underdog--outmatched and outgunned--defies the odds and delivers a win for the people.''  Phyllis Schlafly lived a life of dedication and perseverance. She continuously served our Nation through her inspiring speeches, encouraging attitude, and passion for the future.

It also honors those who have earned the deep respect and admiration of their professional colleagues.  Davis is one of the longest sitting college presidents in the entire United States, serving for over 40 years. He became president of Alice Lloyd College in Kentucky in 1977 and served until 1988, when he became president of the College of the Ozarks, where he remains today.  Throughout his tenure as president, he has transformed the College of the Ozarks into a unique higher education institution with an endowment over $500 million. Nearly every student graduates debt-free by working at on-campus jobs--a significant achievement at a time when student loans are a major burden for many students and families around the country.  Davis is also responsible for creating the College of the Ozarks Patriotic Travel This program pairs veterans with college students to help instill appreciation for the sacrifices of American servicemen and women by traveling back to the battlefields of our Nation's wars. To date, over 300 students have traveled to Vietnam, Japan, and South Korea with over 150 veterans.  Davis's deep love for his country is also reflected by his work to honor those that have sacrificed for our Nation by building memorials on campus. Under Davis's leadership, the college built memorials honoring Missouri Vietnam veterans, the heroes of 9/11, and Missouri Gold Star families. In the spring of 2018, the college will dedicate a new memorial honoring the Korean war.

This is a huge win for 80,000 Boeing employees in the State of Washington as well as for the 1,700 suppliers and individual businesses across our State who support our strong aerospace economy.  It is also a loss to the European Union in its efforts to retaliate against the United States for our challenge to illegal launch aid to Airbus that began more than 10 years ago. This shows it was right to raise these concerns by the United States and that the retaliation by Airbus was wrong.  Last year, the WTO ruled that the EU had not taken steps to comply with its previous ruling regarding $17 billion in illegal launch aid to Airbus, and that it had given another $5 billion in illegal launch aid to the A350 Program even after these kinds of subsidies had been declared illegal.

A number of our Senators are heading for their home States this afternoon and tomorrow to begin what is traditionally called the August recess. I am fortunate to live in Delaware, and I can go home every night. Some people see it as a blessing, others as a curse. I see it as a blessing to go home and stay a while. I am looking forward to that.  We have three Senate office buildings here on Capitol Hill that Senators share and where they have their office space. The oldest is The next oldest is The newest is a building they call the Hart Senate Office For 16 or 17 years, my staff and I have been in the Hart Building--and by choice. Every 2 years we can change offices, but we always want to stay in the same office, which is sort of unusual when you have been here for 16 or 17 years.  Sometimes a lot of people say the names Russell or Dirksen or Russell and Dirksen are pretty famous folks, even now. Hart is less well known. I will not take a lot of time to give a deep history of who Philip Hart was, but he was a Senator from Michigan and he was a His time here preceded my time.  I was elected State treasurer for Delaware in 1976, a Congressman in 1982, and Governor in 1992. Then, I came to the Senate in 2001. But for Philip Hart and me, as far as I know, our service never crossed. If we did, I am not aware.  I don't know a lot of the things he was famous for. There are some of his famous quotes, but one of my all-time favorite quotations are the words I believe he said when he left this place. He left the Senate and retired. Some say he left too soon, but when he retired, he said these words: ``I leave as I arrived, understanding clearly the complexity of the world into which we were born and optimistic that if we give it our best shot, we will come close to achieving the goals set for us 200 years ago.''  That is what he said. Aren't those wonderful words? At a time when we could actually use a little bit of encouragement, I hope that, maybe, his words provide at least a small measure. For me, they always provided a large measure.  If you go back to the beginning of this Congress, January 3, and the inauguration of the President on January 20 of this year, there were high hopes[[Page S4807]]on both sides to immediately get to work on comprehensive tax reform; on transportation and infrastructure policy for roads, highways, bridges, rails, ports, broadband, and maybe our electric grid. There was the idea of doing something for our Republican friends to repeal the Affordable Care  As it turns out, we have in some cases disappointed, and in other cases we probably have pleased the folks who elected us to serve them, in developing and creating some of the policy for our country.  I spent a fair amount of time on healthcare. I know the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Wisconsin, has as well. I spent a fair amount of time thinking and working on healthcare before, as a Governor and even as a I am not a doctor. I have never pretended to be and have never wanted to be, but I think one of the credos for the folks in the medical field and physicians is ``do no harm.'' I hope that, at least on the healthcare front, in these 7 months here of this legislative session, we have not done a great deal of harm. I don't think we have.  We had a robust debate on whether the Affordable Care Act should be repealed, with a special focus on the section called ObamaCare, and not much of a debate on how we get better healthcare results for less money, although it is a goal we all share, as Democrats and Republicans, in the executive branch and in the legislative branch. I think that we all share the goal of trying to figure out how to provide better healthcare for less money to everybody so everybody has coverage. I think that is a shared goal.  Lamar Alexander, my Senate colleague from Tennessee, likes to say: A pilot wouldn't take off in an airplane without knowing what his or her destination is. Think about that. With respect to our destination on healthcare, I think we know what the destination is; that is, as I said earlier, to make sure we provide better coverage for less money and cover everybody. That is the destination.  Just as a guy who spent a lot of time as a naval flight officer in airplanes for about 23 years, I know there are different ways to get to places. Sometimes it is a straight line; sometimes it is not. Sometimes you have to go around turbulence, around storms, or under them. You may run short on fuel, and there may be mechanical malfunctions. It is not always a straight line to get to where we want to go in an airplane. It turns out that it is not a straight line--that destination that we want to get to with respect to healthcare, for better results, less money, and covering everyone.  One of the efforts to reach that destination has its roots in 1993. In fact, here in Washington there were two ideas for reaching that destination in terms of healthcare. Our shared goals go back to 1993, where you had here in Washington two different ideas that were put on the table.  One idea was from our First Lady, Hillary Rodham She worked with really smart people to come up with a healthcare plan called HillaryCare, to essentially try to achieve those three goals I mentioned. Our friends in the Republican Party were not always kind in characterizing her proposal. I think, when they called it ``HillaryCare,'' it was not meant to be a compliment. Even now, in television commercials, I remember seeing them kind of denigrating her efforts.  One of the responses from the folks who supported it--at least, something that First Lady Hillary Clinton proposed--or one of the things that the Democratic side said to the Republicans was this: What is your idea? At least we have an idea.  Then, some really smart people over at the Heritage Foundation went to work and they came up with what turns out to be a good idea--several very good ideas--to draw on market forces in order to try to meet those three goals I stated earlier on healthcare.  The first great idea of the five ideas was to create exchanges in every State for people who don't have coverage under Medicaid or Medicare or they don't work for an employer that provides healthcare for them. These are large purchasing pools in every State where people can get healthcare coverage and be part of a large group plan and realize the benefits of being a part of that large group plan.  The second aspect or pillar of their five ideas was the idea of a sliding-scale tax credit for people whose income was low. They would get a tax credit to lower the cost of a premium in the exchange in their As that person came up and up, at least to a certain level, the tax credit would go away. It is a sliding-scale tax credit. That was a Heritage Foundation idea.  Their third idea was something called an individual mandate, which said that, if you don't have coverage, you have to get it. Particularly, you have to sign up for it in the exchange. If you don't want to sign up, you are going to be fined. You can't actually make people sign up and get coverage, but the idea behind Heritage was that we would incentivize people to get coverage, because, eventually, people who don't have coverage will have to get care. Unfortunately, it is really expensive if they go to the emergency room. A lot of times they are so sick that they end up getting admitted. That costs a bundle, and the rest of us end up paying for it. So the third pillar was the individual mandate.  The fourth pillar was the employer mandate, because we want employers to cover their employees. That may not be absolute full coverage or Cadillac coverage. You don't have to necessarily cover their family, but we want you to offer coverage to your employees--hopefully, decent coverage.  The last part dealt with preexisting conditions. The Heritage folks said that there should be a prohibition against insurance companies being able to say to people who are sick or have some kind of preexisting conditions: We are not going to insure you because you have a preexisting condition. Heritage said that should be verboten. You shouldn't get away with that if you are an insurance company.  Those were the five ideas. Our friends here on the Republican side of the aisle said: We want to take those ideas.  They did. The lead sponsor was John I think he had 22 Republican sponsors in 1993, including Senator Hatch, who was the senior Republican on the Finance Committee and chaired the Finance Committee, and Chuck Grassley, a senior Republican on Finance who was also the chairman of the Judiciary They were some of the 22 cosponsors of the Republican bill, which really reflected the Heritage Foundation's ideas. Neither HillaryCare nor the Chafee legislation went forward and was adopted.  But about 13 years later, in 2006, a fellow Governor of Massachusetts was thinking about what were some things he could do to really differentiate himself in the field for running for President in 2008. His advisers came up with this idea: Why don't we try to cover everybody in Massachusetts and be the first State with everyone having healthcare coverage? They dusted off the Heritage Foundation's five ideas and introduced the legislation in They amended it and changed it a little bit, but, in the end, they passed the legislation. They implemented legislation in 2006, I believe, that reflected Heritage's ideas from 1993 and reflected the legislation that was written in this Chamber by John Chafee in 1993. It worked. It worked in  They fairly quickly were able to cover a lot of extra people in their State who hadn't been covered before. One of the things they wrestled with early on was portability. As it turns out, the folks who are young and invincible, like our pages here with us--I think this may be the last day or two before they head back for home.  The Presiding Officer may not know this, but the pages are here on overtime. Most of the pages returned to their home States across the country, but there are a half dozen or so volunteers that are still sticking with us to the bitter end. Hopefully, it is not too bitter an end. We hope that someday you will come back here as interns or maybe staff Members, and, who knows, maybe even as Presiding Officers or just mortals--mere mortals like me. Thank you again for your service.  Anyway, the Romney folks found out that they had this fine setup. So if people didn't get coverage in Massachusetts, they would have to pay a fine. It went up over time. It was later that they decided that if they had to do this over again, they would have had the fine start higher and escalate faster in order to send a clear message to the[[Page S4808]]young invincibles and others who didn't have coverage that you have to get serious about getting coverage. They wanted a mix of people in their exchanges so that insurance companies would be able to insure them and not lose their shirts--to make money off of it.  Anyway, when we were working on the Affordable Care Act in 2009, my first year on the Finance Committee, we were trying to figure out what to do. We proposed a lot of ideas to sort of keep our eye on the The Affordable Care Act was a way to just sort of pivot away from sick care, where we just spend money on people when they are sick, and do more to invest on how we help people stay healthy through prevention and wellness, by doing screenings for colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, in ways that, if you take away the copays for people and they can go ahead and get the screenings, they save themselves a lot of money and a lot of pain and maybe from dying, which otherwise wouldn't be the case.  There are a lot of aspects of the Affordable Care We raised the eligibility for folks for  When I came back from Southeast Asia in 1993, I went to business school in Delaware and got an The next year, I became State treasurer. I was 29. At that time, I thought of Medicaid as healthcare coverage for poor women with children. At the time, that was pretty much what it was, but not today.  Almost two-thirds of the money we spend on Medicaid is for people who are in nursing homes--our parents, our grandparents, our aunts, our uncles. A lot of them are veterans. I think 2 million are veterans. We spend a lot of money on Medicaid today to treat addiction for heroin and opioids, and we spend money on poor families, including women and children, but the nature of the coverage has changed a whole lot.  For many years, it has been a 50-50 yield. Largely, States pay 50 percent, and the Federal Government pays 50 percent. We changed that in the Affordable Care Act because we wanted the States to cover more than just the people up to 100 percent of poverty. The Federal Government stepped in and said to the States: If you would go along with this, we would like to cover people from 100 percent to 135 percent of poverty. The Federal Government, at least for a while, would pay for that marginal increase in coverage up to 135 percent of poverty. It is a pretty good deal for the States, and about 31 States have signed up to do that. So a lot of people have coverage today who did not have it before through  The other thing we did in writing the Affordable Care Act was to take the idea that they have sort of glommed onto in Massachusetts with RomneyCare--which has its roots back to the 1993 proposal from Heritage and that was proposed here in the Senate by Senator Chafee--and put that into the Affordable Care I know that there are some people who wanted to have a single-payer system in that their idea of healthcare reform was to cover everyone under Medicare who did not have coverage. We were just not ready to go there, so we said: Let's try something that has been put in place in one of our States, maybe with the idea that Massachusetts could be the laboratory of democracy--to find out what works and do more of that--and that was what we did.  We passed legislation that created exchanges in all 50 States, and we had an individual mandate to encourage people to get coverage and incentivize them but fine them if they did not. A lot of people say that we started too slowly, as Massachusetts did not implement it fast enough to get people signed up in the exchanges, but we learned, maybe, from our mistakes. We had the employer mandate, and we had the sliding sales tax credit in the Affordable Care  Then we had the prohibitions against insurance companies that refused to cover people because they had some kind of preexisting condition. That was the part of the Affordable Care Act that had its roots, really, in Heritage and Republican Senators--really good ones. Some of them are still here. Somehow, this has turned out to be that part of the Affordable Care Act with the exchanges and so forth. It ended up being called ObamaCare, which is really ironic because he did not have anything to do with creating it. It was not his idea, but, somehow, it has been deemed to be It is the part of the Affordable Care Act that has been most attacked by our Republican friends. It was their creation, their suggestion, and now they want to get rid of it.  We have had some tough debate here in recent weeks, and the Senate has decided not to repeal that part of the Affordable Care I think that we are smart not to repeal it, but the idea is to help make it work. One of the best ways is to sort of calm down the exchanges--quit disrupting and destabilizing the exchanges. When the President says that we do not know if we are going to enforce the individual mandate or the subsidies that we provide for low-income people, who get their coverage in the exchanges, to help cover their co-pays or deductibles--they do not know if they are going to keep doing that. They are basically saying of the ObamaCare exchanges to just put them in a death spiral. Let them just die. Then, maybe, the Democrats will come to the table.  I think all of that would be a huge mistake. Most of the people would suffer. As a matter of fact, a lot of the folks who voted for them are in rural States, and a lot of them are in red States around the country. I think it is cruel, and I do not think it is very smart.  Last Friday morning at 2 a.m., three Republicans--Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska; Susan Collins, of Maine; and John McCain, of Arizona--joined 48 Democrats in saying: Let's hit the pause button on degrading, further bringing down, the Affordable Care Let's hit the pause button. It is not because the Affordable Care Act is perfect, because we know there are things in it that need to be fixed, but there are portions that need to be preserved as well.  We said: Let's see if we can't hit the pause button--kind of pivot--and stabilize the exchanges, first of all, then do the fix, and do the repair that needs done in the We would keep the stuff that is really good and that everyone says is good and move on. Let's not just do it as Republicans by themselves or Democrats by themselves. We have tried that. Let's try working together.  Now we have a chance to do that, and people, like the Presiding Officer, who have very good ideas will have a chance to present those ideas in hearings that will be held by Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray right after we come back here, just after the Labor Day holiday.  I learned in our Finance Committee today that Chairman Orrin Hatch and Senator Ron Wyden, who is the senior Democrat on the committee, will also be holding a hearing or hearings on how do we stabilize the exchanges and how do we, maybe, find some ways to improve on what we have done in the Affordable Care I can think of any number. I am sure that the Presiding Officer can as well.  I do not leave here discouraged. This is a country about which people say: You must be miserable serving in the U. I say: Oh, no, not at all. I am sort of energized by what has been going on, not discouraged.  A long time ago, we fought the Civil One hundred fifty years ago, we fought the Civil My friend here from Mississippi remembers that. I grew up in the last capital of the Confederacy--Danville, I remember that. One hundred fifty years ago, hundreds of thousands of people were killed, maimed, or wounded. When it was over, our President was assassinated, and his successor was impeached.  Somehow, we got through that and made it to the 20th century and fought, not one, but two World We won them both and led them both. We fought the Cold War--won it, led it. We led the world out of the Great Depression and into the 21st century.  The 21st century emerged, and the Sun came up that January day in 2001. America had the strongest economy on Earth and the most productive workforce on We are a nation of peace. We had four balanced budgets in a row. We had not balanced a budget since 1968. Then we figured out how to do that four times in a row during the last 4 years of the Clinton administration. In 2001, we were the most admired Nation on Earth and the most admired force for justice on Earth.[[Page S4809]]  I like to remind people that if we can get through the 150 years after the Civil War and end up where we were on January 1, 2001, we will get through this as well.  The last thing I would say is this: When we come back, there is plenty to do. One of the things we have to do is deal with our financial plan, our budget, and figure out what to do with respect to the debt ceiling. We will be coming back and holding the hearings that I described on the Affordable Care Act and trying to stabilize the exchanges. We will begin to figure out what we ought to do beyond stabilizing the exchanges and do it as Democrats and Republicans working together.  When we passed Social Security, Medicare, the Civil Rights Act, and the GI bill, those were not all Democratic ideas or all Republican ideas. Some of the best work we do is when we work together.  We will also have the opportunity to tackle our Tax We have a tax code that, in some cases, discourages companies, especially larger companies, from staying in the United States and continuing to do business here and employing people here. In some cases, we encourage them to look for other places around the world in which to locate their businesses. We need to make sure we have a tax code that encourages innovation and that encourages companies to expand and grow here. My hope is that we can, especially on the Finance Committee, really focus on that and work with our colleagues, work with the House, and work with the administration.  I am a really optimistic person about most things, but the last time we did comprehensive tax reform in this country was in 1986. At that time, we had Republican President Reagan, who was for it. He had a great Treasury Secretary, Jim Baker, who was for it. Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House, was for it. Tip O'Neill, the Democratic Speaker of the House, was for it. We had Bob Packwood and Bill Bradley, a Democrat and a Republican--brilliant people on the Finance They were for it, and it still took 5 years to do it--really hard stuff.  We need to get serious about it, and we need to get going. My hope is that we will end up being revenue-neutral. We could use some revenues, but I hope it will be revenue-neutral. At the end of the day, I hope that what we do will answer these four questions: Is it fair? Does it foster economic growth? Does it make the Tax Code less complex or more complex? Finally, how does it affect our fiscal situation--our budget situation? My hope is that we can keep those questions in our minds as we formulate tax reform and answer them in an appropriate way.  I see my colleague here with whom I serve on the Finance Committee and on the Environment and Public Works He is waiting his turn, and I have talked long enough.  I will close where I started, with the words of the late Senator Philip Hart, of Michigan, who was admired by a lot of people here in this body before we came here. He said these words:       I leave as I arrived, understanding clearly the complexity      of the world into which we were born and optimistic that if      we give it our best shot, we will come close to achieving the      goals set for us 200 years ago.  Boy, those words ring true today, don't they?  As we are about to leave, unlike our friend Philip Hart, who left the Senate, those who serve today in the Senate are going to come back in 4 weeks. My hope is that when we come back, we will come back determined to work together. That is what people want us to do. They want us to work together because, if we do, we will get a lot more things done.  My wife and I went to Africa and actually met up there with one of our sons and a friend of his two summers ago in August--2 years ago this I learned more about Africa in, actually, a week to 10 days than I had learned in all of my life. One of the things I learned was an African proverb that some of you already know. It goes something like this: If you want to go fast, travel alone. If you want to go far, travel together.  Think about that: If you want to go fast, travel alone. If you want to go far, travel together.  We have tried going it alone, and we have not gotten that far. My hope is that when we come back, we will travel together, and we will go a long, long way and make everyone proud of us.  I say again to my colleagues and the pages and our staffs, thank you for the good work that you have done. It is a pleasure serving with all of you.  I bid you adieu. Thank you.  I yield the floor.

98,topic-id,317,"Mr.President, September marks National Senior Center More than 11,000 senior centers across the country serve more than 1 million older adults every day. For many older Americans, senior centers are the heart of their communities, offering a place for everything from meals to recreational activities to health and wellness programs. Senior centers also create a sense of comity and community, giving older Americans a place to connect while reducing the social isolation that often burdens our older citizens.  This summer, as ranking member of the U.Senate Special Committee on Aging, I visited numerous senior centers across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in rural, urban, and suburban areas, to discuss the issues on the minds of older At each stop, older Pennsylvanians told me about the important role that senior centers play in their daily lives, as a gathering place and a resource, providing not only necessary nutrition programs, but also benefits counseling, employment assistance, volunteer opportunities, transportation assistance, and so much more.  Senior centers and senior center staff deserve our support. Communities piece together numerous sources to fund their senior center operations, including Federal, State, and local government resources, private-sector donations and grants, and the man-hours of countless volunteers. Many of the county commissioners who joined me during these visits expressed their support for the Community Development Block Grant, which regrettably is slated for elimination by the administration. Counties throughout Pennsylvania depend on the Community Development Block Grant program to fund important infrastructure in our communities. Now is not the time to scale back our investment in these needs. I stand with our community leaders in support of the Community Development Block Grant program, and I will fight to protect these vital resources from elimination.

201,topic-id,790,"Mr.President, 30 years ago, Caribou, ME, served as the proving ground upon which America has built a nationwide system of community-based outpatient clinics that delivers much improved access to medical services for America's rural veterans. The anniversary celebration on September 7 recognizes the determined commitment of Cary Medical Center, the Department of Veterans Affairs, local veterans, and an entire community that transformed healthcare for the men and women who defend our Nation and our freedom.  Our Nation's first CBOC held its formal opening in Caribou, my hometown, on June 13, 1987. The impact was immediate--no longer would the veterans of Aroostook County have to endure an up-to 10-hour round trip to the nearest VA hospital for medical exams or to meet with a VA physician. Today the Caribou CBOC treats a veteran population of 3,500 men and women who served our country, with more than 9,000 care visits annually. The pioneering work done in Caribou led to benefits for America's 3.5 million rural veterans who now receive care closer to home at more than 950 CBOCs throughout the country.  The story of the great advancement in healthcare began 8 years before that formal opening, when seven Aroostook County veterans devoted themselves to the mission of improving access to critical healthcare services in this region. The original members of Aroostook County Veterans Medical Facility Research and Development, Inc.--Percy Thibeault, Meo Bosse, John Rowe, Ray Guerrette, Wesley Adams, Walter Corey, and Leonard Woods, Jr.--faced many obstacles along the way and overcame them all. These patriots exemplified a special quality of the American veteran: they continued to contribute long after their service in uniform was done.  That great mission would not have been accomplished without the dedication and expertise of Cary Medical Center and the involvement of Bill As the American Hospital Association noted in its Award of Honor presentation in 2011, Cary Medical Center has made exemplary contributions in the critical area of veterans' healthcare and has established a national model. In addition to playing a vital role in establishing the VA's first CBOC in Caribou, Cary Medical Center was one of five pilot sites for the highly successful Access Received Closer to Home, or ARCH, program. Maine's program, led by Kris Doody and a tremendous team of professionals, has been called a standard bearer for how to provide[[Page S4927]]rural veterans access to the care they need in their communities. Before he became VA Secretary, I had the opportunity to join David Shulkin on a visit to both the Caribou CBOC and Cary Medical Center, where he praised the innovative work being done being done to provide veterans with top quality healthcare close to where they live. Veterans in Aroostook County and throughout America are grateful for Cary's leadership.  Our State has long history as a leader in working to expand and improve veterans' access to quality healthcare. One year ago, we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the very first national hospital for veterans: Togus, in Maine, which opened its doors in November of 1866. In 2014, we celebrated the opening of the women's clinic at Togus in recognition of the fact that more and more women serve our country in uniform.  I am determined to continue those early efforts on behalf of our rural veterans. The recent enactment of the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017, which I cosponsored with my Maine colleague Senator Angus King, is an important step toward keeping this obligation to our veterans, both urban and rural. As well as providing additional funding for healthcare access in the community, the legislation authorizes 28 leases for VA facilities across the country, including a much-needed CBOC in The result of this crucial legislation is increased access to quality care for all who have defended our freedom.  Maine is home to more than 125,000 veterans. To put that in perspective, Maine has more veterans per capita than all but two of the other States in the country. We are proud of our State's contributions to protecting our Nation and of Maine's impressive record in caring for our veterans.  President Abraham Lincoln signed the legislation establishing a national network of hospitals for Civil War veterans on March 3, 1865. The very next day, he concluded his second inaugural address with a commitment ``to bind up our nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle. . . .''  We must uphold that commitment. Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country. We owe them all that we can do to ensure they receive the best care possible. The veterans and grateful citizens who fought for the Caribou CBOC knew that, and, on this 30th anniversary, we honor their dedication by carrying on their work.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-05-pt1-PgS4926-2.txt,2121,BOB DOLE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT,2017.0,5.0,August
356,topic-id,1536,"Thank you, Mr. I rise in support of the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act that we are now considering. Let me begin by commending Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for their leadership in bringing this important legislation to the Senate floor. This bill is the product of bipartisan, bicameral work and is proof that we can make progress when we work together on the areas where we can find agreement.  FDA user fees, which are reauthorized under this bill, are critical to moving the most advanced research from a promise to a cure and ensuring that new treatments reach patients in need. User fees, where companies fund a portion of the premarket review of their products, account for more than one-quarter of all FDA funding. Yet the FDA's authority to collect these fees will expire at the end of next month unless Congress acts, thus the urgency of getting this bill across the finish line.  That is why it is imperative that we advance this bill now and ensure that work on these promising new pharmaceuticals continues uninterrupted.  In May, the HELP Committee, on which I am pleased to serve, overwhelmingly approved bipartisan legislation to extend and reauthorize the FDA fees in order to support the public health of our The bill before us also incorporates many provisions that were advanced by individual Committee It is a great example of how a committee process should work. It was collaborative. We each brought ideas to the table, and during our markup, those ideas were offered as amendments and in many cases incorporated into the legislation.  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including in this important legislation provisions that I authored with Senator Claire Those provisions seek to accelerate the review process for prescription drugs in cases where there is limited or no competition. Our purpose is to lower or at least moderate the escalating prescription drug prices that are one of the key cost drivers in our healthcare system today.  During the last Congress, our Senate Aging Committee, which I chair--and at that time Senator McCaskill was the ranking member--had a bipartisan investigation into the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to the egregious price spikes for certain off-patent drugs for which there were no generic competitors.  Now, let me explain this situation a little more.  What we found was happening is that in cases in which the patent on the[[Page S4786]]original brand name pharmaceutical had expired, there were these companies that were not traditional pharmaceutical companies--they were not firms that had invested hundreds of millions in R&D in order to develop a new prescription drug. That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about these pharma companies--I call them hedge fund pharmas--that wait until the patent has expired, then buy the pharmaceutical drug and virtually overnight impose egregious price increases. One of the executives of these companies, when asked why he did so, answered simply ``because I can.''  Obviously, that has a very detrimental impact on patients, on healthcare providers, on insurers, and on Federal programs such as Medicaid and  So building on our investigation, Senator McCaskill and I sponsored legislation, called the Making Pharmaceutical Markets More Competitive Act, to foster a more competitive generic marketplace and to improve access for affordable medicines. That is key. If we can have more competition in the prescription drug marketplace, that is what drives down costs, and that is what drives down prices. We know that from our experience when generic drugs come on the market.  The bill that we are considering today that is based on our legislation includes key provisions which were adopted unanimously as an amendment that I sponsored during the committee markup.  First, our provisions would require the FDA to prioritize the review of certain generic applications. It would set a clear timeframe of no more than 8 months for the FDA to act on such applications where there is inadequate generic competition. This would help to resolve situations in which there are drug shortages, as well as circumstances in which there are not more than three approved competitors on the market.  The Aging Committee's investigation into sudden price spikes found that older drugs with only one manufacturer and no generic competitor are particularly vulnerable to dramatic and sudden price increases.  One company that we investigated, Turing Pharmaceuticals, increased the price of a drug called Daraprim, which is a lifesaving drug for serious parasitic infections, from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill--an increase of more than 5,000 percent--and they did so literally overnight. Now, keep in mind that this company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, had nothing to do with the costly research and development that brought about this lifesaving drug, known as Daraprim, but after they bought the drug--after the patent had expired and they saw that there was no generic competitor--they increased the price overnight by 5,000 percent. This price hike for a drug that has remained unchanged since 1953 is unacceptable and underscores the urgent need for legislation to prevent bad actors from taking advantage of a noncompetitive marketplace.  Second, the bill would improve communications between the FDA and the eligible sponsors prior to the submission of an application for the approval of a generic drug. That would improve the quality of applications from the beginning, increasing the chances of successful approval by the  Third, new reporting requirements would provide increased transparency into the backlog of applications for drug approvals and pending generic and priority review applications.  Fourth, this bill would provide the public with accurate information about drugs with limited competition. Drug manufacturers would be required to notify and provide rationale when removing a drug from the market, and the FDA would publish a list of off-patent brand name drugs that lack generic competitors, so that if you were a generic drug company, you would know that this would be an opportunity to develop a competitor drug.  I give the new FDA Commissioner a great deal of credit for his incorporating some of our provisions. He cares deeply about this issue.  Finally, this bill would streamline the regulatory process to address incidents in which the delayed re-inspection of manufacturing facilities becomes a barrier to generics entering the marketplace.  By taking these steps, we will enhance regulatory certainty for generic drug companies, help to prevent shortages, increase competition to lower prices and prevent monopolies, and deter practices that can lead to unjustifiable, exorbitant price hikes.  I am pleased that the legislation also includes another bill that resulted from our Aging Committee's investigation. This provision will help to prevent bad actors from receiving unwarranted vouchers under the Tropical Disease Voucher  This program was intended to incentivize the development of medicines for neglected diseases, yet was exploited by the notorious Martin Shkreli, the founder of After spiking the price of Daraprim, he purchased another decades-old drug--one, once again, without a competitor--that is used to treat a life-threatening infection that is rare in the United Mr.Shkreli sought to use the Tropical Disease Voucher Program to gain exclusivity and hike the price for a drug that is not, in fact, a new drug.  Our legislation revises the program to better ensure that it achieves its intent, which is to spur the development of therapies that are truly new in order to treat and cure neglected diseases.  Drug companies should not be able to increase their prices dramatically by thousands of a percent overnight without any justification--without the development of modifications in the drug that improve its effectiveness, for example.  Our legislation will help to foster a much healthier and more competitive generic marketplace as the best defense against such exploitation. I am pleased that our bipartisan plan will increase generic competition, which is so important for American families and our seniors, particularly, who take a disproportionate number of the prescription drugs that are prescribed in this country.  Before closing, let me briefly mention another important provision in the bill before us, the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017. Approximately 30 million Americans experience age-related hearing loss. Yet only about 14 percent of those with hearing loss use assistive hearing technology, often because they simply cannot afford the price of costly hearing aids.  We know from a hearing that we recently held in the Aging Committee that social isolation among our seniors can be exacerbated by hearing loss that is left untreated. That, in turn, increases that social isolation and increases the risk of serious mental and physical health outcomes. By making some types of hearing aids available over the counter, just as people buy readers to see with, which are over-the-counter eyeglasses, this legislation will help increase access to and lower the cost of the products for the consumers who need them.  The legislation we are considering today will help to bring lifesaving drugs to the marketplace and will ensure that the FDA continues to operate smoothly and, most importantly, that promising therapies make it to the American people.  Again, I commend Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for their leadership, and I encourage all of our colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-08-03-pt1-PgS4782-3.txt,2121,BOB DOLE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT,2017.0,3.0,September
556,topic-id,613,"Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my colleague from Montana, Senator Tester, that would extend an important program to fund Teaching Health Centers, which support the health and well-being of families in rural and medically underserved communities. I am pleased that Senators Cochran, Manchin, Daines, Harris, and Boozman, have joined us as cosponsors.  In the background of the health care debate, there is another crisis that looms. We are facing a severe shortage of doctors. By 2025, we will need more than 100,000 new primary care doctors to meet the growing demand for health care services across the The shortage is especially critical in rural and underserved communities, which are often those that have been hit hardest by the opioid epidemic. The most significant shortages are in family medicine, general internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, and dentistry.  These shortages have reached crisis levels in many places. In clinics and health centers in Aroostook County, Maine's northernmost county where I grew up, I hear stories about vacancies forcing Mainers to travel many miles simply to see a primary care doctor or dentist.  For the past six years, one program, the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program, has worked to fill these gaps. This program helps to train medical residents in community-based settings, including low-income, underserved rural and urban neighborhoods. For example, since 2011, the Penobscot Community Health Care Center has trained 31 residents and served more than 15,000 dental patients in Bangor,  We need to meet people in the communities in which they live and work. This program is training the next generation of physicians, and has produced real results. When compared with traditional Medicare graduate medical education residents, those who train at teaching health centers are significantly more likely to practice primary care and remain in underserved or rural communities. The numbers speak for themselves: 82 percent of Teaching Health Center, or THC, residents choose to practice primary care, compared to 23 percent of traditional Medicare Graduate Medical Education residents; and 55 percent of THC residents choose to remain in underserved communities, compared to 26 percent of traditional Medicare GME residents.  Teaching health centers are serving Americans from coast to coast. A total of 742 THC residents are serving in 27 states and the District of The program is competitive, and trains the best of the best. For each residency position, THC programs receive more than 100 applications. In 2017, THC residents and faculty will provide more than one million primary care medical visits to underserved communities.  Teaching Health Centers have demonstrated a record of success, and it is imperative that we support them. Our legislation would reauthorize the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program for three years. It would also allow new programs to expand within existing centers and the creation of entirely new teaching health centers.  This bill is widely supported by leading community health and physician organizations, including the American Association of Teaching Health Centers, National Association of Community Health Centers, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, American Osteopathic Association, American Council of OB/GYNs, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, and Council of Academic Family We have also received letters of support from teaching health centers in Maine, Montana, Tennessee, Iowa, Oklahoma, North Carolina, California, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Washington, Texas, Connecticut, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and  In the face of nationwide physician shortages, our legislation would provide a solution for communities today and a path forward to train the physicians of tomorrow. I urge all of my colleagues to join in support of this important legislation, the Training the Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017.

Susan Collins,     U.Senate,     Washington,     Jon Tester,     U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senators Collins and Tester: The American Congress of      Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), with more than 58,000      physicians and partners dedicated to advancing women's      health, is pleased to endorse the Training the Next      Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017. Your bill      would help improve access for women in rural and underserved      areas to timely, high quality health care by training primary      care physicians, including obstetrician-gynecologists.       Today, women living in half of all US counties are in areas      without an ob-gyn, including one of Maine's 16 counties, and      35 of Montana's 56 counties. Furthermore, the ob-gyn      workforce is aging and a large number of ob-gyns are retiring      at a time when the female population is expected to increase      36% by 2050. ACOG projects an ob-gyn shortage of 18% by 2030.       Your bill will help alleviate these workforce challenges by      ensuring the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical      Education (THCGME) program can continue to train ob-gyns and      other primary care physicians in an efficient and effective      manner. Community-based THCGME medical training programs are      critical to filling workforce shortages, as physicians      trained through this program are more likely to practice in      underserved communities. According to the Health Resources      and Services Administration (HRSA), primary care residents      trained in community-based settings are three times more      likely to practice in an underserved community-based setting.      An investment in THCGME to improve access to care in rural      and underserved communities has a long-term impact positive      impact.       Thank you for introducing this legislation to improve      access to high quality care for women.

Susan Collins,     U.Senate,     Washington,     Jon Tester,     U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senators Collins and Tester: On behalf of the American      Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the nearly 130,000      osteopathic physicians and osteopathic medical students we      represent, thank you for introducing the ``Training the Next      Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017.'' This      important bipartisan legislation renews the commitment to the      continued development of the Teaching Health Centers Graduate      Medical Education (THCGME) program to help ensure a robust      primary care workforce in our nation's rural and underserved      communities. We are grateful for your leadership on this      critical issue.       The THCGME program is a vital source of training for      primary care residents to help expand access to care in rural      and underserved communities throughout the country. These      programs, located in 59 teaching health centers in 27 states,      currently train 742 residents in much-needed primary care      fields including family medicine, internal medicine,      pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry,      geriatrics, and dentistry. The majority of these programs are      accredited by the AOA or are dually accredited (DO/MD)      programs, supporting nearly 800 osteopathic resident      physicians through their training since the program began.      And true to the intent of the THCGME program, residents who      train in these programs are far more likely to practice      primary care and remain in the communities in which they have      trained.       As osteopathic physicians, we are trained in a patient-     centered, hands-on approach to care that focuses on the whole      person, including the physical, mental, and psychosocial      aspects of health. Our training and philosophy includes a      strong emphasis on primary care--in fact, approximately half      of all osteopathic physicians practice in primary care      specialties. Given this strong presence in primary care,      osteopathic medicine aligns naturally with the mission and      goals of the THCGME program that has proven successful in      helping address the existing gaps in our nation's primary      care workforce.       Your legislation provides much-needed stability through      continued funding for the THCGME program, and also creates a      pathway for the expansion of existing centers as well as the      creation of entirely new teaching health centers. We deeply      appreciate your commitment to training the future of the      primary care workforce and thank you for introducing this      important legislation. The AOA and our members stand ready to      assist you in securing its enactment into law.           Sincerely,                                                Mark Baker, DO,                                      ____                                          Council of Academic                                               Family Medicine,                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2017.     Susan Collins,     U.Senate,     Washington,     Jon Tester,     U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senators Collins and Tester: On behalf of the Council      of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM), including the Society of      Teachers of Family Medicine, Association of Departments of      Family Medicine, Association of Family Medicine Residency      Directors, the North American Primary Care Research Group, we      thank you for introducing the Training the Next Generation of      Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017. This legislation is an      important step to providing sustainable funding and growth      for a critical program that helps address the primary care      physician shortage in our country. We appreciate your      leadership on this issue and give you our whole-hearted      support for the legislation.       To help sustain this important program the proposed      legislation provides suitable funding for current Teaching      Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) programs to      help address the crisis-level shortage of primary care      physicians. The funding level included in the bill will allow      for a per resident amount to be paid for training that is on      par with the Heath Resources and Services Administration      (HRSA) funded study identifying a median cost of      approximately $157 thousand per trainee. Evidence shows[[Page S4833]]     that the THC program graduates are more likely to practice in      rural and medically underserved communities. We are pleased      that the proposed legislation supports ten new THC programs,      with a priority for those serving rural and medically      underserved populations and areas, recognizing the importance      of growing this successful program.       The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), an      advisory body empaneled by Congress, has urged Congress to      continue of the THCGME program stating that ``THCGME programs      deliver excellent value in physician training,'' and that the      program encourages training in ``delivery systems that      emphasize team-based care in Patient Centered Medical Homes      that maximize quality at a moderate cost''; Additionally, the      Institute of Medicine (IOM), [now National Academy of      Medicine] in a 2014 report identified the THCGME program as      helping meet the need for primary care physicians, especially      those who provide care to underserved populations and worthy      of a permanent funding source.       The current authorization for this vital program expires at      the end of this fiscal year. Without legislative action, the      expiration of this program would mean an exacerbation of the      primary care physician shortage, and a lessening of support      for training in underserved and rural areas. We are grateful      to you both for your exceptional leadership in supporting and      sustaining this vital program by introducing this bill and      helping to shepherd it toward enactment.

Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System Alternative Warhead      (GMLRS-AW) The GMLRS-AW, M30A1, is the next design      increment of the GMLRS rocket. The GMLRS-AW M30A1 hardware is      over 90% common with the M31A1 GMLRS Unitary hardware.      Operational range is between 15-70 kilometers. Accuracy of      less than 15 meters Circular Error Probability at all ranges,      when using inertial guidance with Global Positioning System      (GPS) augmentation. Uses a proximity sensor fuze mode with a      10 meter height of burst. The Alternative Warhead carries a      200 pound fragmentation assembly filled with high explosives      which, upon detonation, accelerates two layers of pre-formed      tungsten fragments optimized for effectiveness against large      area and imprecisely located targets. The GMLRS-AW provides      an area target attack capability that is treaty compliant (no      un-exploded ordnance). It provides a 24 hour, all weather,      long range attack capability against personnel, soft and      lightly armored targets, and air defense targets. The GMLRS-     AW uses the same motor, guidance and control systems fuze      mechanisms, and proximity sensors as the M31A1 GMLRS      The highest classification level for release of the GMLRS-AW      is SECRET, based upon the software, sale or testing of the      end item.

267,topic-id,2972,"Mr.President, I congratulate the majority leader for securing these important confirmations of nominees who have been waiting, for no good reason, simply to get an up-or-down vote and get confirmed. This is a big day, with roughly 65 nominations confirmed just here in the last few minutes--things that should have been handled but for the obstruction and foot-dragging of our colleagues across the aisle.  I want to focus for just a minute on things we have been able to do, notwithstanding the lack of cooperation of our colleagues across the aisle since this new administration came into office.  I know the focus of the press--and, frankly, some of our own focus--has been on the unfinished business, like healthcare reform. I can assure my colleagues that issue is not going away and gets more difficult to address as each day goes by.  Perhaps one of the most significant things we have done in the last few months is confirm Neil Gorsuch as a Justice on the Supreme It is undeniable that Judge Gorsuch is a qualified, high-caliber nominee, and he is already serving our Nation well on our highest  We have also worked together with the President to deliver legislation that is a priority for our veterans and police departments around the The American Law Enforcement Heroes Act, which I was proud to sponsor, will help our returning veterans continue to serve their country by creating incentives for police departments to hire them once they take off their military uniform and put on a new uniform as a member of local police departments. This legislation will help keep our communities safe while supporting those who have served our country. I am proud we were able to work together on a bipartisan basis to make it the law of the land.  On this side of the aisle, we are absolutely committed to helping businesses and job creators do what they do best--innovate, create more jobs, and employ more people--and not waste time dealing with onerous rules and regulations. With a friend in the White House--somebody sympathetic to the needs to grow the economy, create more opportunities, and let people pursue the American dream--we have been able to finally deliver some relief to the American people.  One of the ways we have done that is through one of the more obscure laws, perhaps--but one we have brought to life--the so-called Congressional Review Until just this year, I think the Congressional Review Act had been used only one time to repeal the ergonomics rule years ago.  The Congressional Review Act was created to give Congress an opportunity to do away with or repeal regulations which were put in place as the Obama administration was headed out the door. Using these Congressional Review Acts, and with an ally in the White House, we undid some of the thousands of burdensome rules and regulations created by the Obama administration--rules and regulations which added up to a hefty pricetag for our country and which have strangled our economic recovery since 2008 and the great recession.  That is not all. We have also passed important bipartisan legislation imposing tough sanctions on Iran, Russia, and North  In the case of Iran, the overwhelming vote was a strong message that the United States will not tolerate Iran's complicity in terror and is a clear indicator of just how important this legislation is. Now, most people listening to me would be surprised we did this because, frankly, there wasn't a whole lot of coverage about it because it was done with such broad and overwhelming bipartisan support, but it is important, and it is an important signal to our adversaries in other countries that we will not sit idly by and leave our Nation undefended and their acts undeterred.  This week, we continue to build on these additional accomplishments for our veterans. I commend, in particular, the Senator from Georgia, Mr.Isakson, for his great work in getting these bills passed.  Over the last several years, we have heard about VA facilities across the State of Texas and across the country which have been plagued by inefficiency, unaccountability, and quality of care issues. The VA has been hindered by unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles which have been incredibly frustrating and costly for our veterans. The Veterans Choice Program was created to fix that by ensuring veterans can receive timely appointments close to home. The VA Choice and Quality Employment Act, which we passed earlier this week, continues that program and guarantees veterans that they will continue to have access to care without interruption.  Of course, we still have additional work to do before leaving for the August work period. There are still vacancies in the executive branch that need to be filled. In order for President Trump to do the job he was elected to do on November 8, he needs his team in place. While I am glad that today, just a few moments ago, roughly 65 of his Cabinet nominees and sub-Cabinet nominees were confirmed, I hope our[[Page S4801]]colleagues across the aisle will stop their stall tactics so we can confirm the rest of the nominees of this administration.  I congratulate the Senator from Tennessee, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, for the work he did to see passage of the Food and Drug Administration User Fee This is an incredibly important, although somewhat obscure, law that helps establish partnerships between the private and public sector which ensure patients have access to safe and effective drugs and medical devices, while also maintaining the position of the United States as a global leader in medical innovation.  It is simple. Faster approvals mean treatments and cures reach patients sooner, and increased competition leads to lower cost, and that, in turn, leads to more lives saved.  I also congratulate Senator Johnson from He has been trying to get this bill called the Right to Try Act, which passed unanimously earlier today. This is designed to give dying individuals one last chance to try perhaps sometimes experimental medications to see if that will help them extend their quality of life and their longevity. I know he feels passionately about it, and I congratulate him for his leadership and perseverance.  With these remaining items, it is clear we have been able to accomplish a lot in a short time for the American people. Again, we focus on our unfinished work--like the healthcare bill. I assure my colleagues, once again, that remains broken, people remain hurting, and we should not rest or give up until we are able to give them some relief, and we are determined to do that.  Mr.President, I want to mention one other piece of legislation that was introduced today which we have been working on for a long time--years, literally, but since the Trump administration came into office, and particularly with Secretary of Homeland Security General Kelly, who has now become the Chief of Staff for the White  We have introduced something called the Building America's Trust Act, which is border security legislation that increases resources at our borders while boosting trade through ports of entry and strengthens enforcement of existing laws.  Earlier this year, several of my colleagues and I went to my home State to tour our southern border, including the Rio Grande Valley, Laredo, and Del Rio, The reason I was so glad to welcome my colleagues to visit Texas with me and see the borders is because it is a unique part, not only of our State but a unique part of our  Each mile along the border presents its own challenge in terms of what is needed to protect it. On this trip, we spoke most notably with Manny Padilla, chief of the Rio Grande Patrol Sector and commander of the Joint Task Force of the West and South Texas Chief Padilla presides over the busiest Border Patrol sector in the United He said something then which stuck with me. He pointed out that any border security plan must include a combination of three things, and the way those three things come together may well vary, and will vary, depending on the particular location:  The first is physical infrastructure.  Here is an example of some of the fencing that exists along the border where the Border Patrol believes it is necessary in order to control the flow of people across the border in a way they can be allowed to do their job.  The second is technology--things like this aerostat, with its radar capability. It is literally eyes in the sky, which can allow the Border Patrol to do their job better.  Here is another example of some of the ground-based radar which is available. You can imagine, with a 1,200-mile border between Texas and Mexico alone, it is a huge job and a very complex environment.  Of course, the third thing, in addition to physical infrastructure and technology, is things like personnel. Literally, we need to make sure we have an adequate number of Border Patrol available to deal with people who are coming across the border in violation of our immigration laws.  I believe, until we secure the border and enforce the law, we will never be able to regain the public's confidence, which allows us to do other things we need to do to fix our broken immigration system.  That is why we call this bill the Building America's Trust It does these things--secures our borders with expanded resources, enhances ports of entry to increase trade--because it is important to separate the criminal activity from legitimate trade and commerce, which creates 5 million jobs in the United States alone. That is just by our national trade with Of course, it strengthens enforcement of our immigration laws. That is why we have gotten support from the National Border Patrol Council, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Southwestern Border Sheriff's Coalition, and the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition as well, and we have had supportive statements by the Fraternal Order of Police and others.  I firmly believe that until we accomplish this goal--until we regain the public's confidence that we are actually serious about it and we have a plan to do it--we will not be permitted by our constituents to do the other things we know we need to do to fix our broken immigration system.  I know the Presiding Officer was at the White House yesterday with the President, talking about his plan to try to make our legal immigration system more merit-based. This is something we have been trying to do for years now, and I congratulate the Presiding Officer for helping restart that discussion because we need to focus not only on border security and enforcing our laws, we need to think about and talk about what a 21st century immigration system for our country should look like. Should it be based strictly on family relationships or should it be based on some of the attributes of the immigrant which would benefit the United States--people with advanced degrees and capability, people who can come here and help make our country better, not just come here to become dependent on our country.  The Building America's Trust Act is a chance for our Democratic colleagues who have said they actually believe in border security to demonstrate their support. In fact, we supported one of the toughest border security packages there is. I believe that is what this represents.  It is clear the President has made obvious from the beginning that border security would be a top priority for him. I think it is one of the reasons he was elected on November 8 of last year--because the American people sensed, even if maybe they didn't know the details, that things had gotten out of control, our borders were in chaos, and thousands of people were coming across the border who had no legal right to be here in disregard of our laws. They sensed, in their core, that something was fundamentally wrong--that, yes, we are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws--and we have lost that. This is about regaining trust in government and keeping our commitment to the American people.  Over these last few months, I have been working with colleagues, not only in the Senate and the House but with General Kelly in the Department of Homeland Security--now Chief of Staff of the White House--to come up with a strategic plan which addresses various facets of border security and interior enforcement as well. We know about 40 percent of illegal immigration is people who enter the country legally but who overstay their visa and simply melt into the great American landscape.  For too long, those on the frontlines have not had the tools they need to get the job done. These are public servants, like our Border Patrol, who risk their lives to keep us safe, and we simply haven't lived up to our commitment to give them the tools and the political will necessary to support them.  We know the borders are also cause for our local, State, and Federal officials to have to work together, and it makes sense for us to do more to help them do their job at the State and local level as well.  Our bill authorizes additional resources for Border Patrol agents, Customs and Border Protection officers, for agricultural inspectors, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE officers. We also provide for additional immigration judges and Federal prosecutors for State and local law enforcement to aggressively fight drug[[Page S4802]]trafficking, smuggling, and other crimes that, unfortunately, occur along our borders because the organizations--these transnational criminal organizations--really don't care about human life.  We saw that recently when a number of immigrants died in the back of a tractor trailer in a parking lot at Walmart in San Antonio, They are a commodity, a way to make money in the eyes of these cartels who care nothing about human life. Drugs, weapons, and other threats to our country are also part of what they move across the border, and that is why border security is so important.  Our bill also focuses on criminals, gangs, and repeat offenders who return to the United States in defiance of our laws. We have zero tolerance for those criminals in this bill. We end catch-and-release, and we include Kate's Law, a bill recently passed by the House that increases penalties for those who repeatedly cross our borders illegally. The bill is named after Kate Steinle, who was so tragically murdered in San  We hold sanctuary cities accountable because no city should be able to defy cooperation with Federal law enforcement officials. We are not asking them to do the Federal Government's job, but they do have an obligation, as we all do as American citizens, to cooperate and work with our law enforcement officials.  We impose tough penalties on Federal funds for jurisdictions that fail to comply with lawful Federal immigration enforcement requests. To curb the abuse of visas, our bill utilizes a biometric entry-exit system at ports of entry to identify visa overstays and cut off immigration benefits to those who exploit the system.  We also make sure to invest in our ports of entry. These are the ways that people come into our country legally and engage in commerce and trade, which is mutually beneficial. We can't neglect our trading partnerships with our neighbors to the south because we depend on that trade to create and sustain 5 million jobs in the United States alone.  The Building America's Trust Act will also help boost the flow of commerce through our ports so that legitimate trade can continue to flourish. This bill also includes a large investment of resources to improve our ports of entry, to help target and isolate illegal immigration and drug trafficking at ports while facilitating increased, legitimate trade and travel.  Perhaps most importantly, this bill also requires that the Department of Homeland Security and law enforcement officials consult with local officials every step of the way. The people who live in our border communities know best how to help control illegal traffic and illegal activity, but it is the Federal Government's responsibility to step up and help them. They understand the benefits of legitimate travel and trade and traffic, all of which are important parts of a successful border security effort.  Border security really is not a one-size-fits-all plan. As Chief Padilla said, it is always a combination of technology, personnel, and tactical infrastructure--wall systems, fences, and the like. We need an approach that will work for each unique area with input and stakeholder consultation at every step to ensure that the right solution is achieved for all involved.  As I have said, I am happy to have support for this legislation from several law enforcement organizations. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in both Chambers, as well as the administration, toward our goal of protecting our Nation and securing our borders.  I firmly believe that border security, ultimately, is a matter of political will. This President has the political will, and this Congress should have the political will to get the job done. This was the commitment that he made and that we need to make to the American people and that, I think, informed their vote on November 8, 2016.  With this legislation as a guide, we aren't just securing our borders for tomorrow. We are looking ahead and locking in a framework that will exist long after President Trump leaves office.  With the Building America's Trust Act, I hope we can do just that and, again, finally regain the public's confidence by earning that confidence and restoring order and lawfulness to our broken immigration system.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-08-03-pt1-PgS4800-5.txt,1692,DEVELOPING INNOVATION AND GROWING THE INTERNET OF THINGS ACT,2017.0,3.0,September
306,topic-id,2025,"Mr.President, I just returned from Texas, where, as the world knows, Hurricane Harvey has devastated the gulf coast and now ranks among the costliest natural disasters in American history. Today I want to share with you what my State has experienced in the wake of this storm that has battered so many homes and broken so many hearts. The storm calamitously resulted in the loss of at least 60 lives, with probably more to come as the water recedes and as people's bodies are discovered. Of course, we mourn with those families who have lost loved ones.  You have seen the pictures, but let me describe what my fellow Texans have experienced firsthand. It started when Harvey ran into a patch of warm water in the Gulf of Mexico the week before last. As Harvey rumbled toward Texas, the ocean churned and the storm grew in size and strength. By the time it made landfall in the Coastal Bend region south of Houston, the hurricane was a Goliath--Category 4. The rain fell, the wind howled, and the water rose in towns like Rockport, Port Lavaca, and Aransas Streets became swamps, and homes filled up like bathtubs.  First were those smaller coastal communities that I just mentioned, but then one of the largest cities in the Nation, Houston, and nearby areas were hit. Third, let's not forget places like Port Arthur, Beaumont--where I was yesterday with Majority Leader McCarthy from the House of Representatives and my other colleagues--as well as other parts of Jefferson and surrounding counties that were hit when the storm barreled east and then finally abated.  Five days and 50 inches of rainfall--every known record was shattered. The National Hurricane Center was awed by the storm that it called ``relentless.'' The Washington Post appropriately called it ``merciless'' because it was. Sunday, August 27, was the wettest day ever in Houston, where nearly a third of the yearly rainfall came in 24 hours. A third of our annual expected rainfall in Houston came in 24 hours. Not only that, we now know Harvey was the most extreme rain event in the history of the continental United States, a catastrophe so unheard of that it comes perhaps only once in 1,000 years. Let that sink in for a moment--a 1,000-year rain event.  The storm's intensity easily could have overwhelmed first responders. Medical, law enforcement, and rescue personnel easily could have said: You know, I am exhausted. I haven't slept for days. I haven't been able to change my clothes. I can't do this anymore.  They could have easily said all of those things, but instead they kept wading into the water--the Harris County sheriff's water rescue team, the Texas National Guard, the U.Coast Guard, people like Sergeant Steve Perez, a 34-year veteran of the Houston Police Department who drowned in his patrol car during the storm. His wife told him not to go to work on that day, but Sergeant Perez's response was ``We've got work to do.'' He drove for over 2 hours trying to find a safe route to allow him to report for duty and to protect the community he loved. I hope Sergeant Perez's sacrifice will serve as an example to the rest of us to strive to serve others indiscriminately, no matter the potential cost.  Texas's neighbors could have easily stayed home too--after all, our friends in Louisiana learned tough lessons of their own from Hurricane Katrina--but they did not. They quickly mobilized. Calling themselves the Cajun Navy and the Cajun Coast Search and Rescue, they hitched their fishing boats to their pickup trucks and said: ``GTT,'' ``gone to Texas''--gone to Texas to join the other rescuers, both uniformed and volunteers.  What did they all do?  They saved people who were floating on air mattresses, the few belongings they could carry that were stuffed into garbage bags, and people who were stranded on rooftops. They navigated around submerged trees and stop signs and cars, working with little to no sleep, dripping wet with sweat pouring from their faces, and smelling like the murky water that surrounded them. It seems that I heard about these stories over and over and over again during my trips to Corpus Christi, Rockport, Austin, and all around the These are the stories I heard in Houston, Beaumont, and other cities--all of them devastated, but in none of them was their spirit destroyed.  My State and our Nation have responded to this terrible natural disaster. As I did a small part in loading bags of ice and water and serving spaghetti to evacuees in Austin, I was struck by how many people--public officials, volunteers, businesses, and nonprofits, great and small--had offered and given their support, and I want to say that we are grateful to all of them.  In particular, Governor Greg Abbott's leadership has been critical. He and his team of emergency management personnel, led by Chief Nim Kidd, were well prepared in advance, and they moved swiftly following the state of emergency being declared in more than 50 of the 254 Texas counties. Yet it was not just State and local officials who acted with such dispatch. The Federal Government stepped up, too, starting with the President of the United States, who personally, along with the First Lady, made two trips to the affected region. He brought members of his Cabinet, who had previously called[[Page S4920]]me and my other colleagues from the Texas delegation over and over and over again, asking: What more can we do?  I thank the President and the Vice President, who also came personally, clearing brush in Rockport, TX, in a demonstration of how to be a good neighbor and in his concern and commitment to the affected region.  I want to say that FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, also deserves recognition as part of this effort. Throughout the storm and in the days following, Administrator Brock Long has been a steady hand at the helm in his support of State and local teams with strategy, equipment, and personnel. Yet it was not just It was the Small Business Administration, HUD, and the Department of Homeland All of the heads of those agencies were there in person in Texas, asking over and over again: What more can we do?  It is not just government and government officials. It is organizations like the Red Cross, which ran shelters around the State, faith-based organizations, and people who just wanted to be good neighbors, doing anything and everything they could to volunteer--to serve food, provide dry clothes, and a safe place to sleep.  Now we know that FEMA's flood insurance programs, while they are being implemented, are about to run out of money by the end of this week. In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, the inspections have begun, and recovery housing teams are on the ground. Countless others--local, State, and Federal actors--are working around the clock to aid rescue and recovery efforts. Yet, as I said in Texas last week, the road ahead is going to be long and winding. In many ways, once the TV cameras leave and the waters recede, as people are just now coming home, the depth of their losses will just be sinking in with their places of business gone, all of their possessions destroyed, their cars inoperable. People are hurting. Housing and food, water and electricity, and transportation are a few of the things people have lost that most of us take for granted but not those who suffered at the hands of Hurricane  This is why I am working with Senator Cruz and the entire Texas congressional delegation on an appropriations request for disaster recovery. The many communities that have been impacted by this massive storm will need our help and need it quickly. As I said, FEMA, literally, will run out of funds at the end of this week. Unless we act with dispatch to appropriate an emergency supplemental this week, as the House will do tomorrow, and unless we raise the debt ceiling, there will not be any way that Congress will be able to actually appropriate that emergency funding and get it to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to help those who are in so much need. But working together, we are going to deliver that help.  As President Trump said last week, ``Texas can handle anything.'' I think the President is pretty much right. We have seen our share of catastrophes, and we have always bounced back. Texans are tough and resilient, and we always, always band together.  A few years ago, after another tragedy in West Texas that took the lives of a number of first responders in a terrible explosion, I remember running into a county commissioner who said: Texas doesn't just describe where you are from; it describes who your family is.  I know we all love our States, and we love our country, but I am particularly proud of how my State and Texans have stepped forward to help each other in this time of need. I know that all of my colleagues in this Chamber have spent time with their families and their friends this past weekend in honor of Labor As the summer now draws to a close, let's remember that many in Texas were not celebrating that holiday. They are struggling in shelters, not knowing what is left of their homes that they have been forced to flee.  With August now behind us, our work, like theirs, is just beginning. Tomorrow, as I said, the House will vote on a, roughly, $8 billion aid package--the first of several steps toward delivering relief to I appreciate House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who traveled with me yesterday to Houston and Beaumont to survey the damage in He had previously been with me and the Governor in Austin and talked about coordinating the Federal and State response. I look forward to working with Leader McCarthy and all of my colleagues in both Chambers of the Congress on addressing the needs caused by this terrible storm.  By the way, I appreciate all of the texts, the phone calls, and the emails that I have received from colleagues on both sides of the aisle throughout this terrible storm, expressing their concerns and offering their prayers and their help. I appreciate it.  My colleagues, I will just say this. Let's remember Sergeant Steve Perez, the police officer who died in Houston, whom I described earlier, the officer who could have stayed home. As his wife said: It is just too dangerous to go out there amidst the flood. Like him, let's do our duty and look for a way to work together.  Friends, let's get to work and do our job, not only in providing relief for the victims of Hurricane Harvey, but there is so much more that we need to do, working together.  I will close because I see the distinguished Democratic whip here, who I know has made the condition of the Dreamers--the children who came with their parents when they came to the United States in violation of our immigration laws. Of course, children are not responsible for what their parents have done. I actually believe that the President has given us an opportunity by what he did today. After all, what President Obama did, no matter how much we understand it, was essentially declared illegal by a Federal court. The President has no authority to do this unilaterally. That is what the Federal courts told President Obama, so President Trump has appropriately now said: Congress, you do your job. And we will.  I look forward to the debate. I look forward to working on this important issue, but I dare say that just addressing DACA and the Dreamers by themselves is not acceptable. We are going to do as much as we can to address our broken immigration system, to restore public confidence in our border security and the enforcement of our laws, and, once again, become a nation that is, yes, a nation of immigrants but also a nation of laws.

10,topic-id,1090,"Mr.President, today I join my colleagues and all Arkansans in support of and in prayers for the people of Southeast Texas and all of the victims of Hurricane I also want to express our thanks on behalf of a grateful nation. All of you reminded us of the American spirit at a time when we needed it pretty badly.  August was not an easy month for our country. First, in Charlottesville, then in Berkeley, we saw some pretty disgusting things--racism, anarchism, mob violence. If all you knew about America was what you saw on cable news and social media, you might think it was disintegrating into two armed camps of Communists and neo-Images reminiscent of dark days in the last century appeared on our screens--torchlight marches, black-masked thugs, political violence in the streets, beatings, and even a murder--but none of these contemptible people represent America, certainly not what is best about They cannot even begin to understand what makes this country great because this country's destiny was always to be more than a new battleground for old hatreds. It was meant to be a mighty fortress for the rights of all Our destiny is to be the home of mankind's aspiration for freedom, not the twisted delusions of grandeur of pathetic losers. The vast majority of Americans--whatever color, faith, age, or region--celebrate this creed, and they welcome this destiny.  That is exactly why we should not amplify irrelevant, fringe voices. It creates the illusion that a trivial, impotent minority is, in fact, a large and powerful movement against the dictates of common sense and experience. To my knowledge, I have never met a neo-Nazi, a White supremacist, or a leftwing anarchist, nor have the Arkansans with whom I spoke in the last month, but while watching TV or surfing the web in the last month, you would think they number in the tens of millions. The drive for ratings and clicks seemed to leave a lot of Americans wondering, Is this America? Is this whom we have become?  Then Hurricane Harvey made landfall. The stories and the images that followed, once again, proved the old maxim: Adversity does not teach character; it reveals character. What it revealed is an American spirit as strong, as brave, and as loving as ever.  Law enforcement and other first responders performed bravely and skillfully, as always, but what was striking was how ordinary citizens answered the call to duty. There was Jim McIngvale, better known as Mattress Anyone who has ever lived in Houston knows that you cannot watch TV without seeing a Mattress Mack commercial, but Mack was not selling mattresses that day--he was saving families. He turned two furniture stores into relief centers and opened his doors to anyone who sought shelter. Soon, he had 400 people at each store, sleeping on recliners, sofas, love seats--you name it. He gave out his personal cell number for people to call for help. If they could not reach his store because of the flooding, he sent his delivery trucks to go get them. When asked about his generosity, Mattress Mack replied: ``I'm a big believer that it's better to give than to take.''  But not everyone had a Mattress Mack to go to. Some people had to call their local Chick-fil-Jeffrey Urban went to work just to make sure that everything was all right when he noticed a familiar phone number flashing across the caller It was J.Spencer, a regular customer, who called that morning to place a once-in-a-lifetime order: two grilled chicken burritos with extra egg--and a boat. Urban called the owner, Cindy Smith, who sent her husband with his boat to the Spencers' home, but there was not enough room in the boat for both of them and their possessions. Luckily, two heroes on jet skis arrived--Keith Christensen and Winston Savice, When J.took a photo of his wife Karen sitting atop a jet ski while Winston sped her to safety, an internet sensation was born.  After weeks of our living rooms being filled with the sounds and imagery of hatred, we were suddenly overcome by stories of bravery and self-sacrifice. There was local reporter Brandi Smith, who flagged down a rescue crew to help a truckdriver who was trapped in his vehicle. There was Houston SWAT Officer Daryl Hudeck, who carried a young mother, Catherine Pham, and her 13-month-old son Aiden to dry land. There was Catholic priest David Bergeron, who kayaked around his neighborhood and offered to say Mass for anyone in town. Then there was an unknown man from Texas City, who said, when asked what he was doing with his boat under a flooded underpass, that he and his friends were there to save some lives.  So many of these images have already become iconic: Sheriff's Deputy Rick Johnson carrying two children through the floodwaters and the Cajun Navy from Louisiana being lined up like soldiers on a highway, as far as the eye could see, readying for battle. Yet perhaps the most telling image of all was the human chain. When Andrea Smith went into labor in her flooded apartment, her neighbors formed a human chain to help her reach a dump truck that had come to take her to the hospital. There was no pride of place, no rank, no distinction--just humble, selfless Americans who joined hands to help a neighbor in time of need.  You could say that human chain was a symbol because, when you step back and soak it all in, you realize this is America, that this is who we are as a nation, not those ideological zealots, not racists and Their blinded eyes cannot see the dignity and love in that unbroken human chain.  We have never lost this spirit of America, but we do occasionally lose sight of it, which is why we ought to pay tribute to these normal, public-spirited Americans--the people in that human chain, the people who heeded the call, who put their stranded countrymen first. They do not mistake malice for power, and they understand that the greatest power of all is love. They are an inspiration to all of us in this Chamber and, indeed, to all the world. They are the reason we can look to Houston, a city much embattled though not embittered, and take pride in what we see--not human devastation but human valor.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

136,topic-id,761,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding me this time, and I want to thank, as well, the cosponsor--actually, the lead sponsor--Mr.Roskam, for his work here today.  Today is a good day for the American taxpayers as, hopefully, the House of Representatives will soon, once again, pass the Clyde-Hirsch-Sowers RESPECT Act to enact vital reforms to the Federal Government's civil asset forfeiture process.  Civil asset forfeiture is an important tool that the IRS and other Federal agencies use to go after ill-gotten funds from drug dealers, human traffickers, terrorists, and other criminals. This bill will not weaken that vital law enforcement tool one iota, and that is an important point to make. But this legislation will codify into law much-needed reforms to the process to stop what we believe is an abuse of the asset seizures practiced, abusive seizures such as the government's ability to take a person's bank account without ever charging them with a crime.  The Oversight Subcommittee on the Ways and Means Committee, under the guidance of Chairman Peter Roskam, undertook a painstaking, multiyear investigation to get to the bottom of these abusive practices. This investigation included holding a series of congressional hearings--that doesn't always happen anymore around here, Peter, as you know--meeting with officials from a number of Federal agencies, including the I want to thank Commissioner Koskinen for his input and frankness as well, as the ranking member has just indicated.  The subcommittee continued keeping pressure on the IRS and the Justice Department to proactively reach out and return any assets seized from people who were never, ever charged with a crime. These actions culminated in this bipartisan legislation that passed the Ways and Means Committee unanimously.  This bill, the Clyde-Hirsch-Sowers RESPECT Act, aims to take what we have learned and fix the system to better protect all law-abiding citizens. Specifically, it prohibits the IRS from taking any asset related to structuring unless the funds are from an illegal source or the funds were structured to conceal other criminal activity.  Additionally, to provide due process to affected taxpayers, the bill requires the IRS to notify an account holder of a seizure within 30 days--fairly reasonable. Once an account is seized, the bill allows the person whose assets were seized to seek a hearing within 30 days. Now, we know that those engaged in illegal activity and illegal actions will usually not contest the seizure. But for those who committed no crime, this bill simply levels the playing field for them.  My colleague, Mr.Roskam, and I will continue to keep the pressure on the Federal Government to quickly return the assets of those innocent taxpayers--those who are not charged with any crimes but whose bank accounts and other items are still being held by their own government.  But passage of this bill isn't the last part of the fight on wrongful asset forfeiture. This bill is expected to pass this House unanimously, as it did last year, because we all recognize and believe in the basic American judicial premise of innocent until proven guilty. However, I am concerned by the Trump administration's statements and those of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in particular, that the government intends to increase these asset seizures without any intention of charging affected Americans with crimes.  Let me be clear: I support civil asset seizures when the government can make the case that the money was derived from illicit activity. As I said before, nothing in this bill hinders the ability of the government to do just that. But we must fight any effort by the Trump administration to expand wrongful civil asset forfeiture and continue to take innocent people's own money without charging them with a crime.  Finally, as I close, I want to remind my colleagues of the importance of a larger discussion on much-needed criminal justice reform and an issue I hope this Congress can begin to tackle this year.  Just like the Clyde family, the Hirsch family, and the Sowers family who we named this bill after, far too many American families have seen the U.justice system unfairly work against them rather than for them. We need to address that issue of criminal justice reform in the same bipartisan way that Chairman Roskam and the entire Ways and Means Committee dealt with this particular issue.[[Page H6637]]  With that, Mr.Speaker, I look forward to passage of this bill. I thank Mr.Roskam, again, for the sponsorship of this legislation working together in a very bipartisan way to get this bill out of committee to the floor and pass the  ",CREC-2017-09-05-pt1-PgH6634-5.txt,1604,"ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, AUGUST 4, 2017, THROUGH TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2017",2017.0,5.0,September

25,topic-id,1415,"Mr.President, I want to tell a story about one of the great volunteers in His name is Jesus He is a young man who has a great story, who was one of the heroes of Hurricane Harvey in his own small way.[[Page S4921]]  At the age of 6, Jesus was brought from Mexico to the United States by his parents. It was not a family decision. His mom and dad made the decision and brought him to Houston, TX, where he grew up and got good grades in school. He wanted to go to college. He went to the Lone Star College in Houston and became a paramedic--a paramedic who responded to Hurricane  He spent 6 straight days out there, helping people who were in desperate need. Because of his training as a paramedic, he was able to give them emergency first aid and insulin when they were suffering from the impact of diabetes, and he did it day after day after day. He would go home, take a shower, and go right back out again. He finally took a day off and got some rest, and he went back and did it all over again.  The important part of this story is that Jesus Contreras is a paramedic because of the DACA Program, which you have just heard described on the floor by the Senator from It was President Obama's DACA Program that allowed him to stay in the United States, after having been brought here as a 6-year-old, and to go to school and become a paramedic. The DACA Program did that because it protected him from deportation, and it allowed him to legally work here in the United States as a paramedic. It was only because of DACA that this young man was able to step up and be part of that huge group of people who came forward in Houston, TX, and other cities and made such a difference in the lives of so many people.  So when I hear the DACA Program dismissed as just overreach by a President, illegal, and unconstitutional, I beg my colleagues: Take a look at the human side of this story for a moment. Take a look at the human side of 780,000 people, just like Jesus, who have been protected from deportation, and what they have done with their lives. He didn't vote to leave His parents did. He didn't vote for them not to file papers once he arrived in the United His parents did. That is what the Dream Act and DACA are all about.  If I am speeding down the highway and a patrolman pulls me over and gives me a speeding ticket, they don't give a ticket to my grandson sitting in the backseat. He wasn't driving the car.  In this situation, the Dreamers and those protected by DACA were young people brought to this country and who know no other country.  For year after year, he stood up in the classroom and pledged allegiance to the only flag he knew. He believes himself to be Listen to what he wrote to me. This is what Jesus Contreras wrote to me:       Houston is my home and these are my people. I love my      career--it's given me an opportunity to help people in ways I      never imagined I could. DACA means everything to me--I would      lose my license and certifications without it. I would be      sent back to a country I don't know and would lose      everything.  Is that what we want to see happen here? Do we want to set up a circumstance where this young man doesn't have a chance to continue to serve people as he did during Hurricane Harvey in Houston, TX? Of course not.  The announcement by the President today that he is going to bring an end to DACA, I guess, came as no major surprise, but I listened carefully to what President-Elect Trump and what President Trump said about DACA and Dreamers over the months. He said to me personally--he looked me in the eye and said: Don't worry about these kids. We are going to take care of the He said publicly: We love the Well, now we have a chance to do something about it.  I just had a press conference with Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican, of South He and I have come together to introduce the Dream Act, which says, once and for all, that we need permanent law to protect these young people. It is not a new concept. I introduced the bill 16 years ago. If you said someone was a Dreamer 16 years ago, they would have said: Is he with the British rock group? People didn't know what a Dreamer was. They know today. It is people like Jesus, brought to this country as kids and who are just asking for a chance to be part of America--and they are willing to sacrifice.  When he went through Lone Star College, as an undocumented student, Jesus Contreras didn't qualify for one penny of Federal assistance--no government loans for him. He had to work his way through school. It takes that kind of determination to make it through school and to become an important part of  So today I am disappointed by what has happened--the announcement by Attorney General Sessions, who has never ever, in my time in the Senate, supported any immigration reform. He has never voted for the Dream The fact that he was the first public voice saying that he was going to rescind--that the administration would rescind--DACA was no surprise. That is where he has been for as long as I have known him, publicly and politically. But I hope that the President now, because of the good things he said in the past about the Dream Act and DACA, will be part of the solution and will help us in the 6 months to pass something that makes a difference.  I listened to the Senator from Texas stack up a whole list of things we need to have before we can help people like There are a lot of things we need to do. Comprehensive immigration reform is one of them. I was one of the persons who put it together and voted for it when it had 68 votes in the Senate a few years ago. We need that. But, for goodness' sake, we have a time-sensitive issue now with the Dreamers and We need to do something about it and do it quickly. That is why Senator Graham and I are calling for passing the Dream Act in this September session. We know it is there. We have heard positive things said about it by Speaker Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, and even by Senator McConnell, Senator Hatch, and many who cosponsored it. We have to bring this measure up and get it done, once and for all.  In the meantime, 780,000 young people in America protected by DACA heard the news today, and their hearts were broken. They know now that the clock is running. It is the deportation clock. If we don't act--and act in a timely fashion--young people like this man here, who risked his life and helped the people in Houston during Hurricane Harvey, may be deported, and he will certainly lose any opportunity he has to continue to be a licensed paramedic.  Will America be better if Jesus Contreras has to leave the United States? Would Houston have been better during this crisis if he had not been there? I don't think so. We know better. We know that these young people really care and really want to be a part of our They are willing to turn in all their family information, go through background checks, and pay a filing fee under You know they want to be a part of this country.

354,topic-id,3068,"Mr.President, I want to start this morning's presentation on the floor of the Senate with a question. What is the most heavily subsidized private business in America--the for-profit business that receives more Federal subsidies than any other? Is it a defense contractor? Is it some farming operation?  The most heavily subsidized for-profit, private business in America today is for-profit colleges and universities. Why? Because the revenue they receive from the Federal Government accounts for 85, 90, 95 percent or more of all of the revenue they take in. How can that possibly be? How could you run a private for-profit business and have a Federal subsidy of 98 percent? How is that possible?  Here is how it works. A student graduates from high school. The student applies to a for-profit college or university. The for-profit college or university accepts the student on the condition that the student sign over Pell grants--Federal money--and the student's Federal Government loan. The student signs over the Pell grant, signs over the loan, and is enrolled in the school.  This for-profit school now is home free. They admitted the student. They received all the money from the student, and the student is headed for classes. It works only if the student, at the end of the day, ends up with some value in their education--some experience that helps them go on to get a job to pay off their student loans.  It turns out that, in too many instances, for-profit colleges and universities entice these young people into signing up for classes that are worthless. They end up not preparing them for any job. Now they are in a terrible fix. If they finish the course, they have a heavy, large student debt and they end up in a position where they can't get a job and pay it off.  How often does this happen? Think of three numbers. So 9 percent of students graduating from high school today in America go to for-profit colleges and universities. What am I talking about--for-profit? There is the University of Phoenix, DeVry, Rasmussen, and the list goes on and on. So 9 percent of high school students go to these schools, and 20 percent or more of Federal aid to education goes to these schools. Why? Because the tuition they charge is so high. But here is the kicker: 35 percent, one out of three students in America who defaults on their student loans has attended these for-profit colleges and universities.  We decided under the previous administration, the Obama administration, to start asking some hard questions. How are these for-profit colleges and universities enticing these students in? What are they saying to them to bring them in to sign up for classes and for their student loans?  Secondly, if the students finish their degrees at these for-profit colleges and universities, how likely are they to end up with a job that is worth something--a job that allows them to pay back their student loan? Those are legitimate questions; aren't they? If you were the parent of a child who said: Dad, I just heard about the University of Phoenix, and I want to go to school there, you would obviously say: Well, what are you interested in taking? Is it a good course? How much does it cost? What will be your debt when you are finished? What is your likelihood of finding a job? Those are obvious questions. We put all those questions into something called the gainful employment rule. At the end of graduating from for-profit colleges and universities, will you be gainfully employed as a graduated student into a job that gives you a chance to pay off your student loan and really keeps the promise that the for-profit school made to you?  Just weeks ago, the new Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, announced that our U.Department of Education was going to rewrite the gainful employment rule. The rule, as I said, was written by the Obama administration after years of contentious debate with the industry. It was designed to ensure that career training programs that receive Federal student aid are meeting their statutory obligation to prepare the students for a job--for gainful employment.  Don't forget that a lot of young people applying for college are in families that have limited college experience. Mom and Dad may have never gone to college. So when you say DeVry or University of Phoenix, Mom and Dad may say: Is it any good, Son? Is it any good,[[Page S4783]]Daughter? The son or daughter can say: Dad, the Federal Government will loan me the money to go there. It must be a good school. They wouldn't loan me the money to go to a place that is bad. That is a natural reaction. We are, in fact, condoning, endorsing this industry by saying: If you go to these schools, you get taxpayer-funded student loans.  I don't think it is too much to ask the programs promising to train students for specific jobs that actually lead to students being able to get those jobs and, in the process, repay their loans.  The gainful employment rule cuts off Federal student aid if programs where graduates' ratio of student debt to earnings is too high during any 2 years of a 3-year period. We look at the jobs of the graduate of the for-profit schools, we look at the income of the students, and then ask: What is the likelihood that student can make their student loan repayment based on their employment? Is it, in fact, gainful employment?  So prior to leaving office, the Obama Department of Education released gainful employment data for the year 2016. It showed that graduates of public undergraduate certificate programs--now that is those who go to community colleges, different colleges altogether--earn $9,000 more than those who went to for-profit colleges and universities. Do you know what the difference is?  If you decide to go to a community college in my home State of Illinois, in my hometown of Springfield, and go to Lincoln Land Community College--a great community college like most of those in our State--you are going to get an education, a good one, and it will not cost you much. Let me give you the kicker. All of your hours can be transferred to upper level colleges and universities, but if you make a bad decision and go to a for-profit college, different things happen. You end up with a real debt for that first year out of high school and guess what. Virtually none of the credit hours you take at that for-profit school can be transferred to any other college or university. That is the reality of what students face.  Of the programs that saddled students with too much debt compared to the income students receive after the program--listen to this--when we looked at all of the student debt and all of the jobs of all of the graduates across the United States, it turns out, 98 percent of the students who couldn't pay off their student loans after graduating went to for-profit colleges and universities. That was the 2016 analysis. That is what led to the gainful employment rule.  This is cruel to take a young person who is doing just what they were told to do--go to college, get a degree, don't quit with high school--saddle them with debt, make an empty promise about what is going to happen after they graduate, and then they find themselves in a job they can't pay off their student loan. Let me give you a specific example so you can really understand what we have run into.  The digital photography program at the Illinois Institute of Art in Schaumburg, IL--now, let me quickly add, the folks who put this together were pretty smart. We have an outstanding college in Chicago called the Art Institute of My daughter graduated from there. However, this bunch, the for-profit group, decided to call their operation the Illinois Institute of Art, instead of the Art Institute of  They are owned by a for-profit giant, the Education Management They failed the gainful employment rule in the year 2016. Listen to what it wrote on their website for students who wanted to enroll:       There's a market for people who constantly find innovative      ways to fill the world with their ideas, impressions, and      insights. And Digital Photography can help you make a      positive impression when you're ready to match your talents      against the competition. From the very start, we'll guide      your development, both creatively and technically . . . it's      a step-by-step process that's all about preparing you for a      future when you can do what you love.  That is what is on the website for the high school student who likes the idea of majoring in digital photography at the Illinois Institute of Art in Boy, doesn't that sound good?  So let's contrast that with what the gainful employment rule found about that particular program. Get ready. Do you know what the total cost of the digital photography course was at the Illinois Institute of Art, the for-profit school--total cost of tuition, fees, books, and supplies to prepare you to be a digital photographer? It is $88,000--$88,000. It gets better. That is if you live off campus.  Do you want to live on campus? The company helps you find an apartment nearby. Over the 4 years, it is an additional $56,000.  Let's do the quick math here. That is $144,000 in debt, finishing 4 years, majoring in digital photography at the Illinois Institute of How many students have to borrow money to do that? Eighty four percent of the students who went to that school and took digital photography had to borrow the money--84 percent.  Guess what the typical graduate of the Illinois Institute of Art in Schaumburg, IL, in the digital photography course earns after leaving the program. Do you remember that promise on their website? How much do they earn? On average, it is $20,493--$20,493.  Here is a quick calculation. What if I am being paid the minimum wage in America? In Illinois, it is $9.25 an hour. Well, I would be making right around $18,500 a year in a minimum-wage job. I have gone to the Illinois Institute of Art in Schaumburg to take the digital photography course and instead of making $18,500 a year, I am making $20,493. That is almost $2,000 more a year. Oh, I forget. I forgot $144,000 in debt that I also have. Let's do the math. How many years of an additional $2,000 to pay off $144,000? It is only 72 years, and you would be able to pay off your student debt. What a rip-off. These people ought to be ashamed of themselves, and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves that we are supporting this kind of fraudulent activity at the expense of students who were just trying to get a better education.  That is why we wrote this gainful employment rule, to say to the Illinois Institute of Art and those just like them: Stop it. Stop fleecing these kids, stop burying them in debt. Incidentally, many times parents and even grandparents sign on for that debt too.  You know something else you ought to remember? Of all the debts you could incur in life, there are only a handful of them that can never be discharged in bankruptcy. Student loans would happen to be in that category. Do you know what that means? No matter how bad it gets--and it could get to the point where you have no income whatsoever--no matter how bad it gets, you can't go to the courts and say: Please, turn me free. Discharge this debt in bankruptcy. Give me a chance to start all over again.  You can do it with your home mortgage. You can do it with an auto loan. You can do it if you have a loan for a boat but not with student loans. It is with you for a lifetime.  We have had cases where Grandma decided to help her granddaughter by cosigning the note at one of these miserable schools. The granddaughter couldn't pay back the student loan, and they went after Grandma's Social Security payments. That is what this is all about. That is how serious this can become.  There is no way students leaving that digital photography program at this for-profit college in Schaumburg will ever repay their loans making that money. Under the gainful employment rule, if the Illinois Institute of Art doesn't change its program or lower its price or help its students get better jobs, we would stop providing student loans to the students who are engaged in that program. We are not going to be complicit--we shouldn't be--in this fraud. The rule requires schools to post their gainful employment data online using a new, easy-to-read disclosure so students can read what happened to students who took the digital photography course. Did they get jobs? How much did they earn?  That is also one of the requirements of the gainful employment rule. It requires schools to provide warnings to students in advertising and marketing materials about failing programs so they know before they sign up--they know before they go in debt.  Think about what these disclosures and warnings might have meant to Ami Schneider from Hoffman Estates, Ami went to this notorious art institute--the Illinois Institute of Art--[[Page S4784]]the Schaumburg digital photography program from 2007 to 2010. She wrote me a letter and told me her story.  Ami said she moved out of her parents' house at age 19, and after a few years, realized she couldn't have the life she wanted with the job she was working. She was getting 50-cent-an-hour raises every year. She said: I wanted to pursue a career, and I really was serious. I was passionate about it. She visited this Illinois Institute of Art campus in ``I went into [the school],'' she wrote me, ``and they fed me all these success stories. They told me they had [an] excellent placement'' program.  What do you think would have happened if they would have told Ami that at the end of the day, she would have been making slightly more than minimum wage after taking all these courses and incurring all this debt? What if they had been required to tell Ami that employers wouldn't accept her degree and she would never pay off her student loan?  Well, Ami and tens of thousands of students like her across the country would have been spared from a hardship that can change their lives. Ami says her time at the Illinois Institute of Art ``ended up ruining my life.'' In her twenties, she made a decision to go to college, got so deeply in debt, and can't pay it back.  The program culminated in a portfolio show where the students displayed their best work. Do you know how many employers--after Ami finished the course and did her display--do you know how many employers showed up for Ami's class portfolio show at the Illinois Institute of Art? Not one.  Ami and her family who took out the loans to help her now hold more than $100,000 in student loan debt from her time at the Illinois Institute of She is stuck with a degree which, as she said, she ``considered a joke.''  Using the questionable legal authority, which she claims she has, the new Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has decided to delay for a year the requirement that schools warn students like Ami about these failing programs--delayed it for a year. That is another year that for-profit education companies will be able to hide the truth about their miserable results. It means students are going to be defrauded because Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has decided to let it happen.  It means more students like Ami and more Federal dollars in the pockets of these greedy, for-profit college executives. You wouldn't believe what these people pay themselves who head up these for-profit colleges and universities. Take the most successful basketball coach in the United States of America at the college level, take the most successful football coach in a State like Alabama, take a look at what they get paid--and I am sure in Alabama they would pay them even more if they could--and then compare it to what these CEOs pay themselves off these poor students. It is disgraceful. For the sake of the students and taxpayers who immediately would benefit from real warnings, it is time for us in Congress to speak up.  We also know Secretary DeVos intends to eventually rewrite the gainful employment rule, what she called a ``regulatory reset.'' What does that mean?  We hear a lot of speeches on the floor about too much government regulation. If you were Ami Schneider or her parents, would you consider a disclosure to students about the real results of their education, a disclosure to students about the debt they are going to incur and the income they are likely to earn overregulation by the Federal Government?  We are putting a lot of money on the line to give $100,000, at least, of the Federal taxpayers' dollars to Ami to go to school, but she has to promise to pay it back. If she defaults, that money isn't paid back into the For the good of the taxpayers as well as for her family, we should have some basic regulations, some basic accountability.  While Secretary DeVos says the rule is unfair and arbitrary, the Department of Education Inspector General agreed with the assertion that it was a good rule in terms of protecting kids and protecting taxpayers. I am proud to say the rule is supported by many State Attorneys General, including Lisa Madigan in my home State of Illinois, veterans groups, and student advocates.  Secretary DeVos said the gainful employment rule has been ``repeatedly . . . overturned by the courts'' In effect, since it went into effect in 2015, every Federal court it has been in front of has upheld the underlying rule. The Secretary is just plain wrong.  It is time for Secretary DeVos and the Trump administration to stop aiding and abetting for-profit colleges that defraud students and bilk taxpayers.

I believe that everyone on all sides of this issue desire the same thing, and I appreciate Chairman Alexander working with me to get a study relating to this matter. I believe that we are all working, in sincerity, towards a goal of providing those who would benefit from hearing aids with access to safe and effective products that will help them live the kinds of lives which they choose and desire. That being said, I am concerned about a policy which will create a division between a healthcare provider and a patient who needs that provider's expertise.  Thank you.

216,topic-id,936,"Mr.President, today I offer private immigration relief legislation to provide an immigrant visa or lawful permanent resident status to Maria Mendoza Sanchez, Eusebio Sanchez, and Vianney The family represents the essence of the American dream. I believe they merit Congress' special consideration for this relief.  In August 2014, my office assisted Maria and Eusebio with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during their request for a stay of removal. Under the previous administration, ICE found that their case was worthy of a favorable exercise of discretion. This was an acknowledgement that they posed no public safety risk, had no criminal records, and therefore should not be priorities for deportation.  Despite this, in 2017, the Trump administration, told Maria and Eusebio that they were no longer eligible for a stay of removal and that they should prepare for deportation Mario and Eusebio pled with ICE to reconsider this sudden change in policy and I supported their request--believing it would be senseless and callous to remove them from our However, all possible avenues to delay their deportation were denied by immigration. officials.  In August 2017, after living productive lives in this Country for 23 years, Maria and Eusebio were deported back to Their deportation was truly heartbreaking for me, their family, and their community. I personally met Maria and Eusebio and can attest that they are the kind of people we should welcome into the United States with open arms. They are hardworking, law-abiding people who have been self-supporting, have paid their taxes, and owned a home in East  Prior to her deportation, Maria worked as a registered nurse in a local hospital in Oakland, She provided care to patients afflicted with conditions such as trauma, stroke, and cancer. Her supervisor said that her ``genuine compassion, appreciation for her work, and deep knowledge of nursing practices made her an excellent addition to [our hospital].'' Another letter of support said that Maria ``is a great asset to our hospital, community, and country. She is the epitome of what Americans should be.'' Maria's bilingual skills made her a strategic asset in assisting patients at work, which serves uninsured, underserved, and low-income populations. Her deportation is a great loss to many of the patients that relied on her critical assistance as they went through medical treatment.  Similar to Maria, Eusebio was a hardworking contributor to their community. He was a truck driver for a San Francisco-based company, and his employer has described him as ``very reliable, trustworthy, [a] team player, and exceptional worker.'' His friends describe him as someone who ``is a good person, responsible at work, willing to help when we need assistance.''  Together, Eusebio and Maria have raised four children--three of whom are U.citizens. Their oldest daughter, Vianney, age 23, has protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, program. She graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz with a degree in She has aspirations of using her education to work in public service and help her community. She is passionate about doing work that allows her to focus on improving the lives of residents of Oakland and the Bay As a result of Maria and Eusebio's deportation, Vianney will be assuming responsibility of her two younger sisters. I believe that Vianney's determination to make sure her sisters are properly cared for, after dealing with the crushing experience of being separated from her parents, is a testament to her remarkable strength and resilience, and a sign of the kind of values instilled in her by her now deported parents.  The Sanchez's second daughter, Melin, age 21, is a U.citizen. She is currently enrolled at the University of California at Santa Cruz, where she is studying molecular cell and developmental biology. She has aspirations of becoming a pediatrician. Maria and Eusebio paid her college tuition and supported her as she studied for the MCAT and volunteered at a hospital. Their deportation leaves Melin's college tuition in peril.  The Sanchez's third daughter, Elizabeth, age 16, is a U.citizen and is currently enrolled at the NEA Community Learning Center in Elizabeth was diagnosed with a speech delay and learning disabilities at a young age, but with the support of her parents, was able to make great progress and is doing well in school. She needs the support of her parents and continuing to separate her from them will significantly affect her ability to pursue her dreams.  The Sanchez's son, Jesus, age 12, is a U.citizen. He was born with a congenital heart disease, which requires continued medical attention. Jesus has accompanied his parents on their return to Maria and Eusebio's deportation will have an extraordinary impact on He can no longer continue his education in the U.S., the only Country he has ever known. Additionally, Jesus obtained health insurance coverage for his medical condition through his parents. As a result of their deportation, he will lose access to medical care in the U. Maria, Eusebio, and Vianney have become respected members of their community in This is exemplified in the overwhelming support they received to shield them from deportation. Separating this family is not what our country stands for. Maria and Eusebio want nothing more than to continue to provide for their children and continue contributing to this great country they called home. Their deportation has greatly affected their ability to do so.  I believe that Maria and Eusebio's deportation has been a tremendous loss[[Page S4942]]for their children and community. In addition, I believe Vianney needs further protection. This family warrants our compassion, and I will keep fighting for them.  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-05-pt1-PgS4941.txt,1332,SAVING FEDERAL DOLLARS THROUGH BETTER USE OF GOVERNMENT PURCHASE AND,2017.0,5.0,August

175,topic-id,1233,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to discuss the growing threat from North Last month, the North Koreans conducted two intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, tests. The first came as our Nation celebrated its Independence The second test was conducted last week.  According to a number of reports, the second test demonstrated sufficient range to reach much of the United This increasing threat is a concern that I often hear about from  For years, the United States has assessed North Korea to have an ICBM capability, but it was largely unproven. In his 5\1/2\ years in power, Kim Jong Un has conducted more missile tests than his father did during his 17-year reign. Under an aggressive testing program, North Korea has turned a theoretical ICBM capability into an undeniable reality.  Adding to the threat, they have made progress beyond ICBM technology. Over the past year, North Korea has conducted several tests of a submarine-launched ballistic missile. In February, the regime demonstrated a new solid-fueled, road-mobile ballistic missile.  Altogether, these developments reveal a dedicated, sophisticated development program that is relentlessly pursuing weapons designed for no other purpose than to threaten the United States and our allies. The rapid pace of development also indicates an increasingly capable scientific industrial base within North  Questions still remain about the regime's ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead, deliver it accurately, and shield it from the stress associated with launch and then reentry. We should expect Kim Jong Un to overcome these obstacles if the status quo remains unchanged.[[Page S4794]]  Admiral Harris, the commander of the U.Pacific Command, said in his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year: ``It is clearly a matter of when.''  This sense confirms that a drastic change in our approach is required. Our current multilateral efforts have not yielded the results needed to keep the world safe.  The failure of the United Nations Security Council to issue a statement condemning North Korea's July 3 ICBM test was a step backward in the international effort to isolate and to punish the regime for its illegal behavior. With Russia and China preventing any substantive action at the United Nations, I believe we must aggressively implement unilateral sanctions to punish the companies and the countries underwriting Pyongyang's belligerence.  One thing is certain. The principal economic enablers of the Kim regime are China and  Beijing provides direct food and energy assistance to North Korea and is by far the largest market for North Korean exports, such as minerals. North Korean hackers reportedly conduct cyber crime operations from northern China, and almost all of North Korea's internet access is provided via a fiber-optic cable running between those two nations. North Korea has also used Chinese banks to conduct transactions associated with its illicit proliferation activities and its criminal operations.  Russia's economic ties are more limited, but the Russians have been known to import North Korean labor and provide energy supplies, including jet fuel, to  These ties provide China and Russia with influence over North How have they used that influence? Instead of helping to restrain the regime, they appear to be rewarding its bad behavior. Reports indicate both nations are increasing their bilateral trade, with several claiming trade between Russia and North Korea increased by 85 percent in comparison to last year.  Some argue China is unwilling to impose harsh restrictions on trade with Pyongyang because it would risk the regime's collapse and send a wave of North Korean refugees across their border. This argument might explain providing minimal assistance, but it does not justify billions of dollars in cross-border trade, nor does it explain why North Korean ballistic missiles are photographed being hauled by Chinese-made trucks.  China and Russia must believe the Kim regime serves their strategic interests.  For our purposes, these economic relationships are avenues through which we can impose costs on facilitating North Korea's belligerent behavior. Congress gave President Trump broad authority to take action against the nations supporting the North Korean regime's illegal activities, particularly those fostering the regime's hostile cyber activities, weapons programs, abuse of human rights, and their criminal networks. It is time for the President to use his authority to show China and Russia that continued support of the North Koreans will harm their own interests.  The administration has already begun to implement such measures. In June, the United States announced sanctions against a Chinese bank, two Chinese individuals, and a Chinese entity for supporting the North Korean regime. It appears, though, that this warning shot has fallen on deaf ears, because there has been no change in their behavior.  Chinese officials are sticking to their talking points, and they are objecting to any measures so they don't have to bear the costs of their own behavior. Take China's reaction to South Korea's decision to deploy the THAAD system. South Korea deployed a THAAD battery to improve the defenses against North Korean missiles. This is a defensive system that poses no threat to  Yet how did China respond? They shut down South Korean-owned department stores. The South Korean conglomerate who owns the stores also owns the property where the THAAD system was deployed. Moreover, the conglomerate's websites were hit by cyber attacks, and unofficial restrictions appear to have been imposed on imports of South Korean cosmetics and South Korean tourism.  It is clear that the Chinese view North Korea through a narrow lens of immediate strategic interest. That is how we must target our actions. By rigorously applying sanctions, we can make clear to China and any other nation doing business with the North Korean regime that continued support for the DPRK will harm their interests.  Of course, sanctions are not a panacea, and aggressively applying them does carry risk. Indeed, if we could be totally confident that the secondary sanctions would solve this problem, I suspect that they would have been implemented long ago. Time is not on our side and 8 years of strategic patience has narrowed our options. If we want different results, we must change our strategy, and we must make these changes now.  While firmly applying additional sanctions, the United States must also increase its defenses. Of course, our nuclear deterrent remains our country's ultimate protection against nuclear attack. Wednesday's successful test of a Minuteman III ICBM by our military provides continued assurance that our deterrent remains reliable and ready. We cannot rely on deterrence alone, and we must ensure that our missile defense efforts stay ahead of North Korea's accelerating developments.  I am a longtime member, and now the chairman, of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, which oversees our missile defense programs. Through this role, I have had the benefit of working closely with the Directors of the Missile Defense Agency and the commanders of STRATCOM to improve our missile defenses.  Over the years, the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized additional funding for the construction of a new missile defense radar, known as the Long Range Discrimination Radar, or the LRDR, to track potential threats from North The committee is also focused on improving the robustness of our homeland missile defense system, known as the Ground-based Midcourse Defense, or GMD, system as well.

154,topic-id,2579,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak on a policy matter that has been generating substantial attention recently, and that is modern antitrust law. This issue is critical. In the perennial debate over the proper role of government in economic affairs, it will grow all the more critical in the years to come.  New technologies, creating markets not even imaginable only a decade ago, are spurring fundamental shifts in the economic landscape. In the national news, mergers between corporate giants or new fines imposed by foreign regulators are becoming an acceptable thing almost every day. In the Senate, we increasingly see antitrust law dragged into larger economic arguments that are heavier in inflammatory rhetoric than in careful deliberation. Allow me, then, to offer a few thoughts on the matter, and to directly address the rising controversy.  America has always been--and, I haven't a doubt, will remain--the economic and technological marvel of the world. Cradled in the best traditions of the West and animated by a culture equal parts industrious, creative, and restless, our system has produced the most prosperous people in human history. It has shown its shortcomings, to be sure. But on the whole, the American economy is unrivaled by any other. Indeed, at times its blessings are so bountiful, its provisions for the creation of wealth so effective, that we tend to take it for granted in this country. We tend, at times, to forget what got us here.  A big part of what got us here is American antitrust law. You see, all throughout history, societies and governments have tended toward the central planning of economic activity.  America, however, chose a different path. We refused to yield to the false comforts of collectivism. We opted, instead, for an economy that was vibrant, tumultuous, competitive, and free. It is fortunate that we did, for we have found that in the impossible complexity and unsettling chaos of the market--wherein millions of consumers and producers make millions of individual and uncoordinated decisions each and every day--a spontaneous order arises that serves all of us far better than any central authority ever could. Of course, our markets work toward those ends only when they are genuinely free, fair, and competitive. That is where antitrust comes in.  In a very real sense, antitrust is the capitalist's answer to the siren song of the central planner. When antitrust doctrine is referred to as the Magna Carta of the free enterprise system, I suspect this is what we mean.  Let me be clear: Antitrust doctrine in this country has not always gotten it right. As we all know, early antitrust policy tended to confuse protection of market participants for protection of the market itself; it was quick to micromanage particular industries, to choose ad hoc intervention over predictable systems of incentives, and to cast suspicion on any market too concentrated or business too big.  Fortunately, antitrust doctrine grows and adapts. It develops in the same wonderful tradition and manner as the common law. Just as the common law historically gave us property, contract, and commercial rights, so too upon their basis does antitrust seek, year by year, to give us markets that are competitive and free. Thus, the modern era of antitrust has produced a fundamental improvement in our competitive doctrine.  We have steadily adopted the consumer welfare standard, which judges the conduct of firms and the arrangement of markets by what will maximize efficiency and therein serve consumers most completely.  There will always be market failures to account for and noneconomic concerns to keep in mind. But when it comes to the core, basic functioning of the market--how to deliver the most[[Page S4803]]goods to the most people at the highest quality and lowest cost--consumer welfare still works best.  In most industries, most of the time, we ought to think a little less about how best to regulate the market and a little more about how best to set the market upon regulating itself. The disciplining effects of competition and the limitless store of American ingenuity do far more for consumers than the well-intentioned intervention of government authorities.  The consumer welfare standard has, consistently over the years, proved an absolute boon to our economy and our society. Of course, a legal standard means little unless handled with care.  We have chosen the right standard; now we must keep choosing the right officials to implement it. You see, under the consumer welfare standard, good antitrust enforcement is a lot like good sports officiating. It harnesses, rather than stems, the flow of the action. It lays out limited, predictable, and reliably enforced rules. It gets the most out of the players and the competition itself, regardless of which team is in the lead. Most importantly, as any sports fan could tell you, when officiating is done right, we hardly notice the refs at all.  With the right antitrust officials cognizant of their role, we can expect a spirited contest in which American entrepreneurs keep putting points on the board and American consumers keep reaping the reward.  Federal judges, naturally, are critical. In disputes of consequence, they provide the ultimate backstop.  Also critical are our executive officials. Makan Delrahim, for instance, has been nominated to lead the Antitrust Division at the Department of He is eminently qualified, enjoys broad, bipartisan support, and is at the ready to start as soon as he receives our consent. I will urge my colleagues in the Senate, once again, to take up his nomination and confirm him to this important post. He has both Democrat and Republican support. He is well known. He ran the Judiciary Committee under my jurisdiction.  On the other side of the enforcement equation, we are still waiting on nominations to the Federal Trade The FTC is an important agency that will play a central role in the years ahead. Whoever is put in charge will face the monumental task of setting the agency on the right track. I have supreme confidence that the President will make the right choice on this one, and I look forward to supporting his nominees.  As these vacancies linger, however, uncertainty lingers as well. Critical merger and acquisition activity remains sidelined as innovation is chilled and expansions are put on hold. All of this comes at an unnecessary cost to our businesses and consumers.  I want this whole body to hear me clearly: There is no need for the same old partisan food fight over our antitrust officials. Let's get Makan Delrahim to work. FTC nominations will likely include two Republicans and a There is no reason they can't be swiftly confirmed as a package. If delay on these important confirmations persists, I will be back on the floor to make sure everyone--from consumers to industry--knows it.  As I mentioned earlier, antitrust has been increasingly drawn into the broader public debate on economic and innovation policy, and not for the better. With each passing day, it seems the consumer welfare standard finds itself besieged from the left. Their rhetoric may not yet have made its way into traditional precedent, but it certainly has made itself known.  Some in academia insist that recent market concentration and technological progress compel a return to bold, persistent experimentation. Many in the media call for antitrust to pursue everything from industrial democracy to campaign finance reform to material leveling. Above all else, we hear again the old, lazy mantras that big is bad, disruption is suspect, and public utility designation is welcome.  Professor and former FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright has referred to this particular set of proposals as ``hipster antitrust.'' Well, as you might imagine, nobody would mistake me for a hipster. So for my part, and for ease, I will go ahead and call it the progressive standard. Truth be told, as a proposed replacement for the consumer welfare standard, the progressive standard leaves me deeply impressed. From what I can tell, it amounts to little more than pseudoeconomic demagoguery and anti-corporate paranoia. Nevertheless, it must not be dismissed out of hand.  Over the last 8 years, policymakers laid the groundwork for it by routinely disregarding some of the most basic elements of the consumer welfare standard. Now we see the same stirrings of this radical approach in many speeches on the other side of the aisle, as well as in the recently released platform curiously titled ``A Better Deal.''  As such, I believe a response is in order. In defense of the consumer welfare standard, we could, of course, run through the more technical deficiencies of the progressive standard. We can mention that as doctrine, it lacks manageable standards, dispensing with intellectual rigor and inviting political mischief. We can mention that as theory, it accounts for neither tradeoffs nor scarcity. We can mention that as aspiration, it subordinates the productive incentives of the entrepreneur to the fanciful designs of the bureaucrat.  Truth be told, the real trouble for the progressive standard is, it fails to grasp the bigger picture of our history, economy, and national character. It fails to appreciate that our time is not so distinct from times past and that our momentary insights are not so superior to the lessons learned over generations prior.  Of course, anyone can see that changes are afoot. As chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, I have seen it firsthand. The new technological age, having dawned in the late 20th century, continues to ripen into the 21st.  New innovation is relentlessly spurring transformation across the economy, and many markets are concentrating as a result. Yet supporters of the progressive standard seem to think this presents historically unique problems. They rely, as academics are wont to do, on sleek, new jargon to argue that today's antitrust challenges are not only tangibly but conceptually distinct of those of the past. They argue, in other words, that things really are different this time around. At the end of the day, terms like ``platform economics'' and ``network effects''--commonly used to attack the consumer welfare standard--do less to define new economic concepts than to explain how old economic concepts are manifesting themselves in modern markets.  Through history, we have seen this time and time again. As the saying goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Markets concentrate and then disperse; dominant firms rise and then fall; with innovation comes creation in one sector and destruction in another. Anxiety over this evolution is very real, and the strident calls we hear to do something about it--whatever that may be--are on some level understandable, but this lurch toward the progressive standard is not.  Change, sometimes furious change, is a constant in our system. For all its rancor, for all its chaos and uncertainty, it is, alas, what propels us forward. We hope, not fear, that each age looks better than the last.  Now, in anticipation of an objection from my friends across the aisle, nobody is suggesting that no enforcement is necessary. Genuinely anti-competitive conduct must be stopped, and mergers prone to abet such conduct must be heavily scrutinized. That is all a part of keeping markets fair and free in the best tradition of American capitalism.  Again, as I mentioned earlier, we should aim to regulate markets such that in their basic core functioning they regulate themselves. Market discipline imposed by competition and driven by innovation should be our aim. To that end, nobody doubts that new developments in the market will require a fresh look at doctrine. Nobody questions that the consumer welfare standard will have to adapt. For example, categories of anti-competitive conduct may need to be tweaked, refastened or even expanded in light of technical advancement and market evolution. Merger review, never an exact science, will seize upon new econometric tools for measuring ancient[[Page S4804]]economic concepts like quality, preference, and efficiency. The rule of reason, I am sure, will continue to bedevil judges, practitioners, and law students alike, but that is just fine.  Antitrust, as I keep saying, is ultimately a common law exercise. I am here to argue merely that the consumer welfare standard, when handled prudently, is a far better steward of our economy than the progressive standard, which is deeply misguided and potentially quite destructive.  Take, for instance, the proposed Amazon-Whole Foods merger, which has generated so much interest lately. It would, of course, be inappropriate for me on the floor of the Senate to pass judgment. I would caution my colleagues the same. There is an established process for review, but the question should be asked: Upon what basis should antitrust authorities evaluate a proposed merger like this? What we need is the consumer welfare standard. It carefully examines the basic and critical question of whether such a deal helps consumers or whether it hurts consumers. It relies on a coherent doctrine to strike a balance. It is a balance between the merger's pro-competitive effects, such as integrative efficiencies and innovation, and the antitrust competitive potential, such as market domination by one firm or facilitated price coordination by the few that remain. What we absolutely do not need, on the other hand, is the progressive standard.  Under no doctrinal limitations to cabin discretion, antitrust officials would gladly follow vague institutions in shifting intuitions. With a broad mandate to pursue aims far grander than mere market efficiency, officials would be free to engage in ad hoc theorizing about whether corporate consolidation, writ large, can be squared with universal justice, common fairness, and community values, or of whatever else their creativity recommends. To take another example, across the Atlantic, our friends in the European Union have leveled a massive fine against Google for anti-competitive conduct. Again, it is not for me to say on the floor whether those fines are justified. I don't think they are, but it is not for me to say.  Once more, what we need is the framework provided by the consumer welfare standard. We must weigh the pro-competitive aspects of Google's conduct with its anti-competitive potential. The ultimate inquiry should be whether consumers are better off as a result of Google's actions. Under the progressive standard, however, instead of asking what lowers prices and increases quality--instead of considering actual proof of harm to consumers--we would be asking what best serves the social goals in vogue at the moment. The result would be an open invitation to market intervention that is more politically motivated than economically sound.  In conclusion, for all the past rhetoric, for all the claims that a new age requires a new doctrine, the ideas behind the progressive standard are not new. They are terribly old. They may be adorned with original terminology or aimed at novel markets, but it is the same old collectivist impulse it has always been. In that sense, these ideas are not unique to Every day we receive concerning reports from around the world that foreign governments are increasingly turning to antitrust for industrial policy. Whether domestically or abroad, the stakes are simply too high, the consequences too grievous for the consumer welfare standard to be swept away in an instant, merely because a new breed of central planners--falsely conceiving themselves different from their predecessors--imagine they know best.  In America, we have always opted for the invisible hand of the free market over the heavy hand of government intervention. Let's keep it that way.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

287,topic-id,974,"Mr.President, I wish to speak on the importance of maintaining a strong Food and Drug Today we approved the user fee reauthorizations for the We have done the important work of passing these essential user fee agreements out of the committee and have now debated and passed them on the Senate floor.  The HELP Committee is filled with strong personalities. These personalities reflect the passion and diversity of opinion of millions across our nation today. While we may disagree on certain policies, most of us can agree that funding the drug, device, and biologic centers of the FDA is essential.  Our future scientific endeavors require a strong FDA that communicates openly with the industry that it regulates, and this agreement sets up protocols to achieve that goal. A strong FDA also requires clear steps for product review, and only through such deliberative actions can we bring more competition and clarity to our drugs, devices, and biologic products.  I have championed multiple provisions in this bill, but there are two I would like to highlight today. First, there is the counterfeit and diverted drug language. This language makes importation neither harder nor easier. In fact, it doesn't change importation laws at all. Rather, it protects and strengthens the drug supply chain by[[Page S4820]]simply increasing penalties for criminals that choose to divert drugs into the United States or sell counterfeit drugs.  Current penalties for illegally diverting drugs in the United States change arbitrarily based on the location where the drugs are manufactured. Our bill addresses this disparity by enforcing the same penalties for diverting drugs made outside the United States as for those made inside the United To ensure public health and to enhance consumer confidence, it is critical that Congress eliminate these differing penalties for certain types of diversion and counterfeiting.  The second provision I wish to call attention to is a bipartisan proposal from Senators Bennet, Burr, and These fine Senators have joined together to address how clinical trials are designed early on in their development. By offering guidance on how to include the intended patient population, especially those with rare diseases, drug sponsors can craft trials that generate useful data for health professionals and patients to review.  This bill builds upon the success of other expanded access provisions that put the patient at the heart of the healthcare system. FDA does consummate work when reviewing products for market, but including a wider patient mix, when appropriate, will enable phase I, II, and III trials to be more complex. I strongly believe that accurately portraying the intended patient population in a clinical trial is key to ensuring that drugs are both safe and effective.  I support this bill, but I also feel compelled to speak for a moment on the OPEN While not included in the package being debated today, the provisions of the Orphan Product Extension Now Accelerating Cures and Treatments Act--a bill I introduced this Congress with Senator Menendez and last Congress with Senator Klobuchar--would promote new therapies for rare diseases.  New therapies are essential to help the nearly 30 million Americans suffering from a rare disease or condition. Because complex rare diseases with small patient populations have limited market potential, there are few economic incentives to develop new drugs targeting those diseases. While there are 7,000 rare diseases that impact millions of Americans, 95 percent of these diseases have no treatment. All too often, misconceptions about the dangers of exclusivities keep bipartisan measures from being introduced. We must remain focused, however, and remember that, each day we delay in getting treatments to the rare disease community, patients and their families suffer.  Drug companies possess considerable scientific knowledge on drugs that have already been approved for common diseases. Some of these drugs could be repurposed for the treatment of rare diseases. Repurposing drugs is faster, less expensive, and generally less risky than traditional drug development.  The OPEN ACT would encourage such repurposing by providing an additional 6 months of market exclusivity to drugs that are repurposed and approved by FDA for a rare disease or condition.  Finding legislative ways help medical innovators treat rare diseases has been among my top priorities for over 30 years, since I first championed the bipartisan, bicameral Orphan rug Act in 1983. The OPEN ACT is a natural next step in expanding that effort to close the gap for rare diseases for which we have yet to develop treatments. In addition to increasing the number of rare disease therapies, this legislation will boost innovation and provide safer options for rare disease patients using drugs off-label. My bill enjoys enormous support with the backing of over 225 rare disease organizations and patient advocacy groups, not to mention overwhelming support from academic medical and research centers.  Although this provision is not in the bill before us, I have had assurances from Chairman Alexander that he will continue working with me and the cosponsors of this bill to see it become law. I have spoken to Ranking Member Murray in the past about it, and I remain optimistic that my colleagues share my concern for the rare disease community and are willing to advance this legislation in the future. I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member for their dedication to children and families in need.  I wish to conclude by reminding my colleagues that many of the debates that have led to the bill before us today are the culmination of years of experience. When I led the effort to pass what became Hatch-Waxman, the true impact of that law dwarfed even our loftiest hopes. Hatch-Waxman was a resounding success because Senators and Congressmen worked together to improve our country's situation and reduce barriers to market entry. This bill is vital to continuing that goal, and I am pleased to see where the negotiations have landed.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-03-pt1-PgS4819-5.txt,1351,TRICKETT WENDLER RIGHT TO TRY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,3.0,August
599,topic-id,2687,"Mr.President, last week, I joined the Senate majority leader, the Speaker of the House, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Treasury Secretary, and the Director of the National Economic Council in issuing a joint statement on tax reform.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint statement be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Since the statement's release, critics and naysayers have said quite a bit, some even going so far as to declare their opposition to the statement. That is a little odd, given that the statement is not a bill or a tax plan; it is simply a statement of agreed upon principles for tax reform.  That is not to say it was insignificant. Quite the opposite, in fact. The joint statement is an important development in the overall tax reform effort for several reasons.  For example, over the past several months, the favored tax reform narrative among some in the pundit class has been that Republicans are deeply divided. According to this narrative, Republicans in the Senate, the House, and the administration all have such fundamentally different views on tax reform that it will be impossible for us all to get on the same page.  Some of that was, to use an outdated description, pure poppycock.  When the administration puts out a framework that calls for a 15 percent corporate tax rate while the House blueprint has a 20 percent rate target, that is not really a disagreement. Both sides want to lower the corporate rate significantly, and the general idea in both cases is to reduce the rate as much as is reasonably possible.  Admittedly, there were some key differences of opinion. At the outset of this Congress, with a newly elected Republican President, it was fair to say that the House, Senate, and White House were on different pages when it came to some aspects of tax reform.  However, with last week's release of the joint statement, the leaders in this effort--in both congressional chambers and in the executive branch--have declared that, as of now, we are singing off the same song sheet. There are, of course, details that will need to be worked out, but all parties are in agreement on the key principles and have enough confidence that the process can move forward in Congress without the fear that the House, Senate, or administration will take drastically different approaches in crafting a tax reform package.  That is very significant. I have been working on tax reform for more than 6 years now, and this is the first time that we have had anything approaching this level of unity across the various Chambers and branches of government.  Another significant marker in the joint statement is the agreement that the tax-writing committees will do the lion's share of the work in producing the actual tax reform legislation and that the leaders are committed to moving through regular order, by which I mean committee markup processes prior to floor consideration.  This is key because one of the criticisms I have heard about Republicans' tax reform efforts is that the bill is being drafted behind closed doors I have even been scolded, sometimes pointedly, over why I have not held a Finance Committee hearing on ``the bill,'' even though there is no complete bill in place at this time.  Outside groups, some overtly aligned with the Democrats, have already put forward budget scores for the House[[Page S4821]]blueprint and the President's tax framework, even though there are not enough specifics in place to score anything yet. Those scores, generated by whatever is in the imagination of the outside groups, and not based on any facts, tell tall tales. They say there will be tax cuts for the rich, big businesses and a parade of horrors. Democrats here in the Senate, as well, have spoken of the horrors of the Republican ``tax plan,'' even though there is not a detailed plan in place. Again, the horrors represent pure fiction.  It is simply not the case that a bill is being drafted behind closed doors. It was never going to be the case. I have stated several times in recent months that I intended to have a robust and transparent process for tax reform in the The joint statement confirms that both chambers of Congress will take that kind of approach.  The Finance Committee is already hard at work. We have been talking about specific reform proposals for months now, and every member on the majority side of the committee is ready to do the work. More broadly, the committee has been at work in a bipartisan way on tax reform for many years now.  We have a number of great members on the Finance Committee, all of whom--at least on the Republican side--are committed to working toward this effort. I will continue to gather their input with an eye toward crafting a tax reform bill and moving it through the committee this fall. Once again, the committee process is going to be robust; I intend to hold multiple hearings and full markup.  The joint statement also noted that Republican leaders hoped that our Democratic colleagues would be willing to participate in this effort.  That should be no surprise. I have been calling on my Democrat friends to work with us on tax reform for months, even years.  For months now, I have been come to the floor on multiple occasions to ask my Democratic friends to come to the table.  I held a bipartisan hearing on tax reform in the Finance Committee just a few weeks ago, where we heard from experts on both sides of the aisle.  Earlier this week, the committee had another bipartisan hearing, this one on affordable housing. Of course, most of the Federal affordable housing incentives are found in the Tax Code, meaning that issue will undoubtedly be part of the larger discussion.  These hearings are just the latest in very long line of bipartisan, tax-related hearings in the Finance  So there really shouldn't be any doubt that, when I sign onto a statement that includes a call for bipartisanship, the call is both serious and sincere.  In addition, there is quite a bit of bipartisan agreement over the policy principles noted in joint statement.  As I said here on the floor just a few weeks ago, a number of Democrats--including a number of our Senate colleagues and the two most recent Democratic Presidents--have expressed support for lowering the U.corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the industrialized world.  Prominent Democrats, including the distinguished minority leader, have publicly supported reforms to our international tax system in order to make American businesses more competitive and prevent erosion of our tax base.  Both of these concepts are prominently mentioned in our joint statement.  The statement also talks about tax relief for middle-class families and reduced burdens on small businesses. Democrats, last time I checked, were largely in favor of this as well.  So long story short, there is nothing in the statement, either in terms of process or policy, that should discourage a number of Democrats from getting on board with this effort.  Yet, earlier this week, every member of the Senate Democratic Caucus--except three--signed onto a letter they purported to be a call for compromise and bipartisanship. However, if you read the details of the letter, it was really a set of up-front demands peppered in between political attacks.  First and foremost, my colleagues demanded in their letter that Republicans not use budget reconciliation to move a tax reform bill.  That has been a precondition for Democratic involvement in this effort for months now, among other demands unrelated to tax reform, and, as I have said many times, it is preposterous. The demand that Republicans agree upfront to a particular process is really unprecedented and, not to put too fine a point on it, a little nonsensical.  If Democrats are willing to engage in good faith on tax reform, why would they first demand that we ensure their ability to block it from ever even coming to the floor before they would be willing to engage on the substance? The logic is a little dizzying, to say the least.  On top of that, if reconciliation remains on the table, why would that stop Democrats from agreeing on the substance?  Obviously, budget reconciliation gives the majority the tools it needs to move legislation--under specified rules and conditions--without the threat of a filibuster, but nothing in the rules requires reconciliation to be partisan. In fact, historically speaking, tax bills moved through reconciliation tend to get bipartisan support. For example, the so-called Bush Tax Cuts of 2001 and 2003 were passed through reconciliation; yet there were both Republicans and Democrats voting in favor of the package.  Recent history shows that working together on the substance of policy is not precluded by the existence of a reconciliation instruction.  In 2009, with a reconciliation instruction in place, Senate Republicans in the Finance Committee participated in the healthcare reform process, with hearings, roundtables, and bipartisan discussion groups, before we were shut out of the final ObamaCare bill. Republicans did not operate as though there was a prerequisite of no reconciliation before discussion could occur.  In 2013, with a $1 trillion tax-hike reconciliation instruction in place, Senate Republicans in the Finance Committee participated in discussions that produced 10 bipartisan tax option papers; we participated in what was called a blank slate approach to tax reform; and we participated in discussion draft conversations. Republicans did not operate as though there was a prerequisite of no reconciliation before discussion could occur.  Now, our friends on the other side are critical of us when we follow the path they, themselves, took. They are insisting that we do what they would not do when similarly situated. They are not participating on the same constructive basis we did when we were in their place. From their leader on down, they act as if the past does not exist or that we are ignorant of it. Before applying too clever a rhetorical lash to those on this side, my friends on the other side should heed the advice of Lord Byron: ``Keep thy smooth words and juggling homilies for those who know thee not.''  If Democrats will work with us to reach agreement on the substance of tax reform, the process by which it moves through the Senate shouldn't really be a concern. Any implication that the process will necessarily dictate the substance is misleading.  Ideally, the tax reform process would be bipartisan, particularly here in the That would be the best-case scenario for the effort.  In a perfect world, reconciliation would not be necessary.  For that to happen, the Democrats would have to be willing to engage in a reasonable manner. In my view, opening the discussion with a demand that Republicans unilaterally disarm and commit to not using the tools we have under the rules of the Senate--the very tools that have been used by both sides in the past--smacks of disingenuousness. If they are truly willing to engage constructively on these efforts--and I hope they are--we should begin by talking about the substance, not dealing with process demands.  I hope that what we are seeing is posturing. I hope that my Democratic colleagues will recognize the significance of the unity expressed in last week's joint statement and get on board for what will hopefully be a historic effort.  If they do not, Republicans should be willing to use the tools at our disposal to move tax reform without Democratic support. That would include reconciliation.  The majority leader has indicated that he is willing to go that way. I am willing to go that way as well.  However, to get us to the point, a number of things have to happen, not[[Page S4822]]the least of which is the passage of budget resolution. For now, I am focusing on the substantive policies and proposals, and I will keep working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee to deliver on the tasks we were charged in the joint statement.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            [July 27, 2017]                     Joint Statement on Tax Reform       Washington.--Today, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Senate      Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Treasury Secretary      Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn,      Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and      House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX)      issued the following joint statement on tax reform:       ``For the first time in many years, the American people      have elected a President and Congress that are fully      committed to ensuring that ordinary Americans keep more of      their hard-earned money and that our tax policies encourage      employers to invest, hire, and grow. And under the leadership      of President Trump, the White House and Treasury have met      with over 200 members of the House and Senate and hundreds of      grassroots and business groups to talk and listen to ideas      about tax reform.       ``We are all united in the belief that the single most      important action we can take to grow our economy and help the      middle class get ahead is to fix our broken tax code for      families, small business, and American job creators competing      at home and around the globe. Our shared commitment to fixing      America's broken tax code represents a once-in-a-generation      opportunity, and so for three months we have been meeting      regularly to develop a shared template for tax reform.       ``Over many years, the members of the House Ways and Means      Committee and the Senate Finance Committee have examined      various options for tax reform. During our meetings, the      Chairmen of those committees have brought to the table the      views and priorities of their committee members. Building on      this work, as well as on the efforts of the Administration      and input from other stakeholders, we are confident that a      shared vision for tax reform exists, and are prepared for the      two committees to take the lead and begin producing      legislation for the President to sign.       ``Above all, the mission of the committees is to protect      American jobs and make taxes simpler, fairer, and lower for      hard-working American families. We have always been in      agreement that tax relief for American families should be at      the heart of our plan. We also believe there should be a      lower tax rate for small businesses so they can compete with      larger ones, and lower rates for all American businesses so      they can compete with foreign ones. The goal is a plan that      reduces tax rates as much as possible, allows unprecedented      capital expensing, places a priority on permanence, and      creates a system that encourages American companies to bring      back jobs and profits trapped overseas. And we are now      confident that, without transitioning to a new domestic      consumption-based tax system, there is a viable approach for      ensuring a level playing field between American and foreign      companies and workers, while protecting American jobs and the      U.tax base. While we have debated the pro-growth benefits      of border adjustability, we appreciate that there are many      unknowns associated with it and have decided to set this      policy aside in order to advance tax reform.       ``Given our shared sense of purpose, the time has arrived      for the two tax-writing committees to develop and draft      legislation that will result in the first comprehensive tax      reform in a generation. It will be the responsibility of the      members of those committees to produce legislation that      achieves the goals shared broadly within Congress, the      Administration, and by citizens who have been burdened for      too long by an outdated tax system. Our expectation is for      this legislation to move through the committees this fall,      under regular order, followed by consideration on the House      and Senate floors. As the committees work toward this end,      our hope is that our friends on the other side of the aisle      will participate in this effort. The President fully supports      these principles and is committed to this approach. American      families are counting on us to deliver historic tax reform.      And we will.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-03-pt1-PgS4820.txt,1351,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,3.0,September

41,topic-id,682,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.3110, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Insurance Member Continuity I am proud to sponsor this legislation, which is a technical, but extremely important, correction to the Dodd-Frank  I am very grateful for the support of my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee for helping advance this bill. I especially want to thank Ranking Member Waters, the lead cosponsor. In fact, we were able to unanimously report this bill out of committee 60 votes to zero when it was marked up in  The bill amends the Dodd-Frank Act to allow the Financial Stability Oversight Council's independent member with insurance expertise to remain a voting member of the council beyond his or her term until a successor is appointed. The extended term would conclude at the earlier of either 18 months or until Senate confirmation of a successor.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, was created as part of the Dodd-Frank The general purpose of this regulatory body is to provide a forum for discussion of our financial markets and coordination of financial regulations when appropriate.  Under existing law, the 10 voting members of the FSOC include an independent member with insurance expertise who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the The independent member is the only member appointed by the President to specifically serve on the council and is the only voting member which is expected to have insurance expertise.  Dodd-Frank established a 6-year term for the independent member whose term expires on September 30, 2017. Absent the appointment and confirmation of a successor, the expiration of the independent member's term would leave the council without a voting member who has insurance expertise because Dodd-Frank did not make clear if the position can be filled by an acting official.  My legislation is about ensuring that the FSOC is able to benefit from the perspective of a voting member with insurance expertise without any unnecessary lapses, or to quote a letter that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners sent to the ranking member and me: ``It is important that the council have members that have a deep understanding of the unique aspects of the insurance industry and our State-based insurance regulatory system.''  I couldn't agree more. In the case of Illinois, we have a very robust insurance market because of the carefully crafted regulatory system we have developed. This allows great companies to thrive and protects the interests of their policyholders. This might not be the case if the FSOC lacks sufficient understanding of our insurance markets and regulatory system.  What was not intended by Dodd-Frank is for the position to be vacant while the President and Senate work to confirm a new appointee. Other voting positions on the FSOC have the benefit of somebody being able to serve in an acting capacity until someone new is confirmed. In fact, the Dodd-Frank Act clearly states that positions on the FSOC can be filled by someone in an acting capacity.[[Page H6638]]  My legislation would simply bring continuity with other FSOC voting members.  This is especially timely given that the term of the individual currently filling this position, Roy Woodall, ends on September 30 of this year. Since President Trump has not yet announced who should fill this role, and given that the Senate will not likely have sufficient time to react between now and the end of September, we must have this signed into law without delay.  I understand that the Senate Banking Committee will be marking up companion legislation later this week, and I am hopeful it can quickly advance through this Chamber and the Senate Chamber so that this technical issue can be resolved before the end of Mr.Woodall's term.  I again would like to thank Ranking Member Waters and all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working with me. I urge support of this noncontroversial legislation, and I am hopeful it can move swiftly to the President's desk.

533,topic-id,792,"Mr.President, in about 5 minutes, I am going to be asking for consent to pass the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Belina Right to Try Act of 2017.  I wish to take a few moments, though, to tell the story of how that right-to-try bill, which has been passed by 37 States, obtained that name. I believe it was probably March of 2014 that I met Trickett Wendler, a young mom with three children, who came to Washington, DC, with a group of other individuals advocating for those patients and their families with people suffering from ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease--an incurable and devastating disease.  A week before meeting Trickett, I met with the Goldwater Institute, which was talking about its right-to-try legislation. They were beginning to pass through State legislatures. Just mentioning the fact that I supported the right to try brought tears streaming down Trickett Wendler's face. Unfortunately, Trickett Wendler lost her battle to ALS on March 18, 2015. She has inspired something that I think is going to give so many thousands--maybe tens of thousands, maybe millions--of Americans hope when they face a similar type of disease, where there is no hope, where there are no further options, other than potentially an experimental drug that has been proven safe, according to the  In our press conference announcing the introduction of this bill, we had met Matthew Belina, a naval aviator and lieutenant commander--one of the finest among us--also stricken with We had little Jordan McLinn, a little boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and his mother Laura was speaking at that press conference. Remarkably, a man also stricken with ALS, Frank Mongiello, his wife Marilyn, and their children asked to speak. He made such an impression on our gathering, which encapsulated that press conference, particularly his speech in a video that I showed to my colleagues, which resulted in so many cosponsorships of this bill.  These are real people facing their mortality with no hope. This right-to-try piece of legislation will give those individuals and their families hope.  I want to truly thank my lead cosponsor from across the aisle, Senator Joe Donnelly, who is in the Chamber here today, and also Senator King and Senator Manchin, who decided not to play any politics whatsoever and also were willing to cosponsor a bill offered by somebody who was in a tough reelection fight. I want to thank my 43 Republican cosponsors, particularly Senator As leader, he was one of the first cosponsors who helped me to get those other 42 cosponsors. I want to particularly thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, who have worked so cooperatively with me and my staff to make this moment possible. I would like to thank Vice President Pence, who also met Frank Mongiello and became a real advocate for this, and President Trump, who after meeting these types of victims--these individuals--also supported this piece of legislation.  I wish to thank the Goldwater Institute and Darcy Olson for their tireless efforts at promoting the right to try and the 37 States and the 97.7 percent of the legislators who, when given a chance to vote to give people the right to try and the right to hope, voted yes.  I would also like to thank a very special person, Delpassand, who really demonstrated why this is such an important piece of legislation. Delpassand is an oncologist from Houston, He was engaged in an FDA trial on an aggressive form of endocrine cancer with 150 patients. It was working. The drug was working. He petitioned the FDA to allow another 78 patients to participate in the trial. The FDA said no, but Delpassand said yes, putting his career at risk.  It is that kind of courage that we want to reward today by passing this right-to-try bill.  In conclusion, I want to thank the thousands of patients and their families who have taken their wheelchairs and gone to their State capitals and have come here to Washington, DC, to advocate for their personal freedom, their personal liberty, for their right to try, for their right to hope, and for the right to hope of millions of other Americans faced with these incurable diseases.

As such, this bill would allow the current independent insurance member to remain a voting member of the FSOC for the earlier of either 18 months or the appointment of a successor.

I don't know Mr.Powelson as well, but having had an opportunity to advance his name before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for confirmation, too, I know that the expertise and the credentials he will bring to the Commission are greatly appreciated.  I think we recognize that there is much we are anxious to see happen throughout the country in a new administration where we are talking a lot about infrastructure--when we are talking about our energy assets and what we can do to help facilitate the build-out of an aging infrastructure and the add-on of new infrastructure. But in order to proceed with much of this, you have to have the FERC actually operating, working to review the permits, working through the rate-making cases. It is substantive work, it is challenging work, and it is work that has now been stacked up for months and months. So knowing that the FERC will be able to commence its operations again with a quorum is really good news today.  I think it is also important to note that the White House sent just this week two additional names--those of Mr.Glick and Mr.The Energy and Natural Resources Committee will be considering those in early September when we return so that, hopefully, we can get a full complement to this very important  Mr.Mr.President, Richard Glick and Kevin McIntyre have been nominated by the President for positions on the Federal Energy Regulatory I understand they will be heard and marked up in tandem in September and I have told the Democratic leader that they will move as a pair across the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-03-pt1-PgS4819-2.txt,1694,RACE FOR CHILDREN ACT,2017.0,3.0,August

The Congress finds that--[[Page S4893]]       (1) on March 15, 1919, The American Legion was founded in      Paris, France, by members of the American Expeditionary Force      occupying Europe after World War I and concerned about the      welfare of their comrades and communities upon their return      to the United States;       (2) on September 16, 1919, Congress chartered The American      Legion, which quickly grew to become the largest veterans      service organization in the United States;       (3) The American Legion conferences in Washington, DC, in      1923 and 1924 crafted the first United States Flag Code,      which was adopted in schools, States, cities and counties      prior to being enacted in 1942, establishing the proper use,      display, and respect for the colors of the United States;       (4) during World War II, The American Legion developed and      presented to Congress its case for vastly improved support      for medically discharged, disabled veterans, which ultimately      became the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (58      284; chapter 268), better known as the G.Bill of Rights,      and was drafted by former American Legion National Commander      Harry Colmery in Washington's Mayflower Hotel;       (5) through the leadership and advocacy of The American      Legion, the G.Bill was enacted in June 1944, which led to      monumental changes in United States society, including the      democratization of higher education, home ownership for      average people in the United States, better VA hospitals,      business and farm loans for veterans, and the ability to      appeal conditions of military discharge;       (6) defying those who argued the G.Bill would break the      Treasury, according to various researchers, the G.Bill      provided a tremendous return on investment of $7 to the      United States economy for every $1 spent on the program,      triggering a half-century of prosperity in the United States;       (7) after Hurricane Hugo in 1989, The American Legion      established the National Emergency Fund to provide immediate      cash relief for veterans who have been affected by natural      disasters;       (8) American Legion National Emergency Fund grants after      Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, for instance, exceeded      $1,700,000;       (9) The American Legion fought to see the Veterans      Administration elevated to Cabinet-level status as the      Department of Veterans Affairs, ensuring support for veterans      would be set at the highest level of the Federal Government,      as a priority issue for the President;       (10) after a decades-long struggle to improve the      adjudication process for veterans disputing claims decisions,      The American Legion helped shape and introduce the Veterans      Reassurance Act to create a venue for judicial review of      veterans' appeals;       (11) building on these efforts, legislation was passed in      1988 to create the United States Court of Veterans Appeals,      today known as the United States Court of Appeals for      Veterans Claims;       (12) The American Legion created the American Legacy      Scholarship Fund for children of military members killed on      active duty on or after September 11, 2001;       (13) in 2016, The American Legion's National Executive      Committee amended the original scholarship criteria to      include children of veterans with 50 percent or greater VA      disability ratings;       (14) President George Bush signed into law the Post-9/11      Veterans Educational Assistance Act (title V of the      Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008; 122 2357), a      next-generation G.Bill strongly supported by The American      Legion and the most comprehensive educational benefits      package since the original G.Bill of Rights was enacted in      1944;       (15) in August 2018, The American Legion will begin its      centennial recognition at the 100th National Convention in      Minneapolis, Minnesota, the site of the first American Legion      National Convention; and       (16) in March 2019, the organization will celebrate its      100th birthday in Paris, France, and September 16, 2019, will      mark the 100th anniversary of The American Legion's Federal      charter.     3.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Around the world, women remain under-represented in      conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and post-conflict      peace building efforts.       (2) Women in conflict-affected regions have achieved      significant success in--       (A) moderating violent extremism;       (B) countering terrorism;       (C) resolving disputes through nonviolent mediation and      negotiation; and       (D) stabilizing societies by enhancing the effectiveness of      security services, peacekeeping efforts, institutions, and      decisionmaking processes.[[Page S4890]]       (3) Research suggests that peace negotiations are more      likely to succeed and to result in durable peace agreements      when women participate in the peace process.     3.

STATEMENT OF       It shall be the policy of the United States to promote the      meaningful participation of women in all aspects of overseas      conflict prevention, management, and resolution, and post-     conflict relief and recovery efforts, reinforced through      diplomatic efforts and programs that--       (1) integrate the perspectives and interests of affected      women into conflict-prevention activities and strategies;       (2) encourage partner governments to adopt plans to improve      the meaningful participation of women in peace and security      processes and decision-making institutions;       (3) promote the physical safety, economic security, and      dignity of women and girls;       (4) support the equal access of women to aid distribution      mechanisms and services;       (5) collect and analyze gender data for the purpose of      developing and enhancing early warning systems of conflict      and violence;       (6) adjust policies and programs to improve outcomes in      gender equality and the empowerment of women; and       (7) monitor, analyze, and evaluate the efforts related to      each strategy submitted under section 5 and the impact of      such efforts.     5.

The strategy      shall--       (1) support and be aligned with plans developed by other      countries to improve the meaningful participation of women in      peace and security processes, conflict prevention, peace      building, transitional processes, and decisionmaking      institutions; and       (2) include specific and measurable goals, benchmarks,      performance metrics, timetables, and monitoring and      evaluation plans to ensure the accountability and      effectiveness of all policies and initiatives carried out      under the strategy.       (b) Specific Plans for Departments and Agencies.--Each      strategy under subsection (a) shall include a specific      implementation plan from each of the relevant Federal      departments and agencies that describes--       (1) the anticipated contributions of the department or      agency, including technical, financial, and in-kind      contributions, to implement the strategy; and       (2) the efforts of the department or agency to ensure that      the policies and initiatives carried out pursuant to the      strategy are designed to achieve maximum impact and long-term      sustainability.

537,topic-id,483,"Mr.President, I want to say I am really pleased we are moving forward on the FDA Reauthorization Act today. This is really a great example about how Congress can actually work together on health issues and compromise and solve challenges by putting patients and families first.  As my colleagues well know, these so-called user fee agreements are essential to supporting FDA's operation and mission. They allow FDA to meet the complex challenges of the 21st century technology and the movement toward precision medicine, and they help ensure that FDA upholds the gold standard of approval while evaluating new drugs and devices efficiently. Put simply, passing the FDA Reauthorization Act is absolutely necessary if Congress wants to advance safe, effective[[Page S4790]]and innovative medical products for patients and families across the country.  I would add, when we pass this reauthorization today, more than 5,000 employees at FDA will be able to continue their critical work without worry of interruption, employees that worked every day to protect the health and families and advance medical innovations to patients.  So I am really pleased to have worked alongside the chairman of our HELP Committee, the Senior Senator from Tennessee, and all of our colleagues on and off the committee to bring to the floor these finalized agreements.  They truly reflect years of negotiations between FDA and the industry, incorporate input from patient and consumer groups, and support some of our most urgent priorities: restructuring the generic drug user fees, building up the Biosimilars Program, making sure patients' perspectives are considered in drug and device development, and advancing many of the policies we passed as part of the 21st Century Cures  In addition to those agreements, the FDA Reauthorization Act includes priorities and provisions from Members across the political spectrum, so I again want to thank Chairman Alexander and all my colleagues, in particular, Senators Casey, Franken, and Warren, on their work to improve medical device safety; Senators Hassan and Young on their provision to get better information to providers about opioids; Senators McCaskill, Franken, and Collins for their commitment to improving the generic drug market; and Senators Bennet, Van Hollen, and Rubio for their drive to get new medicine for kids with cancer.  I really want to thank my staff and Chairman Alexander's staff who worked so well together over months of hard work to get this done.  Mr.President, this bill advances several significant bipartisan priorities I am proud to support. As many know, the HELP Committee has a strong tradition of bipartisan success in these user fee agreements, and I am very proud to say we have kept it this way.

133,topic-id,613,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I stand today in support of H.1843, the Restraining Excessive Seizure of Property through the Exploitation of Civil Asset Forfeiture Tools Act--more simply, the RESPECT  Fundamentally, this legislation is about stopping abusive civil asset seizure practices. Too often, honest small business owners were treated like criminals and had their bank accounts seized by the Federal Government for making frequent deposits from cash sales.  The law at issue today is the Bank Secrecy Act, which set up new reporting requirements for certain activities, like depositing more than $10,000 in cash. The purpose of the law is to limit criminal business activity conducted in cash, money laundering, drug transactions, and criminal enterprises. Thus, systematically depositing amounts just short of this threshold, is deemed an illegal attempt to structure bank transactions to avoid the reporting requirement.  Over the past 2 years, a number of law-abiding small businesses with high volumes of cash sales testified before the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight describing just how this law was being applied by the IRS and the Department of Justice to seize their bank accounts. Congressmen on both sides of the aisle immediately denounced this practice and sought to have the seized amounts returned.  In October of 2014, the IRS changed its policy on enforcement. Now it only will seize funds of taxpayers where the money is being deposited from an illegal source. H.1843 codifies this policy change, excludes interest received by taxpayers on the return of seized property from tax, and provides notice and hearing rights to taxpayers.  The IRS, however, is only one side of the issue. United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions also must act to right this wrong against these small business owners. The IRS referred 255 petitions to the Department of Justice from small business owners seeking the return of their property. As of June 2017, the Department still had over 180 petitions to review. The Department of Justice should and must work faster.  I thank Congressman Roskam, my friend; and the Democrat lead cosponsor, my friend as well, Congressman Joe Crowley, for their hard work on this legislation; and also the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, John Lewis, for his leadership on this issue.  In closing, I want to take a look at how the position taken by the IRS and the Department of Justice affected a small bakery in For almost 100 years--three generations--the Vocatura family has operated a bakery in Norwich, They sell sandwiches and fresh bread, lots of low-dollar purchases. Until recently, they didn't accept credit cards; so most of their business was in cash.  According to press reports, between March 2007 and April 2013, the Vocatura brothers made hundreds of deposits in amounts ranging from $7,000 to $9,900. The bank tellers told them that they had to fill out lots of extra paperwork for deposits over $10,000, so the Vocatura brothers made sure to deposit their receipts more often. They didn't realize they were breaking the law by consciously avoiding making deposits over $10,000.  In May of 2013, the IRS enforced the structuring laws and seized the bakery's checking account with more than $68,000 on hand. The IRS held on to the Vocatura's money for 3 years without ever bringing a case before a judge. The brothers filed a motion, demanding the return of their money; and in 2016, the IRS capitulated.

Commissioner Koskinen said a number of times in testimony before the Ways and Means Committee that he doesn't write the law. That is the question that is in front of us at this moment. He says that the IRS follows the law, which we expect agencies to do at the behest of those who are duly elected.  So in this instance, I would suggest that while we don't like what the IRS has done in these particular examples that have been correctly cited by both sides, we also have the obligation to alter, change, or amend the law so that this doesn't happen to the innocent going forward.                              {time}  1715  So this was not simply about the Commissioner or IRS agents waking up one day and saying: What kind of havoc and peril can we create today?

On this special occasion, I want to commend the men and women of the Coast Guard for their valiant service on, under, and over our Nation's high seas and waters.  They have a proud history.  Most Americans know the Coast Guard for its orange and white helicopters, fast small boats, cutters, and rescue swimmers, but they probably don't know that the Coast Guard is one of our country's oldest institutions of the U. On August 4, 1790, President George Washington signed the Tariff Act, authorizing construction of the first 10 cutters of what would eventually become the Coast They were known as the revenue cutters, and their original mission was to enforce tariffs and trade laws and to prevent smuggling. For more than a hundred years, the cutters and their crew operated under the names Revenue Marine Service and the Revenue Cutter Not until 1915, when Congress merged the Revenue Cutter Service and the U.Life-Saving Service, did the Coast Guard gets its name.  Over time, the Coast Guard has become synonymous with saving those in peril on the sea. Their wide red bar and narrow blue bar, canted at 64 degrees, will always be a sign of assistance to mariners in danger.  Today, in times of peace, the Coast Guard operates as a part of the Department of Homeland Security, performing its 11 critical, statutory missions.  Right now, there are courageous young men and women aboard buoy tenders and icebreakers, ensuring our waterways remain open for commerce. Fast response cutters patrol the seas, enforcing the law and conducting search-and-rescue missions. Small boat stations enforce our laws while educating the public on safe-boating practices. As a ready and capable partner to a multitude of Federal, State, and local agencies, the Coast Guard does so much more, from responding to oil spills to combating drug trafficking.  In times of war or at the direction of the President, the Coast Guard valiantly serves as part of the Navy  As you can see, the Coast Guard is a small but mighty organization. As ranking member of the Commerce Committee, I have had the privilege to meet many of the men and women of our Coast Guard and see their valuable work firsthand.  Through all the passing decades, some things about the Coast Guard have always been the same: the service's proud tradition and the skill and professionalism of its men and women whose sacrifices contribute to protecting our national security. The Coast Guard's core values of honor, respect, and devotion to duty are evident in everything it does. As the Coast Guard motto says, Semper Paratus, it is always ready for the call.  I want to congratulate and express our sincere gratitude to the men and women of the Coast Guard on 227 outstanding years of exemplary service to our                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-03-pt1-PgS4823-2.txt,859,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,3.0,September

604,topic-id,509,"Mr.President, today, the Senate passed the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017, FDARA, to reauthorize user fees and other programs at the FDA to ensure that new, safe, and effective treatments get to patients in need as quickly as possible to save lives and greatly increase quality of life. While I have long preferred that Congress appropriate funding to the FDA for this purpose to avoid any conflicts of interest, I have supported user fee bills and will do so again today, as it represents a bipartisan pathway for timely drug approvals. I am pleased that this legislation increases the amount of funding that drug and device companies will contribute to the approval process. However, I am disappointed that this legislation does not address drug pricing in a comprehensive way, as I have long advocated. I will continue to work with my colleagues to press for Senate action on this critical issue.  FDARA includes a number of key provisions I worked on to improve the pipeline for new pediatric drugs and devices. In particular, this legislation will reauthorize funding for critical pediatric programs such as pediatric clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health and the Pediatric Device Consortia grants under the In addition, this legislation will spur more pediatric drug development because of critical reforms to require drug companies to begin consideration of pediatric studies earlier in the drug development process. FDARA also takes important steps to spur drug development for and better consideration of the needs of neonates, recognizing that treatments for infants must be considered differently than for teenagers.  Having worked for many years to improve access to care for children with cancer and childhood cancer survivors, I am also pleased to support the bill's new requirements for more pediatric studies on treatments for cancer. These provisions are designed to spur new and better treatments for children suffering from cancer. However, I believe that we should be making these changes to support new treatments for all diseases impacting children, not just those with cancer. While we were unable to go that far in this bill, we were able to add a study of this issue. I look forward to seeing the results and working with my colleagues to expand these requirements in subsequent legislation. I am also concerned that this legislation does nothing to limit the ability of drug companies to benefit from exemptions from current pediatric study requirements. I filed an amendment to FDARA to close the most egregious of these loopholes in which a drug company can technically be exempted from pediatric study requirements because the treatment would only be used for a rare pediatric condition. I would hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle could agree that this loophole must be closed.  FDARA is an important step forward and an example of strong bipartisan health legislation in this I hope that we can continue this work, and not return to the partisan efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act that occupied this body for much of the year.

During his time in Washington, Senator Dole was known for his ability to work across the aisle and embrace practical bipartisanship on the issues, such as tax reform, Social Security, and many other pressing issues. I would call this the Kansas approach to legislating. He has been a lifelong advocate for the disabled and was a key figure in the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act back in 1990.  After his appointment as majority leader, Bob Dole set the record as the Nation's longest serving Republican leader in the Senate of the United Several Presidents of the United States have especially honored Bob for his hard work and leadership in the public sector. For example, President Reagan awarded Bob Dole the Presidential Citizens Medal in 1989.  President Reagan stated:       Whether on the battlefield or Capitol Hill, Senator Dole      has served America heroically. Serving as Senate Majority      Leader during one of the most productive Congresses of recent      time, he has also been a friend to veterans, farmers, and      Americans from every walk of life. Bob Dole has stood for      integrity, straight talk and achievement throughout his years      of distinguished public service.  So said our former President, Ronald  As I said, they are Kansas values.  Likewise, in 1997, President Clinton awarded Senator Dole with the Presidential Medal of Freedom saying:       Son of the soil, citizen, soldier and legislator, Bob Dole      understands the American people, their struggles, their      triumphs and their dreams. . . . In times of conflict and      crisis, he has worked to keep America united and strong. . .      . Our country is better for his courage, his determination,      and his willingness to go the long course to lead  So said our former President, Bill  Senator Dole remains active today, serving as the national chairman of the World War II Memorial Campaign, a memorial that simply would not be in existence today had it not been for his perseverance, leadership, and cochair of the Families of Freedom Scholarship  In 2007 President George Bush appointed Bob to cochair the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors, which inspected and reformed the system of medical care received by U.soldiers returning from Iraq and  He remains the strongest advocate for veterans, having volunteered on a weekly basis for more than a decade on behalf of the national Honor Flight  As a person who has gone to the World War II Memorial, along with Bob Dole, I know I greet the veterans at the bus. They immediately get off the bus. Whether they are from Kansas or any other State, they are very proud to come to see their memorial. The first question they ask is this: Where is Bob? Is Bob here? Then, they flock to him like a mother hen. Maybe, that is not the best example, but it certainly shows the pride and the desire of our veterans to meet the man who did so much for their memorial.  I am also proud that he serves today as the finance chairman of the campaign for the national Dwight Eisenhower Memorial, leading the private fundraising effort to memorialize President Dwight David Eisenhower, our favorite son in Kansas, here in Washington, something near and dear to both of us. I am privileged to be the chairman of the Eisenhower Memorial  It is abundantly clear that throughout his long service to our country, Bob Dole has embodied the American spirit of leadership and determination, and he serves as one of the most prolific role models both in and outside of politics.  I am reminded of the time when I was stationed at Quantico as a young marine and my dad, Wes Roberts, who was[[Page S4806]]a friend and adviser to Bob, said: I want to take you up to the Hill to meet Congressman Bob I consider him to have the highest potential to be whatever he wants with regard to public service.  So I went up to the Hill, and I met this handsome young man. He didn't sit on his hands very long in terms of what he wanted to accomplish. I first met him then, and, then, as a staffer for my predecessor, the Honorable Keith Sebelius, a congressman from ``The Big First'' and, then, as a Member of the House for 16 years.  I tell the story that most people in the House thought that whatever I proposed or whatever I was for, Bob Dole was for me. Well, about 50 percent of that was true, but I never told them about the other 50 percent. So I was really able to get a lot done.  Bob, thank you for that.  I am so proud--so proud--to call him friend. I am proud to serve his I am equally proud today that each Senator--each and every Senator and colleagues on both sides of the aisle--have joined me in honoring Senator Bob Dole with a Congressional Gold Medal--all 100.

94,topic-id,6135,"Mr.Speaker, before I get into a rather elongated discussion about one fundamental issue that we are having to decide in the next few days, I would like to just mention that we have just heard severe criticism of our  Let me just note about President Trump and his rhetoric supposedly making things worse in The rhetoric of our President has not made the situation worse in  What made the situation in Korea a major threat to our country and to our people and to the world was that, during the Clinton administration, President Clinton pushed through this Congress a package of aid for North Yes, we gave billions of dollars of aid in the form of energy and other types of issues and things that they needed. We gave them billions of dollars of aid under the agreement that North Korea would not be developing their nuclear weapons.  At that time, Chris Cox, a Member of the House of Representatives at the time, and myself fought aggressively against that deal. The North Koreans ended up being the recipient of billions of dollars of aid, even though they were the most antidemocratic institution, the greatest threat, and the greatest tyrants in that part of the world.  Yes, they knew that they didn't have to worry about the United States of That is when they, again, slowly but surely, after receiving billions of dollars from us, pushed through by President Clinton, that is how they have gotten to this point now where they are exploding weapons and launching rockets.  They are blaming that on our President, who just recently became President, and they are blaming it on his rhetoric rather than his policy? It is ridiculous.  The other thing we have heard about our President again is how heartless he is because he is not permitting young people who have been designated as DREAMers to stay here in the United States, even though they are in this country illegally, and they were brought here illegally.  Now, what is the impact? What will be the impact to those young people, who are probably wonderful young people? Most of them, I am sure, are wonderful young people. But the bottom line is, our interests and our moral obligation must be to the well-being of American young people. That includes American young people who are of every race and every religion and every ethnic group.  Approving the people who have come here illegally will hurt American young people, especially American-Hispanic young people. The DREAMers will be competing with their jobs and, yes, bidding down the wages of our own young people and our other people who are trying to struggle right now to get by. No, what the President has done is watch out for the right young people:  Yes, we have had millions of people--in fact, for the last few years, over a million people--legally immigrate into our country. We have nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to apologize for. We are the most generous when it comes to legal immigration into our society of any country in the world. In fact, at times recently, the amount of legal immigration we have been allowing into our country represents more than all the other countries of the world in what they have permitted to legally immigrate into their society.  We all feel for young people throughout the world who deserve a better life. But if we permit people to come here as young people illegally, and then legalize their status, every parent in the world will see that decision. Every parent in the world will say: Oh, my gosh, that young person who comes from Guatemala, or wherever it is, made it to He went in illegally, and now he is going to a junior college. He has had some health problems. The American taxpayers have paid for it. Why can't I bring my children there?  Well, it will dawn on them that millions of people--hundreds of millions, perhaps--that if they are going to come to the United States illegally, you better bring the kids, because Americans think more of those kids than they do their own kids.  I applaud the President for what he has done to slow down this betrayal of American young people by allowing young people to come in here illegally and thus expect that they are going to get legal status by wearing us down and appealing to our emotions.  One thing we have to note, in closing on this issue, those young people, if they are legalized, that is not the end of the game. At that point, when they are legalized, they have a right to make applications so that their parents can have their status legalized. They can bring in family that they left back in their home countries. Now they can apply to have them come in under family reunification.  This isn't just about a group of young people who came in. Even to legalize their status would be wrong. Otherwise, millions of other people will come here. Remember the trainloads of young people who were put on trains headed to the United States? Yes, we can expect more of that. Why not? If you love your children and you live anywhere else than the United States and you are living a poor life, of course you want to bring your kids here.  We should not be encouraging that, and we should not be attacking the President of the United States for standing up for our own young people, rather than trying to bring a massive flood of illegal immigrant children into our society and pay for their education and their healthcare, et cetera.  With that said, the issue that I am hoping to discuss in detail tonight is something on a totally different level, in terms of issue. This is an issue, whether you are Republican or Democrat, you go across the board; whether[[Page H6649]]liberal or conservative, there should be a close look at what is happening right now in the House of  A decision will soon be made by the House Rules Committee--they are meeting tonight and tomorrow--that will have a dramatic and direct impact on the lives of millions of Although the issue will have such severe consequences on so many people, Members of Congress may or may not have had the opportunity and may not have the opportunity in the future to vote on the provision that is being discussed tonight.  What I am talking about at issue is an amendment submitted to the Rules For those who don't know, the Rules Committee is a committee here in Congress that decides what will come to the floor for a vote--what bills--and what will be included; what amendments will be permitted, what amendments won't, and if there will be any.  That is their job. They do a good job of it, but it is important that they do a job that reflects the American people and the interests of the American people.  So what we have is an amendment that has been submitted to the Rules Committee for consideration with this week's appropriations bill. What I am talking about is an amendment which prohibits any of the money or resources in the appropriations bill for the Department of Justice; it prevents that money or the resources that come from the Department of Justice, purchased by that revenue; it says that the Department of Justice can't use that money that is being given to them in the appropriations bill to supersede a State law when that State has legalized the medical use of marijuana.  Now, that is my amendment. That amendment has been around. As many of my colleagues know, this amendment has a long history. The House has considered this issue numerous times since former Representative Maurice Hinchey of New York introduced the first amendment of this nature in 2001. I joined him and supported that provision.  Eventually, I became the lead sponsor of the amendment when Mr.Hinchey left. That year, in 2012, my amendment failed in the House by a vote of 162-262.  So, in 2012, my amendment, which would have legalized medical marijuana--basically, saying that you can't have the Federal Government supersede States when they have legalized medical marijuana--lost by 162-262.  Two years later, I teamed up with Representative Sam Farr, who is also now retired, and saw the amendment pass--the very same amendment we were able to reach out to our colleagues and say that we do not want any of the money that is being allocated for the Department of Justice to be used to supercede States' rights. That cannot supersede a State that has legalized the medical use of marijuana.  The passage of the amendment in 2004 led to the inclusion of this provision in last year's omnibus appropriations bill, which was signed into law December 2014. The following year, the amendment passed by an even larger margin. Let me note that the last time it came here for a vote on the floor, it passed by 242-186.  What we are talking about is that the people of the United States, over these years, over and over again, have expressed themselves to the Federal Government by passing laws in their own States to legalize the medical use of marijuana.                              {time}  1945  And now we have a move to try to prevent those reforms that we put into place for the last 6 years that insisted that the Federal Government respect the State laws that have been changed so that the State laws that have given their own people permission to use medical marijuana for medical purposes, now what we see is an effort to try to prevent that from happening.  In other words, the status quo for 4 years has been the Federal Government will not interfere because the Department of Justice is not permitted to use its resources to supersede a State that has legalized the medical use of marijuana. And the States, in these 4 years, over and over and over again, have reaffirmed and have sometimes put in place brand-new law that permits their people to use medical marijuana.  Changing the status quo here by not adding that amendment that has been in the bill for the last 4 years, we are changing the status quo in a way that undermines the rights of the States and the people therein to make their policy, a right that we had acknowledged for the last 4 years.  Since it was first enacted into law, the provision has been updated and extended through a series of continuing resolutions. That is the bill that says we will respect State marijuana laws and omnibus appropriations bills, the last of which was signed into law by President Trump on April 5.  So, on April 5, we signed the omnibus bill. In that bill was the amendment that said the Justice Department will not use its resources to supersede State law. And since the first vote in 2014, the Senate Appropriations Committee has taken up the issue and has adopted this amendment on a bipartisan basis every year for the last few years.  As a result of this provision, the Federal Government has been prohibited from arresting or attacking those providing cannabis for medical purposes in the States that have passed such laws through their State legislature or through a direct vote of their own people.  So, to date, what are we talking about? We are talking about 46 States that have legalized some form of cannabis for medical purposes.  Yet we see, today, this Republican Congress is seriously considering what? Superseding those States, 46 States that have actually said: We will determine what is good for our people, and our people have voted overwhelmingly to permit medical marijuana to be used by the people of this  We are considering changing the status quo tonight by not permitting the amendment that always gave the rights to the States to make that decision.  With this movement by the States, we have witnessed the emergence of a new and a major industry in Billions of dollars now are being invested in the exploding cannabis industry, an industry where now marijuana is being grown to provide clinics, which then they work on the cannabis itself. They put it into and they catalog it in terms of strength and in terms of dosage, and they work with doctors to make sure that this can be used for helping people with their maladies.  Those involved, all who are doing this, the ones who are providing the cannabis, the guys who are processing it, the people who are selling it, the people who want to make sure that everything is designated right, the strength and the character of what is being sold, and, of course, a bookkeeping system that makes sure everybody knows, total, who is doing what, all those involved in this new industry, billions of dollars' worth of industry, are respectable businessmen and -women.  Yes, they are seeking profit, but these are men and women who are eager to be, yes, seeking profit and to be responsible and transparent; and just like any other member of the business community, they want to do a business efficiently, and they want to be held accountable for what they are doing.  Money should be accounted for, yes. Ingredients of products must be verified and labeled. Standard business practices ought to be applied, and, of course, taxes and regulations are part of that equation.  Well, throughout the country, this industry is taking the public away from gangsters, away from criminal drug dealers. Now, who is being helped? But first let me note on that.  If we eliminate this right of the States to basically legalize the medical use of marijuana and put it in the hands of those people whom I have just described, honest businessmen who are going to be held accountable and held with transparent types of operations, no, they will be replaced by whom? They will be replaced by drug dealers. They will be replaced by the Mexican drug cartel. That is who is being helped if we eliminate this provision that has been part of the appropriations bill for the Department of Justice for the last 3 years.  So why are we thinking about helping, not only just superseding what the people locally have voted for--why aren't we thinking about that?--but worse than that, why are we thinking[[Page H6650]]about transferring those billions of dollars now in this industry directly into the pockets of the drug cartels? That is what the vote is.  The vote is not, oh, we are going to stop anybody from using marijuana because marijuana is bad. That is not the vote. That is not the result of the vote. The result of the vote will be billions of dollars immediately transferred into the pockets of the drug cartel. That is what will happen.  So I implore my colleagues to look closely with this vote. I hope that the Rules Committee will see the error of its ways and permit a vote on the floor on this issue. If not, I will be calling on my colleagues to join me in opposing the rule that is coming to the floor that prohibits us from voting on this issue.  If we vote on the issue, let's all vote on the issue and let the voters hold us accountable for our vote, but don't just let nobody have a vote on it and hide behind anonymity. No, let's let the people know what side we are on.  Do we want to have drug cartels being handed billions of dollars? That is what this is about.  Oh, yes, we are going to say, well, fewer people will use marijuana. No, I do not believe that for an instant. And especially people who are using it for medical purposes, there won't be fewer of them. Those people still need medical marijuana, and they have arthritis and all kinds--the Vietnam--actually, not Vietnam vets, but the vets coming back from the The veterans are coming back, and they know that this can help them.  We are now turning off the supply of medical marijuana to people who can be helped, and then what are we doing? We are giving the money that is being made by honest businessmen now in a transparent way, trying to run something where taxes are paid and everybody is held accountable, anything they sell is labeled--no, no. All of that is out the window because someone thinks marijuana, itself, is evil.  Children, especially those who are afflicted by seizures, have been treated through the use of CBD oils. That is a derivative of cannabis, and it appears to be effective.  Senior citizens are both physically and psychologically assisted in dealing with some of the challenges that often come with old age. Alzheimer's, arthritis, chronic pain, these are things that our seniors, when they are sitting in old folks homes or wherever, they suffer, and we say: No, you can't try marijuana; no, we are not going to let you legally be able to obtain that as something that might help you with your suffering. How ridiculous is that?  All Americans who suffer from diseases ranging from Crohn's disease to cancer, the potential to receive medical benefit from cannabis is clear.  And the wounded American soldiers coming home from the Middle East, they have come to our offices. They have been in my office, and I am sure they have been in other people's offices to explain the positive effects of cannabis in dealing with  In fact, the American Legion, an organization chartered in the aftermath of World War I to represent veterans, adopted a resolution last month urging the Federal Government to allow VA physicians to discuss and to recommend the use of medical marijuana in accordance with State laws.  My goodness, I will just have to say that for us to turn our back on these seniors, to say that these people who have young children who had seizures and they couldn't stop them and to turn our back on those people, to turn our back on our veterans, that is what this vote is all about.  This isn't about, oh, well, somebody can just go smoke marijuana.  And, by the way, if an adult is smoking marijuana in their backyard, yes, I don't think that we should waste police resources and billions of dollars of law enforcement money to try to stop an adult from using marijuana in his backyard.  But that is not the issue. The issue is whether States that have legalized the medical use of it should be superseded by us here, by the vote that we are going to have here in the next few days.  Let me tell you something about how I didn't know how the public would respond to the fact that I am one of the leaders in this whole effort to legalize the medical use of cannabis.  You know, I was Ronald Reagan's speechwriter, and I have been a Republican all my life. I get the top score on conservative groups that, you know, are giving you a score of how you voted and everything. I have received very high marks in all of those groups, and I have been a conservative voter. I have a conservative, libertarian background. I was Ronald Reagan's speechwriter for 7\1/2\ years in the White  I got elected in 1988, the last year of Reagan's term in the White House, and I sort of slipped into this issue because it is a principled issue to me. The principle is freedom, liberty, justice, and if you are not hurting somebody else; but especially we should let people who are suffering, at the very least give them some leeway when it comes to medical uses.  Well, I knew that I was getting a lot of publicity on this, and a fellow came into my office to talk to me about a totally different issue, about an aerospace issue. I am one of the senior members of the Science Committee, and I said--now, this guy represents, to me, my typical voter, my conservative voter in Canton,  The conservative voter was a guy who has been a commander or a captain in the U.Navy, a pilot. He was now in aerospace, and I am sure he always voted And so I asked him, I said: Look, what do you think about the fact that the guy you have been voting for all this time is now the leader in the fight to legalize medical marijuana for the people of this State and this country?  He looked at me, and he said: Dana, you really don't know me very well.  I said: Well, I know you are a former pilot in the Navy and you are now in aerospace and you are a conservative vote.  And he says: Yeah, but you don't know that I have three sons--three sons--and the day after 9/11, they all marched off and joined the military. And then what you don't know also is, a few years later, two of them came back, but the third one who came back wasn't my son anymore. The third one that came back was on the floor in seizures because he had been in some kind of an explosion that had rattled his brain, and he was on the floor over these seizures and they wouldn't stop. How would you feel about your child on the floor having seizures that you cannot stop?  And now when I tell these people: We don't care about that; you are not going to get to try medical marijuana--well, this guy said he tried everything. He took him to the VA, and it didn't help. After about a year, this guy said one of the guys at the VA hospital pulled him aside and said: Hey, you want to help your son? See me off campus.  They saw him in his office off the VA hospital, and the guy said: Look, your son needs marijuana. Here is the prescription. Here is how to use it. Go do it.  And do you know what the guy said to me there in my office? He said: My son hasn't had a seizure since that day. You wonder what I want to do about you being the point man on legalizing medical marijuana? I want to go over and give you a big hug.  That is what he said.                              {time}  2000  Now, I hope that my colleagues take this seriously because there are children on the floor having these seizures. There are veterans waiting there in seizures. There are old folks who are having arthritis and they can't move their hands, or they have lost their appetites in these senior citizen homes.  There is nothing wrong with us using cannabis to help alleviate their pain. We have been doing that for 3 years, and now the Rules Committee may not even permit us to have a vote on it, and they will take it out of this bill. We will be taking this away, without even having our people have to vote on it or not.  Well, I say if you disagree with me, that is fine. If you don't think the drug cartels will be enriched, fine. Come up and make your arguments.  When I lost this vote on a number of occasions, before we won 3 or 4 years ago, I lived with it. I said: Fine; I lost the vote. I respect those people's opinion, and they beat me.  Well, I expect that is what a democracy is supposed to be all about. That is what it is supposed to be all about.[[Page H6651]]Let people be held accountable for this. Don't take it out of the bill. If they take it out of the judiciary appropriations bill, I am asking my colleagues to stand up and vote against a rule that is shielding us from accountability, shielding us from having to have, basically, responsibility for handing billions of dollars over to the drug cartels.  Now the argument, of course, is: Oh, there is an opiate--you know, some kind of, what do they call it, an epidemic. An epidemic that is crossing America is opiates. Well, yes, there is.  When young people, or old people, are given opiates by their doctors, that is what happens: they get addicted to the opiates. If their doctors have no alternative, like cannabis, to provide their patients with something that might help them with their challenge, well, then you are going to get opiates, and that is what has happened. Our doctors have been passing out opiates as if they are candy.  It is the legalization of medical marijuana that makes it more likely that we will defeat the opiate epidemic and get our people back to a point where they can actually control their own lives. No one has ever died from an overdose of marijuana.  Now, I can tell you this. I understand that people really want to help young people, and others, not to get addicted to drugs. And I will say, no one has ever overdosed on cannabis. Yes, there are some serious concerns of why you don't want young people, in particular, using cannabis.  But to make it illegal, to put people in jail for using this, for basically leaving the distribution of marijuana in the hands of criminals, is far worse in what happens than any of the things that happen if young people--or, well, if anybody--start smoking a joint.  And let me just say, I think young people, we need to talk to them seriously. When we tell them we don't even think marijuana should be used for medical purposes, they tune out. But if we say, we know there are some legitimate uses for this, but when you are 20 years old, it is going to hurt your mind development, do not use marijuana until at least you are over 20 years old, and we are only making it legal now in this bill, or if you have some medical problems.  Well, the fact is that young people can understand that. That is one of the reasons why we have got to have research into cannabis, other than just leaving these opiates as the easy answer for doctors. In fact, one of the greatest sins, I believe, committed against the American people in the last 100 years has been really a lack of research into cannabis as a potential healthcare device or, shall I say, entity so that, instead of doing research into cannabis for the last 100 years, research has been suppressed.  There could be some really wonderful things, and we are learning about them now. A few years ago, for example, Israel had to lead the way on this and introduce a major research effort into cannabis, and their results have been spectacular.  Why does that happen in Israel and not here? Don't we care about whether those things that they discovered there that affects their people will help our people as well? No, no. We couldn't do that because we have people who are still living in the 1960s when to them cannabis--marijuana--means everybody growing their hair long, smoking dope in the park, and fornicating in the park, and failing in life, becoming hippies, and all of that.  The bottom line is that image is destroying the well-being of millions of Americans today. We have got to get over that image because that is not what medical cannabis is all about.  And as I say, young people under 20 years of age, I have no problem outlawing it for them and having some kind of severe penalty for people selling that to them. We need to protect them because it does impact negatively on kids who are under 20 years of age, or in that age group.  But let me also note: those kids shouldn't be drinking as well. The same studies that show that marijuana will really hurt the development of their brains and affect their electrical system also says that when they overdrink at an early age it has that same type of impact.  So those trying to protect us Americans from ourselves are well-intentioned. They certainly understand these negative impacts, and there are negative impacts of everything. There are negative impacts of too much sugar; there are negative impacts of eating the wrong things, or not getting any exercise, or sitting down in front of your computer, or only sitting and watching  But if we go down the road and we let the government just protect us from ourselves, and that we are saying the government needs to just control our lives for us, no, that is not going to happen. That is not what our Founding Fathers were all about, and that is not what this country is all about.  Yes, there are things that we don't want young people to be involved with when it comes to cannabis. It is true with so many other things. And, also, we can't control that if we leave the drug cartels as the major player.  Perhaps the most serious downside of using cannabis over the last 50 years has been the financing of these drug cartels in Mexico and developing countries. But now, with the continued enactment of Rohrabacher-Farr, the vast majority of States have charted another course, rather than what we have had before, before our things passed. Well, the billions of dollars, this multibillion-dollar industry has been taking shape, and it is taking a huge market share away from the cartels and the gangs.  Number one, it is important that we make sure young people, veterans, older people, people who need this, people who are infirmed and need this help with cannabis and it can help them, first and foremost, let's let the States decide whether or not that is going to be a right for people to try to treat themselves with cannabis in those Okay, that is number one.  But, number two, let's make sure that the money that is now being spent and organized to try to provide those people with their supply, and doing it in a very professional way with how much and what strength they are getting, et cetera, and people held accountable, let's not turn that off and eliminate that and just send these people to the drug cartels. It is ridiculous.  And, finally, for me and many of my conservative colleagues, this has always been an issue of federalism and freedom. This has always been an issue that goes right back to the fundamentals.  Our Founding Fathers did not expect that the Federal Government would assume such a prominent role when it comes to policing our lives. Rather, they intended the States to take the lead when exercising police powers.  The 46 States have, thus far, sought a different course when it comes to medical cannabis. These States should not be stymied by an all-powerful Federal Government dictating what we, and the citizens of this country, shall do in our private lives. The States, and the people therein, should be left to make these decisions and to regulate these activities, or not regulate them, as they see fit.  What has happened now, because we have gotten away from this idea that Federalism will decide, the issue of Federalism, the 10th Amendment, what we have now are situations where we have different armies, like the DEA and others, who have had raids taking place throughout our country. This was not what our Founding Fathers had in mind.  This effort to try to put in jail anybody who is even using marijuana for anything, what we have done is in the Black and Chicano communities, in particular, minority communities who have less money, they have suffered the most because if their children--let's say a 20-year-old young man gets arrested in the ghetto, well, he is not going to have a lawyer like that, like people who live in more affluent areas. So that record will stick with him for the rest of his life.  We have wasted billions of dollars of their lives that they could be having better jobs 10 years down the road by hanging this on their back. We wonder why people can't get jobs. Well, somebody from a more affluent home, there is a lawyer waiting for them at the police station if he is ever caught with a baggy of marijuana.  Well, that is not good to have that young man in the ghetto, or anywhere else, or even in the affluent communities, to have to have a criminal record for something that, yes, might[[Page H6652]]have a negative impact on him. We should instead--let me just offer this as a solution. Let's go forward with some positive programs, rather than superseding State law with a heavy-handed, iron-fisted enforcement of laws controlling people's private behavior and their private consumption of what they want to consume. Let's put our effort into offering a positive alternative.  For example, in high schools and colleges, and even in grade schools, we can have drug testing. In our military, we can have drug testing. But it is not drug testing to put someone in jail. If you do it that way, you can't do that legally. You can't force someone to testify against themselves. But if you say: We want to see if you have a problem, and you are not going to get a driver's license if you don't pass drug free; and you can be given a drug test in high school at any time, and if your test comes back negative, you talk to the family of a young person who has been tested and has been using some kind of drug.  We can do those types of things. We can do those things that aren't aimed at obliterating someone's future by giving them a felony conviction for having a little bit of marijuana on them. That is ridiculous.  And we don't need to give the drug cartels all the money in making sure that people in the old folks' home down the street don't get to smoke marijuana to take care of their arthritis. That is all ridiculous.  Now we are facing this challenge here. This will be a vote this week. I would ask my colleagues: Please, let us have the amendment that we have had for 3 years, keep the status quo of letting the States handle this issue, let the States do that. This is a States' rights issue. Thomas Jefferson would be for us.  At the same time, if we do not get a vote on this and they try to hide behind it--we are not even going to get a chance to vote on it, thus we are not going to be held accountable for eliminating this freedom that we have and this federalism that we have--if we don't get that vote, I am asking my colleagues, especially my Republican colleagues--and I ask the public to pay attention to how people vote--a vote for the rule if this amendment, if the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer amendment is not permitted, then a vote for the rule is a vote for giving money to the drug cartels, it is a vote for eliminating the law as it is today, which is leaving it up to the States and bringing the Federal Government back to our local and State areas in an enforcement mode. We don't need that.  If we don't get this, if my amendment, the Rohrabacher amendment, is not permitted, I would hope that my colleagues would join me in voting against the rule, which sends that bill back to the committee, to the Rules Committee, where they will then either add it or not, but at least gives us a chance to have a direct vote on it again if we defeat it the first time.  So I say strike a blow for freedom, make sure we have reaffirmed the idea of federalism, personal responsibility, not government controls over our lives, let's do what our Founding Fathers did, let's strike a blow for liberty.  That is what this is about: liberty. And it is not about having power in the hands of the Federal Government to come down and tell us how to run our lives and centralizing power in Washington, D. So I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for my amendment if it is permitted on the floor and, if it is not, to vote against the rule on the appropriations bill for the Justice  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-05-pt1-PgH6648-2.txt,979,RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY,2017.0,5.0,September

132,topic-id,765,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, if a person deposits $10,000 or more into a financial institution, that institution must submit a currency transaction report to the Treasury Avoiding this reporting requirement by purposefully staying below the $10,000 limit is a Federal crime known as structuring.  Structuring was made illegal in 1986 to prevent large-scale criminal enterprises, terrorists, and money launderers from hiding their illegally earned money from authorities by consistently depositing just shy of that[[Page H6635]]$10,000 limit. This makes complete sense.  When structuring is believed to have occurred, the Internal Revenue Service can use its civil asset forfeiture authority to seize funds and force the owner of the funds to prove that they were obtained legally. Let me tell you, I am not laying awake at night, and neither are my colleagues here, worrying about terrorists and mobsters not being able to get access to their money. So far, so good. The law makes sense.  But now let me tell you about somebody who had their money seized by the Andrew Clyde served three combat tours in Iraq, and then he came home and opened a store in  Mr.Clyde had an insurance policy that only covered up to $10,000 in off-premise losses. So, like any reasonable person, Mr.Clyde never brought more than $10,000 in cash with him when he made his nightly deposits. The IRS seized $950,000 from him.  Now, just marinate in that for a minute, Mr.Imagine trying to run your business, and one day the Federal Government comes in and takes away all of your money. You don't know why, but it is just gone. You would assume that the IRS would then talk to Mr.Clyde, hear his rationale, and say: Well, it is my mistake. You are clearly not a mobster or a terrorist. Thank you for your service. Here is your life savings back.  But that is not what happened. Instead, the IRS threatened him with criminal structuring charges until he agreed to settle with the agency, and gave them $50,000, after he had spent nearly $100,000 in legal fees.  Andrew Clyde lost $150,000 simply because he wanted to make sure that his cash deposits were low enough to be insured.  We are here today to make sure this never happens again. The RESPECT Act makes commonsense changes to civil asset forfeiture practices. First and foremost, the IRS would have to show probable cause that the funds they are seizing were derived from or connected to an illegal source.  Additionally, it would provide protections for taxpayers whose money was taken, requiring a hearing within 30 days of the money being seized. These commonsense steps prevent the Federal Government from acting with impunity and harassing the very citizens that they are supposed to protect.  I want to thank a number of individuals for their work on this legislation. I would like to thank John Lewis, the ranking member of the Oversight I want to thank my lead sponsor, Joe Crowley, the lead Democrat on this legislation. I want to thank Mr.Neal for his leadership, and I want to thank Chairman  We have been at this for a long time. We first started investigating this issue at an Oversight Subcommittee hearing in February of 2015, and we made some progress. IRS Commissioner Koskinen apologized to the victims of this practice on behalf of his agency. In fact, a year later, he changed the IRS procedures to restrict the use of civil asset forfeiture cases in which the money was earned illegally, a commonsense decision that we will codify with this legislation.  I am also heartened to say that in March of this year, the IRS finished its process of reviewing all 454 contested cases that occurred before the rule change. The agency either returned or recommended that the Department of Justice return approximately 80 percent of those funds. The IRS returned over $6 million to honest Americans who were victims of this government overreach.  While the IRS returned over $6 million, they have also recommended that the Department of Justice return a whopping $16 million. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice still has a long way to go in tackling the backlog of undecided cases. We will be addressing this issue with an amendment in the upcoming appropriations bill.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, Americans deserve a government that they can trust. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation to prevent future victims of abusive civil asset forfeiture practices, and fight for those who have been affected.

This is a story about a citizen, a citizen who is scandalized by the Federal Government that is there to protect the citizen, and the citizen said: Do you know what? This doesn't seem right to me. You don't get to do this.  You can imagine what it was like for these people who got caught up in this and were told by IRS agents and Department of Justice lawyers the nature of that intimidation and how heavy-handed and aggressive that is. Yet these people said: No, no, no. That is not right. That is not the way this country is supposed to work.  So they brought it to people's attention, and, Mr.Speaker, people on both sides of the aisle were scandalized by what they heard about this and were troubled by it and said: We can do something about it.  So as a result of this, you have got something that is moving through. Look, it is a tumultuous time in our public life, and there are many deep divisions within this House and across the country about all kinds of issues. But do you know what? Nobody is here defending the status quo of how these people were treated.  So the institution worked. The institution heard what was going on, and now people have come together on both sides of the aisle to move forward on this basis.

7,topic-id,1209,"Mr.President, first, I welcome the Presiding Officer and every other Senator back from the district work period. As we all know, much has happened since we last were here.  North Korea has tested several ballistic missiles and reportedly tested a nuclear weapon, alarming well-meaning nations around the world.  In Charlottesville, neo-Nazis and White supremacists marched through the streets, reminding us we are not done fighting the darkest elements of American society--racism, bigotry, hate.  Right now, large parts of the fourth largest city in our country remain underwater. I extend my most heartfelt sympathies to the people of Houston and to those across parts of Texas and Louisiana who are just beginning a long road to recovery from Hurricane Having lived through Hurricane Sandy in my home State of New York, I remember the agonies of families who lost their homes, lost their businesses, and, particularly in the first month, had a sense of helplessness about what had happened to them. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in  We thank all the first responders and the rescue organizations--the police and fire departments--that are on the scene, as well as those everyday American heroes. Americans always rise to the occasion to lend a hand, such as the folks who drove to Houston with boats hooked to their cars to help rescue stranded families. In rough times, Americans pull together, and Congress will do its part to provide relief and aid to the people of Houston this month.  Needless to say, we have a busy work period ahead of us. In addition to a recovery package for Houston, we have to pass appropriations to keep the government open, raise the debt ceiling, protect the Dreamers, provide certainty on the cost-sharing program that helps keep healthcare premiums down, and much more. The to-do list is lengthy. Nearly all the items I mentioned will require votes from Senators from both sides of the aisle. The best way to tackle and ultimately pass legislation on those issues is for us to work in a bipartisan way this month.  Mr.President, on taxes, unfortunately, we are off to a very bad start because President Trump has scheduled a meeting on tax reform today with only Republican legislative leaders. Just as they did with healthcare, Republicans seem to be excluding Democrats from the legislative process from the very beginning.  The majority leader announced prior to the break that he would likely pursue changes to the Tax Code on reconciliation, meaning the Republicans would only need the votes of their own party. Now they are meeting about the issue without even inviting Democrats to join in preliminary discussions.  Very simply, if Republicans hope to avoid the same pitfalls that ultimately brought down their effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, they ought to abandon the misguided idea that one party can enact major changes to the Tax An effort such as this requires two parties, and the result for the American people will be better if we all work together. The American people understand clearly that if Democrats were included in the debate, tax reform would be much more likely to help the middle class. If Republicans are the only ones in the room on tax reform, the vast majority of the benefits are likely to go to those at the very top. That is what the Republican Party has stood for for years.  Mr.President, on another matter, over the past 6 weeks, North Korea has repeatedly tested the resolve of the United States with the launch of several ballistic missiles. The rogue regime has threatened to launch a missile in close proximity to Guam, a U.territory, and has, in fact, fired a missile over the territory of our ally  The United States must respond to these increasingly bellicose actions with firmness and levelheadedness. The President of the United States has to lead the way. The President of the United States should be firm, level, and above all else, credible. The President's words matter--especially on issues of national security--but thus far, President Trump has responded to North Korea with bluff and bluster, hyperbole and exaggerated language: ``fire and fury like the world has never seen.'' That is the kind of language we typically hear from the North Korean regime, not from the President of the United  The harsh fact is that because President Trump bluffs and blusters, he will be much less effective in dealing with North Korea in the long run. Foreign leaders--especially our allies--don't know whether they can trust his words when there is so much hyperbole involved, and it undermines his ability to lead in a geopolitical crisis.  I urge the President to speak with caution, to speak with prudence, and to always speak credibly as well as strongly. It is paramount that North Korea understand the position of the United States and that when the President of the United States makes a statement, it believe we are prepared to act accordingly.  Mr.President, finally, on the DACA Program, today the administration announced it would terminate the program after a period of 6 months. Most Americans know how heartless this DACA decision is, ripping families[[Page S4919]]apart, telling people who worked so hard for years to become Americans that they now have to leave the country. These are folks who were brought here as children through no fault of their own. They may have known no other country but ours and have voluntarily registered themselves with the government in order to live, work, and give back to our great country. Make no mistake--they contribute greatly to our country. These hard-working people and their contributions are vital to our economy, vital to our communities, schools, and institutions, such as the military.  They are also vital to tens of thousands of businesses, small and large, that will be hurt if the administration's order stands. Ninety-one percent of DACA recipients are employed, paying taxes and paying into Social A study by the Center for American Progress earlier this year found that ending DACA would drain $433 billion from our national GDP over 10 years. Even the Libertarian Cato Institute estimated that ending DACA would cost employers nearly $2 billion over 2 years. The human and economic toll of rescinding DACA will be far-reaching.  It is telling that Attorney General Sessions--not President Trump--made the announcement today that the administration would be ending DACA, and he did it without taking a single question. It shows that President Trump is not proud of what the administration has done today; otherwise he would have come forward himself. It shows that he is probably ashamed of this decision.  It was with unbelievable hypocrisy that both Attorney General Sessions and the White House Press Secretary said today that the decision was about upholding the rule of law. If this White House had such reverence for the rule of law, the President would not have fired Jim Comey or attacked the Federal judiciary for ruling against the travel ban or pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio for no reason other than he was a political ally.  Congress now has an ability and an obligation to act. Democrats will do everything we can to prevent President Trump's terribly wrong order from becoming reality.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-05-pt1-PgS4918-2.txt,1036,TERMINATING DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS,2017.0,5.0,September
355,topic-id,1604,"Mr.President, as the Senate wraps up its work this week, I have been in multiple discussions with my friend the majority leader about clearing nominations with bipartisan support, and we have made significant progress. Now that we have moved past the terrible process used on healthcare, I hope we can get back to our normal way of legislating and clearing noncontroversial nominees. The two are tied together. They can't avoid regular order when they want to and say that Democrats should use regular order whenever they want us to.  Now that healthcare is done, I think we can tie the two together--the normal way of legislating, clearing noncontroversial nominees as we move forward in Of course, controversial nominees will still require the proper vetting, but I am committed to help move noncontroversial, bipartisan nominees forward.  I hope the fever is breaking. There is a real desire in this body to move past the acrimony of the healthcare debate and get to a place where we can work together to advance legislation that helps the American people.

Tax Reform  Mr.President, the Republican leader has said that the next big issue this body will take up is taxes. Democrats were excluded from even participating in healthcare discussions from the very first day of Congress, a process that ultimately ended in failure. So we have made the first overture this time to show our Republican friends we are serious about a bipartisan process on tax reform. We sent them a letter outlining three very basic principles. This is a guideline for our Republican colleagues to come work with us. These are very simple principles that I think the vast majority of Americans would support. Let me say what they are.  First, the Republican leader has said that he would pursue reconciliation again, a process that purposefully excludes Democrats almost again on the first day we begin to talk about tax reform. The majority leader brought down the curtain on bipartisan tax reform before a discussion between our two parties could even begin. He says that Democrats don't want to have a bipartisan discussion. Of course we do. We have said this over and over again until we are blue in the face, but I guess the majority leader somehow didn't like the three principles we laid out, and I would like him to specifically answer what it was.  We know he probably agrees, so which of these three principles does the majority leader disagree with? Tell us. Which of the three? We know he probably agrees with the third. Surely he can't think that a blunt budget tool that excludes 48 Members of the Senate is a good way to write legislation. He has said so many times himself. I quoted him yesterday.  He warned the Senate about becoming ``an assembly line for one party's partisan legislative agenda.'' Those are Senator McConnell's words. The Senate should not become ``an assembly line for one party's partisan legislative agenda.'' That is what he did on healthcare. Is he doing it again on tax reform? I hope not.  Well, we know he probably agrees with the second principle: no increase to the debt and deficit. We know he agrees because he has said so before. The Republican leader and Members of his party have spent decades assailing the debt and deficit. As recently as May 16, the Republican leader told[[Page S4785]]Bloomberg TV that tax reform will have to be revenue-neutral, so that one doesn't seem to be it. Again, I would like to hear what he has to say explicitly so that we can work together.  It leaves us with the first principle: no tax cuts for the top 1 percent. Here again, I understand why the majority leader and my Republican friends don't want to come out and say that this is the reason they have decided to pursue a tax bill on their own, but it almost certainly is.  Tax cuts for the wealthy are extremely unpopular with the American people--and for good reason. The top 1 percent of this country takes 20 percent of our income, a great percentage of its wealth. The wealthy are doing well. God bless them. Their incomes are going up at a faster rate than those of anybody else, but when we are talking about our Tax Code and rewriting it, we shouldn't be focused on giving the 1 percent another tax break while millions of working families struggle to afford the cost of college, prescription drugs, food, and healthcare.  I am afraid the majority is in the same boat as they were with healthcare. They don't want to say that their real reason for changing healthcare is wanting to slash A good number of courageous Members on the other side said: We won't do that. But that was the core of the Senate bill. They knew it was unpopular with the American people, so they didn't talk about it. They entered into a process that hid it from the American people.  I think, unfortunately, history is repeating itself. They know how unpopular cutting taxes on the top 1 percent is, but for the special interest, Koch brother wing of their party, that is their 1 goal. All they talk about is cutting taxes on the wealthy. So they are stuck. When will my colleagues have the courage to break free from the Koch brothers and special interests?  Don't give breaks to the top 1 percent. Everyone knows they don't need it. It is an old, discredited idea that has lost its steam except among the hard-right, Koch brother wing of the Republican Most Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--don't go for it. So break free.  If our Republican colleagues' whole basis for doing tax reform is cutting taxes on the top 1 percent, we are going to send that message from one end of America to the other, and their ideas will certainly fail, as they did with healthcare.  In a related point, I saw this morning that President Trump has been bragging about the success of the stock market, which, by the way, was already going up. It went up more points under President Obama than under President It started going up years ago. It is just continuing. Most economists would give President Obama at least as much credit as President But that is not the point I wish to make.  The stock market is mainly owned by the wealthy. As of 2013, the top 20 percent own 92 percent of all stock shares. So when the stock market is going up, it is helping the 1 percent.  Average Americans are not looking for stocks to go up, not looking for corporate profits to hit record levels, as much as they are looking at how are their paychecks, how are their expenses. That is why we have a better deal for them. We want paychecks for average Americans to go up. We want expenses for average Americans to go down. We want them to have better tools, so they and their kids can make a better living in the 21st century.  The focus of the stock market is on people at the highest end. Many will dispute whether President Trump deserves credit for it, but whether you think so or you don't--I don't, by and large--it is not what the American people are looking for, and it is not a basis for bragging about the economy.  Well, going back to taxes--the American people will rebel against a tax cut for the wealthy, so the Republicans clearly will not talk about it in their plan. They will give a crumb to the middle class and try to hide a massive giveaway to the already fortunate. I can see no other reason why they object to these three very reasonable, very popular principles other than that, and we hope they will not try to sneak it through in the same partisan process.                              Immigration  Finally, Mr.President, a word on immigration: Yesterday, I heard the President railing against migrant workers and wrapping his arms around the Cotton-Perdue bill. The bill goes after hard-working people who want to play by the rules, contribute to our economy, and earn citizenship, while doing nothing to address the unscrupulous practices of employers who abuse our visa programs to outsource jobs and displace American workers.  Here is what I would like to focus on. The President has this nice announcement that he is cutting back on immigration, but a month ago he actually increased the number of H-2B visas--a program the President knows well. Why? A lot of those with H-2B visas work in hotels. I don't know how many, but I bet a good number are in Trump So when the President actually looks at immigration in his own businesses, he says: We need more immigrants. When asked before, he has said: Well, we couldn't get American workers. But when he comes up with his big immigration plan--I think not appealing to the higher instincts of Americans--he says: Slash it. Those two are complete contradictions. To hold both of those views is to hold hypocritical views.  The President wants to talk about immigration because he thinks the politics are to his advantage, but, in truth, his immigration policy has a stunning hypocrisy at the core of it. The President criticizes and seeks to limit almost every immigration program except the one that benefits his own business.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

These amendments, known as Regulation A-Plus, exclude certain potential issuers, including Exchange Act reporting companies.  As a result, thousands of companies that already meet the SEC's high disclosure requirements are ineligible to use Regulation A-Plus to cost-effectively raise the funds they need to grow and hire employees.  That is why I have introduced this legislation with Congressman Hollingsworth to allow SEC reporting companies access to Regulation A-It is a valuable pathway for small businesses to raise money in an efficient, public, and transparent manner.

49,topic-id,897,"Mr.President, every week, I have been coming to the floor to talk about the wonderful people in my A lot of people have visited If you haven't and you are watching on TV, we really, really want to welcome you to come. It will be the trip of a lifetime; I guarantee it.  What we like to do when we talk about our Alaskan of the Week is talk about someone who has made a real impact, someone who doesn't get a lot of attention, someone who has made an impact on his community or country, and let people know we are thinking about them, let people know we are proud of them. Before recess, I want to do that for a couple of Alaskans today, and I would like to start by talking about a gentleman who has gotten a little press lately in Alaska, but I want the country to hear about it. It is really a remarkable story--Mr.Mark  Let me tell you a little bit about Mark came to my attention through a recent column by Charles Wohlforth in the Alaska Dispatch  Mark is originally from When he was just 17 years old, he joined the Navy, like a lot of We have more vets per capita than any State in the country. He was deployed in 1972.  Mark said:       When I was in high school, everyone had long hair and were      anti-government. That's not the way I was. I was for God and      country. If my brothers were over there in Vietnam, I wanted      to stand with them.  So he went. When a lot of people were avoiding service, he went.  When Mark got out, he couldn't find a job, so he began to hitchhike across the country into Canada and other places, and he wound up in the magical place we call Mark arrived in 1976. After leaving once and coming back, he got a job as a taxi driver--a good job. He met and fell in love with one of his passengers, a beautiful woman named They went on to have seven children--Stephen, David, Kelly, Jared, Michael, and Helen was a great mother.  Then, unfortunately, as sometimes happens in families in certain circumstances, tragedy struck their family. In 2007, Helen was walking down a busy road and was hit and unfortunately killed by a car passing by.  Faced with unspeakable grief, Mark knew he couldn't fall apart. He had seven kids between the ages of 6 and 16, and he had to take care of them. One of them was in third grade at the time and couldn't stop crying over the loss of his mom. The school called often, and Mark--still a taxi driver--left work to pick him up. The hours of tending to his kids began to rack up. He couldn't pay the rent. His kids and he had to eventually live in a homeless shelter.  A social worker wanted to put the kids up for adoption, but Mark refused. They had lost their mother, they had lost their home, and they weren't going to lose their dad. The family needed him, and they were a team.  Eventually--and this is so great; it happens all across Alaska, all across America--with the help of the community, in this case, their local Catholic church, Saint Anthony's Parish, Mark was able to afford rent for a three-bedroom apartment with one bathroom where they still live today and to buy his own taxi license.  In the face of adversity, he raised his kids to be strong, proud, caring, responsible, and to do the right thing. They stuck together. They ran together, sometimes as many as 6 miles a day--the Navy veteran out with his children. They studied together. They were good kids. They didn't miss school or the bus. They never got in trouble. They were a team.  This is what is remarkable about this family: Six out of the seven Braudis children, whom I have been speaking about, have joined the Marines They have taken after their dad, serving their country--six out of seven. How many families in America can say that? The seventh couldn't because of a medical issue, and he is nearly finished with a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Alaska in Anchorage and tutors students in math at the university.  The youngest one, Jenny, a senior in high school, has already been sworn in to the She wants to drive tanks. The middle child, Jared, is the only one who joined the infantry. When they all get together, he kids them, telling them he is the tough one, but I am sure they are all tough. Jared said:       When we were growing up, my dad just made things right. He      still does.  What did Mark learn from these challenges? He said:       When you're married, you become one. And when my wife      passed away, she brought me to God with her. And then I      brought my children to I didn't understand it then, but      I do now. It's been one miracle after another.       Also, what I learned? I'm a dad above everything else.  Well, Mark, thank you. Thanks to you, your children, and your family for this amazing example and for doing such a great job of raising your kids. You are a model for all of us.

We call these people the Alaskan of the It is one of the most fulfilling parts of my job to come here and talk about people who make a difference, people who don't get a lot of press, people who don't get a lot of attention, but people who are doing the right thing for their country and for their community.  Right now in Alaska, we have tourists, people coming from all over, and one of the things happening in Alaska is salmon season. The biggest runs in the world--the bounty of our great State--are happening right now, and the fish are running. If you or anyone listening has ever had the opportunity to catch or eat wild Alaskan salmon, of course, it is the memory of a lifetime. There is nothing better; there is no better fish in the world.  There is great salmon fishing all across Alaska, but one of the most heavily fished areas in Alaska and the[[Page S4796]]world is on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, about 45 minutes from Millions of salmon run up the rivers of the Kenai, drawing tens of thousands of Alaska sports, personal use, and commercial fishermen, as well as visitors from all over the country, all over the world to fish the amazing Kenai  The area can continue to support a lot of traffic, but when you have that many people on the Kenai, sometimes it does cause congestion.

She loves the There is a sense of freedom there and all across It is a place where there is room to pave your own path but support others and the community around you, and, of course, there are the salmon.  Since Kathy moved to Alaska, she has been working to give back to the community that she loves so much. She is an active member and past president of her local Rotary She is a member of the Kenai Peninsula Borough Community Emergency Response She is also a member of a group that operates ham radios in order to help if there is a disaster and shuts down cell service or other communication devices.  During the summer, right now, she spends much of her free time as a Kenai Peninsula Stream Watch volunteer with the Kenai Watershed Forum, helping to make sure that she will have a sustainable fishery--that we will have a sustainable fishery in the Kenai and throughout the State for generations to come. A few times a week, for as many as 6 hours at a time, she roams the fishing spots, picking up trash, helping others, speaking with anglers. She talks to them about how to protect themselves. She carries around safety goggles--you never want a hook in the eye. She talks about what happens when you run into a bear, which happens a lot in our great State, and the best way to avoid them, and importantly, she educates anglers on how to protect the vegetated banks on this great river to maintain the health of the river and the amazing salmon in it.  The vast majority of the people in Alaska and from out of State who fish the Kenai are responsible and want to help in any way they can, and they love Kathy's help, but, still, all the activity in the area has created erosion problems, which has the potential to hurt the fish.  The Kachemak Heritage Land Trust, a land stewardship and conservation trust based in Homer, recently recognized Kathy's efforts and presented her with the King Maker ``It is your selfless actions that help protect the vital habitat needed for salmon to live and thrive,'' the land trust wrote to her. ``Great role models such as yourself can inspire others in our communities to take action by following your lead'' and your example.

While more than 58,000 of those men and women gave the ultimate sacrifice, many more endured and are still here with us today. However, it has not been an easy road for these veterans.

571,topic-id,839,"Mr.President, my esteemed colleague from Delaware says that we have plenty to do when we get back, and he is, certainly, correct. I would join many of my colleagues today, though, in pointing out that in the last 3 days, we have actually gotten substantial work done. Perhaps we have crammed into 3 days what using the regular order and the filibuster and the motions to proceed might have taken 3 weeks otherwise. So the leadership on both sides of the aisle are to be commended for this burst of progress we have made, and I hope we can continue that when we get back.  Earlier today, this Congress passed a significant piece of legislation offered by the Senator who occupies the Chair, my good friend, Senator Johnson of It is the Right to Try Act, which seeks to streamline the way people who are willing to take a bit of a chance on a drug in order to save their lives--streamline the way they can have access to perhaps life-enhancing and lifesaving drugs. It is a real achievement. I congratulate my colleague from Wisconsin and congratulate the leadership facilitating this breakthrough.  Moments later, the Senate passed a companion bill authored by Senator Klobuchar and me known as the Better Empowerment Now to Enhance Framework and Improve Treatments Act or the BENEFIT This is another win for patients--patients who deserve to have a voice in the drug approval process. This bill, which is a companion bill to the very important Right to Try Act, will do that.  The BENEFIT Act calls for a simple amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act--one that could make a big difference to patients whose lives may depend on a new therapy or drug. Specifically, the Wicker-Klobuchar bill would require the use of patient experience and patient-focused drug development and related data in assessing the risk versus the benefit of these particular therapies.  The bill also includes information from patient advocacy groups and academic institutions. This is a small but important step forward.  If signed into law--and I certainly hope the House passes it and I hope the President will sign it into law--this bill would greatly enhance the data and information available to FDA when reviewing drugs, when reviewing medical products, and when reviewing therapies. It would also add to the progress Congress has made in recent years, reaffirming the importance of patients' perspectives in drug decisions--decisions that can have a profound and lasting impact on the lives of these patients. Ask any American who suffers from a disease or who is watching a loved one suffer, and they will tell us that all information should be on the table when a breakthrough or a cure is at stake.  Last year, Senator Klobuchar and I joined together to make the FDA's use of patient perspectives more transparent with what we call the Patient-Focused Impact Assessment This was passed and was signed into law as part of the 21st Century Cures  The BENEFIT Act, passed by the Senate today, would keep that momentum going, building on the progress we have made.  Now, what progress have we made? Let me tell my colleagues this. For years, I have sought to find a cure for the devastating, fatal disease known as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. I have worked on this issue since my early years in the House of Young boys--almost all males--is whom this affects. These young boys face this fatal disease, and they know better than anyone what a drug can do to improve the quality of their lives.  Since the Congress passed and the President signed the MD-CARE Act dealing with Duchenne muscular dystrophy more than 15 years ago, research has led to innovative therapies[[Page S4810]]that have added a decade to the lives of these young boys. What an achievement by scientists in What an achievement for the government to have unleashed cures and research in this area.  We need their voices heard, we need their stories heard, and we need the voices of patients with other diseases heard.  I thank my colleagues in the Senate for joining with us on a unanimous consent request to pass this legislation. I thank the leadership on this side of the aisle and our Democratic counterparts on the other side.  Particular appreciation goes to Senator Alexander, the chairman of the HELP Committee, and to Senator Murray, the ranking Democrat on the HELP Committee, for their valuable help. Appreciation goes to perhaps a new attitude for the rest of the year in the Senate to join together with unanimous consent and move bills and nominations forward that have widespread support and consensus around the country.  I congratulate the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Wisconsin, on an outstanding achievement, and I congratulate the Senate for joining with Senator Klobuchar and me to help out in another way.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Boy Scout Troop 533 was formed in 1927 by Munster native Mr.Muary Kraay when he was in eighth grade. Since its founding, troop 533 has been active in their community. During World War II, the Boy Scouts organized parades and rallies for war bonds, planted community gardens, practiced blackout drills, and participated in wartime recycling programs. On June 14, 1947, when President Coolidge dedicated Wicker Park in Highland, IN, troop 533 was there to welcome him. The Boy Scouts also had a crucial role during the September 2008 flooding of the Little Calumet In anticipation of the flood, troop 533 assisted in filling sandbags, and after the flood, they assisted in yard cleanup and regraveling driveways.
