                               TAX REFORM

  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.)
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I would love 
to vote for a bipartisan tax reform that supports middle class 
families, ensures the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share, 
invests in the next generation, and protects small businesses.
  However, I can't vote for legislation that would raise taxes for 13 
million middle class households next year; or that would give the top 
0.1 percent of Americans an average tax cut of over $320,000 while 
raising taxes on 36 million families by 2027; or that would provide 
more tax benefit to the richest 1 percent than the lower 95 percent of 
Americans combined.
  Saddling the next generation with $1.7 trillion in debt while 
prioritizing millionaires and billionaires at the expense of everybody 
else is irresponsible and cruel.
  Mr. Speaker, I could spend countless hours describing how this bill 
harms middle class families, students, the elderly, and businesses in 
my home State of New Mexico, but since I only have 1 minute to address 
the floor today, I will be back tomorrow to talk about how this bill 
devastates investment and job creation in the quickly growing renewable 
energy industry in my home State of New Mexico.
