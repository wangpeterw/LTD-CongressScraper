                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come, enter the 
lives of our lawmakers today and give them pure hearts. Enlighten and 
illuminate their minds that they may know You, who are the way, the 
truth, and the life. When they are tired, refresh them; when they are 
lonely, cheer them; when they are tempted, strengthen them; and when 
they are perplexed, guide them. Lord, help them so to live that they 
will be prepared to see Your face in peace. Make our Senators positive 
people who are expectant of Your best for our Nation and world. Radiate 
Your hope through them so that America will remain a shining city on a 
hill.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
