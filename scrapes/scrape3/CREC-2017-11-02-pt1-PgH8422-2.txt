                     SUPPORTING THE HEARTBEAT BILL

  (Mr. ROKITA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of 
life.
  Thomas Jefferson famously wrote that every man has the right to 
``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' I hold this quote near 
and dear because we must defend these rights. That is certainly true 
with the right to life for a baby.
  Last week, I met with Rachelle Heidelbaugh with Faith2Action. 
Rachelle told me her story about when she chose life and how she has 
continued fighting for life through Faith2Action. Her story was truly 
moving and pulled at the heartstrings. I couldn't help but give her a 
hug because her story is so meaningful and her efforts are truly saving 
lives.
  While Rachelle visited, we talked about the Heartbeat bill. The 
Heartbeat bill would ensure that every unborn child with a heartbeat is 
protected. We need to do whatever we can to protect life, and this bill 
will allow us to keep on protecting unborn boys and girls.
  Rachelle gave me the Heartbeat Bill Hero Award like many in this 
House have gotten. The award is this small token that I am proud to 
carry because it represents thousands of lives that are being saved.
  I will always stand up for a baby's right to life, and I hope my 
colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 490, the Heartbeat bill 
legislation.
