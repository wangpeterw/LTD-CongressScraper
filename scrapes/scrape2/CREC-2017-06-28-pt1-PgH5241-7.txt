          NORTH CAROLINA GROWTH AND FORTUNE BUSINESS RANKINGS

  (Mr. HOLDING asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the tremendous 
amount of growth in North Carolina, specifically in and around the 
Second Congressional District.
  According to the Census Bureau, North Carolina's population has 
increased 6.4 percent since 2010. That number increases to over 16 
percent for just Wake County which encompasses about half of the Second 
Congressional District.
  Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that North Carolina is a fantastic place 
to live and work, especially for young people wanting to raise a 
family. In fact, Fortune magazine recently surveyed tens of thousands 
of millennials nationally about the best places to work, and the 
results speak for themselves. Two of the top 10 businesses in the 
United States call Wake County home.
  SAS, a global analytics software firm, and Kimley-Horn, a provider of 
professional services, placed at number two and number eight on the 
list respectively.
  That is great news for the future of North Carolina.
