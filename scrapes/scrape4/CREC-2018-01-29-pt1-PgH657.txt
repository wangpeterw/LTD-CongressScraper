                STANDING FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, just a couple of hours ago, the 
Republicans on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence voted to 
release the Nunes report. At the same time, they voted not to allow the 
rebuttal offered by the Democrats to be released.
  All I can say, Mr. Speaker, as a Member who has been through 
impeachment of the Federal judiciary and a President, not one time did 
I see any sidetrack opportunities or efforts to dismantle that ongoing 
investigation.
  We are not in an impeachment proceeding. We have a special counsel 
that is attempting to provide for the American people a detailed and 
thoughtful investigation.
  Why the rule of law has been so obliterated by our Republican friends 
and the idea of democracy and the protection of the institutions of 
this Nation have been undermined, I am shocked.
  The American people are not clamoring for the destruction of the FBI, 
nor are they clamoring for the destruction and undermining of Special 
Counsel Mueller's report.
  Let us stand for the principles of democracy and the Constitution. 
This kind of undermining is dastardly and embarrassing.
