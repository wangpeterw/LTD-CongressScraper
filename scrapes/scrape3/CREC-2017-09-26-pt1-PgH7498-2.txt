                     PRESIDENT TAKES NEW DIRECTION

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the President is doing what he was 
elected to do--call it shaking up the system, putting the brakes on the 
bureaucracy, or creative deconstruction.
  Our country simply cannot continue on the same course: where the 
government increases the debt by hundreds of billions of dollars every 
year; where hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants cross our 
border annually, insulting those who play by the rules and wait their 
turn in line; where political correctness limits freedom of speech, 
especially for conservatives.
  The liberal media is trying to shut down this Presidency because they 
oppose everything President Trump is trying to do. Mr. Speaker, in this 
great conflict, the American people and our democracy could be the 
casualties.
