                          INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK

  (Mr. LAWSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this week is infrastructure week, 
and today I rise to highlight the need to update our country's aging 
infrastructure system. This is a topic that is important in both the 
rural and urban areas of our country.
  From the highway system in Lake City, Florida, to the port needs of 
Jacksonville, we must put forth the necessary resources to update our 
transit needs.
  Each year, millions of tons of freight traffic, seaport cargo, and 
rail cargo pass through Jacksonville as they are transported to 
communities throughout our country.
  The Jacksonville Transportation Authority is building a 57-mile bus 
rapid transit system, which is cost-effective and will support 
hundreds, and potentially thousands, of new jobs.
  They are also overseeing the development of the Jacksonville Regional 
Transportation Center, a transportation hub that will consolidate major 
modes of public transportation, making transit more accessible and 
convenient.
  While that is all good news, there is still much work to be done to 
improve our infrastructure in north Florida.
