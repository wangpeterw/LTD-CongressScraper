                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Answer us, Eternal One, as we lift our hearts to You. Have mercy upon 
our lawmakers and hear their prayers. Remind them that You have set 
apart the godly for Yourself, surrounding them with the shield of Your 
favor. May they never forget that You alone can keep a nation safe.
  Lord, lead them on the path that will bring them to abundant life, 
telling them what to do and showing them which way to turn. As Hanukkah 
ended last evening and Christmas approaches, may Your blessings and 
peace rest on our Nation and world.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
