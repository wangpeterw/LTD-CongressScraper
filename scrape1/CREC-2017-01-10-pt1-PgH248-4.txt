                            REPEAL OBAMACARE

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, on November 8, the American people gave my 
party control of the entire Congress and the White House because of the 
promise-breaking, job-killing law known as ObamaCare--the craziest 
thing in the whole world, according to President Bill Clinton. The 
fearmongers on the other side are telling Americans they will lose 
their health care in a snap. They should talk to Martha.
  Martha is a self-employed CPA who developed a nasty leukemia a couple 
of years ago. She was told to get ready for the end of her life. A 
miracle happened. Experimental treatment reduced her cancer from grade 
III to grade I. The drugs to save her life cost $15,000 per month. On 
October 20, because of ObamaCare, she was told that she had to pay 50 
percent of that cost instead of 30 percent. That is tough for her to 
afford.
  Martha got to hold her fifth grandkid this past summer. House 
Republicans want her to hold her sixth and seventh grandkid in the 
future. We have our orders to repeal ObamaCare. It is time to go to 
work.
