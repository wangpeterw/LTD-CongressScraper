                       TRIBUTE TO HAROLD BLATTIE

 Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Harold 
Blattie, the outgoing executive director of the Montana Association of 
Counties, for his longtime commitment to public service in the State of 
Montana.
  Mr. Blattie has dedicated his life to helping preserve our Montana 
way of life through countless public works projects.
  He has served as the executive director of MACo for over a decade, 
providing strong leadership for Montana's counties and facilitating 
cooperation between local, State, and Federal leaders to deliver for 
the residents of Big Sky Country.
  Throughout his respected career, he has secured critical resources 
for citizens from Libby to Baker and Dillon to Plentywood. The 
residents of our great State owe him a debt of gratitude, and I rise 
today with a small token of our appreciation.
  Mr. Blattie has built his life around building stronger communities.
  He is a role model for all Americans, and Montana is a better place 
because of his work.
  I rise today to thank him for all he has done for the Treasure State 
and wish him all the best of luck in whatever comes next.

                          ____________________
