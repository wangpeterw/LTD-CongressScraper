              CUT BUREAUCRACY OUT OF THE CASEWORK PROCESS

  (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 512, the 
WINGMAN Act. The WINGMAN Act will help Members of Congress and our 
staff members better assist the constituents that we serve. It cuts 
bureaucracy out of the casework process, and it makes it easier to 
connect Pennsylvania families with the services and benefits that they 
need.
  Our staff members in our district do tremendous work every day. They 
help constituents and their families navigate the Federal bureaucracy, 
whether it is helping veterans obtain care through the VA, seniors 
access their Medicare or Social Security benefits, or even helping a 
traveler obtain a passport for an emergency trip overseas. Too often 
that work goes unsung and the hard work they do goes unrecognized.
  I am blessed to have a terrific staff in my district office, led by 
my district chief of staff, Caitlin Ganley. Our team, Bill Dondero, 
Maureen Quinn, Alaina Sforza, and Brian Gallie have helped literally 
thousands of individuals as we have worked to cut through the red tape 
and get the answers they need from the agencies across the Federal 
Government. The WINGMAN Act will make this difficult job just a little 
bit easier, and I am proud to support it.
