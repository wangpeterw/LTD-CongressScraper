                          RUSSIAN INFILTRATION

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is literally 
every day now that something new and even more shocking comes out about 
the Trump administration and its connections with the Russian 
Government. Just last night, it was reported that, according to 
American intelligence officials, at least four members of the Trump 
campaign, senior members, were in constant contact with Russian 
intelligence officials for a year.
  Mr. Speaker, this is not so much about Republican or Democrat as it 
is about democracy, our democracy. I want to thank those few 
Republicans in the Senate who have had the courage to put country 
before party and come forward and demand an independent, bipartisan 
investigation. Sadly, that has been met with silence on the Republican 
side of the aisle in this House.
  We must have a 9/11-like commission to investigate to what extent 
Russian intelligence infiltrated our election.
