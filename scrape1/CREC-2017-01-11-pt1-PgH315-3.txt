  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend hisremarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, I was 
grateful to participate in the Stand Up for Life March andRally in 
Columbia, hosted by the South Carolina Citizens for Life during a rare 
snowstorm.
  I appreciated hearing remarks from Evangelist Alveda King, niece of 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a dedicated pro-lifeactivist. I was also 
grateful to attend the grand opening of Daybreak, a crisis pregnancy 
center, hosted by Director BrennanAschleman.
  I thank Lisa Van Riper, president of South Carolina Citizens for 
Life, with Holly Gatling and Brenda Cerkez for organizingsuch a 
meaningful event. I was grateful to participate, as well, with Bishop 
Robert Guglielmone of Charleston and the Knights ofColumbus led by 
Thomas Monahan.
  Pro-life voters have made a difference with all statewide officials, 
both U.S. Senators and six U.S. Members of Congresssupporting pro-life 
initiatives, along with super majorities in the State house and senate. 
I was grateful to begin this newCongress by being an original cosponsor 
of H. Res. 354 to provide for a moratorium on Federal funding to 
Planned Parenthood,which has disgracefully sold baby body parts.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his 
actions, never forget September the 11th in the globalwar on terrorism.
