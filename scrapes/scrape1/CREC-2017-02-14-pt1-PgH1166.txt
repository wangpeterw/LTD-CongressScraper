           RESIGNATION OF MICHAEL FLYNN AND RUSSIAN INFLUENCE

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the resignation of President Trump's 
national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is the third Trump senior 
adviser to resign amid allegation of ties to Russia and the Kremlin. 
Two others were attached to the Trump campaign: his manager, Paul 
Manafort, and Russian energy adviser, Carter Page.
  Meanwhile, Russia's Putin is the same KGB thug he always has been, 
continuing to invade countries in eastern and central Europe and 
propagating a war in Syria as well as a bloody war against Ukraine.
  The American people deserve to know the full extent of Russia's 
financial, personal, and political grip on the Trump administration, 
and Congress

should meet its constitutional responsibilities to protect our national 
security and to protect our Nation against all enemies, foreign and 
domestic.
  The American people need to know whether Russian creditors or their 
intermediaries are helping prop up the Trump commercial empire. This 
Congress needs to do its job, conduct hearings, subpoena witnesses, and 
bring truth to the American people about the Trump administration's 
ties to Russia.
