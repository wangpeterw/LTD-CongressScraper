           CONGRATULATING WESLEY SO ON HIS CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wesley So of 
Minnetonka, Minnesota, who earlier this month became the United States 
chess champion. At 23 years of age, Wesley is already one of the 
world's top chess grandmasters.
  In St. Louis, for the U.S. Chess Championship, Wesley So and his 
opponent went into a playoff after a two-way tie for first place. In 
the two-game playoff, So won the first game handily and was able to 
force a draw in the second game with a perpetual check with his knight. 
He extended his no-loss streak to 67 games, one of the longest runs in 
the game's history.
  Mr. Speaker, Wesley So has quickly made a name for himself in the 
world of chess since coming to America from the Philippines 5 years 
ago. He is now the world's number two ranked player and is in prime 
position to play the world's top player, Norway's Magnus Carlsen.
  Congratulations to Wesley So on an impressive run of dominance. We 
will be cheering for him as he continues to work on becoming the first 
American chess grandmaster in more than 40 years.
