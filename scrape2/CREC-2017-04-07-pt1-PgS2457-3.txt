                              S. Res. 124

       Whereas the National Sea Grant College Program, established 
     in 1966, serves 31 States and 2 territories to strengthen the 
     health and stewardship of local, State, and national coastal 
     and marine resources;
       Whereas 42 percent of the United States population lives or 
     works in a coastal area, and coastal counties contribute over 
     $7,600,000,000,000 annually to the economy;
       Whereas the National Sea Grant College Program is critical 
     in improving the health of coastal ecosystems, supporting 
     sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, building resilient 
     communities and economies, improving environmental literacy, 
     and developing the next generation of students in science and 
     technology;
       Whereas the National Sea Grant College Program had an 
     economic impact of $575,000,000 in 2015 from a Federal 
     investment of $67,300,000, which is an 854-percent return on 
     investment;

     supported thousands of undergraduate and graduate students at 
     institutions of higher education across the United States:

     National Sea Grant College Program is--
       (1) of vital importance to improving the economy, health, 
     stewardship, and preparedness of the United States;
       (2) an exceptional example of effective partnerships 
     between Federal, State, and local governments; and
