                 HAPPY BIRTHDAY WISHES TO SKY AND SAGE

  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to say happy birthday to my 
daughters, Sky and Sage. There is no greater love than the love I have 
for my twin girls, Sky and Sage, and for my wife, Monica.
  There is no greater role or responsibility I have than to be their 
father and Monica's husband. There is no greater title more honorable 
and more meaningful in my life than the title of father and husband.
  There is no greater joy than to hear my girls sing with happiness, 
play with vigor, and laugh with gusto. There is no greater medicine for 
my soul than feeling their bear hugs when I arrive home after being 
away at work for days.
  Today, I celebrate their birth, their 3 years of life, and their 
future with the highest hopes and aspirations any father can have 
throughout all generations of fatherhood.
  Today I sing our love story, and I sing Happy Birthday to my Sky Bear 
and Sage Monkey.
  Happy birthday. I love you a lot--te amo mucho.
