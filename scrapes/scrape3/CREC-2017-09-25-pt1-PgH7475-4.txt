   REPUBLICANS SHOULD WORK WITH DEMOCRATS TO CREATE BETTER HEALTHCARE

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today to express my 
opposition to the newest TrumpCare bill that will result in 21 million 
fewer Americans having healthcare insurance.
  Once again, Senate Republicans, like House Republicans, are rushing 
to pass a hurtful bill that every major healthcare group, from the 
American Medical Association to Kaiser, is opposing.
  The latest heartless version of TrumpCare is no different than the 
previous plans because it still leaves many in the cold. As the old 
saying goes, it is like putting lipstick on a pig, as the bill still 
allows States to eliminate essential healthcare benefits like ER 
visits, preventative screenings, and prescription drug coverage.
  This misguided plan also guts Medicaid, at a loss of $4 billion in 
Federal funds to Ohio--my State--and allows insurers to charge seniors 
and people with preexisting health conditions more money for less 
coverage.
  Now it is time to stand together and hold strong with Senator John 
McCain and the Governors of Ohio, Nevada, and other States. Republicans 
should work with Democrats to create a better deal, better jobs, better 
healthcare, and a better future for all Americans.
