      MANUFACTURING IS STILL KEY TO OUR NATION'S FUTURE PROSPERITY

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, in Illinois' 10th District, one doesn't 
have to look far to see America's strength in advanced 21st century 
manufacturing. In fact, my district has the fourth highest 
concentration of manufacturing jobs of any district in the Nation.
  Manufacturing is still key to our Nation's future prosperity because 
it creates a multiplier effect that generates economic growth and jobs 
throughout our economy.
  Last week, I visited 12 local manufacturers as part of my Made in 
Illinois 10 Tour. I had three key takeaways from my visit:
  First, innovation is alive and well in Illinois 10. I saw new 
applications and design, additive manufacturing, robotics, and more. 
And at every turn, innovation is creating new, quality, well-paying 
jobs.
  Second, we have to close the skills gap. We need more teachers, 
parents, and especially young, smart talented people to recognize that 
working in manufacturing can be a stimulating and rewarding career.
  Third, when the global market is a fair and level playing field, 
American companies not only can compete, we can win and we can prosper.
  We need to hold bad actors like China accountable. The President's 
shoot-from-the-hip actions risk sparking a destructive cycle of 
retaliatory tariffs.
  The companies I visited are worried about that and, indeed, are 
already feeling the impact of a prospective trade war.
  Mr. Speaker, I was encouraged by the ingenuity and drive of our local 
manufacturers, and I remain committed to supporting this crucial sector 
of our economy.
