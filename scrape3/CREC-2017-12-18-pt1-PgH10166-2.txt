           CONGRESS NEEDS TO VOTE ON A SOLUTION FOR DREAMERS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, there are very few legislative days 
left this calendar year, and the House has yet to debate and vote on 
the Dream Act or any legislative proposal that would shield our 
DREAMers from deportation.
  The administration created an arbitrary deadline of March 5 before 
the DACA program begins to phase out. However, Mr. Speaker, we cannot, 
we should not, and we must not wait until the very last minute to take 
action.
  Every day that goes by, DREAMers are losing protections; they can't 
get that job they so desperately need; and they can't apply to the 
school that they want. Simply put, their lives have been put on hold.
  Mr. Speaker, Members have seen me come to the floor time after time 
to advocate for these hardworking, young Americans because I 
wholeheartedly believe that we need to get this done rapidly. The 
American people agree, and many of our colleagues from both sides of 
the aisle agree.
  So I urge each one of my colleagues to look at the ideals of 
compassion and opportunity that have long characterized our generous 
and great country and allow a vote to help our DREAMers. The time for 
Congress to take action is now.
