         GOP TAX BILL INCENTIVES: AUTOMATION OVER JOB CREATION

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address my concerns with 
the GOP tax bill.
  Calling this bill the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is simply wrong.
  Adding $1.5 trillion to our deficit and assuming--and basically 
hoping--corporations will create jobs is irresponsible. There is no 
guarantee jobs will be created and no incentive for job training. This 
is wrong.
  In America, we have a skilled trade crisis. We cannot continue to 
operate our economy and jobs without skilled trades. We must give 
incentives to invest in new technology and equipment for our 
corporations, but we must do that while demanding that they also invest 
in skilled trade training and investment.
  Tax reform was a real chance to close the skills gap, reinvest in our 
workers, and create a 21st century job training program.
