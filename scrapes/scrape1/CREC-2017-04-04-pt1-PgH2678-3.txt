          CONGRATULATING TEXAS WESLEYAN MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my alma mater, 
Texas Wesleyan University. On March 21, 2017, Texas Wesleyan's men's 
basketball team brought home their second NAIA title to Fort Worth, 
Texas. From the start, Texas Wesleyan Rams were up against a tough 
fight as they faced off with Life University in the championship match.
  Thanks to the Ram's MVP, Dion Rogers, who scored 28 points in the 
final match, and with another 21 points scored by Ryan Harris, the Rams 
were led to victory.
  But the road to the championship wasn't easy. The Rams showed true 
perseverance, heart, and dedication to win 5 games in 6 days against 
the toughest competition in the Nation.
  Congratulations to the Rams, the coaching staff, parents, families, 
and the city of Fort Worth for this hard fought victory.
  Go Rams.
  Mr. Speaker, the Rams were not the only team making Fort Worth proud. 
Just 9 days later, Texas Christian University across town also won a 
championship, and my colleague, Kay Granger, who represents west Fort 
Worth, is here to tell that story.
