                       HONORING ATHLETIC TRAINERS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, March is National Athletic 
Training Month, and I rise today to honor these healthcare 
professionals who provide care for athletes and patients, soldiers, 
workers, and performers.
  Athletic trainers are committed to providing compassionate care for 
all in work, life, and sport. Anyone who has been sidelined with an 
injury can tell you how important their athletic trainer has been in 
helping them make a full recovery.
  Athletic trainers provide medical services to all types of patients, 
not just athletes participating in sports, and can work in a variety of 
job settings. They are instrumental in relieving widespread and future 
workforce shortages in primary care support and outpatient rehab 
professions, and they provide an unparalleled range of care for the 
patients. They also improve functional outcomes and specialize in 
patient education to prevent injury or reinjury.
  As a former athlete, therapist, and rehabilitation services manager, 
I know just how valuable our athletic trainers are, and I thank them 
for the work they do to care for so many patients in various 
industries.
