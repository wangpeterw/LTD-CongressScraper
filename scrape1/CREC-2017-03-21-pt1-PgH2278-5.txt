                  THE LATEST INCARNATION OF TRUMPCARE

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, late last night, in a callous betrayal of 
the very people who elected them, Republicans hatched up the latest 
plan to deprive more than 24 million Americans of their health care. 
Let me say that again. 24 million people. In fact, perhaps more because 
we have yet to receive the CBO estimates on this latest plan.
  This incarnation of TrumpCare would freeze Medicaid expansion in its 
tracks on top of the $880 billion cut that was already in the bill. In 
my home State of Washington, this plan would put in jeopardy 600,000 
people assisted by Medicaid expansion, people who have gained access to 
critical treatments for substance abuse, diabetes, and cancer 
screenings.
  Dominic in Seattle has a son who, along with many others who suffer 
from asthma and other respiratory diseases, will not be able to afford 
his inhaler anymore. Nursing homes will shut down and throw thousands 
of grandparents out with no help. New so-called work requirements will 
add even more obstacles to healthcare coverage for our most vulnerable.
  TrumpCare will strip coverage from 24 million. It is past time for my 
colleagues to reject this pay even more for even less plan.
