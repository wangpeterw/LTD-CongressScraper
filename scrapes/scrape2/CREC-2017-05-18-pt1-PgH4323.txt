                    REMEMBERING ROXCY O'NEAL BOLTON

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise 
to recognize the beloved memory of a dear friend, Roxcy O'Neal Bolton, 
who passed away the morning of May 17.
  Roxcy was born in Mississippi and later moved to Coral Gables, 
Florida, in my congressional district, where she spent the last 53 
years of her rich and accomplished life.
  Roxcy became a champion for women everywhere. She was on the front 
lines fighting on behalf of abused women and created the first women's 
rescue shelter and the first crime watch in Florida to help curb crime 
against women. Roxcy also established the first rape treatment center 
in the country located at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, which 
serves as the model for the creation of many other such centers across 
our Nation.
  It was Roxcy's vision that helped establish The Women's Park of 
Miami-Dade County, which was later renamed after Roxcy.
  The passing of Roxcy O'Neal Bolton is a huge loss for those of us in 
south Florida; and, Mr. Speaker, it is a huge loss for women 
everywhere. We are comforted by her outstanding legacy, which will live 
forever.
  My prayers go out to her children, David, Bonnie, and Buddy, and to 
all of her loved ones during this most difficult time.
  Way to go, Roxcy. We are going to miss you forever, my friend.
