               PANDEMONIUM COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, when I was sworn in to office, I made a 
commitment to support and defend the Constitution of these United 
States. Our President's latest actions have shown us that we cannot 
trust him to do the same.
  Whether it is a lapse of judgment or just plain inexperience, the 
pandemonium coming out of the White House is worse than a scene from 
``House of Cards''
  The method in which Trump chose to reveal classified intelligence to 
Russian officials--impulsive;
  The way Trump chose to fire FBI Director Comey--imprudent;
  And, if the latest reports are true, the way Trump chose to interfere 
with the FBI investigation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn--
impeachable.
  I don't use this last ``i'' word lightly, but for love of country and 
democracy, and as an American, I hope this is not true. If it is, this 
is a blatant obstruction of justice and a grave, grave offense.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
