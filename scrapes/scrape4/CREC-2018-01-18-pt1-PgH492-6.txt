                            LOVE SAVES LIVES

  (Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my excitement that 
this body has taken a strong pro-life stance and, likewise, that this 
country is becoming increasingly pro-life.
  This is not surprising since it is a view that is plainly obvious 
that we are not talking about a clump of cells but a baby human. 
Advances in science and medicine make this more clear all the time.
  In addition to our votes this week to save babies with the necessary 
medical care when they are born alive following an abortion, tomorrow 
my office will be welcoming and hosting pro-life leaders and friends 
from Ohio's Eighth District traveling to Washington, D.C., to 
participate in this year's March for Life.
  I am proud to participate tomorrow in the march where we will seek to 
get out the message that love saves lives. Since Roe v. Wade, nearly 60 
million babies with all their potential have had their lives tragically 
cut short. I look forward to the day when love and sound science 
finally put an end to abortion.
