      WILLIE O'REE SHOULD BE INDUCTED INTO THE HOCKEY HALL OF FAME

  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago, Willie O'Ree broke the color 
barrier in professional hockey, all while overcoming racial slurs, 
doubt, and blindness in his right eye.
  Often referred to as the Jackie Robinson of hockey, Willie has been a 
trusted champion for diversity, a proponent of inclusion, and an 
inspiration for so many young players both off and on the ice.
  Each February, we celebrate Black History Month as well as Hockey is 
for Everyone Month, and no one embodies both of those tributes as 
profoundly as living legend Willie O'Ree.
  He is as humble as he is inspiring, often reminding fans that he only 
played in the NHL for 45 games, and while that may be true, he changed 
the game forever.
  There are few players worthier of being inducted into the Hockey Hall 
of Fame, and it is long overdue that Willie's name be added to that 
list.
  As the Hockey Hall of Fame continues to accept and review nominee 
submissions before the March 15 deadline, I want to remind everyone of 
the countless ways Willie strengthened and supported this sport.
  I thank him for his continued efforts to increase access for all 
people of all backgrounds to get out on the ice and play the greatest 
game.
