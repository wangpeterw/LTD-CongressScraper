                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Gracious and merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  In this Chamber where the people's House gathers, we pause to offer 
You gratitude for the gift of this good land on which we live and for 
this great Nation which You have inspired in developing over so many 
years.
  Our Nation prepares for the ritual transfer of power, celebrated with 
the inauguration of our 45th President. Bless us all this week. Give to 
us and all people a vivid sense of Your presence, that we may learn to 
understand each other, to respect each other, to work with each other, 
to live with each other, and to do good to each other. So shall we make 
our Nation great in goodness and good in its greatness.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
