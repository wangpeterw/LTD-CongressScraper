  RECOGNIZING THE BUCKS COUNTY OPPORTUNITY COUNCIL, COMMUNITY ACTION 
                                 AGENCY

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Bucks 
County Opportunity Council, Community Action Agency, which serves low-
income families throughout Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and its economic 
self-sufficiency program, which recently graduated its 300th family 
from poverty.
  This individualized program works with families to end the cycle of 
poverty by building a plan of action and working with a coach to attain 
new training and education. To graduate, participants in the program 
must be free from welfare subsidies, have secured employment, live in 
safe and affordable housing, have access to safe and reliable 
transportation, maintain a balanced budget, and have a healthcare plan 
for their entire family.
  Mr. Speaker, this program is working. Aside from the total number of 
graduates, last year's class of families have more than tripled their 
salaries. Moreover, in our community, every dollar invested nets nearly 
$5 saved in cash welfare subsidies.
  I am proud to stand with the Bucks County Opportunity Council in 
their mission to reduce poverty and partner with our community to 
promote economic self-sufficiency. Our community is a better place 
because of their work.
