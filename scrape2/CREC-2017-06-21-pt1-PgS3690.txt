SENATE RESOLUTION 197--TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TIME FOR LEGISLATION TO BE 
                                  READ

  Mr. PAUL submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Rules and Administration:

                              S. Res. 197

       Resolved, That (a) it shall not be in order for the Senate 
     to consider any bill, resolution, message, conference report, 
     amendment between the Houses, amendment, treaty, or any other 
     measure or matter until 1 session day has passed since 
     introduction for every 20 pages included in the measure or 
     matter in the usual form plus 1 session day for any number of 
     remaining pages less than 20 in the usual form.
       (b)(1) Any Senator may raise a point of order that 
     consideration of any bill, resolution, message, conference 
     report, amendment, treaty, or any other measure or matter is 
     not in order under subsection (a). No motion to table the 
     point of order shall be in order.
       (2) Paragraph (1) may be waived or suspended only by an 
     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen 
     and sworn. All motions to waive under this paragraph shall be 
     debatable collectively for not to exceed 3 hours equally 
     divided between the Senator raising the point of order and 
     the Senator moving to waive the point of order or their 
     designees. A motion to waive the point of order shall not be 
     amendable.
       (3) This resolution is enacted pursuant to the power 
     granted to each House of Congress to determine the Rules of 
     its Proceedings in clause 2 of section 5 of article I of the 
     Constitution of the United States.
