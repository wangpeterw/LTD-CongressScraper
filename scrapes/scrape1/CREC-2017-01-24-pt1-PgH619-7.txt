                    THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL CHOICE

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, this week marks National 
School Choice Week, an opportunity to recognize the importance of 
providing families choice in education.

  As the husband of a retired schoolteacher and the grateful father of 
four sons and eight grandchildren, I know firsthand the benefit of 
school choice. We should strive for education that recognizes the 
individual needs of our students.
  Last week, I was appreciative to visit schools to experience school 
choice at work. I visited a charter school, a public school, and a 
homeschool group. Thank you to Mark Brown, principal of Horse Creek 
Academy in Aiken; to Dr. Bill Coon, principal of Meadow Glen Middle 
School in Lexington; and Wendy Hoyle, the president of the Aiken Area 
Home Educators. You make a remarkable difference for students.
  I believe that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will make a very 
positive difference in the tradition of Education Superintendent Molly 
Spearman of South Carolina.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
