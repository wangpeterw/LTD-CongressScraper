         HONORING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOOD STAMP ACT OF 1977

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, today I honor the anniversary of the Food 
Stamp Act of 1977.
  Tomorrow, the program we know as SNAP--the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program--turns 40. We also know that before the 
implementation of SNAP, families couldn't afford healthy meals and kids 
were going to school on empty stomachs.
  Today, thanks to this program, over 18,000 families in my district on 
the central coast of California count on SNAP benefits to put food on 
their tables at home and help their children feed their minds at their 
schools.
  In my district, the number one industry is agriculture. We ship our 
many fresh fruits and vegetables all over the country and to even other 
parts of the world. As a representative of this area, it is my goal and 
it is my responsibility to make sure that the families in my district 
have access to the same nutritious produce that is grown in our 
backyard.
  As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, under the leadership 
of Chairman Conaway, I look forward to working on the 2018 farm bill 
with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle so that we can support 
strong investments in SNAP. By doing that, we will support stronger 
families and a stronger future.
