                WELCOMING REVEREND DR. MICHAEL W. WATERS

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie 
Bernice Johnson) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to 
host Reverend Waters as our guest chaplain today.
  Reverend Waters is a true community servant and a man of God. He is 
the founding pastor of Joy Tabernacle African Methodist Episcopal 
Church--AME--of Dallas, Texas.
  Reverend Waters is a pastor, a professor, an award-winning author, a 
community leader, and a social commentator. Reverend Waters' words of 
hope and empowerment inspire national and international audiences.
  As a notable friend of the community, Reverend Waters served as a 
keynote speaker at my Annual Dallas Prayer Breakfast this year. His 
engaging personality and purposeful speech captivated the attention of 
all those who attended.
  As a strong leader, Reverend Waters is able to understand the unique 
needs of our community. He knows no stranger when he walks into the 
room, and his charismatic nature allows him to connect with everyone he 
meets.
  It is my pleasure that he has come today to be our guest chaplain. 
May God continue to bless him.
