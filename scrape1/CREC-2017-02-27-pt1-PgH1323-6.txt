                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  You sent Your prophet Isaiah to Your people when they were in need of 
hope and vision. May Isaiah's prophetic words guide us still.
  Send Your spirit upon this Nation and this Congress that we may be 
open to hearing Your word and actively seek the salvation You alone can 
bring.
  Make of us a people of compassion and holiness. In pursuing the 
avenues of justice for all, may we be a sign to the community of 
nations.
  Help us to work toward the complete fulfillment of the deepest human 
hopes and Your inspiriting promises. With humility let us embrace our 
calling: to be truly prophetic, as Your servants of old, by earnestly 
fulfilling Your commands now and forever.
  Lord, bless the Members of the people's House today and all days, and 
may all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
