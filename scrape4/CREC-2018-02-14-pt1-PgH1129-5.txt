                          SALUTING LEWIS WOOD

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, new Boy Scouts make a promise to do their best 
to do their duty to God and country and to help other people at all 
times.
  Mr. Lewis Wood from Stokes County, North Carolina, has not only 
fulfilled that promise, he has lived it to the fullest. Mr. Wood joined 
the Boy Scouts of America in January 1943. Later, he served as a 
volunteer and Scoutmaster for Troop 440 for 50 years.
  When Mr. Wood and his family were recently informed of his pancreatic 
cancer diagnosis, he was focused on living until this January, the 75th 
anniversary of his becoming a Scout. What an admirable spirit and a 
wonderful man. After a lifetime of service, Mr. Wood is now preparing 
for his next journey.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Wood for his 75 years of dedication to the 
Boy Scouts and Stokes County.
