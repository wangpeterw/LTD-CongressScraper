                      HONORING DR. NEHEMIAH DAVIS

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the 
life of a dedicated civil rights leader and pastor, Dr. Nehemiah Davis.
  Pastor Davis faithfully served the Mount Pisgah Baptist Church on 
Evans Avenue in Fort Worth, Texas, on the south side, for over 50 
years. Along with serving as a spiritual leader in my hometown, Mr. 
Davis served as the president of the National Missionary Baptist 
Convention of America, where he supported churches nationwide.
  Pastor Davis' dedication to the community eventually led to his 
induction into the Religious Hall of Fame and the recognition by the 
Boy Scouts of America with a Distinguished Service Award.
  Dr. Davis not only believed in nurturing spiritual growth, but fought 
for the equality of all Americans. He fought fearlessly on behalf of 
the African-American community and led the local NAACP chapter for over 
20 years.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Nehemiah Davis' life 
of service.
