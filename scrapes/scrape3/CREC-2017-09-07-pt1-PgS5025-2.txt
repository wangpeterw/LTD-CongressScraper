                   THANKING THE SENATOR FROM FLORIDA

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, let me thank my friend from 
Florida for his kind words.
  During these troubled times in the State of Florida--and we hope and 
pray that Irma will not do too much damage, although signs point in the 
other direction--the people of Florida could not have a stronger, more 
effective, more compassionate advocate than the Senator from Florida, 
Mr. Nelson. He knows how to get things done, and he knows how to inform 
people about what is going on. He is able to reach across the aisle, in 
a bipartisan way, to help in all times but, particularly, in times of 
need.
  The people of Florida are lucky to have him as their Senator, 
particularly at this moment, I would say to my dear friend Bill Nelson.
