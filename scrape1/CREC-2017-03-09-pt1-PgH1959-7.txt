                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
deep concern with the proposal put forward by my Republican colleagues 
to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Most Americans want to increase access to health care, lower costs, 
and cover more Americans; but this bill, TrumpCare, will increase 
costs, limit access, and cover fewer Americans.
  This plan will cut Medicaid, which has helped literally tens of 
thousands of people in my State--in the Granite State--access health 
insurance for the first time.
  It has increased treatment and recovery services for those struggling 
with substance use disorder.
  We, like many States across this country, are grappling with a heroin 
epidemic. People are dying in my district from heroin overdoses and the 
fatal synthetic fentanyl. For the first time, they have access to 
health care. They have access to drug treatment. They have access to 
recovery services. And yet this bill will pull the rug out from 
underneath these Granite Staters and their families.
  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
