       MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR OF JAIDEN BARTEE AND TORI PEREZ

  (Mr. GARRETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me today as we remember 
the lives of Jaiden Bartee and Tori Perez, ages 5 and 6 years old, who, 
as they stood with their mothers waiting for the schoolbus on the 
morning of March 30, were struck down and taken from this world far too 
soon by a passing truck.
  Mr. Speaker, Members, there is no Scripture, no words, no thought 
poignant enough to address the loss of these mothers, of the Buckingham 
County, Virginia, community, of humanity of these two lives; but in 
what is the best effort that I can make, I ask that all of my 
colleagues and these Members of the Virginia delegation who join me to 
join in a moment of silence to recognize these two young people.
