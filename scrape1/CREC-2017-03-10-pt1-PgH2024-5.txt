                  TRUMPCARE IS DESTRUCTIVE LEGISLATION

  (Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, President Trump and the Republican 
Congress promised a better plan for health care that would be good for 
all Americans.
  Now that we have seen their plan, we know the truth. Passage of the 
American Health Care Act will not improve health care or reduce 
healthcare costs. Instead, it will cut critical health access and 
benefits for children, older adults, pregnant women, communities of 
color, and people living with disabilities.
  If TrumpCare becomes law, it will destroy Medicaid as we know it, 
while also increasing costs of health care for working class families 
across the country.
  It is unconscionable that this kind of destructive legislation should 
be shoved through Congress without hearings or stakeholder input.
  I urge my Republican colleagues to reject this shortsighted bill and 
work with Democrats to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, a healthcare 
plan that is working well for millions of Americans.
