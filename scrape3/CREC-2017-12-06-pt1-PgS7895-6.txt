            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous 
consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in 
consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to 
executive session for consideration of Calendar No. 167, the nomination 
of Susan Bodine to be an Assistant Administrator of EPA. I further ask 
that there be 30 minutes of debate on the nomination, equally divided 
in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, 
the Senate vote on confirmation with no intervening action or debate, 
and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the 
Senate's action.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
