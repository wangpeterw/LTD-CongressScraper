                      AMERICAN GROWN FLOWER MONTH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Carbajal) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, today I proudly introduce bipartisan 
legislation to recognize July as American Grown Flower Month. I have 
seen firsthand the value of the grown flower industry playing an 
important role in our economy and community during my visits with our 
Central Coast growers in my district.
  California produces three-quarters of all cut flowers grown here in 
the United States. This generates thousands of jobs across our State 
and drives a staggering $1.13 billion in the economic activity each 
year.
  Whether it is celebrating Mother's Day, a birthday, or a graduation, 
flowers have been used to mark special occasions dating back thousands 
of years.
  I am committed to recognizing this industry's remarkable contribution 
to our country by designating July as American Grown Flower Month. We 
officially celebrate the incomparable beauty flowers bring to our homes 
and to our celebrations year round.
  I also want to urge the White House to consider having American 
flowers in the White House for all occasions.
