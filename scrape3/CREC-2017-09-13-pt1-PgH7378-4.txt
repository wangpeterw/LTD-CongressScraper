                                  DACA

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my profound 
disappointment in the President's decision to repeal the DACA program.
  This repeal is destroying the lives of nearly 800,000 young people. 
In my home State of Washington, there are over 17,000 Washingtonians 
who have been granted this deferred action status. One of them is 
Larissa Reza Garcia who came to the United States when she was 3 years 
old. Larissa works with underrepresented young people to connect them 
with opportunities to pursue their dreams within the education system. 
DREAMers like Larissa strengthen the fabric of our country.
  Mr. Speaker, I also want to express my disappointment that the House 
will take up H.R. 3697 tomorrow, a bill that would promote racial 
profiling, expand mandatory detention, and criminalize immigrants 
without any due process protections.
  We should be voting on the Dream Act, not legislation to criminalize 
immigrants. We have the votes to pass the Dream Act if it were brought 
to the floor, and I hope and call upon Speaker Ryan to have the courage 
to bring it to the floor
