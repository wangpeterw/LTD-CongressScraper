  Chaplain Robert Vick, American Legion National Chaplain, New Port 
Richey, Florida, offered the following prayer:

[[Page H1275]]

  Almighty God, our Father, we humbly ask Your blessings on our 
government and all our representatives gathered here today. We humbly 
ask Your blessing, Your wisdom, and protection for our country and for 
our flag, the symbol of our freedom and our home. Keep us always aware 
of the heritage which is ours and the freedom and opportunities we 
enjoy as Americans.
  As we bow before You, may we pledge anew in our hearts and on our 
lips to preserve this country, its citizens, and our way of life. May 
we continue our commitment to You and to our fellow man. May we not 
take that small step from tolerance to tyranny in our deliberations.
  May we keep foremost in our thoughts the welfare and the success of 
our great Nation and work together to solve our differences. May we 
emulate the great men and women of the past, who, through sacrifice, 
purchased our freedoms. Aid us to commit ourselves to preserving them.
  I pray this prayer in the name of God, before whom every knee shall 
ultimately bow and every tongue confess that You are Lord and God.
  Amen. And amen.
