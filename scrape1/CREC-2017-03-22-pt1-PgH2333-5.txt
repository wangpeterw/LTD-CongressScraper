                           OPPOSING TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against 
TrumpCare.
  TrumpCare will take health insurance away from 24 million Americans. 
That is basically the amount of people that live in the State of Texas.
  For the lucky ones who don't have their health care ripped away, 
TrumpCare forces families to pay increased out-of-pocket costs and 
higher deductibles and cuts the financial assistance they get today to 
afford their insurance.
  It has a crushing age tax. TrumpCare forces Americans who are aged 50 
to 64 to pay premiums five times higher than younger people pay for 
health insurance.
  This, combined with a slash in financial assistance to help people 
pay for coverage, will literally mean that there will be people who now 
have to pay more for their premiums annually than they actually earn in 
a year. That is unacceptable.
  TrumpCare cuts Medicare and will shorten the life of the program by 3 
years. It is hard to find someone this bill helps, but the people that 
it will hurt can be counted in the millions.
  I urge my colleagues to vote against this horrible plan and to work 
with us to expand access and lower cost.
