      RISING IN SUPPORT OF THE BORN-ALIVE SURVIVORS PROTECTION ACT

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4712, the 
Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of 
this important pro-life legislation.
  The Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act is a simple but critical bill 
to strengthen the protections for babies who survive abortion. It 
ensures that these precious babies are provided with the same degree of 
medical care that any other child would receive in order to save their 
life.
  We all expect doctors and nurses to follow their oath to help and 
heal. This bill simply codifies that expectation into law for babies 
who survive abortion and deserve a chance at life.
  Just think about this. Right now we are debating whether a living, 
breathing baby should be given a chance to live. I know that my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree that these babies deserve 
our compassion, and most importantly, our protection, and I hope they 
will join in me in supporting this important legislation.
