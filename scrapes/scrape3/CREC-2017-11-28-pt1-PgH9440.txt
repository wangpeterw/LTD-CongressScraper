                   HONORING POLICE OFFICER BRIAN SHAW

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from 
Pennsylvania for his remarks regarding Officer Shaw.
  The Book of Wisdom teaches that ``the souls of the just are in the 
hands of God, and no torment shall touch them.''
  The family and friends of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, Police 
Officer Brian Shaw today must trust in that Scripture as they continue 
to grieve his loss.
  Officer Shaw was only 25 years old when he was taken in an act of 
senseless violence, but in his short life, he learned a great deal, and 
what he learned allowed him to give even more.
  Brian Shaw knew his vocation, to serve as a police officer and, as he 
said, to make a difference. His former supervisor, Frazer Township 
Police Chief Terry Kuhns, recalled that when Brian gave that answer 
during his job interview, he knew he meant it as he looked in his eyes 
and his smile.
  Perhaps what Chief Kuhns saw in Brian were virtues our world 
desperately needs more of: authenticity and sincerity. Those virtues 
contributed to what New Kensington Police Chief Jim Klein described as 
Brian's incredible passion for his work.
  To Brian's parents and family, you raised him right. May Brian Shaw, 
a just man, evermore rest in the hands of God.
