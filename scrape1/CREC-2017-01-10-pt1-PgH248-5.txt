          ELK COUNTY CATHOLIC STUDENTS PERFORM AT PEARL HARBOR

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
seven Elk County Catholic High School band students who performed on 
December 7 at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for the 75th anniversary of the 
tragic attacks that brought the United States into World War II. This 
anniversary marks one of the major milestones, which may be one of the 
few opportunities for survivors of the attacks to participate.
  Elk County Catholic represented the Commonwealth, alongside the 
survivors of the USS Pennsylvania, one of the eight battleships in 
Pearl Harbor on that fateful day in 1941.
  I am so proud of how the students paid tribute to World War II 
veterans who served at Pearl Harbor and all of the military men and 
women that fought for our Nation.
  This event was especially close to the heart of baritone saxophone 
player, Luke Ferragine, whose grandfather is a World War II veteran. 
Also performing in the honor band was Emily Miller, Kendra Smithbauer, 
Holly Kim, Andrew Wingard, Simon Glatt, and Nathan Schlosser. 
Congratulations to each of them.
