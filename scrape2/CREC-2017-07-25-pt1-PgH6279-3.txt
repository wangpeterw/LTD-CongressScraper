    THANKING ELLEN MURPHY AND KATIE ORREL FOR THEIR SERVICE AT STAR 
                               FOUNDATION

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. 
Ellen Murphy and Ms. Katie Orrel, who will retire at the end of the 
year after more than 40 combined years of volunteer service at the 
Southern Technology Advocacy Research Foundation, known as STAR, in 
Brunswick, Georgia.
  Ms. Murphy and Ms. Orrel created the STAR Foundation in 1997 to help 
area citizens gain meaningful and rewarding employment opportunities 
through career training classes. The training classes at STAR include 
how to balance a checkbook, to use a computer, and how to write a 
resume.
  Ms. Orrel teaches personal financial management and interviewing 
skills, and pushes her students to do their very best every day. At the 
same time, Ms. Murphy has been the executive director at STAR since its 
inception over

20 years ago, and has done a great job to grow the organization and 
reach more students.
  I would like to thank Ms. Murphy and Ms. Orrel once more for helping 
south Georgians to advance their careers.
