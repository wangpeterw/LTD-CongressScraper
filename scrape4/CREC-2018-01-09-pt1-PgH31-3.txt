                          MEDIA POSITIVE NEWS

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, the media's daily barrage of 
negative stories have undermined the public's confidence in their 
reporting. The media continues to ignore positive stories about the 
President's effective policies.
  If the media were not so biased against the President, more of the 
American people would know the following:
  The 4.1 percent unemployment rate for the entire country is the 
lowest it has been in 17 years;
  Latino and African-American unemployment numbers are the lowest in 
decades;
  The stock market has broken numerous records, adding significant 
value to Americans' investment and retirement accounts;
  The economy is growing at 3.3 percent, the fastest in years;
  Consumer confidence is at a 17-year high.
  The liberal media should report the facts, even if they make the 
President look good.
