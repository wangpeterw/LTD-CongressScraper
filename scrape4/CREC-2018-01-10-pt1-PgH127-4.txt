                         RECOGNIZING TOM BARTON

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
longtime editorial page editor of the Savannah Morning News, Mr. Tom 
Barton, who officially retired on January 5, after 39 years of service.
  He began his time in Savannah writing for the former Savannah Evening 
Press covering crime and police stories. His first stories included a 
murder trial of an elderly woman and a man who violated city code by 
killing a chicken and leaving its remnants on city sidewalks.
  These stories quickly taught Mr. Barton lessons in journalism while 
his gripping, clear, and insightful writing helped him become an 
influential and trusted writer and editor in Savannah.
  Since those first stories, he has covered the most important topics 
in Savannah over the past decades, including interviews with the 
infamous Jim Williams, photos of running back Herschel Walker, and 
stories about political elections.
  Mr. Barton not only knows the unique character of Savannah better 
than anyone in our area, but he has also contributed greatly to its 
development over the last 39 years.
  His regular contributions to the Savannah Morning News will be 
missed. I thank him for his dedication to making Savannah a better 
place to live.
