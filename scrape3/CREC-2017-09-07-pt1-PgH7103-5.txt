           RECOGNIZING CLARION UNIVERSITY'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Clarion University of Pennsylvania as it celebrates 150 years.
  In 1859, the people of Clarion County created a proposal for a higher 
education institution in Clarion. Shortly after, the Civil War erupted 
and disrupted the Nation, but it did not stop the determination of the 
Clarion people.
  On September 10, 1867, Clarion University was founded as the Carrier 
Seminary of western Pennsylvania. With no facilities to call home, 
Carrier Seminary operated as a co-educational program in the old 
academy building, with Reverend James G. Townsend as principal.
  Carrier Seminary then became Clarion State Normal School in 1887. In 
1915, the Commonwealth purchased the school, and it became a technical 
school of junior college rank in 1920.
  It opened its doors as a college-level institution in 1929. Since 
then, Clarion's student body has grown to more than 5,000, its programs 
have received top level accreditation, and the institution has become a 
part of Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Clarion University on reaching this 
milestone, and I join all in celebrating its rich history and 
contributions to our area.
