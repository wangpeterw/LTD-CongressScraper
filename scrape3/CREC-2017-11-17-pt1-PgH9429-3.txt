                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Send Your spirit of peace and calm, that all might have confidence in 
Your faithfulness to us, and that no matter what lies ahead, Your grace 
is abundantly available.
  Now we approach a week during which all Americans will gather to 
remember who we are, a nation generously blessed not only by You, our 
God, but by courageous ancestors, faithful allies, and the best good 
wishes of people everywhere who long for freedom, who would glory in 
the difficult work of participative government, and who do not enjoy 
the bounty we are privileged to possess.
  Bless the Members of this assembly, and us all, that we would be 
worthy of the call we have been given as Americans. Help us all to be 
truly thankful and appropriately generous in our response.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
