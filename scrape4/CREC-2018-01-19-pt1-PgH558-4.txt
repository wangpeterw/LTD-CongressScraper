         NORTHAMPTON TOWNSHIP NAMED ONE OF THE 25 SAFEST CITIES

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Northampton 
Township in my district in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for being named 
the safest community in Pennsylvania.
  Northampton rose to the top of the list of 25 safest cities with over 
39,000 residents with a score of 90.97, the top fifth percentile in the 
entire Nation. The rankings are run by SafeHome, a professional 
security organization dedicated to making communities safer.
  This recognition would not have been possible without the dedicated 
work of the entire Northampton Township Police Department and the 
leadership of Police Chief Mike Clark. Every day, these men and women 
put their lives on the line to protect their family, their friends, and 
their neighbors.
  Quoting Chief Clark, who said it best:

       It is not just us; it is working hand in hand with our 
     residents, our administration and our board of supervisors, 
     our fire department, our rescue squads, our school district. 
     It is everyone working together that makes this a great place 
     to live.

  Well said, Chief Clark. We are so proud of the emergency services, 
governmental officials, and residents of Northampton Township. A job 
well done.
