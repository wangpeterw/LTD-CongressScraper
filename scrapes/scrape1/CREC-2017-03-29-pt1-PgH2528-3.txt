                       RECOGNIZING THERESA LOPEZ

  (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Theresa Lopez from 
Madera, California. Theresa was chosen by my office to be March's 
Heroine of the Month for the 17th Congressional District.
  For nearly 10 years, Theresa has served as a veterans service 
representative at the Madera Veterans Service Office. Theresa 
understands that our valley veterans and their families deserve the 
best care and service that they can have because the men and women who 
have served our Nation's military, members of your family and members 
of my family, have made sacrifices that we should never, ever forget.
  Theresa knows. She's been working with my office since 2008, and I 
know that she works hard every day to ensure that local veterans are 
receiving the VA benefits they have earned.
  Theresa also does outreach to the Chowchilla State men's prison and 
the VA community-based clinic in Oakhurst, and she is a member of the 
county veterans court. She has also served as secretary of the 
California Association of County Veterans Service Officers since 2012.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the service of Theresa 
Lopez and her strong commitment to serving valley veterans, for we can 
never, ever say thank you enough not only for our veterans, but for the 
good work that Theresa has done.
  God bless her, and God bless the United States of America.
