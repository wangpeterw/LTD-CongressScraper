                   COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause 
of death for men and women combined. It is a silent killer because the 
disease often has no signs or symptoms. Each year, more than 50,000 
Americans die from colorectal cancer even though it is mostly 
preventable and treatable if caught early.
  Six years ago today, my father, the late Congressman Donald Payne, 
died from colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer screening just wasn't 
something people of his generation did.
  Mr. Speaker, my father might have lived had he gotten tested for 
colorectal cancer. That is why each year I sponsor a resolution to 
recognize March as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, a time 
to educate the public about the disease and the need for screening.
  By educating people, increasing research funding, and making Medicare 
coverage better for seniors, we can save tens of thousands of lives 
each year.
  I would rather not have to make this 1-minute speech every year, to 
have my father still be a Member of Congress from the 10th 
Congressional District.
