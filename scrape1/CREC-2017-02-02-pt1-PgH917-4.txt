                   REMEMBERING THOMAS J. MAHONEY, JR.

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Mr. 
Thomas J. Mahoney, Jr. of Savannah, Georgia, a highly-respected local 
attorney and community leader. He passed away on January 20 at 80 years 
of age.

  Mr. Mahoney graduated from Savannah's Benedictine Military School in 
1954 and earned his law degree from the University of South Carolina.
  In his first career after college, he worked as an FBI Special Agent 
in Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington. During this time, Mr. Mahoney 
met the love of his life, Judy, with whom he had four children.
  After 2 years in the FBI, Mr. Mahoney returned to Savannah and joined 
the law firm Mahoney & Cole, P.C. Through his hard work and 
determination, he worked up the ranks to become its president and CEO.
  He used his legal knowledge to make coastal Georgia a better place to 
live, serving as the Chatham County attorney, city attorney for Tybee 
Island, judge for Tybee Island, and assistant city attorney for 
Savannah. He also served as the special assistant attorney general for 
the Georgia Ports Authority since 1987, helping it to grow to its 
current, impressive size.
  Thank you, Mr. Mahoney, for everything you have done for the Savannah 
community. You will be missed.
