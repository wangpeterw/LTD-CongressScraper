  RECOGNIZING SOCIAL SCIENTISTS FROM THE CONSORTIUM OF SOCIAL SCIENCE 
                              ASSOCIATIONS

  (Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the 80 social 
scientists from the Consortium of Social Science Associations, who are 
visiting Washington, D.C., today, and to thank them for their hard work 
keeping our STEM enterprise strong.
  They are here to highlight the value of social science research to 
the Nation, and to support funding for the social, behavioral, and 
economic sciences in the National Science Foundation budget.
  Social science research has provided us with numerous benefits. Some 
of these include: strengthening cybersecurity by showing us how changes 
in behavior can eliminate cyber vulnerabilities; making our soldiers 
safer by working with the Army to improve its cross-cultural training; 
and saving lives by improving the system of matching kidney donors with 
patients.
  Madam Speaker, we must have strong Federal funding for social science 
research. Cuts would make America weaker, not greater.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose any cuts to social science funding in 
the NSF budget.
