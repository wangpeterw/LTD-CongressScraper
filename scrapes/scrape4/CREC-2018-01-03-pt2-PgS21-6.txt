                    TRIBUTE TO LINDA CLOUTIER-NAMDAR

 Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, today I would like to recognize 
and honor a remarkable Vermonter, Linda Cloutier-Namdar, who is the 
recipient of Vermont's 2018 Teacher of the Year Award.
  Linda Cloutier-Namdar has taught ninth grade core at Essex High 
School since its inception, helping set a supportive tone during the 
critical transition period into high school. She is also a class 
adviser, serves on a number of school committees, partakes in school 
literacy initiatives, and is a member of the districtwide English 
Language Arts Vertical Team.
  Linda's love of teaching extends outside of the classroom as well, 
through her work with the Flynn Theater for the Performing Arts as a 
teacher leader, the Essex Westford Education Association, and the 
Vermont Writing Collaborative.
  The 2018 Teacher of the Year Award is a fitting testament to Linda's 
efforts in and out of the classroom and to her dedication to her 
students' academic success. She has had an enormously positive impact 
on countless young people in our State and has earned the respect of 
her colleagues, students, and community through her unwavering 
commitment to students' personal and intellectual growth.
  I would like to offer Linda Cloutier-Namdar my warmest 
congratulations on this well-deserved award. Vermont is honored to have 
Linda represent our
