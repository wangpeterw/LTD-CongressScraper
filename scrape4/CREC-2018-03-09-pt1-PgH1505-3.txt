                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Peoples Church, Jacksonville, Texas, 
offered the following prayer:
  Heavenly Father, how grateful we are for the opportunity that prayer 
provides: to find grace and mercy in our times of need.
  For Your law is perfect, O Lord, converting the soul, making wise the 
simple, teach us Thy statutes that our eyes may be enlightened.
  For Your judgments are true and righteous, let us desire them above 
silver and gold.
  For by Your words we are warned and in keeping Your commandments 
there is great reward, show us the error of our ways and reveal our 
secret sins, O Lord. Let them not have dominion over us.
  Cause us to walk uprightly toward our neighbors for all the law is 
fulfilled in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
  But if we bite and devour one another, we shall be consumed one of 
another.
  So let our words always be gracious, O Lord.
  In Jesus' name, amen.
