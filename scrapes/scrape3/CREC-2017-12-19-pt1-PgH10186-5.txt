                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  In the waning days of the first session of the 115th Congress, help 
the Members of the House, and those of the Senate, to act wisely and 
carefully in the important work they do.
  And as our Nation passes through this holy season for millions of 
Americans, may there be good will in our communities and peace and 
reconciliation where those virtues are so sorely needed.
  May all that is done within the people's House be for Your greater 
honor and glory.
  Amen.
