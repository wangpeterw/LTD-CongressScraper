      CONGRATULATING MICHELLE BAUER ON WINNING FIRST PLACE IN THE 
          PENNSYLVANIA MUNICIPAL LEAGUE'S ANNUAL ESSAY CONTEST

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
a St. Marys Area High School student for winning first place in the 
Pennsylvania Municipal League's annual essay contest.
  Michelle Bauer, a senior at St. Marys Area High School, is the 
recipient of a $2,000 scholarship for taking home the top prize at the 
Pennsylvania Municipal League's 118th annual summit, which took place 
earlier this month at Erie's Bayfront Convention Center.
  This year's essay theme was: Civics and you.
  Contest participants were asked to elaborate on this theme by writing 
about opportunities in their community that allows for civic engagement 
and encourage citizens to volunteer locally.
  Mr. Speaker, I know that civic involvement is something that we can 
all agree is important to the quality of life in all of our 
communities.
  The mission of the Pennsylvania Municipal League is to strengthen, 
empower, and advocate for effective local government. It is a 
nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that was established in 1900 to 
advocate for Pennsylvania's third class cities.
  I congratulate Michelle Bauer on her first place finish and wish her 
all the best in her future endeavors.
