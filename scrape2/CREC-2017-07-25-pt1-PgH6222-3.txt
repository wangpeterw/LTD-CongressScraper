                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Lonnie Mitchell, Sr., Bethel African Methodist Episcopal 
Church, Spokane, Washington, offered the following prayer:
  O Lord God, pour out Your presence and Your power upon this opening 
session of the U.S. House of Representatives. Please empower our 
leaders to deliberate, collaborate, and, when necessary, compromise for 
the good of our Nation.
  As President Lincoln said: With malice toward none, with charity for 
all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let 
this Congress strive on to finish the work they are in, to bind up the 
Nation's wounds . . . to do all which may achieve and cherish a just 
and lasting peace among everybody and with all nations.
  God, we the people in the land of the free and the home of the brave 
desperately need You now and forevermore. O that You would bless this 
session and the leaders in this House and all branches of our 
government.
  Respectful of all faiths, in Jesus the Christ I pray.
  Amen.
