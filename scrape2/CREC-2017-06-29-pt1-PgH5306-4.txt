                 SANCTUARY CITIES UNDERMINE FEDERAL LAW

  (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. So-called sanctuary cities 
have become a safe haven for illegal immigrants who have committed 
crimes. They undermine Federal law and put the safety of law-abiding 
citizens at risk.
  Kate Steinle was murdered in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant 
who had seven felonies and had been deported five times. Where was 
Kate's sanctuary?
  We are a country of laws, and we must enforce them and hold 
accountable anyone who violates them.
  Sarah Root was killed by an illegal immigrant, street racing drunk. 
Grant Ronnebeck was murdered in cold blood by working the nightshift at 
a convenience store.
  Mr. Speaker, no family should ever have to go through what these 
families have faced.
  Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act will help protect 
our communities and help protect families from these senseless and 
preventable tragedies.
