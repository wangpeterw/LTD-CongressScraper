  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful in unity 
with the thousands of dedicated citizens traveling to Washington this 
week for the 45th annual March for Life. The vision is of a world where 
every life is valued and protected. It is one I support every day in 
Congress.
  Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to meet with Ryan Bomberger 
in Columbia. Although Ryan's biological mother was raped, she chose 
life for Ryan and gave him an opportunity to grow up in a loving, 
adopted family. His witness and success demonstrate the importance of 
ensuring that the unborn have an opportunity for a fulfilling life.
  I also appreciate the commitment and enthusiasm of the South Carolina 
Citizens for Life executive director, Holly Gatling. Through her hard 
work and the efforts from the South Carolina Citizens for Life team, 
hundreds of people, including myself, gathered at the statehouse steps 
this month for the Stand Up for Life Rally with Bishop Robert 
Guglielmone of Charleston and Attorney General Alan Wilson.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Congratulations to Republicans Nancy Mace of Charleston and Ashley 
Trantham of Greenville for their elections to the South Carolina House 
of Representatives.
