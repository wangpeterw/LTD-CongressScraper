                            FEDERAL WORKERS

  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend jobs.
  In my region, Federal workers at Olympic National Park, which brings 
millions of visitors to our area, help that park run smoothly. They 
provide needed health services and care for our veterans at local VA 
facilities. Federal workers serve our Nation and help our sailors and 
submariners be safe through their work at the Puget Sound Naval 
Shipyard, which has been operating for 125 years.
  We should have admiration and respect for the work they do. I don't 
think that this Chamber did right by them this week. That is because 
the

House approved a rule that would allow any Member to add an amendment 
to spending bills to cut Federal jobs and lower the pay of workers.
  These workers shouldn't be unfairly singled out on the House floor. 
This is not the way to do business. Having worked in the private 
sector, you would never see a successful employer treat their employees 
with the disrespect that Congress treats the Federal workforce.
  It is time to tell everyone at that shipyard, at the park, at the VA, 
and all Federal workers in my region and throughout this country that 
Congress respects and honors the work that they do. It is time to do 
away with this rule.
