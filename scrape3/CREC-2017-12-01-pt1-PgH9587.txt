                             WATER IS LIFE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, when the sun barely peeks over the 
sky, millions of women and children across the developing world wake up 
and make their daily, dangerous walk in search of the necessity of 
life: water.
  They walk for miles in water-scarce regions to a well or polluted 
river for water. During these long walks, they are often put at risk of 
sexual abuse and assault. Also, bad guys control the wells and abuse 
women in return for the sometimes polluted water.
  The time-consuming search for water results in rape, pregnancy, child 
kidnapping, and high educational dropout rates. Access to water, 
sanitation, and hygiene prevents disease. It also improves the safety 
and security of women and children across the entire world.
  It is encouraging to see our Nation and Congress recognizing water as 
the global security crisis that it is and the need to build capacity to 
clean water. With our God-given resources, we have it within our power 
and our duty to help others access clean water--the key to life.
  And that is just the way it is.
