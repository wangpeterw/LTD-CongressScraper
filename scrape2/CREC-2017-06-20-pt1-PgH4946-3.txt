                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God, Father of us all, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Please send Your spirit upon this assembly, that the men and women 
who serve the United States in contentious times such as these might 
better work together for the benefit of our Nation. This is not easy, 
so bless them with Your wisdom and give them the patience and 
understanding to rise to the demands of their calling.
  So also we ask Your blessing upon our world, where so many live and 
unfortunately die in nations and regions cursed by violence and 
division. Lord, have mercy.
  Lord, be with us this day and all days, and may all that is done be 
for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
