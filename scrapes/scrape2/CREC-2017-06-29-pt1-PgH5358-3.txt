                      HONORING JUDGE RYAN REINHOLD

  (Mr. O'HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, it is with respect and admiration that 
we honor Judge Ryan Reinhold for his outstanding legacy and service to 
the State of Arizona.
  This week, Ryan retires after 41 years as Navajo County justice of 
the peace, municipal court judge, White Mountain Apache tribal judge, 
and Navajo County constable.
  Throughout his career, he has been known for his tireless efforts to 
benefit his community in every aspect. I want to take a moment to share 
some of the highlights of his career.
  Ryan was first selected as justice of the peace in 1978. In 1984, he 
received the Kenneth L. MacEachern Award for Outstanding Non-Lawyer 
Judge in the United States. He was reelected five times and honorably 
led the court for 22 years before retiring in 2000.
  He was appointed Navajo County constable for precinct six in 2003 and 
elected in 2006.
  He has led hundreds of volunteers as the district chairman of the Boy 
Scouts of America, and he serves as the president of the Blue Ridge 
High School Scholarship Fund and Lions Club.
  In retirement, I hear that he plans to be making regular scuba diving 
trips, traveling the world, and spending quality time with his beloved 
family and friends--all well deserved.
  Mr. Speaker, Ryan Reinhold is a pillar of his community and has done 
so much for Arizona. I extend my best wishes as Ryan begins the next 
chapter of his life.
