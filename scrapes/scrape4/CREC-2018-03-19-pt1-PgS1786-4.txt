[[Page S1787]]

birthday wishes to Ms. Carol Rivard who celebrated her 100th birthday 
on March 17, 2018.
  Carol has lived in New Hampshire since she moved to Salem with her 
family in 1959. She worked in a textile mill and later as an office 
clerk for Kmart. After her retirement, Carol dedicated her time to 
helping a local food pantry where she volunteered every week for nearly 
10 years.
  To this day, Carol lives independently in her New Hampshire home. Her 
most cherished moments are spent with loved ones at family gatherings, 
where they enjoy listening to Frank Sinatra and cheering on the Boston 
Celtics. Carol has three sons and a daughter, as well as three 
grandchildren and five great-grandchildren
  I join with Carol's friends and family, as well as many people in the 
town of Salem and across the Granite State, in wishing her a very happy 
100th birthday.
