                               TAX REFORM

  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to praise the 
progress the Senate and the House has made toward passing tax reform 
for the American people.
  Our tax plan would roughly double the standard deduction, a deduction 
that 71 percent of Missourians use. When our tax bill passes, the 
simple truth is that it will allow Missouri families and families 
everywhere to take home more of their paychecks.
  Our tax plan will also be more fair, eliminating special interest 
loopholes and making it easier for average Americans to file taxes. 
Currently, our country spends a total of $378 billion per year filing 
tax returns. Our tax plan will change all that.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the 
final version of this bill so we can give Americans a great present by 
Christmas and watch our economy thrive.
