                      OPEN TAX REFORM DISCUSSIONS

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, there is no question we need to reform 
our outdated, overly complex Tax

Code. That is something we all agree on. We need to encourage growth 
and support our middle class. But the Republican decision to approach 
taxes in an exclusively partisan and fiscally irresponsible way is not 
the way to go.
  I am deeply concerned about the partisan plan rolled out by the 
Republican leadership, in no small part because it saddles future 
generations with trillions more in debt just to pay for tax cuts for 
the most fortunate Americans.
  Furthermore, restricting provisions relied upon by countless middle 
class families, including the State and local tax--SALT--deductions and 
property tax deductions hurts working families. This is particularly 
true in States like Illinois, where one in every three filers depends 
on the SALT deduction.
  In the days ahead, I hope my Republican colleagues will open the tax 
reform discussion to bipartisan engagement. I remain ready and willing 
to sit down and work across the aisle to achieve responsible tax reform 
that will grow our economy, protect our seniors, truly help middle 
class families, and secure our future.
