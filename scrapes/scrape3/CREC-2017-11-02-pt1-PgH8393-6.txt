                                TAX PLAN

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Tax Policy Center, the 
Wharton School, and virtually every rational economist have reviewed 
the House Republican tax cut plan and the results are clear: no new 
good economic growth, big debt and deficit, and big tax cuts for 
corporations and very rich Americans.
  Three million wealthy Americans will get a tax cut next year of 
$220,000; 250 million not-so-rich Americans will get a tax cut of $221. 
If you make $730,000, your income next year will increase by 8.5 
percent. If you make $150,000, it will increase by 1 percent.
  Where are all of the deficit hawks? Where are any of the deficit 
hawks?
  This tax plan is nothing more than fraud being perpetrated against 
middle America.
  I ask my colleagues to reject this plan.
