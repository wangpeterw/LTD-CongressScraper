SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 15--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION 
 OF OCTOBER 28, 2017, AS ``HONORING THE NATION'S FIRST RESPONDERS DAY''

  Ms. WARREN (for herself and Mr. Cotton) submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs:

                            S. Con. Res. 15

       Whereas first responders include professional and volunteer 
     fire, police, emergency medical technician, and paramedic 
     workers in the United States;
       Whereas there are more than 25,300,000 first responders in 
     the United States working to keep communities safe;
       Whereas first responders deserve to be recognized for their 
     commitment to safety, defense, and honor; and
       Whereas October 28, 2017, would be an appropriate day to 
     establish as ``Honoring the Nation's First Responders Day'': 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives 
     concurring), That the Senate--
       (1) supports the designation of October 28, 2017, as 
     ``Honoring the Nation's First Responders Day'';
       (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of first 
     responders; and
       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
     Honoring the Nation's First Responders Day with appropriate 
     ceremonies and activities that promote awareness of the 
     contributions of first responders in the United States.
