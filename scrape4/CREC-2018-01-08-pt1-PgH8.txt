            TRIBUTE TO NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY BISONS

  (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the North Dakota 
State University Bisons, who, on Saturday, won their sixth NCAA 
Division 1 football championship in the last 7 years.
  When Chris Kliemen was named head coach at NDSU 3 years ago, he 
inherited a tradition of excellence and made it a dynasty. Merriam-
Webster defines ``dynasty'' as ``a powerful group or family that 
maintains its position for a considerable time.''
  Well, Mr. Speaker, winning six national championships in 7 years 
certainly meets the second half of that definition. And anyone who 
knows Bison football knows that they are a family. It is what makes 
them special.
  Quarterback Easton Stick was named the Game's Most Outstanding 
Player, but it was the Bison defense that shined the brightest on 
Saturday, holding James Madison University's explosive offense to a 
season low 241 yards and just 13 points.
  Perhaps it was linebacker Nick DeLuca who put it best when asked how 
the Bison defense was able to respond so spectacularly in so many 
difficult situations. He simply said: ``Just remain focused and calm.''
  Good advice, Nick, in football and politics.
  Congratulations, Bisons. You make us proud.
