   REMEMBERING ALFRED EARNEST PELLOW, FOUNDER OF VETS HONOR GUARD IN 
                         FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to honor Alfred Earnest Pellow, a resident of Franklin, 
Pennsylvania, who passed away last week at his home.
  Ernie, as he was called by family and friends, was involved in 
founding the Veterans Coalition and the VETS Honor Guard in Franklin. 
He was also deeply instrumental in bringing the Veterans Administration 
clinic to Franklin to care for our military men and women.
  The 79-year-old was a U.S. Army peacetime veteran who served 37 
months in Germany. In 1960, he married his wife, Joyce, with whom he 
spent 57 years of wedded bliss. He was a family man: a loving husband, 
brother, father, and grandfather.
  Ernie was a self-employed building contractor. He received the 
Pennsylvania Builders of the Year Award in 1996 and Pennsylvania 
Builders Distinguished Achievement Award in 2014.
  A member of Masonic Blue Lodge and the York Rite, Ernie received his 
Masonic 50 year pin in 2015.
  Mr. Speaker, Ernie Pellow lived a life of service: service to his 
country, service to his community, and service to his family. He will 
be sorely missed by all who knew him.
