                     HONORING THE LIFE OF RAY BAUM

  (Ms. ESHOO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to pay tribute to a great 
man, Ray Baum.
  Ray Baum was the staff director of the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
He came to Washington, D.C., to take on the senior policy role at the 
committee with the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology.
  Ray was a gentleman who was scholarly in terms of his understanding 
of the issues. He served in the Oregon State House of Representatives 
and as chairman on the Public Utilities Commission in the State of 
Oregon. His deep and broad knowledge is something that we all benefited 
from. I think the House and our country has lost a true patriot.
  Ray was a man of great faith. He had two great loves in his life: 
Kristine, his wife; their 6 children and 10 grandchildren. He was only 
62 years old. He also loved public service and his country. He gave 
great service to his country.
  I feel very blessed to have served with him at the committee and to 
have formed a friendship that will last with me all the days of my 
life.
  God bless you, Ray. Thank you for the example and the role model that 
you have been to so many of us. May you rest in peace. We will always 
remember you with love, respect, and always with affection.
