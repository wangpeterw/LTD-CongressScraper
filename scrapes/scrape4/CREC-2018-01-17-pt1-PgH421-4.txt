                       KATE'S KART MARKS 10 YEARS

  (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kate's Kart, 
a group founded in memory of Kate Layman.
  Monday marked 10 years since Kate's life was cut short due to a heart 
condition at the age of 18 months. During Kate's final moments here on 
Earth, listening to stories brought a sense of comfort and joy.
  Today, Kate's memory lives on through Kate's Kart. This organization 
brings joy to thousands of hospitalized children throughout northeast 
Indiana by giving them free books. In the 10 years that it has 
operated, Kate's Kart has passed out over 186,000 books.
  Kate's Kart is particularly near and dear to my heart because Mr. 
Layman, Kate's father, was my middle school history teacher, and he 
helped spark my interest in government.
  I want to recognize the life-changing work of Kate's Kart. Truly, 
Kate's legacy lives on through this organization and its impact on 
children throughout northeast Indiana.
