                       THE SENATE HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Ms. DelBENE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, Senate Republicans may have delayed the 
vote, but make no mistake, they are pushing ahead with a destructive, 
dangerous healthcare bill that is not just mean, it is immoral. The 
American people are right to be outraged. I am outraged.
  We should be working together to give people better coverage at lower 
cost. Instead, Senate leaders crafted legislation that leads to lost 
coverage for 22 million Americans, skyrocketing deductibles, hospital 
closures in rural communities, and the return of annual and lifetime 
caps on care.
  For families like Colton's in Mill Creek, Washington, who have 
watched as their 17-year-old son battled high-risk leukemia for 8 
years, I can promise you, we are not backing down. Colton is in his 
fifth remission and still fighting--and so are we.
  Healthcare is not a privilege reserved for those fortunate enough to 
be wealthy or healthy. It is a human right, and it is worth fighting 
for.
