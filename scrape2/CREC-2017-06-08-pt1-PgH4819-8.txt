            By Mr. NEWHOUSE:
        H.R. 2828.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
        Article 1, Section 8, Clause 18, Congress may enact laws 
     necessary and proper to the execution of its enumerated 
     powers. As this legislation solely amends the amount of time 
     available for execution of previously granted authority, it 
     is merely technical in nature and an appropriate exercise of 
     Congress' authority to amend its previous actions through 
     necessary and proper statutes.
