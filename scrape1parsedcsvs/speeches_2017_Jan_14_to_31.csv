It is just 2 days since the 44th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, and Republicans are, once again, attacking women's health care.  This legislation would prevent Federal funds from being spent on health benefits that include abortion coverage, causing women and families who depend on ACA to lose their coverage.  A woman who can't afford an abortion and needs one should not be stripped of her constitutionally protected right to one because of her insurance.  We have to stand up and fight for our sister's right to choose and her right to control her own body. It is not the Federal Government's business. It is personal. It is my business.

I just want to say that this bill signifies our staunch support for life, and in spite of what has all been said, it just simply prevents taxpayer funds from being used to pay for abortions.  For years our government has had a patchwork approach to this issue. However, this bill, H.7, would create a clear and unified policy across all Federal agencies.

846,topic-id,457,"Mr.President, Democratic Senators are searching for a valid reason to oppose the President's nomination of Betsy DeVos to be U.Education Secretary because they really don't want Americans to know what their real reason is. Here is the real reason: Betsy DeVos has spent the last 30 years--actually more than 30 years--being dedicated to helping low-income children in America have more of the same choices of schools that wealthy Americans already have.  Specifically, the Democrats object to the fact that Betsy DeVos supports the idea of tax dollars following low-income children to the school that their parents may choose--public, private, or religious. This is not a new or subversive idea. Let us go back to 1944, the GI bill for veterans. The Congress enacted probably the most successful piece of social legislation ever enacted when it passed the GI bill for veterans. As a result, veterans came home from World War II and Federal tax dollars followed them to the accredited college or university of their choice.  They could go to Notre They could go the University of They could go to Nashville Auto Diesel College, the University of It did not matter. It was their choice. That is when Americans experience with education vouchers began. I have always wondered, why would an idea that helped to create the ``greatest generation''--which is what we call the World War II generation--that helped to create the best colleges and universities in the world, why would that be such a dangerous idea to use for our schools?  The idea of education vouchers following students to the college of their choice has been continued in higher education. Pell grants--we spend about $30 billion in Pell grants every year, up to $6,000, that follow lower income students to the community college or college of their choice. Those are education vouchers.  We have almost $100 billion of new student loans every year. How do we spend that money? We allow that money to follow the college students to the college of their choice. Those are education vouchers. Starting with the GI bill for veterans, all the way through Pell grants, all the way through student loans, we all endorse those ideas, saying it creates great opportunity for children. It has been so successful. I have not heard any Senator in this body stand up and say: Well, let's cancel the Pell grants because it is tax money following students to a college. Let's cancel $100 billion in student loans this year because it means tax dollars following someone to Harvard or to Notre Dame or to  No one is going to say that.

It has been 44 years since Roe v. Since then, 58 million precious American lives have been aborted. The Supreme Court got it wrong when it violated its authority by creating a constitutional right to abortion. To make matters worse, the Federal Government is now using our taxpayer dollars to subsidize these abortions. Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to put a stop to this. This is an area in which the Constitution, my constituents, and my conviction will not allow me to budge.  I believe that all life is ordained by God and begins at conception, as the psalmists so eloquently said: ``for You created my inward parts. You knit me together in my mother's womb.''

1717,topic-id,1208,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the nomination of Rex Tillerson to serve as Secretary of Shortly after President Trump's election, I wrote to him about what I thought was a mutual interest, taking on a rigged system in Washington where powerful interests call the shots. For too long, I have heard from Wisconsinites who feel that Washington's economic and political system is broken. People are angry because they feel that our government institutions seem to work for Big Banks or Big Oil but not for them.  President Trump clearly tapped into this widely held dissatisfaction when he announced his plan to reduce the influence of special interests in government by draining the swamp. Yet with appointment after appointment, it has been made clear that President Trump is not interested in ridding the government of powerful interests. In fact, he continues to appoint and nominate foxes to guard the henhouse.  We don't need to look back very far to know what can happen when we let industry insiders run our government. The 2008 financial crisis was a result of years of deregulation pushed by Wall Street from both inside and outside the government. Last Congress, I introduced legislation to slow the revolving door and ensure that our public servants are working for the public interest, not their former--or future, for that matter--employers. I was inspired to introduce this legislation when I saw several Obama administration appointees receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for leaving their private sector jobs to join the government. These government service golden parachutes, as they are known, demonstrate how valuable some companies believe it is to have friends in high places.  Rex Tillerson, the President's nominee to serve as Secretary of State, received a $180 million payout from ExxonMobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere. What is more, reports indicate that the deal he struck allows him to defer paying 71 million in taxes. It is hard to imagine that our Nation's top diplomat will forget such an incredible favor, but Rex Tillerson isn't the only Trump appointee who will be rewarded with a golden parachute as he enters government. Gary Cohn, the President's pick to run the National Economic Council, will receive over 100 million from his former employer, Goldman Sachs, before he starts to coordinate an administration-wide economic policy.  I remain as opposed to this practice under the Trump administration as I was during the Obama administration. Wisconsin families cannot afford to have corporate insiders running our government to rig the rules on behalf of their former corporations. That is why I am reintroducing the Financial Services Conflict of Interest Act, to ensure that our government is truly of the people, by the people, and for the people of the United States, to ensure that President Trump's Cabinet officials are working in the national interests instead of their own interests, to ensure that they are working for their current employers, the American people, instead of their former bosses.  In the case of Mr.Tillerson, whose nomination the Senate is voting on this week, these questions of influence, of favoritism and priorities are particularly troubling, troubling because during his tenure leading Exxon, Mr.Tillerson showed a disregard, if not outright contempt at times, for putting U.policy first. Whether in the Middle East, Africa or Russia, Exxon's bottom line was his overriding priority. Now, with 180 million of Exxon's money in his pocket--and after 40 years with the company--should we take it on faith that his priorities will suddenly change? Should we blindly accept that the 180 million will not ever influence his decisionmaking or should we continue to ask questions, questions that Rex Tillerson has yet to answer?  For example, how will Exxon and Big Business influence U.policy in strategically important but democratically fragile oil-producing African states? How about U.international commitments to combatting climate change, one of our greatest national security challenges but also a challenge that Big Oil has dismissed as a hoax. Perhaps most concerning, what influence will Exxon have in matters relating to Russia, where its long record of doing business at the expense of U.national security interests seems to be right at home in the Trump administration?  We also need to hear what Rex Tillerson thinks about President Trump's actions this weekend. On Friday, President Trump issued anti-refugee and anti-immigrant Executive orders. I am outraged by the way these orders were hastily thrown together late The President's sloppy actions created chaos, disorder, and confusion at our airports, and it left families, including permanent legal residents, wondering what it meant for them. There have been media reports that relevant agencies, including the State Department, were not consulted before this order was signed by President President Trump says we need extreme vetting of refugees fleeing war-torn nations. The refugees--the vast majority of whom are women and children--already go through an extremely strict screening process before they are allowed to enter the country.  What we really need extreme vetting of is President Trump's Executive orders before he signs them. With the stroke of a pen, President Trump's orders will make ISIS stronger, weaken America's counterterrorism efforts, and likely cost lives. It is wrong to turn our back on our American values and the rest of the world. We are better than this.  President Trump and Republicans in Congress should reverse these shameful actions immediately. I am proud to be cosponsoring legislation that would do just that. We need to know where Rex Tillerson stands on those very same issues. Does he oppose welcoming refugees into the country, which strengthens America's connection with freedom, the foundation of who we are as a people? Was Mr.Tillerson consulted by the President before these orders were issued? Mr.Tillerson owes it to the American people to answer those questions before the Senate votes on his confirmation.  What happened the day after President Trump issued these Executive orders? On Saturday, President Trump called Vladimir Putin to discuss a more cozy relationship with What does Mr.Tillerson think about this call? According to reports, it was a warm conversation and resulted in preparations for a meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, the same Vladimir Putin who illegally invaded Ukraine and actively seeks to divide and destroy NATO, our most important security alliance; the same Vladimir Putin who is responsible for directing cyber attacks meant to influence and undermine our elections and our Democratic process; the same Vladimir Putin who fights alongside the murderous Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and is responsible for war crimes, indiscriminately bombing innocent civilians in Aleppo; the same Vladimir Putin who gave Rex Tillerson the Order of Friendship following his business dealings in  We need a Secretary of State who understands the threats posed by nations like Russia, not someone who is cozy with Vladimir We need a nominee with experience in foreign affairs and foreign policy, not a billionaire oil tycoon who has spent his career fighting to ensure that government policies help the oil industry. Rex Tillerson is not this nominee.  For all these reasons, I oppose the nomination of Rex Tillerson to serve as U.Secretary of I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.

I thank Mr.King of New York and Chairman McCaul for working with me to introduce this legislation.  The purpose of my bill is to clarify and enhance the partnership between the Department of Homeland Security and the National Network of Fusion The bill amends the existing statute to update the Department's responsibilities for sharing information with State and local law enforcement and other emergency personnel within the National Network of Fusion  After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, State and local governments created fusion centers as a way to communicate Federal homeland security information to State and local law enforcement officials, as well as fuse State and locally collected information with Federal intelligence.  Congress supported this partnership by mandating that the Office of Intelligence and Analysis within the Department of Homeland Security coordinate and share information with fusion centers. There are now 78 State and locally owned fusion centers across the country.  I would especially like to recognize the work of the Pennsylvania Criminal Intelligence Center, PaCIC, which is run by the Pennsylvania State In 2015, our fusion center received the Fusion Center of the Year Award from the National Fusion Center  I want to congratulate the men and women working at PaCIC for their commitment to security and public safety. They share vital information with police departments that keep officers and our citizens safe.  PaCIC provides intelligence and information products to over 1,200 local, State, and Federal criminal justice agencies, while also working with over 6,000 private and public center partners to also share information to help protect critical infrastructure and key resources.  Our center has been nationally recognized for their training and compliance with issues of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. They produce documents that highlight threats and scams that target Pennsylvanians, and help make sure that local police departments have information on public events, ranging from the Little League World Series to the visit of Pope  A significant amount of progress has been made by States and fusion centers within the national network to improve information sharing and analytic support. Many centers, including PaCIC, provide all crime, all hazard support. They also maintain a focus on our homeland security missions, including protecting critical information and sharing suspicious activity reporting.  H.642 recognizes the progress and focuses on enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's responsibility to support, share information, and coordinate with fusion centers. This includes improving coordination with other Federal departments that provide better operational intelligence, reduce inefficiencies, and coordinate nationwide suspicious activity reporting.  As a member of the Homeland Security Committee and a former mayor, I have heard concerns raised by law enforcement in my district and elsewhere about the lack of information and coordination from several DHS component agencies, including ICE and To address this issue, I included language in this bill to direct the Department to ensure that each component is providing information and personnel to work with fusion centers.  To address the need for better accountability, language is included throughout the bill requiring DHS to coordinate with fusion centers and State Homeland Security Advisers in carrying out the assigned responsibilities.  Additionally, there is a requirement for the Department to submit a report to Congress on their efforts, including the components to support fusion centers, and specifically report on how they are meeting the requirements that are set forth in this bill.

888,topic-id,1125,"Mr.President, last week the Committee on Environment[[Page S421]]and Public Works held a hearing on the nomination of Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection The hearing was really about the future of this Agency and how we can get it back to doing the job it was meant to do from the very beginning.  We are blessed in this country with enormous natural resources. Our goal should be to use these resources responsibly in ways that protect our environment and help make our economy strong.  Over the past 8 years, the leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency created broad and legally questionable new regulations that undermined the American people's faith in the The political leaders of this Agency have been reckless, irresponsible, and arrogant.  A course of correction is long overdue, and it is exactly what we are going to get.  If my colleagues have any doubts that the EPA lost its way, they can just look at two of the biggest environmental scandals we have seen in a long time. In the summer of 2015, there was what became known as the Gold King Mine disaster. The Environmental Protection Agency spilled 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater into a river in This was water filled with toxic substances like arsenic and lead. It flowed to New Mexico and Utah, through the land of the Navajo Nation and the Southern Ute Indian tribe. There are 200,000 people who drink water from the river system that the EPA poisoned. Farmers and ranchers couldn't use the water for their crops or their animals.  The other disaster the Environmental Protection Agency helped to cause was what happened in Flint, The EPA failed to do the proper oversight. As a result, thousands of children were exposed to high levels of lead in their drinking water. The Agency knew about the dangers to the public health and for months did nothing to warn the people.  These are just two scandals where the Environmental Protection Agency actually harmed people's health because the EPA was negligent. There are also many ways the Agency has harmed families and the American economy, not by accident but intentionally. It has issued thousands of pages of regulations trying to shut down the entire coal industry in the United Since 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency has come out with nearly 200 new regulations.  According to the American Action Forum, the total cost of all of this new redtape is about $340 billion. The Agency has piled enormous new restrictions and costs onto American families and businesses, all to produce miniscule benefits.  One of them was the so-called Clean Power States sued to block this destructive bureaucratic overreach. The courts had to step in and tell Washington not so fast.  We should be looking for ways to make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs for American families. That is not what the Environmental Protection Agency did with its power regulations.  The EPA also put out a new rule that dramatically expanded its own control over what it calls waters of the United The Agency declared that it has control over things like irrigation ditches and backyard ponds all across Two different courts have blocked this rule from taking effect. Why? Because it goes far beyond the Agency's own authority.  For 8 years now, the leaders of the EPA have not had their priorities straight. They have been pursuing a political agenda instead of focusing on what should be the Agency's core mission. The Environmental Protection Agency was created for a reason. It was created because America needed someone to perform this mission. There is a right way to do the job. We can strike the right balance so we protect our environment while allowing our economy to grow.  My home State of Wyoming is one of the most pristine States in the country, one of the most beautiful places in the world, as well as one of the most energy-rich States in the country. Wyoming has struck the right balance. We have done it successfully and so have many other We can address threats to our environment best through the cooperation of States, towns, Indian tribes, and Washington--a cooperation.  The quality of America's air, water, and land are local concerns as much as they are national concerns. The Environmental Protection Agency should not try to dictate regulations from Washington without consulting its partners at all levels.  Much of the work of the EPA was intended to give States a chance to take action first. Federal regulators are meant to be a backstop, acting when States or communities fail to act. Restoring this proper order and restoring the partnership of States with the EPA is essential to making sure people see the Agency as legitimate once again. The Agency needs to learn to listen before it acts.  We can also restore the Environmental Protection Agency by restating its commitment to the rule of law. That is why the American people elect a Congress--because of the rule of law. The Agency must enforce the laws as they are written by The Agency cannot write the laws, cannot ignore the parts of the laws it doesn't like, although that is exactly what this EPA has been doing.  We all know the EPA used to do very good work. In the past, it protected America's environment while understanding that there need to be reasonable regulations that allow people to use our natural resources. Every American wants clean air, clean water, and commonsense protection for our species. That will not change. We need the EPA to do its job, and we need it to do the job right.  Through 6 hours of questioning before our committee last week, Scott Pruitt showed that he understands the need to return the Environmental Protection Agency back to its proper course. He showed he is committed to working as a partner with Americans all across the country to find the best ways to address the threats to our environment. His record as the attorney general of Oklahoma showed that he is committed to restoring and maintaining the rule of law.  I am confident that Attorney General Pruitt will be able to right the ship at the I am confident that he can restore the balance between the benefits the Agency can deliver for Americans with the costs that it imposes.

1701,topic-id,1239,"Mr.President, I wish to congratulate the current Presiding Officer for his ascension to the[[Page S514]]chair of the Indian Affairs Committee in the U.It is a committee with a great history of bipartisan efforts working together. It is a committee on which I was privileged to serve and still serve and of which I have been the chairman in the past. I am looking forward to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota taking over the mantle of responsibility, and I know he will continue to work hard, as he has since joining the Senate, in the efforts on behalf of so many  I also come to the floor about what is going on in the Senate with regard to confirming nominations in a Cabinet that I believe is truly an all-star Cabinet--truly an all-star I think it gets better as we keep confirming one nominee after another. Last week I spoke on the floor about what a great job I believe Scott Pruitt is going to do as head of the Environmental Protection Today I wish to talk about two more examples.  First, there is the nomination of our friend and colleague, Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama, to be Attorney Those of us who have served with Senator Sessions over the years know he is a man of uncommon decency, of fairness, and of integrity. We know his dedication to the law is absolute.  In 1999, Senator Sessions came to the floor to speak in support of awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa In that speech, he said: ``Equal treatment under the law is a fundamental pillar upon which our republic rests.'' We saw Senator Sessions' devotion to this idea again and again and again. He introduced legislation to reduce the differences in the kinds of sentences that could be handed out to people convicted of similar drug crimes. He teamed up with Senator Ted Kennedy to pass legislation protecting prisoners from sexual assault behind bars.  The job of Attorney General is to be America's top law enforcement officer and attorney. Jeff Sessions has shown himself to be an outstanding attorney. He worked as a frontline prosecutor. He spent 12 years as the U.attorney for the Southern District of He was attorney general of the State of Alabama, and he has spent 20 years here as a U. If confirmed as Attorney General, he will be one of the most qualified people ever to hold this job. These qualifications include an exceptional knowledge of how the Justice Department works and the priorities of the people who work there.  The Attorney General oversees the work of more than 100,000 people. Most of them are law enforcement, working for agencies like the FBI and the Drug Enforcement I think these men and women are going to find that Jeff Sessions is their greatest champion, and I think they are going to greet his arrival at the Justice Department with a wonderful ovation. National law enforcement groups have already endorsed his nomination, and so have groups representing Federal and local prosecutors. He is going to enforce the laws passed by Congress in a fair and impartial manner. That is exactly what America needs in its Attorney  The second person I want to talk about is Congressman Tom Tom has been nominated to be the Secretary of Health and Human Just as Jeff Sessions has devoted his life to the law, Tom Price has devoted his life to caring for the health of patients and the American people.  Price practiced medicine for 20 years. He was medical director of the orthopedic clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital in Grady Memorial Hospital is a public safety-net hospital in Atlanta, and many, many of its patients are low income. Price saw each and every day the challenges that people faced in America's broken health care system, both the patients and the people who are trying to provide the care. That is why he has taken health care reform so seriously as a Member of He did as well when he was in the Georgia State legislature. He understands and he understood immediately why so many parts of ObamaCare simply would not work when they were passed and signed into law some 6 years ago. Like a lot of us, he warned the health care law would actually make things worse for millions of Americans--and Tom Price has proven right.  It is time for the Department of Health and Human Services to have leadership that understands that patients should not become a political tool. Congressman Price is actually the first medical doctor to be nominated to head the Department of Health and Human Services since 1989. That kind of knowledge and the background he has is essential for dealing with the challenges the Department faces today.  The wheels are falling off of America's health care system. We need leaders--leaders who are more than just professional bureaucrats, which is what we have had. We need someone who understands health care deeply, and who cares about putting patients first, not politics.  Tom Price has shown he can reach across the aisle to get things done. It is what he did in the State legislature in Georgia, and it is what he has done in the House of Representatives here in Tom worked with Democrats to make sure that Medicare patients could continue to get access to medical equipment like blood sugar monitors and oxygen tanks. He did the same thing when he introduced a bipartisan measure to stop burdensome new regulations affecting patients who need a new hip or a new knee joint. As Secretary of Health and Human Services, he is going to listen--listen to the best arguments of both sides, and then he is going to do what is right for the health of the American people.  ObamaCare has to go. It has failed miserably. We all know that. Even Democrats in Congress who wrote the law realize how flawed it really is. It is time for us now to focus on what can be done to replace ObamaCare and make American health care work once again.  I have seen media reports that Democrats want to obstruct the nomination of Tom Price as well as that of Jeff I expect Democrats will plan to grandstand for political purposes because they have no real objections to either person's qualifications or credentials.  Democrats' complaint is that they lost the Presidential election. Well, the President deserves to have his Cabinet in place. That is why Republicans didn't object to President Obama getting seven of his Cabinet members on his very first day in office in 2009. By this point in time, President Obama had a significant number of his Cabinet--over 20 members--confirmed in 2009, and we look at where we are today, with President Trump's Cabinet and the obstruction of the It is unfortunate that Democrats have decided not to follow the example of Republicans when Barack Obama came to the White  Political spite isn't a good enough reason for delay. Democrats need to get over it and get on with it. Attorney General of the United States and Secretary of Health and Human Services are big jobs. They are important jobs, and they are necessary jobs. It is time for the Senate to move as soon as possible to confirm both Jeff Sessions and Tom Price to the  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The assistant minority leader.

Last summer, I traveled with Senator Markey and Representative Maloney to Nigeria and Senegal where we met with a number of local IT experts. What was clear from our in-depth discussions is that Internet access has quickly become a critical component of economies and economic growth throughout the developing world.  Many developing economies, which have traditionally had to navigate institutional or infrastructural impediments, are able to utilize information technology to resolve everyday problems. Case in point, telephone land lines in some developing economies are often in need of constant repair and maintenance. As a result, over the years, land lines became the preserve of the middle class and affluent sectors of capital cities.  This is no longer the case because astute entrepreneurs have found a way to circumvent this impediment by buying and/or renting out cell phones for public use.

On the contrary, all I heard on Friday was another campaign speech of more of the same divisive rhetoric and recycled ideas from his campaign trail, ideas like the new deal for Black America that he mentioned on the campaign trail, a proposal that you have heard a lot about tonight that embraces the same trickle-down economic assumptions that didn't work for African Americans in the past and certainly won't work today.

1278,topic-id,1489,"Mr.President, Mr.Trump's poorly drawn and implemented Executive order blocking refugees from the United States sacrifices fundamental American values and does not make us safer.  For the first time in memory, the order imposes a ban on all refugees entering our country, many of whom are fleeing war or who risk persecution for their religious or political beliefs. The order affects many thousands of children, women, and men whom our government has vetted for years and cleared for rescue.  President Trump's action--taken in the first days of his new administration, for political reasons, without regard for real world consequences and without the expertise of our national security professionals or even some of those appointed by the President himself--represents a rare, but shameful, departure from a constitutional heritage that has made America strong and a beacon to oppressed people throughout the world.[[Page S473]]  For generations, immigrants and refugees have come to our country to flee religious persecution and to seek a better life. Indeed, these are the very people who founded our original colonies. Although, as now, we have occasionally failed to live up to our ideals, over generations the United States has accepted millions of refugees from around the world.  My own family is part of this story, as so many people's families in this Chamber are. My mom was born in Poland in 1938 while Nazi tanks massed at the border. She and her parents miraculously survived the Holocaust--one of the worst human events in history.  After the war, after arriving in Sweden and then Mexico City, they were able to come to New York City in 1950. They wanted to come to the United States because it was the only country in the world where they believed they could rebuild their shattered lives. And they did.  This weekend, my mom joined hundreds of thousands of Americans to call on the President to change course, knowing that our family's struggles in Europe require us to recognize the danger and persecution facing families throughout the Middle East today.  Out of a population of 22 million, almost 5 million Syrians have fled to neighboring countries--some to Europe--and have registered as refugees. More than half of those displaced are children.  According to the United Nations, more than half of the remaining Syrian population--6 million of them children--require assistance such as food, water, and health care. Nearly one in four people in Lebanon today--tonight--is a Syrian refugee, and the fourth largest city in Jordan is now a refugee camp.  In the wake of President Trump's refugee ban, it seems useful to ask--and I am sure the American people are asking--why are so many millions of people fleeing their homes, their countries, and their history?  They are doing it to save their lives--and, in many cases, their children's lives--from ISIS's medieval barbarism and Assad's unrelenting brutality. They seek to escape the murder, rape, detention, and torture they suffer because of their religion or their ethnicity or both.  Assad is their enemy. ISIS is their enemy. Today's refugees are fleeing the violence and extremism that threatens our own national security. Their enemies are our enemies. The same is true of the refugees from Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, and  Does this mean we have an obligation simply to open our borders to them? Of course not. We have a national security imperative to ensure that no terrorist tries to sneak into the United States as part of the refugee program.  I have long said that the burden of proof is not on the United States to accept a refugee. Rather, the refugee has the burden to demonstrate that they are not a threat to the United We have no obligation, nor should we, to take anything on faith. It is for this reason that refugees are more thoroughly vetted than anyone else entering the United They must pass stringent screening standards to ensure that they pose no threat, a process that can take up to 2 years.  First, the United Nations screens them and collects biometric data. Only those who pass that test are then referred to the United And, by the way, no refugee knows at that stage of the process to which country they will be referred--to the United States or to any other country that is accepting refugees. After that, multiple agencies--including the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the State Department, and our intelligence agencies--conduct rigorous screenings. This process includes repeated biometric checks, several layers of biographical and background screening, health checks, and interviews. Syrian refugees, in particular, receive enhanced scrutiny through an additional security risk review by specially trained officers.  Out of the nearly 60,000 people referred to the United States, only about 12,000 have been accepted. Of those Syrian refugees accepted by the United States, three-quarters are women and children and half were under 13 in 2016.  We are the leader of the free world, a republic founded on the premise of religious freedom and a society that for generations has called out to the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to be free. That is who we are. Yet, in the name of fighting terrorism in his first week as President, Mr.Trump has sacrificed what has made us exceptional and has banned these children and their mothers from our shores.  These children are no different than Omran Daqneesh, whose distant stare from the back of an ambulance in Aleppo bore witness to the senseless violence he suffered; or Alan Kurdi, whose lifeless body on a Turkish beach condemned the worst savagery of humankind.  Once he learns the details--if he chooses to study them--if President Trump wishes to make our vetting even more extreme than it already is, I guess he may do so. But banning refugees and prioritizing immigration by religion or ethnicity simultaneously abandons our principles and weakens our counterterrorism efforts. It sends the wrong message to our Muslim partners who fight with us in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, including civilians in those countries who have risked their lives alongside our troops. It also hands ISIS a recruiting tool by fueling their narrative that the Western and Muslim worlds cannot coexist in peace.  If the President really wants to secure our borders and ensure extremists stay out of the country, there are far better alternatives, and they are alternatives that are not at war with who we are as We should work together to close security gaps in our Visa Waiver Program and partner with European countries to better track the flow of foreign fighters throughout Europe and the Middle We should also do more to counter the ability of terrorists to radicalize and recruit, both here at home and abroad. We should do more to equip our agencies with tools and capabilities to degrade the ability of terrorist organizations--in particular, ISIS--to persuade and inspire using social media. Congress should enact ideas passed by the Senate in 2013 to strengthen border security, double the number of border agents, and address visa overstays.  By tackling real vulnerabilities and investing in smart security solutions, we can secure not only our borders but also our values, and we will not repeat the darkest moments of our history when America turned away from those fleeing persecution around the world.  A year ago, I came to the Senate floor to share a note sent to me by my grandparents on my first birthday. It is a message that bears repeating tonight. The year was 1965--15 years after my mother and grandparents came to this country after surviving the horrors of the Holocaust in This is what they wrote:       The ancient Greeks gave the world the high ideals of      democracy, in search of which your dear mother and we came to      the hospitable shores of beautiful America in 1950. We have      been happy here ever since, beyond our greatest dreams and      expectations, with democracy, freedom, and love, and      humanity's greatest treasure. We hope that when you grow up,      you will help develop in other parts of the world a greater      understanding of these American values.  Like so many immigrants, my grandparents knew how special these American values are and how rare they are. We cannot take them for granted or subvert them for a political moment. These values make us who we are.  Edmund Burke once wrote: ``In history a great volume is unrolled for our instruction, drawing the materials of future wisdom from the past errors and infirmities of mankind.''  This is a time when we can learn from the past errors and infirmities of humankind. We cannot turn our backs on women, children, and families who risk persecution, starvation, or death.  The President should rescind this Executive order. If not, the Senate should end the ban immediately and start a serious conversation on how to make our country safe again in a manner that is consistent with our fundamental values.

In a country founded on life and liberty, the act of abortion should not be condoned, and it certainly should not be subsidized.  It is fitting that the House consider this legislation this week as we prepare for millions of people to come to Washington, D.C., for the annual March for Life rally where they will give a voice to the unborn. We must work together to move the pro-life message and pro-life policies forward to protect those who cannot yet speak for themselves.

This successful, two-decades-old tristate Dungeness crab management agreement expired on September 30, 2016. This bill simply extends the working management authority between Washington, Oregon, and California and makes this arrangement permanent. A similar measure passed the House last year with flying colors.  For approximately two decades, these States have successfully overseen one of the most valuable fisheries in the Pacific In 2014, fishermen delivered 53 million pounds of crab to market, totaling $170 million. This economic activity helps support more than 60,000 jobs related to the seafood industry in Washington alone.  How has it maintained its success? The fishery has been managed in a sustainable, science-based way, and, importantly, it doesn't cost taxpayers a[[Page H714]]dime. If we do not renew this agreement, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, says its management of this fishery will cost taxpayers $1.15 million per year.  Simply put, this bill maintains local control of a crucial resource and ensures sustainability of the Dungeness crab fishery, all while saving taxpayer dollars. This bill is the kind of commonsense policy that those folks I represent at home in southwest Washington expect to see out of Washington, D.

School choice has greatly benefited Arizona--from charter schools to vocational schools, to private school scholarships, to education savings accounts. I am grateful that my State is a national leader in diverse school choice programs.  Arizona's scholarship tax credit program gives taxpayers a dollar-for-dollar tax credit to enable low-income and disabled children to attend private schools. In Arizona, more children per capita attend exemplary charter schools, and, indeed, they are some of the best charter schools in the country. We have significantly expanded the education savings account model so students can receive the best education possible that meets their unique needs, including those of tribal families who live in reservation communities.[[Page H619]]  Arizona recognizes that all children are unique, that they learn differently, and that each child should have the opportunity to attend the school that will help him learn to love learning and succeed.

Our community along the coast is prone to experiencing hurricanes and tropical storms on a regular basis. Flood insurance is a must where we live.  But right now, the National Flood Insurance Program bases its flood insurance rates on maps that can be 50 years or older. Many are completely out of date and often inaccurate. It is also one of the reasons that NFIP is over $23 billion in debt.  The Flood Insurance Integrity Act will require an open and transparent annual review of flood maps. It sounds good.  Americans who need flood insurance should be able to trust that their flood insurance premiums accurately reflect their flood risk. It is the least we can do.

I rise today in support of critical legislation to support public safety and first responders, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act, H.437.  My bill will help secure medical countermeasures for first responders, ensuring we are prepared for any type of emergency. For instance, last year, in Florida, we faced the outbreak of the Zika virus.  The Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act means that reliable grant funding would be available to conduct medical preparedness activities such as planning, training, and purchasing protective equipment to combat Zika or other public health threats going forward nationwide. When the worst occurs, our first responders are there for us on the front lines.  I consistently find myself in awe of these brave men and women and the sacrifices they make on the public's behalf. They are heroes. The least we can do is make sure they have the tools they need to do their jobs and keep us safe. That is what my bill seeks to accomplish. We want to keep them safe as well, Mr. The legislation authorizes grant funds for the stockpiling of countermeasures, including medical kits, protective gear, ventilators, and more. This should give us all peace of mind to know this vital equipment will be there in case of a crisis.  Importantly, the grant fund used in H.437 already exists. The bill does not require new or additional funding. Also significant, this bill has received strong bipartisan support.  I thank my colleagues, Representatives Susan Brooks and Peter King, for being original cosponsors of H.437.  I was inspired to write this legislation during my time as subcommittee chairman on the Homeland Security Committee after a series of hearings with folks from the emergency response community. They expressed the urgent need for stockpiling these medical countermeasures and for providing first responders the assurance that grant funding may be used to support them now and in the future. They need certainty, Mr. I am proud to have the support of the Emergency Services Coalition for Medical Preparedness and the International Association of Fire Chiefs on this issue. The Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act is going to make a difference to protect the public and protect our protectors. I strongly urge passage today.

578,topic-id,488,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule to provide consideration of H.7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure This bill is, quite literally, the least we can do for American taxpayers and our voiceless unborn.  Frankly, the fact that we are even here discussing this, and that there is opposition to this bill at all, really does break my heart, and it speaks to the depths of the entanglement with the big abortion industry that exist in some corners of this Because, at the end of the day, you know what this bill really is about? The right to choose.  We hear our friends across the aisle use the phrase a lot. But what about the other right to choose, the right of the taxpayer to choose not to pay for the practice that violates everything that they believe? That is what we are here to protect.  The American people support this policy, with 6 in 10 surveyed saying that taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund abortions. And these are both pro-life and pro-choice.  So today, Madam Speaker, I am asking my colleagues across the aisle to honor the will of their constituents. I am asking them to remember the good old Democratic rallying cry of safe, legal, and rare abortion. Obviously, abortion is not rare today when over 330,000 abortions are performed in 1 year.  If my colleagues still believe these words, they will join us in supporting this modest solution to keep unsuspecting taxpayers off of the hook for this practice. And if they can't vote for this bill then there is truly not a single limit on abortion that they will accept, and that is a sad commentary on the state of politics.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.  Mr.Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me just clarify for the Record that there is no Federal funding for abortion. All you have to do is read the Hyde amendment, which has been in effect for 40 years. I don't support it, but that is the law of the land.  The majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal. So if you want to talk about polls, the overwhelming number of Americans believe that abortions should be safe and legal.  I also would like to say that while my colleagues are working overtime to try to defund organizations like Planned Parenthood, it is because of Planned Parenthood, the counseling that is provided, and the reproductive services that are provided at their clinics, and contraception, that the number of abortions have decreased in this country.

Every year, Democrats and Republicans alike have come together to support funding bills that maintain the law called the Hyde amendment, which prohibits the direct Federal funding of abortion, with limited exceptions. This 40-year-old law has saved an estimated 2 million lives, but it is not permanent, meaning that this time-honored protection could be taken away on a whim. What is more, the law, in its current form, has clear loopholes.  A 2014 GAO study found that taxpayer-funded insurance subsidies could be used to pay for abortions on over 1,000 ObamaCare plans nationwide. That is why today we have the opportunity to make this life-affirming law permanent and governmentwide.  As a mother, a grandmother, and a nurse for more than 40 years, this measure is especially meaningful to me. During my years in the healthcare industry, I saw the joy in young parents' eyes when they met their newborn for the very first time. I held the hands of grieving spouses and children as they said good-bye to their loved ones. And, sadly, I witnessed a young woman lose her life due to the effects of a botched abortion.  These experiences informed my view that all life is a precious gift from I pray that in time this truth will be reflected in our Nation's laws. Until then, can't we at least do this much.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure  I reserve the balance of my time.

Since 1973, 57 million lives have been lost to abortion. Even more disheartening, taxpayer dollars have been funding these abortions, despite the fact that polls show that 60 percent of Americans believe that abortions should not be directly paid for with tax dollars.  Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has saved 2 million lives by prohibiting tax dollars from funding abortions. It is time to make this lifesaving amendment permanent and governmentwide. If signed by our new President, this [[Page H641]]measure would do just that. Supporting comprehensive, life-affirming care is a better and more effective way to invest in women's health.

It is even worse when the FCC, under its public interest mandate, decides to put its[[Page H575]]thumb on the scale in favor of one technology sector or another, often without providing reasonable evidence that its intervention is necessary and appropriate.  While I have faith that Chairman Pai will bring about real reform at the FCC, without legislative changes, I am afraid that this type of jury-rigged rulemaking will return under a future administration. That is why I have supported this bill each time it has made its way through our committee and each time it has come to the House floor. I believe that strong process can restore the agency's integrity and rein it back in the interest of the stakeholders and the society that it should serve.  The bill requires the FCC to conduct a notice and comment rulemaking in order to adopt clear rules to guide its own process. By giving the FCC flexibility when setting procedures and deadlines, we are not hamstringing the agency; rather, we are providing them with goals to meet and allowing them to determine the best way to meet those goals.  We are asking the FCC to consider and adopt rules for itself that would provide clear deadlines on starting and stopping comments, clear deadlines for resolving petitions filed by the public, clear notice of status to those affected by petitions and rules, and clear schedules of statistical reports.  The bill also requires the FCC to consider publication of Commission documents to be considered at an open meeting and to consider whether cost-benefit analysis just might improve their rulemakings.

Today we are considering a very worthy piece of legislation, which has been introduced in each of the last two Congresses by Vice Chairman Barton, Vice Chairman Lance, and Representative All of them have put a lot of hard work into this bill, and I thank each of them for their dedication in pursuing a much-needed update to the Truth In Caller ID  Spoofing is the act of altering the number that will appear on the receiving end of the caller It is a trick that has been around for more than a decade. Spoofing provides a false identity to bad actors and criminals who seek to harass and defraud our hardworking taxpayers, oftentimes through various scams.  Sometimes the scams are elaborate, and other times they are simple. But these schemes are all petty; and once carried out, they are criminal. Spoofing lets the bad guys disguise their identity and will often pose as official entities, such as credit card companies, hospitals, and government agencies to target their unsuspecting victims. These crooks regularly target seniors and use intimidation tactics to extract personal and financial information.  The FCC has the authority to levy penalties and criminal fines against individuals that use fake caller ID information for the purpose of defrauding or harming another. However, current law only covers traditional voice calls. While this was considered a good fix when it was enacted in 2009, the Truth in Caller ID Act no longer sufficiently protects consumers. New communication methods and an evolving consumer trend towards text messaging have left the law with significant holes for the fraudsters to fly through and avoid prosecution.  H.423 would extend and clarify provisions of the Truth in Caller ID Act to include text messages and Voice over Internet Protocol services and would also apply the penalties to violators outside of the United  The bill would also seek to make it more challenging for those using fake caller ID information. In the past, you needed to have advanced skills and expensive equipment in order to spoof. Nowadays, it isn't hard. All someone needs to have is a smartphone and access to any of the various apps on the market that can instantly generate a fake caller  This is another classic case where technology has outpaced the laws that govern it. We will never be able to legislate ahead of technology advancement, nor should we try to do so. But when we find areas where legislation can help shield our consumers and hold the bad guys accountable, it is incumbent on us to act.  I believe that the legislation we are considering today is a good next step in our pursuit of stronger protection for our consumers. This bill will not prevent spoofing and it will not make our constituents invincible from the related scams and harassment, but what this bill does is important. By updating the law to more accurately reflect today's environment, we will be equipped to hold violators subject to the penalty of law.  I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill.

Spoofing is a commonly used tool for a      number of illegal practices, including phishing for personal      information and swatting--calling in a fictitious crime in      progress in order to generate a police response. The original      Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 prohibits spoofing voice      caller identification.

Many Americans are now relying on text      messaging to stay connected, and this method of communication      has become a target for spoofing in much the same way voice      calls have been.       H.423 extends the provisions of the Truth in Caller ID      Act to include text messaging as well as Voice over Internet      Protocol services. The legislation, introduced by      Barton, Lance, and Meng, also addresses the growth      of services that allow users to knowingly transmit misleading      or inaccurate caller identification information by adding a      definition of ``spoofing service'' to the Truth in Caller ID            In amending H.423, the Committee significantly changed      the definitions of ``text message'' and ``text messaging      service.'' The changes are designed to exclude from these      definitions those online messaging services that use      traditional telephone numbers for the purpose of identifying      a user's account, just as other online services may use an      email address or username for a similar purpose. The excluded      services do not use telephone numbers to interconnect with      the public switched telephone network or enable communication      with individuals who do not subscribe to the same messaging      service. The Committee intends the Commission to devise its      rules using the meanings set forth in the legislation.      ``Short message service'' and ``multimedia message service''      should be narrowly interpreted consistent with current      industry standards (see, e.g., ETSI, Technical Specification,      3GPP TS 23.040 version 12.2.0 Release 12, ETSI TS 123 040      v12.2.0 (2014), available at www.etsi.org).       The Committee takes notice of the fact that the language      set forth in the version of H.423, as ordered reported, is      identical to the text relating to the same subject contained      in 253, the Communications Act Update Act of 2016, as      passed by the U.House of Representatives, on September 27,      2016. The House passed 253, as amended, by unanimous      consent. The foregoing discussion should therefore serve as      an explanation of that bill's provisions for purposes of      legislative history.             section-by-section analysis of the legislation       Section 1. Short title       This section provides that the Act may be cited as the      ``Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017''.       Section 2.

This section also requires the Commission, in coordination      with the Federal Trade Commission, to develop consumer      education materials regarding caller ID scams and      technologies that can help consumers protect themselves      against fraudulent activity.       This section also requires a Government Accountability      Office report on the actions taken by the Federal      Communications Commission and FTC to combat caller ID fraud.

296,topic-id,579,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  When disaster strikes, there is a lot of hard work to be done, and every second counts. First responders go into action for those that need help. Relief organizations and volunteers rush in to begin the process of cleaning up. Utilities and service providers must be on the ground repairing damaged infrastructure.  All of these mission-critical tasks require a functioning communications network. People turn to the network for potentially lifesaving information and rely on its functionality to reach emergency services.  We are here today to consider this bill. Representative Pallone--I want to give some credit to him--has been a champion of following the eye-opening effects of Superstorm He has worked tirelessly on this legislation since October 2012.  In total, the Sandy storm resulted in roughly $74 billion in damages in the U.alone. Sometimes we forget the magnitude of that storm. Damage to power and communications infrastructure, it knocked out about 25 percent of the cell sites in its path. In some of the hardest-hit counties, 50 percent of those sites were down.  When the networks go down, public safety communications and emergency response services are threatened. In order for the networks to get back up and running, telecommunications providers need access to critical resources and permission to enter the disaster area.[[Page H580]]  The chaos immediately following a major disaster makes it challenging to obtain resources and entry to the affected area. What we saw after Sandy were communication providers being turned away from the disaster area and denied resources because they were not considered essential to the recovery effort. This bill seeks to change that.  In the wake of Sandy, and as a result of repair workers being barred from the recovery effort, communication networks remained offline for hours and, in some cases, days longer than need be. This left those who were still vulnerable in the disaster area without critical information and no means to call for help.  There are numerous entities that are essential for the rescue and recovery phase following a disaster. The affected area needs power. Water is critical. The bill would clarify that communications networks are also an essential service.  Whether it be wireline, mobile telephone, Internet, radio or television, communication services play a key role in facilitating recovery. In some cases it can be the difference between life and death. By defining these types of providers as essential, telecommunication companies will be granted the access and resources needed to get their networks back online.  The bill would also require the FCC to conduct a study on the feasibility and benefits of making WiFi access points available to the general public to access 911 services during times of emergency.  I would also like to recognize that the original version of this bill included a number of wireless provisions designed to increase preparedness. These provisions were removed, however, because the five largest wireless carriers voluntarily adopted these provisions.  H.588, in its current form, combined with the voluntary framework established by the wireless carriers, leaves us with a strong, bipartisan bill that will improve the resiliency of our Nation's communications infrastructure to avoid a recurrence of the widespread and extended service outages, as experienced in the aftermath of Superstorm  I thank our colleagues from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for working with us on this bill, and I urge the support of my colleagues for the legislation.

1346,topic-id,723,"Mr.Speaker, we are seeing from coast to coast demonstrations, protests, with people speaking out against the outrageous, reckless, and cruel executive order promulgated by the administration on It is wrong, and it is immoral on so many levels. It is hard to know where to start.  I just left my office with the president of the Western States chiropractic college--the largest such institution in the country--Joe Brimhall has a number of students who are dual citizens who need to leave the United States to take their board-certified tests next week in He doesn't know what to tell them. Pursue their professional career and maybe not be able to come back to the United States and finish at the college? It is embarrassing that we can't give him guidance about this ill-thought-out and reckless executive order that wasn't planned and still is having the details worked out.  But perhaps the worst aspect of this blanket cancelation is as it affects Special Immigrant Visas for Iraqis who are waiting to come to the United Whatever you think about the Iraq war, the men and women in Iraq who volunteered to help our forces were essential. They were guides, they were interpreters, and they worked on the projects. We could not have done the job over there without them. In many cases, they blended into the units in which they served. I have had cases where our soldiers have described to me how these people literally saved their lives.  I have heard from veterans who care deeply and wonder about the signal that they are sending to people they regarded essentially as family. They wonder how this administration could have forgotten about them. The guard in my office in Portland, who is a veteran, was asking me what is going on. He recalled his story about an interpreter who was critical to him when he served in How could we have forgotten them?  I will tell you somebody who has not forgotten them are the Taliban and the ISIS terrorists. They regard these people as traitors. The terrorists have long memories, and want to make people pay for helping the United We have seen countless examples of these people being hunted down by terrorists. They have been assaulted, they have been kidnapped, they have had family members held for ransom, and they have been murdered.  That is why I have worked on a bipartisan basis for 10 years establishing the Special Immigrant Visa program with the late Senator Kennedy, with Senator John McCain, Senator Shaheen, my Republican colleague Adam Kinzinger, and Congressmen Stivers and Hunter who were veterans themselves and understood why this program was important.  There is a lot of talk about extreme vetting. Trust me--the applicants for these visas are extremely vetted, taking 2 and 3 years, sometimes longer, fighting the bureaucracy, trying to make sure that they can escape to safety. Many have been killed because the extreme vetting process took so long.[[Page H757]]To turn their lives upside down and put them at risk because there are people in the White House who don't understand or who don't care is appalling.  I applaud my colleagues in both parties who are speaking out and asking the administration to come to its senses on this blanket ban of Muslims from seven countries--seven countries, by the way, that have not been involved with terrorist acts. This is not going to make us any safer. Some have speculated that some of the countries that have been left out, like Saudi Arabia, where most of the 9/11 terrorists came from, were left out because the President has business interests there.  I don't know why these countries were selected, but the fact is it should end today. It should end not just because of the brave men and women under the Special Immigrant Visa program from Iraq whose lives are now at greater risk because of this reckless act. It is wrong because of the signals we are sending to foreign nationals whom we rely upon. It is not just in We have people who work for the United States who live in many other countries who help us with the State Department programs and with the military.

855,topic-id,896,"Mr.President, this past Sunday we celebrated the 44th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, a ruling that assured every woman of her constitutional right to make her own decision about whether and when to have a child. That fundamental constitutional right is the right to privacy, which all women should cherish and protect.  This weekend, in fact, many of us in Washington, DC, and around the country marched in the streets of our home States--or here, as I did--in support of these ideals and values, including the right to privacy, other civil rights and liberties, economic opportunity, and women's access to health care, which truly make America great.  Fundamental to the principle of women's access to health care is the Roe v. Wade decision that reaffirms the constitutional right to reproductive decisions made by women individually on their own in consultation with their health care providers, their families, their clergy. I was a clerk for Justice Blackmun in the term after Roe v. Wade was decided, and I can tell you that we all believed then very strongly that that Supreme Court decision would put to rest the question of legal access to abortion in this great country.  In fact, it did not. Despite 7 in 10 Americans opposing the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade according to a recent survey by Pew Research Center, the outliers and extremists still seek to eliminate the right to legal abortion. That broad public support was embodied in the spirit and dedication shown over this past weekend by protesters across the world, and I was reminded yet again that we must continue to fight for what we believe, particularly in light of the ongoing threats to and attacks on women's health care.  Efforts to undermine these rights have redoubled in recent years, and throughout the past decade we have seen unprecedented attacks through State efforts to chip away at that vitally protected constitutional right. From 2011 to 2016, there were 334 restrictions enacted by States that would cut back on Roe v. Wade rights, accounting for 30 percent of all abortion restrictions since the U.Supreme Court decided that case.  The force dedicated to enacting these restrictions, which are designed to undermine the right to reproductive health care, can be particularly disheartening as they disregard the health needs of the most vulnerable population of the women who are most often impacted, by also seeking, or at least claiming to seek, to advance women's health care. In fact, many of those restrictions are a ruse. They are enacted in the name of health care but are a disguise for restrictions on health care. They have left many women, particularly in rural and underserved locations, with little access to health care, including basic care such as cancer screening, STD testing, and preventive health care. Clearly, improving women's health care has failed to be the focus of State legislatures in these instances, as they have actively worked to restrict access to care and chip away at the constitutional protections provided in Roe v.  I joined with Senator Murray in leading a total of 163 Members of the House and Senate in filing an amicus brief in the case of Whole Woman's Health v. Last summer, the Supreme Court overturned the restriction at issue in that case, reiterating and clarifying the ``undue burden'' standard in Roe and debunking the lie that anti-choice extremists have been pushing for years--that medically unnecessary, onerous restrictions on clinics and clinicians that provide women abortions do not make women safer. In fact, they simply constrain access.  I am hopeful that this decision will help stem and stop the assault on women's health care taking place in so many States and communities around the country. So I am joining with my colleague, Senator Murray, who was here just minutes ago--a wonderful champion of this cause--as well as Senator Shaheen, whom I believe will be speaking later today on Roe v. Wade's anniversary, in pushing back on this policy by introducing legislation to permanently repeal the global gag rule that the Trump administration, as one of its first acts, has announced, which will reverse much of the progress that President Obama made in relation to international family planning. This legislation will seek to move that progress forward again and forestall the effort to roll back that process and turn back the clock. I will oppose any and all efforts by the Trump administration to move our country backwards, including yesterday's reversion to the global gag rule.  This 44th anniversary of Roe v. Wade should be a reminder about the importance of fighting for the right of privacy, the right to live life free of governmental interference, and, as one of our Supreme Court Justices said, the right to be let alone--in effect, let alone from government interference.  It is a right that I have fought for and that so many others have fought for throughout my career and throughout my time as a Senator and the attorney general of It is a right we should all continue to keep at the forefront of our work here in the Senate and for all of us in this country.

1279,topic-id,901,"Mr.President, I am honored to follow that very eloquent speech by my colleague from Colorado and to be followed on the floor by our colleague from  We are here today with stories. Every one of us has a story going back one[[Page S474]]generation, maybe two or three, maybe five or ten, but we all have an immigrant story. Most of those immigrant stories are about people coming here to seek hope, opportunity, and, yes, safety; to escape violence and persecution; to come here for refuge.  I met one of those refugees over this weekend in West Hartford at a Holocaust remembrance ceremony. Abby Weiner is a Romanian Jew who survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald but lost his parents there. He was honored by Voices of Hope at this Holocaust remembrance ceremony at a synagogue in West Hartford, attended by 500, 700 people. There was a massive outpouring of support for him and for the values that are represented by people who come here as immigrants fleeing persecution and violence, as he did in Nazi He said: The words came before the bullets and gas chambers. The words of Nazi Germany came before the bullets and gas chambers. Words have consequences. Edicts and orders have consequences.  When I spoke, I told my own story--a proud story of my father, who also came here from Nazi Germany in 1935. He was 17 years old. He spoke virtually no English, he had not much more than the shirt on his back, and he knew almost no one. This great country, the greatest in the history of the world, gave him a chance to succeed. He was a proud How sad and ashamed he would be today to see actions by the President of the United States that ban a group coming to this country based on their religion--a ban that is antithetical to our history, our values, our Constitution, and the rule of law.  I salute Sally Yates, who has taken a stand based on moral and legal principle in the highest tradition of the Department of Justice, saying that these orders cannot be defended and that the rule of law and morality is more important than the politics of the moment and the impulsive edicts of a ruler who apparently fails to understand that law--or, at least his administration does.  It raises the question of whether the next Attorney General--she is only acting--will have the strength and courage to uphold the rule of law. Tomorrow, I will vote against our respected and admired colleague, Jeff Sessions, because I believe that the next Attorney General must be a champion--a steadfast advocate and protector of the rule of law and rights and liberties that are overridden and abridged by this order banning people from Muslim-majority nations, in effect a ban on a religious group.  We are better than this kind of discriminatory edict. We know it harms mainly children and families fleeing violence and oppression. Refugees like those children have helped to shape and build this We are stronger because of our diversity. We are a nation of immigrants. Our strength comes from the talents, energies, strengths, and vibrancy they bring to this country.  Often, when I am feeling down about our public life, I go to immigration and naturalization ceremonies. They occur every Friday in courts around the State of I welcome people who are becoming citizens, and I say to them: Thank you for becoming a citizen of the greatest country in the world. You are a source of strength for us, and you have taken a test that most Americans could not pass.  They laugh because they know it is true. They will never take for granted what it means to be a citizen of this country. I look at them in their diversity, and I know that is That is our future.  We will be less safe because of this order, which will alienate allies and deny us sources of intelligence to troops on the ground that we need to win the war against ISIS, and we must win that war. It will provide a recruiting tool to ISIS, convincing young people who may be tempted to join their ranks that, in fact, this country is engaged in a war against Islam, which is utterly and totally untrue. It will discourage people from within the United States who are part of the Muslim community from coming forth when they see threats and could provide information that would forestall an attack by violent extremists within our country.  This order makes us less safe, but it weakens us mainly in a deeper moral sense: It is wrong. It is wrong for this great country, devoted and founded on the ideals of welcoming people seeking that beacon of hope and protection and opportunity.  The Statue of Liberty is a symbol, but the ideals and the values are living. The damage that has been done to them can be repaired. We must repair it and reverse this order.

He is the symbol in a sense, the chief voice and advocate around the world of The Secretary of State is in a sense our representative to the world, embodying and promoting, hopefully, the best in America to billions of people around the globe, proving to the world yet again that America is exceptional, that we are the greatest country in the history of the world, and that we have a respect for the rule of law, for human dignity and rights for all, including the right to live in a safe and free environment.  Past Secretaries of State have changed history, averted and navigated war, brokered peace, championed human rights, and fought to make the world a better place. In this time of immense uncertainty, we must demand nothing less of our next Secretary of State than that he be a great reflection and representative of the United States to the world.  The likes of Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright, George Marshall, and Charles Evan Hughes have all held this position. To join these titans or even to aspire to their position is no small challenge. We need a candidate who will continue to embody what is right even in the face of resistance from adversaries and foes who do not admire and, in fact, seek to do harm to our way of life.  As ExxonMobil's CEO, the President's nominee, Rex Tillerson, has worked hard and successfully for his corporation. In fact, he has put that corporation's interests ahead of America's interests. That may have been his job, and I understand that was his job description, but doing that job well does not qualify him to be our Nation's chief diplomat and to assume the mantle of defending our national interests.  Having worked for four decades for this oil giant, without any government experience, I am unconvinced that Mr.Tillerson has shown he is able to reverse this oil interest mindset and put America's needs before his former employer. I do not have faith that he can rise to the paramount challenge of representing us on the world stage.  I share my colleagues' concerns. We have heard numerous of our colleagues express the same view--that his oil interests will harm the progress we have made to protect the environment and slow the impact of climate change. I say that reluctantly because I hope I am wrong. He is likely to be confirmed, but I hope my colleagues think hard and long and join me in opposing Rex  I am also hopeful that a number of his other stances, such as enforcing sanctions that hold our adversaries accountable--notably, Russia and Iran--will change as well. These stances have been troubling. I have little confidence that Mr.Tillerson will vigorously enforce these sanctions and even less confidence that he will guide President Trump to provide the crucial advice our demonstrably rash and ill-advised President needs.  I want to point particularly to some of the tactics ExxonMobil used in its litigation against legal challenges that were brought based on climate change information that allegedly was concealed by These tactics are deeply troubling, and I hope that maybe the toughness of ExxonMobil in those tactics will be replicated in the toughness that is brought to bear in enforcing the sanctions against Iran and Russia because he has shown a troublesome trend of opposing sanctions that have held Iran accountable--sanctions that pushed Iran to the table in negotiating the Iran nuclear agreement, which has made our world a safer place.  Across decades and administrations, the Senate reached an overwhelmingly bipartisan consensus that the Iran regime should be aggressively sanctioned for its global missile program, state sponsorship of terrorism, and gross human rights violations. ExxonMobil directly and together with other global oil companies and through the financing of third-party advocacy organizations has persistently tried to stop Congress from passing sanctions legislation.  ExxonMobil has been a board member of USA Engage since its founding in 1997 and from 2003 to 2007 held the chairmanship of that organization. For two decades it has actively lobbied Congress to oppose Iran-related sanctions bills, including last year for at least four such pieces of legislation.  ExxonMobil has worked to prevent the authorization and extension of the Iran sanctions act, which I am proud to say was renewed for another 10 years by Congress, becoming law just a few weeks ago, and I was proud to support it. Yet, during Mr.Tillerson's hearing, he denied that ExxonMobil ever lobbied against Iran's sanctions, in the face of facts to the contrary. As Ronald Reagan said, ``Facts are stubborn things.''[[Page S531]]  Foreign policy experts and military leadership have explicitly identified Russia as a growing threat and a violator of international law. Many of us in this body--in fact, I would say the majority--have recognized that fact. Yet Mr.Tillerson does not seem to treat Russia with the same gravity.  We need a Secretary of State who is going to work with our NATO allies and stand up for us and not give Putin a pass. We are all aware of Mr.Tillerson's inappropriate stance toward relations with a country responsible for assaults on world order through cyber attacks, illegal land grabs, and war crimes. We are the victims of a cyber attack by Russia, an act of cyber war. The Secretary of State must be somebody who regards that kind of attack as intolerable and unacceptable.  Mr.Tillerson's affinity for Russia is alarming because he adds to the growing list of Putin admirers in this administration, and that list unfortunately includes the President himself and National Security Advisor Michael  Mr.Tillerson's opposition to sanctions imposed on Russia for its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 was not the result of national security concerns but, rather, because ExxonMobil stood to make millions, even billions of dollars from the business deal that corporation had recently made with Russia to develop its oil and gas interests. What is good for ExxonMobil is not necessarily good for the United States of These sanctions were put in place because Russia's invasion of Ukraine was unacceptable and now has led to at least 10,000 deaths, 20,000 wounded, and 2 million people displaced.  These are hard numbers and hard facts--the result of Russian aggression that must be countered.  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have fought to include and pass the NDAA's robust funding for Ukrainian assistance. I am proud to say that this initiative was successful. I also successfully urged a provision that terminated U.contracts with the Russian arms export agency.  Mr.Tillerson made it clear during his nomination hearing that his stance was unchanged. He could not admit that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal, despite these deaths and the torture involved in this aggression and other similar acts, or to say that the sanctions against Putin's Russia are necessary and appropriate. His views are inconsistent with the interests of the United States of  Given his troubling trend of dodging questions during his testimony, I cannot confidently say that he will follow the clear direction of Congress concerning sanctions policy. I will say bluntly and frankly to my colleagues that my particular concern is that sanctions laws contain waivers. Those waivers are provided to the President for the rare requirement that such sanctions may be waived when it is in the national interest or for national security. This exception must be used exceedingly sparingly and judiciously. Sanctions without enforcement are worse than no sanctions at all. They are meaningless, and they raise false expectations. My fear is that under Mr.Tillerson, if he is advising President Trump, those exemptions and exceptions will swallow the rule.  Talking about rules, if confirmed, Mr.Tillerson will be responsible for executing President Trump's extremely misguided policy expanding the global gag rule, which prevents foreign aid from being provided to global health programs that discuss or provide abortion services. The result will be to obstruct programs that cover everything from HIV prevention to maternal and child care and epidemic disease responses, putting lives at risk. This is just the opposite of what we ought to be doing. It makes the world less safe, as does this weekend's Executive order that bans refugees and We need someone willing and able to voice resistance and opposition to policies that flagrantly fly in the face of everything we value--our American values. We need a Secretary of State ready to stand up for the most vulnerable people and speak truth to power, even when that power is the President of the United The fact is, sadly, that Mr.Tillerson has never taken strong stances on these issues, leaving us guessing as to what he will do when and if he is in office.  I cannot support anyone to be Secretary of State who fails to condemn the suspension of our Refugee Resettlement Program directly under his purview. When we target refugees, we target people who are victims of the same oppressors and tyrants and murderers that we call enemies. Refugees are not our enemies. Many are fleeing the murderous Syrian regime and ISIL, which are our enemies. We are at war with ISIL, and we must win that war. We are disadvantaged by a policy that excludes refugees on the basis of religion, because we alienate our allies with the sources of intelligence and troops on the ground, and we lead to the misimpression--and it is a misimpression--that we are at war against Islam or our Muslim neighbors when, in fact, our enemy is violent extremists.  These refugees and immigrants see America as a beacon of hope, but they are now receiving the message that, whoever they are and however strong their claim to come here is, their religion will bar them, their religion denies them the right to come to this country, their religion will ban them.  Mr.Tillerson has never denounced this strategy when it does so much to damage our international credibility, our values at home, and our Four judges have stayed the President's Executive orders. My respectful opinion is that the President's orders are, in fact, illegal.  The question is this: Will he defend career diplomats who have spoken out against these policies? Will he take a stand himself against them? Will he stand up for American values?  One story in particular struck me because it involves my own State of Last Saturday, a Syrian refugee who settled in Milford, CT, 2 years ago, Fadi Kassar, anxiously awaited the arrival of his wife and two daughters, ages 5 and 8. He has not seen them since resettling in this country. His family was turned away before they could board a flight to the United They were told they were not going to be allowed to enter this country following the President's refugee ban. Despite having been granted refugee status--asylum--three days before the refugee ban, they would no longer be united with Mr.Kassar in the United  I am working--and I hope the Secretary of Homeland Security may be listening, if not at this moment then at some point in the future, to my entreaty that he do the right thing, that he make their entry possible. They have gone through all of the necessary screenings, submitted all of the necessary forms. Yet, under the President's Executive action, they are denied refuge in the United States based only on their nationality and their religion.  Mr.Kassar's family is now back in Jordan without luggage, without clothes, and without the new home they were so close to having. My office has offered assistance to Mr.Kassar's lawyers, and we are working to help in any way we can.  The United States--Connecticut in particular--has a proud moral tradition and heritage of aiding refugees who need our help when their own homelands are in turmoil. President Trump's egregious acts contravene our values, contradict our Constitution, and should be rescinded immediately.  Mr.Tillerson, join me in urging President Trump to rip up this order. It is the only solution.  I am not confident, until I hear him say so, that he is ready to be the leader we need in the Department of State to ensure that America's values of acceptance and assistance hold strong in an administration that directly challenges these most cherished traditions and values.  Our Secretary of State must be clear-eyed about threats facing our Nation, both from adversaries abroad and others who would do us harm inside our borders. I regretfully conclude that Mr.Tillerson has failed to demonstrate that ability to do so, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his nomination.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter,      President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow      Americans, andpeople of the world, thank you. We, the      citizens of America, are now joined in a great national      effort to rebuild our countryand restore its promise for all      of our people. Together we will determine the course of      America and the world for many, manyyears to come.       We will face challenges. We will confront hardships, but we      will get the job done.       Every 4 years wegather on these steps to carry out the      orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And we are grateful      to President Obama and FirstLady Michelle Obama for their      gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been      magnificent.       Thank you.       (Applause.)       Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning because      today we are not merely transferring power fromone      administration to another or from one party to another, but      we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving      itback to you, the people.       For too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has      reaped the rewards of government while thepeople have borne      the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share      in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but thejobs left and      the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but      not the citizens of our country. Their victorieshave not been      your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs,      and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital,there was      little to celebrate for struggling families all across our      land.       That all changes starting right here and rightnow, because      this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to      everyone gathered here today and everyone watching allacross      This is your day. This is your celebration. This,      the United States of America, is your country.       (Applause.)       What truly matters is not which party controls our      government but whether our government is controlled by the      people.January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the      people became the rulers of this Nation again.       (Applause.)       Theforgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten      no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the      tens ofmillions to become part of a historic movement, the      likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center      of this momentis a crucial conviction that a nation exists to      serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their      children, safeneighborhoods for their families, and good jobs      for themselves.       (Applause.)       These are just and reasonable demands ofrighteous people      and a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a      different reality exists: mothers and childrentrapped in      poverty in our inner cities, rusted-out factories scattered      like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation,      aneducation system flush with cash but which leaves our young      and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge, the crime      and thegangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives      and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.       This Americancarnage stops right here and stops right now.      We are one Nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams      are our dreams. Theirsuccess will be our success. We share      one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of      office I take today is an oathof allegiance to all      For many decades we have enriched foreign industry at the      expense of American industry,subsidized the armies of other      countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our      military.       We have defended othernations' borders, while refusing to      defend our own, and spent trillions and trillions of dollars      overseas while America'sinfrastructure has fallen into      disrepair and decay. We have made other countries rich while      the wealth, strength, and confidenceof our country has      dissipated over the horizon.       One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores,      with not even athought about the millions and millions of      American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our      middle class has beenripped from their homes and then      redistributed all across the world.       But that is the past. Now, we are looking only to      thefuture. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree      to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in      every hallof power. From this day forward, a new vision will      govern our land. From this day forward, it is going to be      only Americafirst--America first. Every decision on trade, on      taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to      benefit Americanworkers and American families.       (Applause.)       We must protect our borders from the ravages of other      countries making ourproducts, stealing our companies, and      destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity      and strength. I will fightfor you with every breath in my      body, and I will never, ever let you down. America will start      winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back      our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring      back our wealth.

We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire            (Applause.)       We willseek friendship and good will with the nations of      the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the      right of allnations to put their own interests first.       We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but      rather to let it shine asan example. We will shine for      everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form      new ones and unite the civilizedworld against radical Islamic      terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face      of the       (Applause.)       Atthe bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to      the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our      country,we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When      you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for      prejudice. The Bibletells us how good and pleasant it is when      God's people live together in unity. We must speak our minds      openly, debate ourdisagreements honestly, but always pursue      solidarity.       (Applause.)       When America is united, America is totally      unstoppable.There should be no fear. We are protected, and we      will always be protected. We will be protected by the great      men and women ofour military and law enforcement and, most      importantly, we will be protected by       (Applause.)       Finally, we must thinkbig and dream even bigger. In      America, we understand that a nation is only living as long      as it is striving.       We will nolonger accept politicians who are all talk and no      action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about      it. The time forempty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of      action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be      done. No challenge canmatch the heart and fight and spirit of      We will not fail. Our country will thrive and      prosper again.       (Applause.)       We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock      the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries      ofdisease, and to harness the energies, industries, and      technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir our      soul, liftour sights, and heal our divisions.       (Applause.)       It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will      neverforget--that whether we are Black or Brown or White, we      all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all enjoy the      same gloriousfreedoms, and we all salute the same great      American flag.       (Applause.)

On Saturday, I, too, joined the peaceful march in our Nation's Capital with hundreds of thousands of women and men. Millions more marched in Oregon, across the country, and around the world to demand that our voices be heard.

It will disproportionately affect low-income women, young women, women of color, women in rural communities, and immigrant women. This bill turns back the clock. It puts women's lives at risk.

76,topic-id,1994,"Mr.President, I join with my colleagues today. I appreciate the Senator from Oregon and his remarks. I join with him and the others who have spoken to express my grave concerns about the nomination of Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection  It is really unacceptable to me that someone who denies climate change science could be put in charge of an agency that is really tasked with advancing our national strategy to address climate change and the ills resulting. Mr.Pruitt has said--the overwhelming evidence to the contrary--that the debate is far from settled. He denies what is happening in regards to the evidence and the science and the conclusions of the near consensus of scientists.  Time and again, this attorney general from Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt, has filed suits actually to block the EPA's clean air and clean water regulations protocols, which have allowed the United States to lead the efforts to reduce carbon emissions and address the climate crisis we face.  There are few issues, in my opinion, that are as urgent as this, and across the globe that we must meaningfully do something collectively about. America must lead and not have a leader on this issue that is now so far out of step with global consensus. Everyone, from scientists and climate experts to business leaders and even our own military officials, understands that climate change is a real threat, not just to our environment but also to our economy, to the health of our people and our national security.  It is disturbing that, in a way--and it also defies common sense--if you hear the way some people talk about climate change, including our President-elect and Mr.Pruitt, you might think that not only is climate change not a problem but that it is not our problem. This could not be further from the truth. We are already, here in America, dealing with and seeing the very real impact of climate change.  Ask anyone living in my home State along the shore or a family in Louisiana whose home has been destroyed by severe flooding or a farmer whose land has become barren from the droughts in California whether or not these consequences are real for their families. Yet, the President-elect and Mr.Pruitt not only refuse to acknowledge the consequences that we are facing but the dangerous and destructive path ahead. They are failing to face that if we fail to act.  Now, the facts of climate change are worth repeating. Air temperatures are rising. Ocean temperatures are increasing. The ocean is becoming far more acidic. Sea levels are rising, both because of expansion of warming oceans and because of the melting of land-based snow and ice that is now entering our oceans. Many mountain glaciers are melting away and the Arctic sea ice is decreasing.  Climate change is an American issue and it is a global issue. Addressing climate change should be a cause where we find agreement across political and geographic divides. In many ways, it already is. We have seen 36 Noble prize winners come together in 2015 in a historic declaration on the threats of climate change. Brad Schmidt, winner of the 2011 Noble Prize in Physics stated: ``I see this issue as the single greatest threat to human prosperity.''  That is why, in late December 2015, 195 countries signed the Paris Agreement, a historic global agreement to meaningfully address climate change. That is why the Climate and Security Advisory Group, a nonpartisan group of 43 military and national security experts, including former military officials, spoke out to urge the next administration to ``comprehensively address the security risks of climate change at all levels of national security planning.''  That is why more than 300 American businesses--significant economic engines of our economy--sent a letter to the President-elect urging him to address climate change and to continue America's participation in the Paris Agreement, saying: ``Implementing the Paris Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing law-carbon investments into trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity to all.''  You see, that is the false narrative--that somehow people's working on the climate change issue is done at the expense of businesses. But business leaders understand that there is a tremendous opportunity in the new economy--in a green-energy economy. There is tremendous agreement that America should be leading on this innovation and these ideas, not following that of others around the globe.  They are health care folks who understand the challenges to American health. That is why the American Lung Association warned that ``climate change threatens the health of millions of people. While everyone is at risk for the harms of climate change and air pollution, those most at risk include infants, children, older adults, and those with lung disease (such as asthma and COPD), cardiovascular disease or diabetes. They are the ones who must rush to the emergency room when they cannot breathe because of worsened ozone pollution during a heat wave, or when smoke blows into their yard from wildfires that may be burning hundreds of miles away.''  When we talk about climate change, we aren't talking about ideology or opinion. We are talking about science and evidence. We are talking about national security. We are talking about creating greater economic prosperity, and obviously we are talking about public health.  America cannot sit idly by. We cannot be sidelined in this effort, not just because we produce such a significant amount of the climate-changing chemicals and byproducts but also because we don't want to shirk the opportunities of being a leader in this space. And the American people really understand this. They understand that this isn't a lose-lose, that this could be a win-win for America and the globe. And that is why, according to a Gallop poll from March of last year--it said clearly that the majority of Americans are worried about global warming, and the majority of Americans believe global warming is a result of manmade pollution.  I understand that for many people climate change is not an immediate urgency and reality, but, again, we should understand that right now, many of our more vulnerable Americans are suffering as a result. I see this when I go home from here in Washington to Newark has almost an epidemic level of asthma, with kids missing school because of this health and lung risk. The facts are clear: The pollutants kids breathe are real. For families living in communities on the shore in my State who are still rebuilding after Superstorm Sandy, the facts are clear: Their homes are being destroyed by unpredictable weather events. In New Jersey, we have seen the damage up and down our coast, with rising sea levels, flooding, and extreme weather.  We know that those who can least afford it--low-income, hard-working families--are severely impacted around the country. Communities that are poor, often minority populations, disproportionately endure pain and suffering related to changes in the weather due to climate change.  We know that when evacuation orders are given, those who can afford to leave their homes face a far different reality than those who have financial constraints.  Not only is it more difficult for working families to deal with climate-related issues, but the neighborhoods and communities in which they live are often the ones that are more affected by the rising temperatures and the pollution caused by climate change. One researcher who conducted a 2014 study[[Page S339]]on the effects of climate change reported that ``generally, higher poverty neighborhoods are warmer, and wealthier neighborhoods are cooler.'' We see that in cities in New  Multiple studies continue to show that poorer communities are more likely to be exposed to harmful pollutants than higher income communities. One study from the University of Minnesota found that Americans of color are exposed on average to 38 percent higher levels of outdoor nitrogen dioxide and that disparities in exposure amount to about 7,000 deaths a year from the health problems caused by these realities.  Climate change is already posing real dangers. The most recent National Climate Assessment released in 2014 noted that communities in rural America, as well as urban communities, have already experienced consequences of climate change, including ``crop and livestock loss from severe drought and flooding, damage to levees and roads from extreme storms, shifts in planting and harvesting times, and large-scale losses from fires and other weather-related disasters.'' The report concludes that ``these impacts have profound effects, often significantly affecting the health and well-being of rural residents and communities.''  In States like Oklahoma, for example, where the State legislature mandated a study on the potential impacts of climate change, the group commissioned to do that study, the Oklahoma Climatological Survey, definitively concluded the following:       The Earth's climate has warmed during the last 100 years.      The Earth's climate will continue to warm for the foreseeable      future. Much of the global average temperature increases over      the last 50 years can be attributed to human activities,      particularly increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.      Oklahoma will be impacted.  Undoubtedly, New Jersey, Oklahoma--where Mr.Pruitt is from--and the rest of our country and the world will continue to be impacted by this problem, especially if America does not lead and falls behind.  We have made great strides, though, in addressing climate change under President Obama, including critical tax credits for wind and solar energy that not only help deal with climate change but also help American businesses thrive and lead, with now more people being employed by solar than coal. We have the historic Paris agreement and EPA regulations to reduce emissions from the electric power and transportation sectors. We are making strides of which we all should be proud, and actually our economy is benefiting as a result.  The United States has now emerged as a global leader in meaningfully addressing climate change. We cannot afford to slow down this progress, but I am afraid that under the leadership of President-Elect Donald Trump, that is exactly where we are headed. Despite scientific evidence, popular concern, and the real-life impacts of climate change being evidenced in communities all across the country, all different backgrounds, from urban to rural, our President-elect and his nominee for the EPA, Attorney General Scott Pruitt, plan to advance special interests ahead of the common interest, of the global interest, of America's interests.  The United States has a long legacy of leading, being a global leader in times of crisis, and at a time when we see the realities of climate change, at a time when we and many scientists are concluding that there is a global crisis and military leaders are concluding that we have a global crisis, at a time when we are seeing the effect of that crisis being made real in regions across our Nation and our planet Earth, America must not waiver in its commitment.  I believe the Environmental Protection Agency deserves a leader who is prepared to lead--not deny, not retreat, not equivocate, not surrender ground that we have gained. We deserve to have an EPA leader who is just that--someone who stands up to lead, who makes the difficult choices and finds ways to unify our country, to pull from the wisdom of the military, the wisdom of businesses, the wisdom of communities like the one in which I live, and chart a course for this country that helps to lead the globe, lead planet Earth out of this crisis and into the strength we can find through American leadership. I believe that is the task: that we can save our environment and create incredible prosperity in the future.  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS335-2.txt,2194,ENSURING RELIABLE AIR SERVICE IN AMERICAN SAMOA,2017.0,17.0,January
1282,topic-id,5406,"Mr.President, I rise in gratitude for the opportunity to speak on the Senate floor. I want to express a lot of gratitude toward the Senator from She has been an advocate for the truth of our country. She has spoken here on this hallowed floor. I have now watched her speak in the streets, at airports, at rallies. She is one of those people--like so many Americans, literally millions of Americans over the course of these last few weeks--who is saying with the force of conviction that they will not be silent when the cause of our country is at stake.  I join with her tonight, along with some of my other colleagues, to stand up and really speak from the heart. I think this floor has seen many partisan speeches, but this is not going to be about Republican or This is not a speech I ever imagined I would be giving in the U.I never thought I would be here today talking about something that quite honestly was unimaginable to me just months ago.  This is a time I could not have foreseen, and I fear my generation of Americans maybe, perhaps, should have known that moments like this are possible; that we who believe in the values of our Nation, we who believe in the ideals enshrined in our Constitution, such as religious liberty, we should know that every generation of Americans has to prove worthy of these ideals and stay forever vigilant in their protection and never get so complacent as to think that this could never happen. The ideals we enjoy were fought for and struggled for and often bled for and died for. We of our generation who have the privileges we enjoy, the blessings of liberty that we luxuriate in, we have the obligation to stay the course to ensure that these moments never come, and when they do, that we stand with conviction to speak out against them, work against them to resist any retrenchment of American values.  What Donald Trump did in this Executive action issued this past Friday is, in no uncertain terms, a break with American policy. I believe it is a violation of our very Constitution, that it is illegal, unconstitutional, as well as immoral. More than this, it very specifically makes this Nation less safe and not more so. I want to repeat that. It makes this Nation less safe and not more so.  The ban was put forth in a climate of fear, intending to try to appeal to people's fears, trying to tell people that doing this Executive order was going to make us safer, but in its essence it is illogical when you look at the facts. Not only should it be known that it blocks immigration from seven majority Muslim countries--seven countries. Not a single perpetrator of terrorist attacks on American soil has come from these countries, dating back to well before 9/11. In fact, well before 2000, well before the nineties, well before the eighties and, in fact, not since the seventies, in over 40 years, no American has been killed on American soil by any of these countries in terrorist attacks.  In addition to that, what this ban is doing is it is shutting down the Refugee Resettlement Program for about 4 months and suspends the Syrian refugee program indefinitely, despite the fact that individuals entering the United States as refugees undergo the most heavily vetted resettlement process of anybody traveling into the United  So understand this. If you are trying to come into this country through student visas, Visa Waiver Programs, there are so many ways to come into this country without going through the refugee process, which takes between 1 year and 3 years, and you are not just going through the vetting of the Department of State but also the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center, numerous agencies for over up to 3 years are vetting you. Let me tell you right now, again, people who go through this[[Page S480]]program, history is showing, you have not seen in any recent years that folks going through these programs pose a terrorist threat or are taking American lives. So the very argument being used to push this ban is illogical and has no basis for any of the experiences we have had in this country.  A former chief counsel for U.Citizenship and Immigration services remarked that no competent terrorist would choose the U.refugee process as a preferred strategy for gaining entry into this country. Subjecting yourself to the 1 to 3 years of vetting from multiple agencies, more than any other way to enter, is not a way for terrorists to try to gain access to this country at all.  What we see is that this terrorist ban is putting focus--excuse me, this Executive order is putting focus in areas that do not produce safety but do have the collateral consequence of making us less safe.  The order indefinitely suspends the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United The majority of these folks are women and children who are fleeing barrel bombs, chemical attacks, military attacks on homes and schools. They are fleeing famine, they are fleeing starvation, they are fleeing the same violent extremism that we ourselves are trying to fight against. While the Syrian people face violence, terror, and oppression, the President has chosen to equate helpless refugees with those who are actually perpetrating the terror. Despite the fact that we have this stringent years-long vetting program for Iraqis and Afghans who risked their lives to help Americans by acting as interpreters, the ban ends--astonishingly, it ends a Special Immigrant Visa Program and substitutes it with nothing.  What is this Special Immigrant Visa Program that many of my colleagues have spoken about? It is a program that is specifically there for Iraqis and Afghans who helped America and put their families in danger, who put their necks out for us. They put themselves out there to assist our servicemen and servicewomen. It actually is there to help people who, because of their service to us and our country, now have their lives endangered where they are.  I want to read a series of tweets just yesterday from Kirk Johnson, a former USAID Administrator in Iraq who wrote about these folks who put themselves on the line for Americans who are our allies and our friends. This is what Kirk Johnson wrote:       I served in Iraq as USAID's man in Lived      alongside Marines and interpreters as they fought terrorists.       Over 100,000 of these Iraqis risked their lives for us      during the war. They bled for our country.       You said, before signing--  He is talking about President Trump--       ``We only want to admit those into our country who will      support our country, and love deeply our people.''  And what Kirk Johnson wrote follows:       I'd like you to know [Donald Trump] about some of these      people.       ``Homeboy'' lost his leg dragging a wounded U.SSgt from      MN out of the field of fire. He spent 4 years being vetted      before coming here.       Hossam helped us build schools. When insurgents found out,      in Oct `06, they left a severed dog head on his front step      that said ``run.''       Faisal, an interpreter for the troops you command [Donald      Trump], died of a suicide bomb on 3/14/2008.       Mohammed was assassinated when terrorists, who wanted to      kill the ``traitor'' booby-trapped his house in Jan 2008.       Ali had both his legs amputated by an IED blast while      working as an interpreter in Nov 2007.       Hameed died of a gunshot wound to the head while helping      our troops in July 2007.  I could do this all day, sadly.  He wrote in his remarks. He goes on to say:       Those that helped us were Christians, Muslims, Yazidis,      atheists, you name it.  These people in Fallujah and the surrounding areas were our allies.       When they ran through gunfire to save our troops, they      didn't think about such labels.       These Iraqis believed in They loved our country.      They lost their country as a result of the choice they made      to help us.       Your signature [Donald Trump] just banned them.  He continues:       I have heard from many, many soldiers and Marines (some of      extremely high rank) who believe this is a huge mistake.       One senior military officer with extensive experience in      Iraq and Afghanistan told me it was ``heinous and      counterproductive.''  Now why is it counterproductive? Well, for one, when we are conducting dangerous missions, when we are relying on people in country to assist us with our counterterrorism efforts, if they are going to take that risk, put their lives on the line, be subjected to terrorism themselves, there should be a process that allows them, after proper vetting, to get into this country. That has been American policy. Even people who have been threatened, victimized, and persecuted can't just walk into our country because some of our high-ranking Marines say so. They still go through vetting that often takes years. That is the process. It is a process that Donald Trump has now stopped.  Yesterday a report noted that radical jihadists--the people we are fighting against, the terrorists intending to kill us--were already using this Executive order as a victory, proof that the United States is at war with Now some people say that claim is hard to make. This is just banning people from seven countries. Well, look a little closer at the Executive order. There are exceptions made for non-Muslims in those countries.  Imagine this. We are the United States of Enshrined in our Constitution is this idea of freedom of religion; that there is no religious test to vote, there is no religious test to have citizenship, there is no religious test to enjoy the richness of a nation that believes in religious liberty. But in one action by the President of the United States, who claims to be concerned about terrorism from these countries, he says: I am going to stop people from entering. Oh, wait a minute, only Christians are welcome. If that is not a violation of core principles of freedom of religion that there should be religious tests to enter from these countries--that is an assault on all we proclaim in our country to be our core values.  This is not missed by our enemies. They are now trying to say this isn't a war between America and This isn't a war between America and radical jihadists. They want, as a propaganda tool, for people to believe that this is a war between the United States and Islam, between America and a religion. That is a lie. But when Donald Trump takes actions like this that specifically target people because of their faith, he is playing into the hands of the propagandists who seek to hurt us.  National security experts from across the political spectrum, from Republicans and Democrats, have spoken out against this order on this basis and on how it will affect our security as a country.  The former Director of the CIA, Michael Hayden, said of this order that it ``inarguably has made us less safe.''  Those people who want to help us, who want to serve with our marines, who want to be interpreters, who want to stand up for America, what are they to think now when America has shut its doors, when they have watched others do this, and now they can't gain access to this country? What about those allies of ours who say that the great United States of America is standing up against terrorism and Muslim leaders in other countries? But it is not about Islam; it is about the people who are conducting vicious terrorism, which is a sin on a peaceful religion. What can our allies say now, when we have specifically targeted an Executive order from our President not at a country but at a people who pray a certain way in that country?  What are we to think in the United States? This great Nation born from the ideas of liberty and freedom--freedom to pray as we want--what are we to think?  Despite all of the evidence to the contrary, just 2 days after President Trump instituted this ban, he remarked: Hey, this ban is going ``nicely.'' Earlier today, President Trump's spokesman referred to those being unlawfully detained as just being ``temporarily inconvenienced.''  We know that the reality of the situation is much different for the families and individuals across the globe who are affected. Many of them are permanent residents and green card holders for whom this Executive order has amounted to a door slammed in their face by the country that is supposed to represent the shining beacon on the planet Earth of liberty and hope.[[Page S481]]  Hundreds of people of seven different nationalities have been trapped at American airports. Many of them were detained for hours on end without access to lawyers; they were handcuffed and interrogated; some were immediately deported, while many more have been turned away at the doors to their flights bound for the United These are people who followed all of the rules, who went through extensive vetting, who upended their lives--doors slammed in their faces.  I am sorry, but this is not an inconvenience. This is a denial of process, a denial of procedure; it is a denial of basic liberty and a violation of our principles.  It is no wonder, though, that judges across the country began issuing stays within hours of this order becoming effective. As we saw in New York, how people like Hamidyah Al Saeedi, the 65-year-old mother of a sergeant--65-year-old mother of a sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division of the U.Army, who traveled from Iraq to see her son for the first time in 5 years. A mother of a sergeant in the 82nd Airborne--someone who should be honored--lawfully entered the United States, and because of this order, she was detained for 30 hours, denied a wheelchair, and handcuffed, before her release.  On Saturday night and early into the morning, I saw Customs and Border Patrol officials at I left Washington, DC, and drove to Virginia to go to Dulles I saw Customs and Border Patrol officials seemingly defy the orders coming from a Federal judge to at least permit all legal permanent residents in detention access to legal counsel. I held the judge's order in my hands. Because of the kindness of a local law enforcement officer who was stationed in Dulles, I was able to shuttle to Customs and Border Patrol, and I was then able to submit handwritten notes and questions to the officials who refused to meet with me. I did not get much of an explanation as to why they were defying a clear order from a Federal judge. Whether or not this was a case of bureaucratic confusion or a message from the courts getting lost, Federal law enforcement officers, under the supervision of the Department of Homeland Security, ignored and defied the orders of a Federal judge.  To me, this is more reason for outrage. In a Nation with three branches of government, the judiciary with a clear role giving an order to the executive branch, I believe the defiance of that order also was unconstitutional.  Access to counsel is a principle in our democracy. It is about fairness and due process. Failing to allow access to counsel, to me, seems a clear violation of constitutional norms and ideals. The judge obviously believes so, and that is why he ordered counsel to be provided.  Still, right now, we don't know how many people are being detained across the country in the wake of this Executive order or how many were immediately and quietly deported once they came here again, thoroughly vetted, in accordance with the law, but they were still deported upon their arrival in this country. I think Congress deserves answers. I wrote to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly earlier this evening to seek them.  This mistreatment of any legal permanent resident or visitors to this country is wrong. It is un-It undermines the truth of who we are. It is patently unacceptable.  This Executive order has treated green card holders and immigrants in this Nation as if they were criminals. It has torn families apart across the world and pulled the rug out from families who were preparing to begin a new life in the United States of And this order has betrayed some of our closest allies--men and women who risked their lives to help American servicemembers deployed often on hostile soil. Ending the special immigrant visa programs established to help Iraqis and Afghans who risked their lives to help American forces is unacceptable. The United States cannot turn its back on those who stepped up and stepped in when we needed them most.  Just this morning, I read about an Iraqi man, Sami, who had risked his life to work with the American Government in After waiting 7 years to gain entry, going through a laborious process of vetting under the special immigrant visa program, he and his family finally got the OK, and they were ready to start their new lives in On Saturday, he and his wife and two daughters had flown from Iraq to Istanbul, and they were sitting in their seats ready to take off when they were removed from the plane by security officials. Foreign Policy magazine reported that, through tears, Sami's 7-year-old daughter asked, ``Why don't they want us in America?''  American servicemembers and veterans are joining a growing core, speaking out against this misguided decision which threatens the commonsense program that helps our military do their jobs.  Take Zachary Iscol, a former Marine infantry officer who wrote about some of the Iraqis he worked with who had risked everything to help the United He told the story of one man, Frank, who had served as an interpreter for his Marine Corps unit and, in doing so, had taken a bullet in his leg. Frank had remained in Iraq since then. Zachary wrote:       He was still living in Baghdad with daily fears for his and      his family's safety. After six years of vetting, including      what seemed like countless interviews and background checks      by various government agencies, he had finally been cleared      to come to the United States with his pregnant wife and 18-     month-old son.  Zachary went on to write:       My wife and I began to prepare our guest room for their      arrival. But now, because of a new executive order by      President Trump, Frank is no longer welcome.  This is an American military man, preparing to have these folks who put their lives on the line for him, stay in his home.  This special visa program is why people like Mohammed and Saif Alnasseri, whom I am proud to call Jersey residents--two of my constituents--were able to come to this country. I would like to share a little bit about this family.  Mohammed Alnasseri was finishing high school in Iraq in 2003 when the Americans arrived. As an English speaker, Mohammed began helping the Americans stationed near his neighborhood, working for free as their neighborhood translator. When the unit he had become friends with left, he decided to apply for work as an official interpreter with the U.By 2004, he had been sent to Fallujah to work with and help protect American military fighting there. Because of his work with the American military, he recounts receiving hundreds of death notes, threatening not just his life but the life of his mother and his family.  He returned to Baghdad where he worked, despite these threats, as a contractor with an American company until one day he was targeted and almost assassinated in his car. He knew at that point, with the death threats and the assassination attempt, that he had to get out of the country.  After moving to Australia, his sister informed him about America's special visa program, so he applied, and 2\1/2\ years later he was able to join his family in the United  In a call with my office just earlier today, he wanted to make it clear that he arrived in the United States on July 3, and by August 10, he had started his job. He remarked to my team that he couldn't understand why anyone would think he was coming to America because it was easy or because he wanted something. He spent most of his savings trying to get to America, and he had never taken any benefit since arriving here.  Mohammed met his wife in New Jersey and now lives in our State, works at Costco, and is working to obtain his citizenship. He shared that this Executive order made him more sad than scared and that it simply didn't make sense to ban regular, hard-working people who are also afraid of terrorists, persecuted by terrorists, almost killed by terrorists, and who had done so much to help our country. It made no sense to them.  This is what he said: ``We ran away from these people. I paid all the money I had to leave.'' He did that for the safety of his family.  Mohammed's brother is now a proud American citizen, father of two, and resident of Scotch Plains, Saif and his wife had worked as pharmacists in Iraq, but when the war began, he knew he needed to get involved. So Saif worked as a translator and reporter for[[Page S482]]the Los Angeles Times during the war in Iraq, providing support and key insights to the American media and the American public. They were able to come to the United States in 2008 through that special visa program--the SIV program--and slowly worked their way through school. Now, as pharmacy technicians, they have their pharmacy licenses.  Saif is a pharmacy manager in Cranford, NJ, a homeowner in Scotch Plains, and a proud father of two girls. He savors this country, this precious He celebrates our values. He is a glowing testimony to the truth of who we are. His success is our success. His family's security and safety and thriving lives in New Jersey give luster to the greatness of  In a phone call yesterday, Saif remarked that this Executive order was embarrassing and hurtful, that it was clear Muslims were being targeted, and that he couldn't understand why those who were so heavily vetted like his family posed such a threat.  Saif and his family are heavily involved in their community in Scotch Plains, and they make sure to offer support to families similar to theirs who come from Iraq seeking refuge. They are not just basking and luxuriating in their good fortune to become American citizens; they are honoring one of the great hallowed traditions of our country, which is service.  At the end of the call, Saif remarked that ``[he] didn't think this would happen in any other country.'' It seemed like he was about to say this kind of religiously targeted ban wouldn't happen anywhere else, and he might have been right. But instead, he said that ``if this kind of executive order from a leader in any other country happened against any group of people, you would never see the kind of resistance and action of so many standing up for them.''  Even in one of the darkest moments in recent history, this man, this patriot, this person who served our Nation's interests and continues to volunteer in service to this day, could have every reason to be angry, upset, and cynical. But what is beautiful from our conversations with this man is that he hasn't given up faith. He still believes in the American people.  The beautiful thing about the conversations my staff has had with those New Jersey residents who once were serving our Nation in theaters of violence and terrorism, standing up for our military, for our press, victimized by terroristic threats, shot at, assassination attempts--these families now here in America witnessing this Executive order are saddened and embarrassed by it, but they are not giving up in their faith in That is our story.  I stand here today--dare I say, all of the Members of the Senate stand here today because of this tradition of our country, that even when we had dark chapters from our past where others in positions of power violated our values, the faith and activism and engagement of American people remained.  I dare say we are the oldest constitutional democracy on the planet God, the genius of our Founders who put on paper ideals that have been heralded for centuries on planet Newer constitutional democracies literally would study our Constitution and model their nations after elements of our I am sad to tell you that some of those countries' democracies have failed. They had the vaunted words, they put forth the same principles and ideals, but their countries' democracies have been overthrown, have seen despots who destroyed the very spirit of those ideals.  Why has America persisted? It is not just because of the documents that are sacred and so special in the course of human events. But what makes those documents true and real--because those sentiments are not just written on parchment; every generation has had them written on their hearts and have said: No matter what I may be experiencing in this country, I am going to dedicate myself to the principles and ideals, because as great as our Founders were when they founded this country in liberty and in justice and equality under the law, it didn't apply to everyone. It didn't apply to women. Native Americans were referred to as savages. African Americans were fractions of human beings. Yet the faith of a people in every generation worked to expand the concepts of liberty and freedom. They made the Constitution more real. They made our Union more perfect. They made our country's truth more true for more people.  It is why great poets like Langston Hughes wrote:       America never was America to me,       And yet I swear this oath--       America will be!  That is the call to the citizenry of this country.  There have been dark days in our past, but every generation of Americans, despite the dark actions of people in power, understands the truth that the power of the people is greater than the people in power. If we never lose faith in the ideals of this Nation, if we keep standing and working and sacrificing and struggling, every generation could advance the ideals of our country and make us more free and more true and more real for more people.  Last week, we saw yet another American leader shrink the ideals of this country, try to pull us backward to times past when we turned our backs on people fleeing persecution. What Donald Trump did is try to pull back on the ideals inscribed on that great statue that sits right next to New Jersey, the mother of exiles, who says in poetry, among other things, ``give us''--not ``Hey, you can come in'' but a demand:       Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning      to breathe free,       The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.  It is a demand to the world that we will take those who are oppressed, we will take those who are being violated, we will take those who are being victimized. A President turns his back on those ideals. We have seen it before.  Lauren Feldman wrote to me about chapters of dark pasts. She wrote:       Today is Holocaust Remembrance I am a My      relatives were unable to find refuge in our country and were      murdered by the My grandmother lost her beloved aunt,      Rokhl Rosnick Gertman, and an uncle and 4 young cousins that      she never met. Had we as a country done the right thing and      welcomed the refugees fleeing the Nazis, Tante Rokhl and      millions of others could have joined their family members in      safety and we could have been proud of our country, instead      of ashamed of the racist paper walls built by the FDR      administration to keep my family and others out.       Please tell Mr.Trump that we cannot go back. We must be a      beacon of safety and refuge for the persecuted. Please do all      that you can to prevent this ban from being enacted. Please      think of my relatives and the relatives of your other      constituents and fellow citizens who were needlessly and      shamefully murdered because of our fear and racism. We are      better than that. You are better than that.  She concludes, ``Thank you for your time and service. Lauren Feldman, Princeton.''  We are the United States of We haven't been perfect, but there has been a striving and a yearning in every generation to be more so.  I am a product of people Black and White, Christian and Jewish and Muslim, who, even though issues didn't affect them directly, knew that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. They marched and they fought. They sat in. They got on buses for freedom rides knowing they would be bombed. They tried to cross bridges, standing up against law enforcement, State troopers, Governors who dared them to try to pass them. There were implacable walls of hatred and racism, but they stood anyway, and they bled the southern soil red--for my freedom, for our freedom, for this Nation's freedom.  I have worked all my career for the safety of communities. Yes, we must make sure our Nation is safe. But don't let fear and concern for safety ever make us ever turn our backs on our values as a nation. When we are threatened by our enemies, it is not a time to surrender our values, it is time to double down on them. The terrorists win if they change our free hearts and our souls set on liberty.  We as a nation are called to be great, to be a beacon of liberty and justice. There are people now pulled off of airplanes, forced to return to communities where their lives are being threatened. We made a bargain with them: Stand for Stand with our military. Stand against terrorism.  There are people who went through years and years of vetting by agency after agency, and when they were on the brink of freedom, like people of old who were on ships that came into our harbor, they were turned away, back to[[Page S483]]face persecution and injustice. That is not the America I believe in. It is not who we are.  So I say to our President in prayer, in deep abiding faith: Repeal your Executive order. Stand up for our principles. Defend them. Be the champion millions of Americans want you to be.  I say to Americans, to all of us as a country: This is not a time to despair. It is not a time to give up. It is not a time to grow cynical or lose faith in our country or our values. No, remember our history. When dark times come, when it seems that people in the highest points of power are turning their backs on their ideals, it is not a time to retreat or equivocate, it is a time to fight, to stand up, to resist.  We are a great nation not just because of the words printed on a Constitution; we are a great nation because people with great sacrifice and struggle fought to live those words and to make them real in the lives of every single person.  America, we must now stand up. The opposite of justice is not just injustice; it is silence and indifference. This may not affect you or your family directly, but it is a threat to all of our collective values.  Go to the Jefferson Memorial and read those final words. Thomas Jefferson knew that for this Nation to be great, we had to pledge to each other an unusual level of commitment.

1684,topic-id,568,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss what happened in the Finance Committee today--or what didn't happen in the Finance Committee today. Two newspapers--one, the Columbus Dispatch, one of Ohio's best and most conservative newspapers, and the Wall Street Journal, one of this country's most conservative newspapers--reported that the two nominees in front of the Senate Finance Committee had lied to the committee. Treasury Secretary-Designee Mnuchin had lied when asked if his bank, OneWest, had done robo signings; he said no.  The Columbus Dispatch investigative reporters found, in fact, that they had done robo signings, and they found that dozens--probably hundreds, maybe thousands--of Ohioans lost their homes. A woman named Miss Duncan, who had paid her mortgage month after month, was doing everything right. She was foreclosed on--not anything of her doing--and her financial life was turned upside down.  The Wall Street Journal reported that Congressman Price, the designee for Health and Human Services, had lied about insider information he had. He had advantages that other investors didn't have in buying health care stocks as he sat on the health care committee in the House, as he voted, as he wrote amendments and bills dealing with health care.  These are nominees for agencies--the two most important economic agencies in the Federal Government, probably, at least in the Cabinet--who have lied about things that affect people's lives. It is hundreds of people--thousands, maybe, in my We are not even the largest State on foreclosures caused by Thousands, hundreds of thousands--who knows how many around the country, as he will not tell us yet--have lost homes because of his and his bank's actions, making him wealthier, to be sure, but upending people's lives in the cruelest kind of way when their homes are foreclosed on.  We are saying to Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Finance Committee: Get some answers here. Find out why these two nominees lied, and find out what they are going to do to fix it. Find out what they have in their backgrounds that they haven't disclosed to this committee.  We have no business voting on nominees before we have that kind of information. That is the reason that Democratic Senators of the Finance Committee, led by Ranking Member Wyden, decided not to come to the committee to vote today--because it is the only way we can get Senator Hatch to bring those two forward to give us the information and to give the American public the information they need.  I might add that we probably did President Trump a favor today, because if these two nominees had been brought forward--and I assume confirmed, because Republicans are voting for every nominee, it seems, no matter what; I haven't seen a break from that yet--they may have come to the floor and have been confirmed, and there likely would have been a scandal early in the Trump Administration and in the Treasury Department and Health and Human Services Department--two incredibly important agencies.  I think that we, perhaps, in some sense, saved President Trump from himself and the damage that his nominees could do. I don't expect appreciation or thanks from the White House on this, but I do think this is an issue that should be taken care of before they head two of the most important and largest--if not largest, two of the most important--Federal agencies.

435,topic-id,1235,"Mr.President, I rise today to support Mike Pompeo as the next Director of the And I thank my good friend, the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Warner, for his comments.  I will vary slightly from Senator Warner in that I think the committee process provided every member of the committee a sufficient amount of time and opportunity to ask and to have answered every question that one can query a four-term Member of the U.Congress, a member of the House Intelligence Representative Pompeo made himself available to every member on the committee for a private meeting in their office, to the best of my knowledge, with no time limit.  Representative Pompeo came to an open hearing--which is unusual for our committee, but we do that with nominees--with no time limit. He made himself available to a closed committee hearing with no time limits. He answered over 150 questions for the record. Every member of the committee was given a tremendous opportunity to ask everything and to have it sufficiently answered by the nominee.  Maybe we won't explain what went through the mind of my colleague from Oregon to claim that he hadn't had sufficient time, that there were more questions that needed to be asked, and he made the statement in the light of day. Trust me, most all of the hearings we had and the meetings the members had were in the light of day--it was before 5 p.m. and after 8 a.m. in the morning.  In fact, there is a little game going on with Representative Pompeo, and I think it is similar to what we are going to see with other nominees. But let me tell you why this ought to be different. This ought to be different because of what is at stake. The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency should be somebody who is above reproach, somebody who understands that integrity is everything--not just with the Congress of the United States but with the employees of the  This is an agency that operates in the shadows. The President gave a speech there on Saturday, and behind him as a backdrop were the stars of individuals who have no names, who have sacrificed their lives without recognition on behalf of the future of this[[Page S372]]country and the security of the United So it is absolutely crucial that we put somebody there who understands the value of the individuals but more importantly, the value of what they do for the security of  Representative Pompeo has been asked to lead what I believe is our Nation's most treasured asset. It is an agency that works in the shadows and requires a leader to be unwavering in integrity, who will ensure that the organization operates lawfully, ethically, and morally.  Just look at Mike Pompeo's background. He went to West He graduated 1 in his class. He left West Point and went to Harvard, where he became a lawyer, God bless him. He headed the Law Review at But he didn't pursue a legal career; he started an aerospace business and became the CEO of an aerospace business. He has had multiple successes in life, yet he ended up in public service. He ended up in the House of  When asked by the President on behalf of the security of the American people to serve at the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo said: Yes, sir, I will do it--only to come up here with a biography like I have read, with the trust and the integrity needed to fill the slot.  For Members of Congress to question whether this is the right fit, not because of the content of what he has accomplished but because they wanted to claim they hadn't had enough time--if we don't change this--and I say this in a bipartisan way--if we don't change this, good people will not respond ``yes'' when asked. If we continue to berate people who come here, because of things in their background that have no real, rational reason for exploration as to whether they can sufficiently do the job, then America stands a chance to lose the best and the brightest, regardless of where they grew up, regardless of the color of their skin, and regardless of their or their family's success. I say that to my colleagues in the hope that we will back off before we have done everlasting damage to our possibilities to get the right people here.  Representative Pompeo has honorably and energetically represented the people of the Fourth District in Kansas for three terms. He is on the House Intelligence House or Senate, I can't think of a Member of Congress who has traveled more around the world and spent more time at the CIA understanding the ins and outs of what they do, how they do it, and why it is important to the American people and to the security of this country, than Mike He is well versed on intelligence community operations, capabilities, and their authorities. He understands the nature of the threat we face here at home and abroad.  Some are going to question whether, in fact, his personal views that maybe there are events that will happen that will challenge Congress to change the laws are important. That is fine for him or me or for the President to question. The important thing is, How would he answer it if you applied it today? And his answer: I would follow the law. I wouldn't circumvent the law, I would follow the law, and the law says this today. Short of Congress changing the law, I will follow the law as it is today.  I am not sure you can have more clarity in an answer than that.  Mike Pompeo's intellectual rigor, honorable service, and outstanding judgment make him a natural fit for the As I said earlier, he is one of the most active, most engaged, and most charismatic individuals I have seen nominated in quite a while.  I ask my colleagues to support the nomination of Mike Pompeo as next Director of the Do it expeditiously. Treat him fairly. Don't paint him as for something he is not. He is a colleague of ours who worked hard to be here. He has a background of proof as to why the Fourth District of Kansas made an incredibly wise decision, but more importantly, Mike Pompeo is somebody who can contribute in a significant way to the security of the American people, the security of this country, and can, in fact, manage and lead at the CIA without concerns as to whether there is the integrity of the institution, without concerns as to whether he might step across the legal line of what is appropriate, that every day he is there following the rule of law in this country, someone whose primary focus is to make sure that we as policymakers and the President as Commander in Chief have the best intelligence possible to make decisions about America's future and about America's security.  I hope it won't take 6 hours today, but we are in the first hour of debate.

Through this program, he attended Millsaps College and Tulane University and went on to serve in the Navy aboard the USS  After serving, Lewis continued his education at the University of Alabama where he received a law degree, and, soon after, commissioned as a first lieutenant in the U.Air Force in 1951, serving as a legal officer in  Lewis Odom's career of service was only just beginning when he left the military.

Probably one of his most memorable accomplishments during his career on Capitol Hill was to plan and organize the inauguration ceremony for President John He often spoke of the great challenge and honor of that job.  Following his time on Capitol Hill, he served as deputy to the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or He was eventually appointed senior Deputy Comptroller of the Currency before retiring from Federal service in 1981.  After his years of service in the Federal Government, Lewis returned to practice law in Mobile, joining the law firm of Miller, Hamilton, Snider & That was when I met As a newly minted lawyer, Lewis took me under his wing and served as an important mentor.  Lewis was a thorough and exact lawyer who paid attention to detail and helped instill those traits in me and many others that he worked with. He inspired in me the confidence to hold myself to a standard of excellence, but he did so without being overbearing or harsh. He took a new lawyer and allowed me to gain invaluable experience.  As a young lawyer, Lewis taught me an important lesson that every young lawyer must learn: to choose your battles wisely. This lesson applied to more than just the field of law, however, and I have continued to use this principle in many of the other skills that I learned from Lewis throughout my life and career.  Lewis was also a true community leader committed to making Alabama a better place. From his first days in Mobile to his last, Lewis was ever present in the community, serving in any way he could, always giving his time and his devotion.  During his years in Mobile, Lewis served as the chairman of the Alabama Ethics Commission, the chairman of the Mobile water board, chancellor of the Episcopal Diocese of the Central Gulf Coast, and chairman of the Mobile Museum  He was also a strong supporter of the University of Alabama, serving as president to various alumni chapters and as a founding member of the Farrah Law Society for the University of Alabama School of  It is true that Lewis worked just as hard for his community in his retirement as he had earlier in his legal career.

We need a stable transition that will empower Americans to make the best health care decisions for their families.  In my home State of West Virginia, ObamaCare has been very difficult for many. It has meant skyrocketing premiums and skyrocketing copays and deductibles for families and small businesses. It has meant little, if any, choice of insurers. As a matter of fact, for the first several years, we had no choice. We now have two insurers in several counties, but in the beginning, the entire State had no choice.  It has meant fewer choices of doctors and hospitals, as networks shrink and plans become more restrictive. Now we must repair what can be fixed, scrap what is not working, and create a better health care reality for all  I have spoken with small business owners who have absorbed the cost of increased insurance, but their employees are getting less coverage.

As we move forward, I am working to balance each of these needs and ensure access in West Virginia and across the Nation to affordable, quality health care.  To achieve this goal, I am joining Senators Cassidy, Collins, and Isakson to introduce an alternative to ObamaCare which was introduced yesterday. It is called the Patient Freedom It sounds good. We are really good at making names that sound good, but the Patient Freedom Act lives up to its name.  The Patient Freedom Act of 2017 removes ObamaCare's most burdensome regulations. It provides our States, which are closest to the people who are accessing health care, the opportunity and funding to ensure that those currently covered by Medicaid expansion are protected and retain their health coverage. It returns authority to the States and provides more health care choices and better insurance options to individuals and families. It keeps important consumer protections, such as coverage for preexisting conditions, and extends coverage to children and dependents until the age of 26--both very popular parts of the It protects the Federal black lung benefits program, which is especially important in my State of West Virginia and the surrounding areas.  In addition to all of those important changes, it gives States a pathway forward for replacing Specifically, following repeal, which we know we are going to do, States will have three options. First, a State, if it so chooses, could choose to reinstate ObamaCare, or a State could go without Federal assistance and opt to not receive any Federal funding for tax credits or Medicaid expansion. Finally, a State could choose an innovative replacement plan where the State determines its own insurance regulations. In this scenario, the State would be eligible for 95 percent of the funds it would receive under ObamaCare, and the Medicaid expansion would be fully funded. For a State like West Virginia that has already expanded Medicaid, the State could either keep its Medicaid expansion as is, or they could convert it to subsidies to help individuals purchase the private insurance.  Under this plan, individuals would use a Roth Health Savings Account to purchase health care. This would enable uninsured individuals to purchase health insurance that meets their specific needs. States would have the option to auto-enroll uninsured individuals into a standard health care plan, with individuals able to easily opt out if they didn't want it. Auto enrollment would ensure stability and soundness to our insurance markets.  The Patient Freedom Act is a smart, innovative way forward and meets the varied needs of people in my State of West Virginia and across the country. The legislation reflects Senator Cassidy's experience as a physician, and I thank him for his innovation--he has worked with patients who are uninsured--and I appreciate his leadership so much, as I do Senator Collins in particular and Senator Isakson as another cosponsor. As other replacement plans are drafted and introduced in the Senate, I will evaluate those proposals to ensure they meet West Virginians' health care needs. I am committed to replacing ObamaCare with a system that offers us more choice. We can figure this out; we know what we need--lowers cost gives patients and families more control--because, together, we can achieve a health care system that works for everybody.

1250,topic-id,392,"Madam President, the Environmental Protection Agency, which bears most of the blame for regulations targeting energy jobs, is in dire need of a change of direction. The EPA under the Obama administration was unwilling to engage the people of West Virginia in public listening sessions or hearings about decisions that directly impacted our State's economy, and I have described what the result of that has been.  This failure to effectively engage resulted in a number of job-killing regulations, like the utility MATS rule for powerplants, the so-called Clean Power Plan, and the waters of the U.rule.  As the Presiding Officer knows, the waters of the U.rule is something that impacts not just mining but also agriculture, construction, and it really has far-reaching implications.  Scott Pruitt, who is President Trump's nominee to become the EPA Administrator, has gone through a thorough review process by the Environment and Public Works At Attorney General Pruitt's confirmation hearing, Senators from both parties were permitted to engage in as many as four rounds of questioning, and some of them were pretty tough. After the hearing, Attorney General Pruitt answered 1,078 questions for the Combining both the hearing and the followup questions, Attorney General Pruitt answered more than 1,200 questions from our committees.  Through the process, Attorney General Pruitt has shown himself to be a person who cares about applying our environmental laws as they were written and intended by He has a[[Page S465]]strong record of enforcing environmental statutes in a balanced way and ensuring clean air and clean water without unnecessarily sacrificing jobs or economic growth.  Attorney General Pruitt has been clear that he will work with State regulators and listen to the views of individuals who will be most heavily impacted by EPA's regulatory decisions.  I believe Attorney General Pruitt will keep his word and provide a refreshing change and direction for West Virginia coal miners, natural gas workers, manufacturers, farmers, and, indeed, for all of our communities struggling from the effects of overregulation.  I look forward to supporting Attorney General Pruitt's nomination in the EPW Committee, which will come before the committee on Wednesday morning, and I look forward to seeing him confirmed on the Senate floor soon.

1306,topic-id,1074,"Mr.President, the last 6 years have been devastating to local economies across coal country. The Mine Safety and Health Administration has estimated that at least 60,000 coal jobs have been lost since 2011, and thousands of these jobs have been in my home State of West  Excessive government regulation and other factors have done more than cost jobs. These policies have imperiled our coal miner retirement benefits, and they have left local governments struggling to keep up to pay for education, to pay for public works, and to pay for law enforcement. I can tell my colleagues story after story I have seen in our newspapers about this very thing.  In October, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee heard testimony from Wayne County, West Virginia commissioner Robert He said that the coal severance tax revenues in Wayne County in West Virginia--his county--dropped by 88 percent in 2013 and 2016. This drop left the county without a vital funding source that traditionally helped to pay for local volunteer fire departments, senior citizens programs, and education.  West Virginia University economist John Deskins told the Senate Energy[[Page S494]]and Natural Resources Committee in August that six West Virginia counties were suffering a depression--a depression--because of the coal downturn. And just last week, the State of West Virginia projected that its annual State budget faces a $500 million shortfall.  So what was the response of President Obama's administration in its last days in power? Yet another job-killing and anti-coal regulation that would make a bad situation in my State worse.  The Department of the Interior published its stream protection rule on December 20, 2016, and it made the rule effective on January 19, 2017--just 1 day before President Obama left office. There is a lot of irony here, and I don't think it is by chance. According to a National Mining Association Study, one-third of remaining coal jobs could be placed at risk by the rule.  Today I am proud to join Leader McConnell as he introduces the Stream Protection Congressional Review We are also joined by my colleagues in the West Virginia congressional delegation, including Congressman David McKinley and Congressman Evan Jenkins, and others. We are going to be introducing a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, blocking the Obama administration's stream protection rule.  Once this resolution of disapproval is passed by Congress--and I believe that it will be, and signed by President Trump, which I believe that it will be--I am confident that both things will happen: The stream protection rule will be nullified, and the Department of the Interior will be prohibited from imposing a similar rule without permission from  The stream protection rule deserves to be eliminated through the Congressional Review Act process. Despite its title--because why would we get rid of something called the stream protection rule--this rule will do little to actually protect our streams, but if left in place, this rule would cost even more coal jobs in my State and across the country that have already been devastated.  West Virginia's former Department of Environmental Protection secretary Randy Huffman told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on which I served last Congress, that the proposed version of the stream protection rule was ``an unnecessary, uncalled for political gesture.''  I would like to say that Secretary Huffman was serving under a Democratic Governor in my  The stream protection rule is the result of an incredibly flawed regulatory process that excluded State officials. Of the 10 States that began the regulatory process--people were asked to join together to begin this process--working with the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining, eight of those States eventually removed themselves from the process because of the Department's unwillingness to actually seriously consider their input. In other words, they were just there for window dressing.  Ohio's chief of Mineral Resources Management Larry Erdos told the Environment and Public Works Committee last February that ``OSM has not provided for meaningful participation with the cooperating or commenting agency states.''  Congress took action to instruct the Department of the Interior to reengage with the States, realizing what was happening here, before moving forward with this rulemaking process. However, despite this direction from lawmakers in the Congress, the Department failed to address the State concerns.  Wyoming director of Environmental Quality, Todd Parfitt, told the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that ``the failure to engage cooperating agencies throughout this process is reflected in the poor quality of the proposed rule.'' He called on the Office of Surface Mining to withdraw the rule and reengage with States and other stakeholders.  Last week, West Virginia's newly appointed secretary of Environmental Protection--again under a new Democratic Governor--Austin Caperton wrote to congressional leaders detailing our State's concerns with the stream protection rule. Secretary Caperton gave three main reasons for West Virginia's opposition to this rule.  First, he said that the rule upsets the statutory balance between environmental protection and allowing coal mining to take place in the first place. Second, the rule conflicts with the congressionally directed role of the States to be the exclusive regulators of mining activities. And third, the rule conflicts with the Federal Clean Water Act and State water quality standards--pretty broad-ranging concerns.  The concerns from environmental regulators in mining States across the country explain why 14 States, including the State of West Virginia, have already filed lawsuits to stop this stream protection rule. Fifteen State attorneys general, led by West Virginia's attorney general Patrick Morrisey, have written to Congress asking that this rule be blocked using the Congressional Review  State environmental regulators are not alone in their opposition to this rule. Cecil Roberts, who is the president of the United Mine Workers of America, wrote just last week in support of this resolution of disapproval. He said that ``the last thing America's coal-producing regions need at this time is another regulation that will have the effect of reducing employment even more and further stifling economic development.''  West Virginia cannot afford another job-killing regulation that once again inserts Washington and their one-size-fits-all standard into a regulatory process that is supposed to be effectively managed--and is effectively managed--by our State agencies.  The stream protection rule is a flawed policy that was born out of a flawed process.  The rule deserves to be eliminated promptly, and I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the McConnell-Capito resolution of disapproval and to vote to block the rule in the coming days.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS491.txt,1676,ADJOURNMENT,2017.0,30.0,January

I might tell you, she was very strong about her sensitivity that the United Nations has not been fair to one of our key allies, Israel, and she would be a strong voice to make sure those types of issues are dealt with and the United States uses all the tools at its disposal to fight against those types of bias and prejudice within the United  We have talked a great deal in our committee about moral clarity from our nominees, so there is no misunderstanding anywhere in the world that the United States stands for human rights, that the United States stands against abuses that take place around the world, and that it will fight for democracy in all parts of the world and support those causes through our diplomacy, through our development assistance, through our tools.

We talked specifically about what was happening in Syria and Russia's support for the Assad regime and the atrocities that have taken place in that country, most recently in When we asked if she would characterize that type of conduct as war crimes, without any equivocation she said: Absolutely--that this was a matter that required international accountability.  I also brought up with her what was happening in the Philippines, one of our allies, where the President of the Philippines, Mr.Duterte, has done extrajudicial killings and how she would characterize that as gross violations of human rights. She agreed that type of conduct cannot be tolerated, that we need to speak to whether they are friend or foe when they commit this type of conduct, that this is wrong and the United States must stand up for our principles. I was impressed by the way that she spoke to those types of issues.  One of the more telling questions that we asked was whether she would support any registry for any subgroup of ethnic or religious Americans, and she said: Absolutely not.  We had, I thought, moral clarity in her response to some of the most important questions. I think all of us feel that she has the passion to represent the United States and our views well at the United  What was particularly important to us is how she would speak out to power within the United Nations; that she had no problem in dealing with Mr.Putin and calling his conduct exactly what it was and would not be intimidated by Mr.Putin saying ``Well, you need me for some other issue''; that we have to be clear that we will not tolerate that type of conduct that violates basic human rights.

I am certain he has great negotiating skills, as he has shown as the CEO of ExxonMobil, and I think that is an important ability to have if he were confirmed as Secretary of  I do think he wants to serve our Nation, and he has put forward his ability to serve as Secretary of State for the right reasons. However, I have serious reservations, as a result of this process, this confirmation process, that leads me to the conclusion that I cannot support his nomination, and I will be voting against his nomination. I wanted to at least start this debate by giving some of the reasons I will not be supporting Mr.Tillerson to be the Secretary of  Mr.Tillerson's business orientation and his lack of moral clarity to questions that were asked during the confirmation hearing, to me, compromises his ability to forcefully promote the values and ideals that defined America's leading role in the world for more than 200 years. When I am referring to the values, they are the values of good governance, the values of standing up for human rights, the values of speaking up for a free press, the values of recognizing the importance of civil societies, which is lacking in so many places around the world.  When Mr.Tillerson was asked the question as to how he would characterize what Russia is doing in Syria in supporting a regime that has attacked humanitarian convoys, whether that should be considered as war crimes, Mr.Tillerson was less than clear as to how he would characterize Russia's conduct in  When I asked Mr.Tillerson how he would characterize Philippine President Duterte's extrajudicial killings--this is a President who has authorized individuals to be killed on site without judicial process, which has been well-documented--whether that was a gross violation of human rights, Mr.Tillerson was less than clear as to whether that in fact would elevate to a serious human rights violation.  When I asked the question, whether under any circumstances we could have a national registry for any group of religious or ethnic minorities in America, his answer was not as clear as I would have hoped it to be. The answer should have been a simple ``no,'' but he did not give that answer in that moral clarity.  For all those reasons, I have serious concern as to whether he will speak with a strong voice on American values or whether that will be compromised for narrow business interests or for other considerations that should not take priority to the values that have made America the great Nation it is.  I was concerned about this before what has happened in recent days, but when I take a look at President Trump's first 10 days in office and I look at the Executive orders he has issued as President of the United States, it is even more critical that the next Secretary of State speak with moral clarity as to the values of  The gag order that was reimposed by President Trump wasn't the same gag order that other administrations have imposed. It is far broader and could prevent U.participation with health workers around the world to stop the spread of HIV-AIDS or to deal with the Zika virus or to deal with issues concerning global health issues, maternal health. I want someone, as Secretary of State, to say that America stands for providing the leadership we need on global health issues.  More recently, when President Trump announced his Mexican policy; that it would build a wall, he not only asked the taxpayers to pay for it once but to pay for it twice, to build the wall, which almost anyone will tell you will not work. We do have tunnels that we already know could go under walls. It will be expensive, but he is also asking Americans to pay for it twice because he is going to impose a tariff, at least that is under consideration, that middle-income families will end up paying--starting a trade war with And why? Why would you start this? Mexico is working with us to stop illegal immigration. They are working with us to stop the illegal trafficking of drugs. They are working with us to build a regional, natural economy that benefits both countries. Why would we pick a fight with our neighbor? It makes no sense whatsoever.  The last thing that was done over this weekend points out even more clearly why we need a Secretary of State who will speak with moral clarity, and that was this outrageous, reckless, and dangerous Executive order that would ban certain individuals from coming to It would put a hold on our refugee program and would establish a religious test for people coming to America--a Muslim ban. That is not what America stands for.  I believe that Executive order is illegal. I know that Executive order will put Americans at risk. I would like to know from our Secretary of State how he, if he is confirmed, would respond when other countries ask: Why should we help you when you will not allow people from Muslim countries the right to visit your country? Why should we give you that information? How will Americans, who are traveling abroad, be treated? It puts all at risk. Our next Secretary of State has to have that credibility to deal with other countries with moral clarity. Time and time again, when confronted with questions, Mr.Tillerson was not clear.  Let me give you one example that may sum up my concern on his moral clarity issues, and that is with We had asked several times whether he would support the existing sanctions, would he support stronger sanctions. After all, the sanctions were put on because Russia invaded They[[Page S466]]are still there. They are still in They are still interfering with eastern Unless they comply with the Minsk agreement, our European allies are looking for America to say no way would we ever weaken our sanctions as long as Russia is violating its commitment in  Since that, they have been doing other things. I already mentioned the war crimes they are committing in Syria, but they also attacked They attacked us through cyber, trying to bring down our democratic system of government, free elections. I would certainly have hoped Mr.Tillerson would have shown some compassion for increasing sanctions against Instead, we asked him a question about Cuba, and Mr.Tillerson was very clear when he talked about He said: Look, if we do business with Cuba, we are allowing a repressive regime to have greater resources. Why would we want to support a repressive regime?  Mr.Tillerson didn't show the same concern about He has no compulsion at all about doing business with Russia, even though that business is allowing the Putin repressive regime to carry out their activities of attacks against our allies, attacks against us, interfere with what is going on in Syria, and to do all the activities they are doing. I would have hoped that we were seeing a greater sense of moral clarity from our Secretary of State nominee.  There are other issues I am concerned about. I know we will have a chance to talk about it if this issue is still on the floor tomorrow, as I expect it will be. We will have a chance to talk about issues regarding his quick use of military power versus diplomacy. We asked him several times about external events and how he will respond to them. His answer was too quick about using our military and not quick enough about using our diplomacy. The use of military must be a matter of last resort. I want to make sure our next Secretary of State is very sensitive to that particular issue.  Then we get to the concern about the ethical issues. I need to mention this because when we asked him questions about his knowledge of ExxonMobil, he was less than forthcoming to the committee, not aware of ExxonMobil's lobbying on certain issues, and very unclear about how its activities were in Sudan, Syria, Iran, and other countries that have horrible human rights records. And his willingness to recuse himself from anything affecting Exxon for 1 year, not for the entire length of term that he would be Secretary of State if confirmed by the Senate--he should not deal with ExxonMobil for the entire length of his time as Secretary of He is a person who has substantial wealth as a result of his working at None of us criticize him for that, but it disqualifies him from dealing with  We are going to be involved in a lengthy debate on the next Secretary of State, as we should, but I just wanted to share with my colleagues my concern about Mr.Tillerson and why I am opposing his nomination. And I would just indicate that I think the events particularly over the weekend with this immigration policy really point out the need for the next Secretary of State to be willing to stand strong for American values, and I have serious questions in that regard on Mr. With that, I yield the floor.

1693,topic-id,2737,"Mr.President, I rise today as the Senate begins consideration of the nomination of Mr.Rex Tillerson to serve as the 69th Secretary of State of the United States of I thank Mr.Tillerson for his willingness to serve our Nation and for his participation in a lengthy, wide-ranging hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where I have the honor of being the senior Democrat, the ranking Democrat on the committee.  Earlier today, I thanked Chairman Corker for the courtesies he showed during the hearing process. However, as I stated yesterday, I remain concerned that Mr.Tillerson's demonstrated business orientation in his responses to questions during the confirmation hearing would prevent him from being a Secretary of State who forcefully promotes the values and ideals that have defined our country and our leading role in the world for more than 200 years. I, therefore, will not be supporting his nomination.  Given the events over the weekend, I believe it is important that I begin today's debate by painting a picture for the American people of the unstable, reckless foreign policy that Mr.Tillerson is going to be asked to carry out under President It is painfully obvious that when the President says ``America first,'' the cumulative result of his vision would actually lead to America alone and America at risk.  From time to time, in our Nation's history, we have heard the calls of isolationism, but isolationism did not work then and it will not work now. It is an approach that our history has taught us, time and time again, undermines our interests, makes us vulnerable to those who wish us harm, betrays our values, and leaves us less secure and less prosperous.  America's leadership, rooted in our values, makes the world a better place for all, but the first 10 days of the Trump administration shows that the President is intent on compromising our values, abandoning our allies, and using a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel to conduct the detailed, careful work of safeguarding our Some of his supporters chalk it up to inexperience. My own chairman has said on numerous occasions that he wishes the President had more flushed-out ideas on foreign policy space.  What the American people witnessed in the last 10 days goes beyond inexperience. There is a willful, dangerous campaign underway by forces in this administration to bend or potentially even break the law. More than ever, we need to reaffirm and adhere to the values that make our country so strong and so stable, the city on the hill that others look to for leadership.  In order to do that, we need leaders who will not shy away from our values, who will sound a certain trumpet for human rights, the rule of law, and bedrock American values.  Mr.Tillerson's timid equivocation on American values throughout his confirmation process, his trumpet's uncertain sound was alarming because he will be working for a President clearly willing to compromise America's values at every turn. There are many individuals who have served in both Republican and Democratic administrations who recognize this Executive order for what it is.  I have in my hand a letter from over 100 former Cabinet Secretaries, senior government officials, diplomats, military servicemembers, and intelligence community professionals who have served in the Bush and Obama administrations. The letter, to the heads of the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State, expresses deep concern that the Executive order issued over the weekend jeopardizes tens of thousands of lives, has caused a crisis here in America, and will do long-term damage to our national security.  It strongly recommends the President rescind this order. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 January 30, 2017.     John Kelly,     Secretary, Department of Homeland Security,     Washington,     Sally Yates,     Acting Attorney General,     Department of Justice,     Washington,     Thomas Shannon,     Acting Secretary, Department of State,     Washington,       Secretary Kelly, Acting Attorney General Yates, Acting      Secretary Shannon: As former cabinet Secretaries, senior      government officials, diplomats, military service members and      intelligence community professionals who have served in the      Bush and Obama administrations, we, the undersigned, have      worked for many years to make America strong and our homeland      secure. Therefore, we are writing to you to express our deep      concern with President Trump's recent Executive Order      directed at the immigration system, refugees and visitors to      this country. This Order not only jeopardizes tens of[[Page S507]]     thousands of lives, it has caused a crisis right here in      America and will do long-term damage to our national      security.       In the middle of the night, just as.we were beginning our      nation's commemoration of the Holocaust, dozens of refugees      onboard flights to the United States and thousands of      visitors were swept up in an Order of unprecedented scope,      apparently with little to no oversight or input from national      security professionals.       Individuals, who have passed through multiple rounds of      robust security vetting, including just before their      departure, were detained, some reportedly without access to      lawyers, right here in U.airports. They include not only      women and children whose lives have been upended by actual      radical terrorists, but brave individuals who put their own      lives on the line and worked side-by-side with our men and      women in uniform in Iraq now fighting against Now,      because of actions taken by this White House, their lives      have been disrupted and they may even be in greater danger if      they are sent home. Many more thousands going through the      process will now be left behind. More broadly, tens of      thousands of other travelers, including dual citizens and, at      one point, legal U.residents face deep uncertainty about      whether they may even travel to the United States or risk      leaving and being barred reentry.       Many of us have worked for years to keep America safe from      terrorists. Many of us were on the job working for our      country on 9/11 and need no reminder just how vital it is to      destroy terrorist networks and bring partners to our side in      that global effort. Simply put, this Order will harm our      national security. Partner countries in Europe and the Middle      East, on whom we rely for vital counterterrorism cooperation,      are already objecting to this action and distancing      themselves from the United States, shredding years of effort      to bring them closer to us. Moreover, because the Order      discriminates against Muslim travelers and immigrants, it has      already sent exactly the wrong message to the Muslim      community here at home and all over the world: that the U.     government is at war with them based on their religion. We      may even endanger Christian communities, by handing ISIL a      recruiting tool and propaganda victory that spreads their      horrific message that the United States is engaged in a      religious war. We need to take every step we can to counter      violent extremism, not to feed into it by fueling ISIL      propaganda.       Perhaps the most tragic irony of this episode is that it is      unnecessary. We do not need to turn America into a fortress      to keep it secure. Since the 9/11 attacks, the United States      has developed a rigorous system of security vetting,      leveraging the full capabilities of the law enforcement and      intelligence communities. This vetting is applied to      travelers not once, but multiple times. Refugees receive even      further scrutiny. In fact, successive administrations have      worked to improve this vetting on a near continuous basis,      through robust information sharing and data integration to      identify potential terrorists. Since 9/11 not a single major      terrorist attack has been perpetrated by travelers from the      countries named in the       The suddenness of this Order is also troubling. The fact      that individuals cleared for admission were literally in the      air as the Order went into effect speaks to the haste with      which it was developed and implemented. We are concerned that      this Order received little, if any scrutiny by the      Departments of State, Justice, and Homeland Security or the      Intelligence Now that some of these individuals      are here in the United States, and thousands of others are      stranded, our government's response has appeared disorganized      and chaotic. As lawyers take steps to protect their clients      who have been detained here or stranded at many other      airports, the U.government will continue to face a flurry      of legal challenges, which could have been avoided.      Additionally, by banning travel by individuals cooperating      against ISIL, we risk placing our military and diplomatic      efforts at risk by sending a clear message to those citizens      and all Muslims that the United States does not have their      backs. Already, the international push-back has been immense,      and threatens to jeopardize critical counterterrorism      cooperation.       Fortunately, there is a way out of this self-made crisis.      We know that your agencies did not create this situation and      we particularly respect that many of you are working to      mitigate its damage. Effective immediately, you can apply the      discretion given to you under the President's Order to admit      into the country the men, women and children who are      currently still stranded in airports. The process for doing      this is well known to the security professionals within your      departments. We urge you to execute it. While it is good to      see the withdrawal of the application of the Order to legal      permanent residents of the United States, your Departments      can immediately work to allow other classes of people into      the country, and remove the discriminatory prioritization      implicit within the Most critically, we urge you to      draw on the insight of the professionals in your departments      to recommend that the President revisit and rescind this      Blanket bans of certain countries or classes of people      is inhumane, unnecessary and counterproductive from a      security standpoint, and beneath the dignity of our great      nation.

1694,topic-id,496,"Mr.Tillerson needs to answer whether he supports Mr.Trump's decision this weekend to ban Muslims, to keep green card holders out of the country, and state his view on the chaos that ensued from the terrible implementation of this terrible policy. We asked Mr.Tillerson during the confirmation hearing whether he supported a Muslim ban. He would not give us a clear answer, and he did not speak out against an unconstitutional Muslim ban.  Just today, I have sent a letter, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to Mr.Tillerson asking his specific views on the President's Executive order, what impacts that will have on America's credibility, what impact that will have on America's ability to work with our strategic partners around the world. I hope he will respond to us so we know his views on the President's Executive order before we are called upon to vote on his nomination.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             United States Senate,                               Committee on Foreign Relations,                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2017.     Mr.Rex Tillerson,     CEO, Exxon Mobil Corporation,     Irving,       Dear Mr.Tillerson: As the Senate Foreign Relations      Committee and the full Senate consider your nomination to      serve as Secretary of State, I write to seek your views about      the Executive Order, ``Protecting the Nation from Foreign      Terrorist Entry into the United States,'' signed by President      Trump on January 27, 2017. I am concerned that the text of      the Executive Order and its haphazard implementation over the      weekend run counter to our American values and the U.     Constitution, as well as our national security and economic      interests.       Do you support the Executive Order's indefinite denial of      entry to Syrian refugees and the 120-day suspension of the      entire U.Refugee Resettlement Program, which impacts      20,000 refugees and will, in practice, grind all refugee      processing to a halt for many months?       Do you agree with President Trump's assertion that our      country should give preference to Christians seeking to      obtain visas or admission to the U.S? If so, do you think      this action is consistent with our nation's bedrock      principles of liberty and religious freedom?       What process would you support to identify an individual's      religion prior to receiving a visa, admission, or other      immigration benefit?       In your view, what message does barring individuals that      have served our military in Iraq send to our partners abroad?

1695,topic-id,719,"Mr.President, it remains to be seen whether Mr.Tillerson has the moral compass necessary to counsel the President toward a coherent U.foreign policy that advances our national security and embraces our values and ideals or if he will be another yes-man, enabling the risky, chaotic whims of a demagogue President, who is leading us on a march of folly.  The American people deserve to know because if the last 10 days are any indication, the Trump administration is on a track to be the most dangerous and divisive in history. Nothing so painfully illustrates that point as Friday's Executive order banning refugees and certain Muslim immigrants from entering the United As a citizen of this great Nation, I am deeply offended by and ashamed of the President's Executive actions.  When the news of this developed over the weekend, I happened to be attending a family wedding in the Miami area, a city rich in its immigrant character and its welcoming nature to people of many faiths and backgrounds.  Miami was also the city where one of the most shameful episodes in our history transpired, where in 1993, the Louis, filled with Jewish refugees trying to flee the horrors of Nazi Germany waited for days, seeing the lights of the city ashore, seeking shelter and refuge. Shamefully, we turned the Louis away and condemned many of its passengers to death in the  We say never again. Yet fear and uncertainty was palatable this weekend in Miami and across the country. I have heard from constituents who were temporarily detained and arrested or whose loved ones had scheduled legal travel to the United States but were unsure if they should board their planes for fear of being arrested or turned around once they arrived.  I am aware of students studying legally here in the United States who suddenly found their entire future in jeopardy because of their nationality. Maryland is proud to host world-class universities like Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland, colleges that are enriched by the contributions and perspectives of foreign citizens.  Permanent legal residents who endured a lengthy process to acquire their green card and make the United States their home were suddenly unsure if they belonged. I was particularly troubled when two Iraqi citizens, who have played critical roles in supporting America's forces in Iraq, and were traveling on valid visas, were denied entry into New What do they get for helping our brave men and women with translation and security services? A big ugly ``Not Welcome'' sign at JFK Adding insult to injury, their immediate families were already here in the United  The cumulative effect of this Executive order is enough to make your stomach churn because what President Trump tried to do was legalize discrimination based on religion and nationality. As President Trump said, giving preference to Christians is going to be As Trump adviser Rudy[[Page S509]]Giuliani said, this is a way to legalize a Muslim ban.  So I was relieved when Federal judge Ann Donnelly issued a stay on Saturday evening to stop the madness, at least temporarily. Other judges around the Nation acted accordingly as well, affirming certain rights of green card holders and legal permanent residents, but too many innocent people remain in limbo. My staff's communications with Cabinet agencies over the weekend were extremely troubling. The left hand did not know what the right hand was doing in the Trump administration. In the zeal to play politics and inflame the fears of Americans who feel threatened, the White House revealed how little they knew or cared about governing.  It was reported that Secretary Kelly did not have a proper opportunity to view the Executive order before it was issued, a sobering lesson I hope Mr.Tillerson has paid close attention to. The Department of Homeland Security has now belatedly begun to engage on issuing guidance, but I fear the damage has been done.  Clearly, the Department of Justice was not part of developing the Executive order, as Acting Attorney General Sally Yates said, boldly, that she was not convinced that the Executive order was lawful. As a result, President Trump fired her--the Monday night massacre. Our voice must be loud and clear. Mr.Trump, this is our country, a country that stands for the highest principles, supported by the rule of law.

1706,topic-id,1991,"Mr.President, as I indicated earlier, this afternoon I had an opportunity to meet with King Abdallah of During that conversation with Members of the Senate, there was a good deal of discussion about foreign policy challenges that are very much a part of this debate on Mr. It was interesting to listen to King Abdallah of Jordan talk about his country's commitment to refugees. They have taken in refugees from many parts of that region--from Iraq, Yemen, and other countries. They have taken in over 600,000 refugees from I think King Abdallah used a number. If you wanted to use a comparable number of refugees coming into America, it would be equivalent to about 60 million refugees coming into our country. Let me remind you that in Syria, President Obama committed to 10,000. It is literally a drop in the bucket compared to what Jordan has done in accepting refugees. It just underscores even more how wrong President Trump's Executive order over the weekend was, which put a hold on our refugee program and restricted travel to the United  The vetting that goes forward in Jordan in regard to refugees is under the auspices of the United Nations, and of those who are seeking refugee status, a very small percentage--I understand it is less than one percent--will actually ever get a chance to be considered for refugee status here in the United Let me remind you that we are talking about, generally, women and children who are fleeing persecution, who have established themselves as refugees. They go through several screening procedures. Their background is thoroughly checked. They check all of the different indices as far as different agencies are concerned to make sure that they have no concern. Then a small percentage of that number actually ever gets to the United It takes 18 to 24 months. To date, there hasn't been a single episode of terrorism from a Syrian refugee. We have a pretty strong vetting process--the strongest in the world--that very much puts American security first.  It was disheartening for me to listen to King Abdallah talk about the sacrifices his country has made. Of the 650,000 refugees that Jordan has taken in from Syria, the King indicated that about 90 percent are integrated into the Jordanian society. They are not in camps. They are in their schools, in their communities. They have been able to make sure that the refugees are well cared for. It is a huge part of the budget. I think the King indicated that maybe 20 percent of the Jordanian budget deals with refugees. That is a country that understands their regional responsibilities and international responsibilities.  The United States has been the leader in the global community, recognizing that the flight of people--the refugees--represents not only a humanitarian requirement for the global community but also security issues. We have to have an orderly process for those who are fleeing persecution, and the United States has always been in the leadership. We have been in the leadership in opening our borders. We are proud of the refugees that came to this country after World War II, from Cambodia, Vietnam, and There is a long list of those who have escaped persecution coming here to the United States and helping to build this great country. We recognize that diversity is our strength. This made us the great Nation that we are.  For all those reasons, it was very disheartening to hear President Trump's Executive order, where he really questions whether America is committed to its traditional values, whether we are going to maintain our international leadership, whether we are going to be[[Page S517]]credible when we deal with other countries around the world to take on the responsibilities of dealing with the flight of people who are escaping persecution.  I mentioned all this because the Secretary of State is the key diplomat that we have for America and to use America's power of persuasion, of using diplomacy, of using the tools at our disposal under the Department of State, including development assistance for how we can, in fact, promote those values. We need someone who is going to be able to speak out about these policies that were announced over the weekend because they weaken They make us less safe. I brought this out: In reality what you are talking about is how do you engage other countries around the world to help us in our war against terror when we tell them that Muslims aren't really welcome here in America and it is a majority-Muslim country? How does that work? How do we protect Americans who are traveling abroad who may be subjected to physical danger because of the statements that have been made by our President? How do you protect this country from the concerns about homegrown terrorism, which might, in fact, be encouraged by the recruitment of terrorists as a result of what the President has done in his Executive order?  For all those reasons, it is even more important for us to have as the next Secretary of State a person who is committed to the core values of this country--that it is part of their gut, and that they will be a strong advocate for those issues. I have already indicated during the questioning in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that we did not see that moral clarity in regard to Mr.Tillerson and in regard to those values.  The second issue that came up in King Abdallah's meeting was very interesting. We had a long discussion about Russia and about Russia's influence. We know about Russia's influence in We had a little discussion about Russia's desires in regard to the Baltics and whether the Baltics could be the next Ukraine, as far as Russia's aggression. We know that Russia is already in Russia is already in Russia is in Do they have their sights now set for Lithuania or Latvia or Estonia or Poland, where there is a large Russian-speaking population?  Interesting observations were made that if Russia sees that we don't have resolve, they will use that opportunity to expand their influence. We saw that in the Middle We saw how in the Middle East Russia, which a few years ago had very little influence in the Middle East, now has a growing influence in the Middle East--not only in Syria but in other countries in that region where you see Russia's active engagement. So this is not theoretical.  Russia's interests are different than our interests. Make no mistake about that. They don't share our values. They are not our friends. They are trying to compromise our democratic institutions. We have seen that over and over--not only the attack on our election system here in the United States, not only the attack on the system in Montenegro in parliamentary elections, but the concern now in Western Europe, as they are entering into the election season. We see over and over what Russia has done in denying space for civil society, in compromising dissent in their own country, in the way that corruption has been established as part of government. All of that is just against the principles that we believe in, that we believe the global community has accepted, and that leads to the stability in nations and advances America's national security interests.  I must tell you that there are Democrats and Republicans all talking about the fact that we have to stand up to We have to be stronger on Yes, we have been able--thanks to the leadership of the Obama Administration--to take the sanctions that were passed by We passed the sanctions. The leadership and Members of the Senate and the House have brought about the stronger sanctions regime here in the United I congratulate my colleague, Senator Menendez, who was one of the principal leaders to get stronger sanctions here in regard to Russia, and other members of our committee who worked on that. We were able to get stronger sanctions. At the same time, we were able to get Europe to join us in these sanctions, and that helped us. But now there is a concern as to whether these sanctions will remain.  President Trump at least has raised that question as to the continuation of sanctions. The question becomes this: Should we be maintaining those sanctions until Russia complies with the Minsk agreement that are relevant to its invasion into Ukraine? But we should also be strengthening those sanctions because of Russia's illegal activities in attacking our country and in what they are doing in Syria in perpetrating war crimes. We should be looking at stronger sanctions against  I mention all of that because the person who can lead us in that effort is our next Secretary of We look at Mr.Tillerson and his record as the CEO of ExxonMobil, their relationships in Russia, and his answers to questions as to whether we should consider additional sanctions. Over and over he says: Well, there are multiple considerations. To me, that was a red flag that indicated that maybe there is some business interest here. Maybe, if there is a business interest, we shouldn't let that be more important than the human rights advancements and the other areas that we are concerned about.  In reality, we saw that in the way ExxonMobil lobbied against the original sanctions that were imposed against They lobbied against it because they said it didn't create a level playing field for U.companies. The reason it didn't create a level playing field is that the United States is always the leader on sanctions. We always set the international bar as to what we need to do, and then the rest of the world follows us. But if we take the lowest bar, we will never have a tough enough stance against  We need, as the next Secretary of State, a person who is going to be a leader in saying: We are going to use every one of our diplomatic tools to isolate Russia if they continue this activity of interfering with our elections, threatening to interfere with European elections, interfering with humanitarian assistance in Syria, or if they continue their illegal occupation of We need that type of leadership. That is one of the reasons we have been so much engaged in this debate.  There are many other issues about which we talked with King Abdallah that dealt with foreign policy challenges, including moving forward with broader coalitions against ISIS in the region. All of that requires the use of all the power we have. We know that our military is very strong. We are very proud of our Department of Defense and very proud of the men and women who serve in the military. They are the guardians of our freedom. We thank them every day for the sacrifices they make on behalf of our We owe it to them to make sure our military is only used as a matter of last resort, that we use all of our diplomatic skills in order to prevent the unnecessary use of our military, that we only use the military when it is absolutely essential and it is a matter of last resort.  We must have as our chief diplomat a person who will carry out that strong commitment to our diplomatic skills and agenda in order to make sure that we only use the military when necessary.  We have heard this before. But it was General Mattis who said: If you don't fund the Department of State, if you don't give them the resources they need for development assistance, you are going to have to give me a lot more soldiers.  Our diplomats can very much keep us safe, and they can do it with less risk to our men and women who serve in the military and at less cost.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Unemployment is atits lowest level since 2007.       Home prices are back at all-time highs.       Growth is picking up. The economy expanded at a 3.2%annual      rate from July through       Even the middle class is (finally) getting a raise in pay.       ``President Trumpreally is inheriting an economy that's      pretty solid,'' said Kevin Hassett, an economist at the      conservative American EnterpriseInstitute, on CNBC       The ``Obama economy'' deserves a ``B or B+'' grade, says      Paul Ashworth, chief economist at                       grading the obama economy       That's not an A, but theeconomy is certainly better off      than it was when Obama walked into the Oval Office in 2009.      Back then, the country was in themidst of a deep financial      crisis and recession. The very month Obama took office,      nearly 800,000 Americans lost theirjobs.       Obama believes he hasn't received enough credit for the big      turnaround. ``Anyone claiming that America's economy is      indecline is peddling fiction,'' Obama said earlier this      year.       Unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to just 4.6%      now.America has gained over 11 million new jobs since Obama      took office.              trump points to thoseleft behind in recovery       Trump has repeatedly called the unemployment rate ``a      joke'' and ``a hoax.''It's unclear whether he will change      that message when he takes office. Then he would be able to      take credit for keepingunemployment down--or even causing it      to go lower.       For now, Trump continues to hammer the Obama economy as      terrible.``Companies are not going to leave the United States      anymore without consequences,'' Trump said at a speech at a      Carrier factoryin Indianapolis, ``We're losing so      much.''       While hiring has picked up rapidly under President Obama--     2014 and 2015were the best years of job growth since the late      1990s--the gains have almost all come in the so-called      ``service sector,'' notin manufacturing and blue collar work.       ``There are some people doing fabulously well and others on      death's doorstep. Andthere's a heck of a gulf in between,''      says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com.

They say they can get it to4%--     stronger than recent years when the economy has grown only      2%.       The question is how.       Trump wants big tax cuts forbusinesses and individuals.      He's also planning to roll back regulation and spend more on      roads and bridges.     Wall Street hasgiven these plans a big thumbs up. The stock      market rallied to record levels in November after Trump won      the presidency.Business and consumer confidence has also shot      up since the momentous win.                        the big problemfor trump       There's just one catch: The U.economy has less potential      to grow now than in the past,argues economist       Two key factors drive growth: More people entering the      workforce and workers being more productiveon the job.       Right now, the U.has an aging population and little      appetite for much more immigration, so it's hard to seemore      workers flooding into the workforce. Trump likes to claim 94      million Americans are out of work and need jobs, but      that'snot correct. That number includes retirees, people in      school and those who have chosen not to work in order to take      care oftheir family.       In reality, about 2.1 million lost their jobs in recent      years and appear to have simply given up looking. Theyare the      hidden unemployed. Getting them jobs won't be easy as many      jobs today require specialized skills.       Trump's big hope isto get productivity up by encouraging      businesses to invest more in[[Page S358]]     their factories, research and workers.

879,topic-id,1431,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the Medicaid Program, a program that I am sure a lot of folks in Washington and around the country hear about a lot. We talk about it a lot, but I am not sure that people around here have a real sense of what it means to folks back at home.  Medicaid is a program that is more than 50 years old now. In some ways, the name doesn't convey the scope of it. In some ways, I wish it had a different name because it would remind people who benefits from it.  Instead of referring to it as the Medicaid Program, if you called it the ``kids, seniors, and folks with disabilities program,'' or something like that, you would be accurately describing the scope and the reach of the program because it has a profound impact on the lives of children, on the lives of older citizens trying to get long-term care in nursing homes, and, of course, it has a huge impact on individuals with disabilities.  We know that in the campaign, President Trump made a statement. I am not quoting him exactly, but it was a brief statement during his campaign, and it was in writing that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, or I think a lot of people had forgotten about that third one.  One of the tasks that we have in the Senate is to make sure that, when a statement like that is made, any President is held accountable to that promise.  The examples I could cite are many about the impact of Just a couple are significant. Not by way of exclusion, but I will just mention a few.  I am holding here a March of Dimes document. It is an issue brief by the March of Dimes, and it is entitled ``The Value of Medicaid.'' I won't read it all, but here is just one fact that I am not sure a lot of people know. ``Medicaid covers 45% of all births''--and they have a footnote for that. I am not sure there are many in Washington who know that. But that is why I referred to it earlier in a more informal way as ``the baby program,'' because all of those children come into the world paid for by  Medicaid has a substantial impact on rural families, rural America, and rural hospitals. By one estimate a couple of years ago, First Focus, one of the advocacy groups here in Washington that tracks issues that relate to children, estimated that as of 2012--and I doubt that it has changed much since then--more than 45 percent of rural children got their health care through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance So almost half of rural children were benefitting from one program or the other.  Here are just a couple more. One in five seniors receives Medicare assistance through Medicaid, and that includes premium assistance, cost sharing, long-term care, dental care, and vision care.  Another important number is that two-thirds of nursing home residents are covered by  I mentioned children before and the profound impact it has on their lives. Medicaid covers 40 percent of all children in the country. I mentioned CHIP and Medicaid combined covering almost half of rural children. Just Medicaid alone covers 40 percent of all children--rural, urban, and everywhere in between. If you just consider low-income kids, or children who come from low-income families, Medicaid covers some 75 percent of those children.  So there is a lot to talk about. But one issue that we are in the process of engaging on as an issue is: What will happen to Medicaid?  Despite what the President said when he was campaigning--and I am talking specifically about Medicaid--just this weekend, the administration announced--without much attention drawn to it at the time, but I hope increasingly more attention--that the administration would support block-granting That is at variance with what the President said. In my judgment, it is a total contradiction of what he said, and now, apparently, his administration has embraced the House Republican approach to Medicaid, which is block-granting.  There are a lot of ways to measure the impact of block-granting. One that I will just cite for the record is a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities dated March 15, 2016, entitled ``Medicaid Block Grant Would Add Millions to Uninsured and Underinsured,'' which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 15, 2016] Medicaid Block Grant Would Add Millions to Uninsured and Underinsured                            (By Edwin Park)       House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price's budget plan      would radically restructure Medicaid by converting it to a      block grant, cutting federal funding by about $1 trillion      over the next decade. It would also repeal health reform's      Medicaid expansion. The combined result would be a total      Medicaid cut of $2.1 trillion over the next ten years,      relative to current law, likely making tens of millions of      Americans uninsured or underinsured.       Repealing the Medicaid expansion means that at least 14      million people would lose Medicaid or not get it in the      future, based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates.      In addition, the large and growing funding cut from the block      grant would almost certainly force states to sharply scale      back their Medicaid programs.       The Price plan would also repeal health reform's other      coverage expansions, including the subsidies to help people      afford marketplace coverage.       All told, not only would the estimated 20 million Americans      who've already gained coverage through health reform lose it,      but millions more who qualify for Medicaid apart from health      reform would likely lose their Medicaid coverage as well.      Tens of millions of Americans would likely become uninsured.       Under Price's ``State Flexibilities Funds'' block grant      proposal, the federal government would no longer pay a fixed      share of states' Medicaid costs, apparently starting in 2018.      Instead, states would get a fixed dollar amount of federal      funding, which would rise only modestly each year, as      explained below.       Block-grant funding would fall further behind state needs      each year. The annual increase in the block grant would      average about 4.3 percentage points less than Medicaid's      currently projected growth rate over the next ten years. In      the plan's tenth year (2026), federal Medicaid and Children's      Health Insurance Program (CHIP) funding would be $169      billion--or roughly 33 percent--less than under current law      (see graph). And the cuts would likely keep growing after      2026.       The block grant would cut federal Medicaid funding by $1      trillion from 2017-2026. A small share of these cuts could      come from CHIP which the Price plan would presumably merge      into the Medicaid block grant as in past House Republican      budget plans. Over the next ten years (2017-2026), the budget      plan would provide nearly 25 percent less in federal Medicaid      and CHIP funding to states than under current law--not      counting the lost federal funding for the Medicaid expansion.       The loss of federal funding would be greater in years when      enrollment or per-beneficiary health care costs rose faster      than expected--for example, due to a recession or new      treatment that improved patients' health but raised costs.      Currently, the federal government and the states share in      those unanticipated costs; under the Price plan, states alone      would bear them.       As CBO concluded in 2012 when analyzing a similar Medicaid      block grant from then-House Budget Committee Chairman Paul      Ryan:       ``The magnitude of the reduction in spending . . . means      that states would need to increase their spending on these      programs, make considerable cutbacks in them, or both.      Cutbacks might involve reduced eligibility, . . . coverage of      fewer services, lower payments to providers, or increased      cost-sharing by beneficiaries--all of which would reduce      access to care.''       In making these cuts, states would likely use the large      added flexibility that the Price plan would give them. For      example, the plan would likely let states cap Medicaid      enrollment and turn eligible people away from the program, or      drop benefits that people with[[Page S418]]     disabilities or other special health problems need.       The Urban Institute estimated that the 2012 Ryan proposal      would lead states to drop between 14.3 million and 20.5      million people from Medicaid by the tenth year (outside of      the effects of repealing health reform's Medicaid expansion).      That's an enrollment decline of 25 to 35 percent. Urban also      estimated that the Ryan plan would lead states to cut      reimbursements to health care providers by more than 30      percent. The Price block-grant proposal likely would mean      similarly draconian cuts.  ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS417.txt,1828,1215,2017.0,24.0,January
880,topic-id,833,"Here is one of the headlines of that article, one of the basic inclusions by a respected organization that tracks this information. I will just read that headline: ``The block grant would cut federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion from 2017-2026.''  So if you are saying you are going to protect children and you are going to protect seniors and you are going to make sure that those with disabilities don't have any problems going forward, it is pretty difficult to do that if you take a trillion dollars out of the Medicaid Program over the course of a decade.  There was an op-ed in the New York Times on Christmas It was interesting that it actually was printed on that holy day. There was an op-ed by Gene Gene is someone who many people in Washington know. But for those who don't, Gene served two Presidents; he served both President Clinton and President Obama as the Director of the National Economic  Here is one of the conclusions that Gene reached, based upon his research and his vast experience. I will quote him directly from the December 25 op-ed in the New York Times entitled ``The Quiet War on Medicaid'': ``Together, full repeal''--and there he means full repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act--``and block granting would cut Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program funding by about $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years--a 40 percent cut.''  So whether you look at it in terms of block granting's impact on Medicaid or the combination of that block-granting policy, which the administration has now embraced fully, and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the result of that is that you adversely impact two programs--the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Medicaid  Let me bring this back to real people. I just want to highlight a couple of excerpts from a letter I received recently, and then I will conclude.  This is a letter from Coatesville, PA, the southeastern corner of our State, a letter sent to me by Pamela I will just call her Pam, even though I don't know her personally.  She wrote me a letter about her son. Pam Simpson's son is She said that Rowan, who I guess is now 5 years old, back in 2015 was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She went on to say how much Rowan has benefitted from the Medicaid We call it Medical Assistance in  She said that among the services he received was the behavioral specialist consultant helping him and a therapeutic staff support worker. They received direct help, direct intervention so that Rowan could grow and benefit from those direct services.  She said that the agency that administers these kinds of wraparound services for Rowan and children like him--in this case, the Child Guidance Resource Centers--started a particular program focused on social skills, especially for children with autism.  But here is how she concluded her letter, and this is why I want to cite it in the context of this critically important debate we are going to have about Medicaid and the question of block granting, which sounds kind of benign; doesn't it? When you say it, it doesn't sound that bad. But in my judgment, it would be devastating to these families.  She said to me in the letter: Please think of my dear Rowan and his happy face, his big blue eyes, and his lovely strawberry blonde hair.  You can see him in these pictures that I should have mentioned earlier. Rowan is in these two different pictures, and there he is dressed as a firefighter.  She continued: Please think of me and my husband, working every day to support our family, and please think of my 9-month-old daughter Luna who smiles at her brother daily.  There is Luna in the picture, being held by  She says that she is worried that that little girl, when she is much older, will have to take care of Rowan later in life when Pam and her husband are gone.  She ends the letter this way: Overall, we are desperately in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and would be devastated if we lost these benefits. What she is referring to there, of course, is  I have real trouble believing that if the Trump administration's proposal on block granting Medicaid marches forward, now that they have embraced the proposal that Republicans in Washington have embraced for years--they had voted for block granting over and over and over again. Now it is a live issue. Now it is no longer just voting. Now it is an issue that could be enacted into law, and I think that would be a terrible step in the wrong direction.  So I think we have to remember that when we consider these budget debates, when we consider the debate about health care, and especially when we consider real families like Pam's and real children like  With that, I yield the floor.

46,topic-id,1160,"Mr.President, I was pleased to see on the front page of the Washington Post that President-Elect Trump was speaking about how we should maintain at least the number of people covered under ObamaCare in a new kind of replacement for that portion of If you will, I agree totally with him. We should fulfill this promise and do it, as he said, at a lower cost.  We think we have a mechanism to do so with Senator We will speak to that today. First, let me point out, for those who are praising ObamaCare, I will say that since it has passed, the American people have been voting consistently against candidates who supported ObamaCare, culminating in the election of President-Elect So whatever folks might say about how wonderful it is, the American people are voting against it consistently.  That said, there is a mandate from the American people not just to repeal but to replace. So it is not that the American people don't want to have coverage, and they want folks with preexisting conditions to have their issues addressed, but what they are concerned about is the way ObamaCare was forced upon them, with the power of Washington, DC, reaching into their own life, if you will, to their kitchen table, promising them penalties unless they comply with the Washington bureaucrats directly. That is what the American people do not like.  So, first, can we maintain coverage? President-Elect Trump said we are going to have insurance for everybody. Two, will we cover more? Three, can we lower costs? The answer there is yes.  Now, let's first speak to covering more Americans than President-Elect Trump, Majority Leader McConnell, and Speaker Ryan have all committed to maintaining coverage for all.  People speak of the advances made under I will give them those advances. There are still 30 million people uninsured. Our alternative has the potential to cover 95 percent of Americans without a mandate. The way we do this is that as we return power to the States, we give States the option of saying that everyone who is eligible for coverage is enrolled unless they choose not to be.  Just like when I turned 65 and I am on I am on I don't feel it is a mandate. No one calls me up. Indeed, if I don't want to be on Medicare, I have to call someone up and tell them I don't want to be on it. State legislatures would have the option to say you are in unless you call and tell us you are out. I say that addresses two folks who are hard to reach; the fellow whose life is so in disarray that he is living beneath a park bench and the typical 28-year-old male who never thinks about health insurance. All of a sudden he is in without even realizing he is in, until he needs it, and then he will be very pleased.  On the other hand, if you don't want to be in, we make it easy to get out. By the way, I spoke of that fellow living beneath the park bench. As a physician who has worked in a hospital for the uninsured for 30 years, that was not tongue-in-cheek, and that is not a throwaway line. That person living beneath the park bench will never have his life well enough together, or almost never, to go to a public library to log onto healthcare.gov. He does not have a W-2--and if he did, he lost it long ago--to submit it to sign up.  Under our program, he is enrolled. What are the benefits that he would get? He would have a health savings account so that if he goes to the urgent care center with a nail in his foot, it is covered. He has a pharmacy benefit, so that if he gets his life together while he is at that urgent care center to take an antipsychotic, he has a pharmacy benefit. Lastly, if something terrible happens, he is hit by a car or something, then he is brought to the hospital and that catastrophic coverage protects society against the cost of his hospitalization.  By the way, under our plan, we give States the power. I would like to think that this is something Democrats and Republicans can agree to. When Republicans say: You can keep your plan if you like it, and we mean it, we mean it. The way we would do this is that Congress would give States alternative options. The State would have the choice.  The State could go with the alternative, which we will lay out. The State could opt for nothing, no Medicaid expansion and no help for their lower income folks, or the State could opt to stay in If Illinois, California, Massachusetts, New York want to stay in ObamaCare, we think they should have the right to stay in  ObamaCare, if it is working for your State, God bless you. On the other hand, it is not working for a State where there are double-digit and sometimes triple-digit premium increases in 1 year.  So the State could choose to stay in ObamaCare, for nothing, or for the alternative, which we lay out for them. By the way, I would say that those who govern closest to those who are governed govern best. We know that the State of Alaska is far different than the State of California, Illinois, Louisiana, or New So let those States decide the system that works best for them.  What is the timeline? This year, 2017, we would like to repeal ObamaCare but put in place the legislation which allows, in 2018, for a State legislature or a Governor to choose the option they wish and the method by which they wish to enroll the people of their In 2019, the State would implement the replacement option of their choice. By 2020, the repeal and the replace would have been finished.  If, at a later date, a State wishes to change their option--they decided to stay with ObamaCare but on second thought now they wish to have the alternative we lay out, which I actually think would be something that might happen, they could choose that as a later option.  We are not being partisan. I tell folks, this is not a Republican plan, not[[Page S327]]a Democratic plan, it is a patient plan, born out of my experience working in a public hospital for the uninsured; that if you give the patient the power, things line up. If we can make it an American patient plan, it does not matter what your State decides. I am comfortable that we will end up in the right place.  Our goal is to fulfill President-Elect Trump's promise, more coverage at lower cost. We think we have laid out a pathway which can truly be bipartisan to achieve that goal.  I yield the floor.

486,topic-id,2298,"Mr.President, today I have the privilege, with Senator Collins, to introduce a replacement bill for ObamaCare, with her experience as an insurance commissioner and mine as a physician caring for the insured and the underinsured. Let me also give due credit to Pete Sessions in the House, who has introduced a very similar bill to come up with something that we think works not just for the people we represent but for the entire country. That is our goal.  I wish to speak on the Patient Freedom Act of 2017. Our goal, if you will--I tell my staff to imagine a woman who voted for Donald Trump and doesn't like ObamaCare, but she has breast cancer. Her coverage has a $6,000 deductible, but she has coverage. On the other hand, she wants to see something different. If we just view our efforts through the prism of her care, I think we will do right by the American people.  Let me say something else. Again, our goal is not to come up with a Republican plan; it is not to come up with an anti-ObamaCare plan; our goal is to come up with an American patient plan where, whoever she or he is, they can feel comfortable that, as a Senate, we are trying to do right by the American people.  Let's go to first principles. First principles is, we in the Republican Party think that if you like your insurance, you should be able to keep it. I will come to that later. President Obama was rightly criticized because he pledged that, and it turns out it wasn't true. That is one of our first principles, and we mean it.  Secondly, we think the States should have the power, not the Federal When you speak to Americans, they want their State capital to be the kind of principal force behind how their insurance is administered, not our Nation's Capital, so we return power to both the States and to patients.  Lastly, I will say that we are truly reaching out to One of the criticisms of ObamaCare is that it was rammed through on a partisan vote with hardly a consideration given of Senator Collins and I are absolutely open to working with Democrats for this solution.  How do we begin?  We first begin by repealing the ObamaCare mandates and penalties. The American people do not like Washington telling them how to live their lives. We take those mandates and penalties from both the individual and the employer and we take them off.  Secondly, we work to make health care truly affordable. We do this by giving States a choice to put in what we call the State alternative. I think we are going to begin calling it the better choice. In the better choice, we would use tax credits which would go to those who are eligible and which would go into an account. If the patient did nothing, she would have a[[Page S401]]health savings account, which will be pre funded. The money would go in, actually put money into the account--catastrophic coverage and a pharmacy benefit.  It is important to note that she would have power over this account. If she wished, she could combine it with her family's, these different tax credits, and they could buy a richer family policy, or she could assign it to her employer as the employee's contribution for an employer-sponsored plan.  If each member of the family decided to keep their own HPSA account and one of them got a terrible illness and went into the cash portion and exhausted their health savings account, we would allow family members to donate their health savings account balance to each other to help cover that cash exposure.  We do different things, but the goal is to give the patient the power.  Since we are going to these health savings accounts under the better choice model, in the better choice model, we give these tax credits that go into a health savings account. The individual can donate their own money, or the employer can contribute theirs. These are some of the options they have, but whichever options they have, we institute price transparency. That is to say that when the patient goes to have her blood test, she will know the cost of the blood test before she has it done as opposed to finding out later.  This came to mind this past I had a friend in town for the inauguration. She is a physician, and she went for a vitamin D level. When she went for the vitamin D level and got the bill, it was $290. She called the hospital and said: I order these all the time. Am I really getting a $290 charge on each of these?  They said: Oh, yes, ma'am. That is what we bill patients.  So she went to different labs and found out the cash price for the panels of labs she typically orders.  She had a patient who was from out of town and was paying cash. She said: Pay me $38; it will cover the labs. Here is the slip; go to the lab.  The patient paid $38 but went to the wrong laboratory. She was from out of town and not quite sure where to go. She went to the wrong laboratory. The bill she got, which in one lab would be $38, in the other lab was $690.  My physician friend called the hospital and said: You have to be kidding--$690?  They reduced it to $380. There is a tenfold difference in the cash price for labs. If the patient had known that, she probably would have paid more attention to the directions. But certainly if the price of the labs were posted when she went, even if she went to the wrong place, she could have looked at the fee schedule and decided she needed to go someplace else.  One of the young men who work with me said: Yes, I get it, price transparency. Who would buy a car without knowing the price beforehand? It would be great for the car dealer but really lousy for you. That is how we purchase health care now. It is great for the folks selling the service; it is pretty lousy for the person paying the cash.  By this, we think we begin to use market forces to reduce costs. By the way, this is not only about saving the patient money, which is very important, but here is another example.  John Fleming is a physician who until recently was a Member of the House of He tells the story of when their office went to a health savings account, a woman who worked with him came to him and said: Fleming, I don't like these health savings accounts. Previously I had a pharmacy benefit that paid for my inhaler, and now I don't have the same pharmacy benefit.  He said: Well, under their plan, at least, you can use the health savings account to pay for your inhaler, and, by the way, if you stopped smoking, you wouldn't need the inhaler.  Then he walks away.  Six months later she says to him: Fleming, you were right.  He didn't remember the conversation. He turns around and she says: Remember when you told me if I stopped smoking, I wouldn't need an inhaler? I stopped smoking and I don't need an inhaler.  So what this does is it activates the patient. It gets her or him engaged in their health care, and between that--not only do we protect the patient's pocketbook, but we also do something positive for their health care.  Let me also point this out. We think most States would go for the better choice. It is possible, though, that a State will reject everything and say: We don't want Medicaid expansion dollars and we don't want any extra help for those who have lower incomes. We would give States that choice. This is not Washington, DC, forcing something on people.  Let me also point out something else. Republicans believe that if you like your health care, you can keep it; if you like your health insurance, you can keep it, and we mean it. If a State decided they wished to stay on ObamaCare--I think it is a terrible decision--but this legislation would allow a State to do so.  I was so disappointed. I saw that the minority leader, Mr.Schumer, criticized our bill and said things that weren't true--fake news, if you will. He said we didn't cover preexisting conditions. We do. He said the deductibles and copays would be too high, which is not true, but what was striking is that he hasn't read our legislation yet.  This is what is wrong with Washington, Here we have something which in good faith would allow New York to stay in ObamaCare if the people of New York decided they wished to--but we can look at double- and even triple-digit premium increases in other Without reading our bill, other States are going to be condemned to these double- and triple-digit premium increases because folks don't want to consider something different. This is not a Republican plan. It is not a Democratic plan. We want it to be an American plan where States can decide the best system for their State, and if it is working for New York, it can stay in New It is not working for Louisiana so our State would go with the better choice, I am confident.  That said, please don't criticize the plan before you even look at it, and please allow those on the Democratic side who are down to one insurance company on their exchanges, with double-digit premium increases, to at least consider an option that would be good for their  Now, folks say: Well, you don't have a mandate. We don't think Washington, DC, should be telling people how to live their lives. So how do we, under our better choice, get the kind of big insurance pool without a mandate? We give States the option to do what we call automatic enrollment. If someone is eligible, they would be enrolled. The tax credit they receive would be adequate for their premium. They would never have to pay anything out-of-pocket to have this health savings account--high-deductible health plan and pharmacy benefit. It would be covered with the tax credit they receive. By doing so, all these young males who haven't signed up for ObamaCare because they are paying too much would actually be enrolled in an insurance plan. For those who get ill or have chronic conditions, they are spreading the cost of their expensive illness over the many healthy and not just over the few sick. It restores the law of big numbers.  We had an insurance plan model this, and they said they think just by doing our method of enrollment, it would lower premiums by 20 percent. That is without an individual mandate.  By the way, think of the folks who will never sign up for an ObamaCare exchange policy. The mentally ill person living beneath a bridge is not going to go to a public library. If he has his W-2 form, he doesn't know where it is. He is not going to fill out a 16-page, long-line form and sign up for Under our policy, he could be automatically enrolled. So if he goes to the urgent care center with cellulitis, he has coverage. If something terrible happens--if he is hit by a car, and goes to the emergency room and is admitted to the hospital, society is protected from major expenses. If he gets his life together enough, he has a pharmacy benefit providing those antipsychotics. So we actually think we would increase the number who truly need health care to the number of those who are covered.  Let me finish up by speaking about our timeline. We hope that over this next year, Republicans and Democrats can come together. I understand Democrats will not vote for a reconciliation[[Page S402]]bill that begins the repeal process of ObamaCare, but that almost certainly will pass. What we hope is that sometime within this year, Democrats who live in States with only one insurance company on their exchanges, in which premiums are increasing by double--and maybe even at that time in their States triple digits--will come together to vote with us to give their State an option for our better choice. So we would pass that legislation in 2017, giving their State legislatures and Governors the option to choose this pathway in 2018; and in 2019, the States would implement their option of choice; and by 2020, it has all been done.  That is our hope.  Folks say Senator Collins and I are naive; that the Senate cannot overcome its partisanship; that inevitably it will be so partisan, people, without reading the bill, will criticize our legislation, saying things about it that are not true.  I go back to where I started, to that woman who didn't go to college, working hard, voted for Trump, doesn't like ObamaCare but has breast cancer. She needs coverage, and she wants something done for her. We want to give her the power. We want to give her that coverage. My goal is that when this finishes, as she goes from cancer to health, the only thing she knows about her coverage is that the decisions about her health care are made in her State Capitol and around her kitchen table, and that as her breast cancer is treated, her health coverage improves. That is our goal. It is not a Democratic plan or a Republican plan. It is not a partisan plan. It is a plan for her. That is our goal.

1696,topic-id,953,"Mr.President, the big debate right now, as we all know in our country, is this: How do we repeal and replace ObamaCare?  It is pretty clear that the American people want something done. They voted, ever since the bill was passed, for those who opposed ObamaCare and had a desire to both repeal and replace, culminating in the election of President  Now, I and Susan Collins, as well as others, have introduced something called the Patient Freedom Act, which is our attempt to replace But what I want to emphasize here is the bill's emphasis upon federalism. The key feature is that we take power from Washington, DC, and give it back to patients and back to State capitols.  We think that we find plenty of examples where Washington has done that, allowing States to be the laboratories of democracy. It has worked out well for all.  First, let's look at the parameters that President Trump has laid out. President Trump says he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act but replace it with something which covers everyone, takes care of preexisting conditions, does not have mandates, and lowers cost. Those are the marching orders, as far as I am concerned. With the Patient Freedom Act, we attempt to achieve President Trump's goals.  Now, how do we do that? Under our bill, Congress would pass legislation this year which next year would give States one of three options.  The Patient Freedom Act has something we call the better choice. That would be one option that States could choose. But really, a State would have the choice to say nothing: We don't want anything from the Federal Good-bye. Get out of here. That is one option the State has, and the last option the State has is to stay with the status quo--or the Affordable Care Act.[[Page S511]]  We have actually gotten a little bit of criticism for that from conservatives, and I am saying: Why? This is federalism.  We are going to repeal the ObamaCare taxes and penalties. We are repealing that. But if a State and a State capitol wants to reinstitute taxes and penalties upon the people in its State and upon the businesses in that State, God bless them. I think it is a mistake, but they should have that choice. In fact, they have that choice now. All we are saying is that you can exercise the right that you currently possess.  The States would choose in 2018. They would implement their choice in 2019. By 2020, ObamaCare would be repealed and replaced. That is our goal: to repeal and replace while achieving President Trump's goals of insuring all, taking care of those with preexisting conditions, without mandates and at a lower cost.  Now, by the way, let's talk a little bit about federalism. Conservatives have always thought the 10th Amendment, which grants the States every responsibility not delegated to the Federal Government, is an important consideration. That is what we are embracing here--to allow the State to choose.  There are some States in which the Affordable Care Act, I am told, is working well. The folks in California and New York swear by it. It is not working in  A friend of mine got his quote for the renewal of his and his wife's policy. They are 60 and 61, or thereabouts. It was $39,000 a year--$39,000 a year for the renewal of a policy.  Yes, Mr.President, it is $39,000 a year for the renewal of a policy. No one believes me. I put it on my Facebook page, holding up the quote sheet with their names darkened out, but you can see, it is $39,000 a year. That is the ``un-Affordable Care Act.''  As you look around the country, you can see, for example, in Arizona, there was one county that for a while had no insurance company there, and when one came in, it raised the rates 116 percent in one year--more than doubled in one year, on top of the increases in all the previous years.  If California and New York say that the Affordable Care Act is working for them, keep it. It is not working for It is not working for It is not working for other States in the Why not take power from our Nation's capital and give it to the State capital, and allow the State capital to come up with a solution that works for that State?  I read an editorial today, and it was out of Rome, It pointed to the Welfare Reform Act, in which a Republican Congress and President Clinton devolved to the States many of the reforms necessary for welfare. It has been considered a tremendous legislative success. They used that example as an endorsement of the approach to federalism we are taking now.  It isn't just that we give power back to the States; we also give power back to the patients. We let them choose the benefits they wish to have. We put in measures such as price transparency so that someone knows how much something costs before she has the tests performed, as opposed to being surprised by a huge bill 6 months later. With that and other means, we give power to patients.  We hope all those who wish to see President Trump's mandates fulfilled to cover everyone, take care of those with preexisting conditions, lower costs without mandates, in the process of repealing and replacing ObamaCare, will endorse the federalism of the Patient Freedom Act as well as those other provisions.

571,topic-id,311,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 55, which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure This bipartisan bill will codify and make permanent what is commonly referred to as the Hyde amendment and expand Hyde amendment restrictions to all Federal agencies.  First offered in 1976, the Hyde amendment prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions through government programs like These restrictions have been maintained for more than 40 years through the annual appropriations process, including the most recent continuing resolution passed last It is time that these important protections against the use of taxpayer funding to pay for abortion be made permanent.  A GAO report in 2014 found that, under ObamaCare, over 1,000 insurance plans covered elective abortion. Those plans are purchased with taxpayer subsidies. H.7 would stop this and make ObamaCare conform to the Hyde amendment. If the Hyde amendment had been applied to ObamaCare, as President Obama promised it would be, the number of federally subsidized plans with elective abortion coverage would have been zero.  As we work to repeal and replace the deeply flawed ObamaCare, we need to ensure taxpayer subsidies are not used to pay for abortion coverage.  According to a Marist Poll conducted last July, 62 percent of respondents--a majority of the women asked--and including 45 percent of those who identify as pro-choice do not support taxpayer funding for abortions. H.7 simply codifies and makes permanent a protection against the use of taxpayer funding for abortion that the majority of Americans and certainly a majority of my constituents in Wyoming support.  Therefore, I urge support for the rule to allow consideration of H.7.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

603,topic-id,4586,"Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.  Mr.Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 23 faith-based organizations and communities urging Members to reject H.7; a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union urging Members to vote ``no'' on H.7; a letter from 44 women's health, religious, and other advocacy organizations strongly opposed to H.7; and a letter from the American Association of University Women urging Members to oppose H.7.                                     House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, January 28, 2014       Dear Representative: As leaders of faith-based      organizations and communities, we urge you to reject H.7,      a bill introduced as the so-called ``No Taxpayer Funding for      Abortion Act,'' which would harm a woman's health, economic      security, and religious liberty by making coverage of      abortion inaccessible in both public and private health      plans. Enclosed is a statement of shared principles that      compel us, together with 20 of our partner organizations from      the faith community, to speak out against legislation like      H.7, which seeks to impose a narrowly-defined view of one      religious viewpoint on every citizen, threatening the freedom      of religion afforded to every individual by the U.           H.7 is sponsored in the House by Chris Smith (NJ-     4). This bill would raise taxes on women and families, as      well as small businesses, who access or offer abortion      coverage as part of a comprehensive insurance plan. It would      do so by denying women and families a premium assistance tax      credit if they choose a plan in the health insurance      marketplace that includes abortion, a proposal soundly      rejected by Congress in the 2010 health reform debate. This      bill would also deny small employers a Small Business Tax      Credit for offering their workers comprehensive coverage that      includes abortion. Further, as amended in committee, this      bill would withhold abortion coverage from women enrolled in      a multistate, private insurance plan. Taken together, these      provisions would jeopardize coverage of abortion in the full      private insurance market, risking coverage that many women      and families have today; more than 80 percent of private      health plans currently cover abortion care.       Also among its provisions, H.7 would make permanent      dangerous restrictions that withhold abortion coverage from      women who access coverage or care through federal programs,      such as women enrolled in Medicaid, federal employees, Native      American women, and others. It would also permanently      withhold abortion coverage from low-income women living in      the District of Columbia, a federal ban that goes against the      wishes of DC elected officials and voters. These provisions      would disproportionately harm women struggling to make ends      meet, risking their economic security, health and well-being,      and ability to make personal decisions in accordance with      their own conscience and religious or moral beliefs.[[Page H628]]       Please see the enclosed statement outlining shared      principles of faith that compel us and our partners to speak      out against this harmful proposal. As communities and      organizations that represent diverse constituencies of faith,      we stand united in opposition to H.7 given the danger it      poses to women and their families by jeopardizing affordable      and accessible insurance coverage of abortion.       We urge you to reject H.7 when it reaches the House      floor for a vote.

We are deeply troubled by legislative      efforts designed to restrict women's access to comprehensive      reproductive health care options, including abortion,      contraception, HIV/STD testing, cancer screenings, and other      essential health services.       We recognize that issues surrounding women's reproductive      choices--and those regarding abortion in particular--are      complex. Although we come from diverse faith traditions, we      all agree that proposals aimed at restricting access to      reproductive healthcare would have devastating consequences      for women and their families, particularly low-income women.      We call on Congress and the President to reject these      intolerable measures.       As people of faith, the following common principles compel      us to speak out together against these proposals:       Striving for social justice and equal rights to health      care: All too often, legislation is proposed that would      create significant barriers to women's access to reproductive      health options and make it harder for women to make their own      reproductive choices based on their individual beliefs and      consciences. We are especially concerned about efforts to de-     fund the Title X Family Planning program and those      organizations, such as Planned Parenthood, that serve as a      key part of our social safety net. Title X health centers and      clinics are on the public health front lines, serving low-     income individuals and other vulnerable populations. These      centers help men and women of limited means prevent      unintended pregnancies; they promote prevention of, and      treatment for HIV and other STDs; they offer life-saving      cancer screenings; and they provide crucial medically-     accurate information about sexual health. Title X providers      ensure that women who want to have children get the      information and care they need to promote a healthy      pregnancy. As faith-centered organizations, we are committed      to the most marginalized and the most vulnerable of our      society, especially those with limited financial means or      those who live in areas with limited access to services.      Reducing health care options for some, based on their      economic strata or geographic location, is profoundly unjust.       Respecting women's moral agency: We affirm women as moral      agents who have the capacity, right, and responsibility to      make their own decisions about sexuality, reproduction, and      their families. Legislation that eliminates health coverage      for and limits the availability of reproductive health care      services through funding restrictions would severely limit a      woman's ability to make decisions about her own health care      and about how best to care for her family, guided by her own      conscience, her personal circumstances, and her own moral or      faith tradition.       Valuing compassion and the obligation to protect every      woman's health and life: Restrictions on women's health care      options endanger women's lives. In particular, we oppose      proposals that would allow hospitals and individual health      workers to refuse to provide abortion services to a woman,      even when such care is necessary to save her life. As people      of faith, we strongly believe that a health worker's right to      refuse to provide certain services must not infringe on a      woman's right to access the health care she needs. Above all,      that refusal must not endanger her life. Health professionals      and the organizations that support them have an obligation to      ensure access to necessary services, whether directly or by      referral to an accessible alternative health care provider.       Safeguarding religious liberty: We believe that one      person's religious viewpoint must not be imposed on others.      Different faiths, and even groups within a single faith      community, hold varying views and opinions. Time and again,      our nation has answered this diversity of opinions by      upholding the founding principle of religious freedom.      Reproductive freedoms are integrally bound with religious      freedoms--a connection recognized by the Supreme Court's      1973 decision in Roe v. Women have a right to make      reproductive health choices based on their own faith      tradition, free from constraints imposed by those seeking      to legislate one religious viewpoint or another. We oppose      legislation that would erode Americans' constitutionally      protected right to religious freedom.       As people of faith, we believe in compassion, justice, and      the dignity of all women. We understand that those who would      restrict women's access to comprehensive reproductive health      care are often motivated by their religious beliefs and seek      to impose their views on others. However, freedom of choice      means that every person is valued as a moral decision-maker,      free to make personal decisions about their reproductive      lives based on their own religious beliefs and consciences.      We cannot presume to tell others how best to inform and      listen to their own consciences as they make decisions about      whether and when to have children or how best to care for      their families. Today, and every day, we stand up as people      of faith for women's health and reproductive choices--and we      urge our government to do the same.

Vote ``NO'' on H.7, the ``No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and             Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017''       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Civil      Liberties Union (ACLU) and our nearly two million members and      supporters, we urge Members of the House of Representatives      to vote no on H.7, the so-called ``No Taxpayer Funding for      Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of      2017.'' The ACLU opposes this legislation, which would make      harmful, discriminatory abortion coverage restrictions      permanent and interfere with private health insurance      coverage for abortion.       H.7 would make permanent the Hyde Amendment and its      progeny, discriminatory abortion coverage restrictions that      single out and exclude abortion from a host of programs that      fulfill the government's obligation to provide health care.      These restrictions disproportionately impact those who      already face significant barriers to care--low-income      families, women of color, immigrants, young people, LGBTQ      people, and those in rural areas. They discriminate against      these women, who rely on the government for health care, by      severely restricting their access to a health care service      that is readily available to women of means and women with      private insurance.       A woman in need of abortion care who does not have      independent financial resources must scramble to raise the      necessary funds, delay receiving care, and is often left with      no choice but to carry to term in circumstances where she is      physically, emotionally, or financially unprepared to care      for a child. In fact, restricting Medicaid coverage of      abortion forces one in four poor women seeking abortion to      carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. When a woman seeking an      abortion is denied one, she is three times more likely to      fall into poverty than a woman who can obtain the care she      needs. If a woman chooses to carry to term, Medicaid (and      other federal insurance programs) offers her assistance for      the necessary medical care. But if she needs to end her      pregnancy, the same programs will deny her coverage for her      abortion. The government should not interfere with a woman's      personal medical decisions by selectively withholding      benefits in this way.       H.7 also takes particular aim at low-income women in the      District of Although the use of federal funds is      currently restricted from covering most abortions, states are      free to use their own funds to include abortion coverage in      their medical assistance programs. The only exception is the      District of H.7 would make permanent a provision      that forbids the District from using its own locally raised      non-federal dollars to provide coverage for abortion for its      low-income residents. The D.abortion ban disenfranchises      the District's residents, and allows non-resident Members of      Congress who are not accountable to the people of the      District to impose their own ideology upon the District's      residents with impunity.       H.R 7 would also impact women's ability to purchase private      insurance that includes abortion coverage. It would revive      the so-called Stupak Amendment, rejected by the 111th      Congress, which would bar anyone receiving a federal premium      assistance credit from buying a private insurance policy that      includes abortion coverage on the Affordable Care Act's (ACA)      insurance exchanges. This is not only an attempt to      effectively ban abortion coverage in the exchanges by      encouraging insurers to exclude it, but it would have a      ripple effect on plans outside the exchanges that jeopardizes      abortion coverage for millions of women. Further, the      inaccurate disclosure requirements in H.7[[Page H629]]     would push insurance companies to drop abortion coverage and      deter women from purchasing plans that include such coverage      by misleading them about the cost of purchasing these plans.      These provisions are direct attacks on a woman's ability to      make personal medical decisions with complete and accurate      information.       Additionally, H.7 rewrites tax law to penalize a single,      legal, medical procedure: abortion. It would deny small      businesses tax credits if the insurance they provide to their      employees includes abortion coverage, effectively coercing      employers to offer plans that exclude abortion. The bill      would also deny millions of women and families premium tax      credits if they purchase a health insurance plan that covers      abortion, forcing them to forgo comprehensive health      insurance plans in order to get the premium assistance they      need. This manipulation of the tax code is simply government      interference in taxpayers' private medical decisions and      should be rejected.       Abortion is basic, constitutionally-protected health care      for women. Yet H.7 attacks women's fundamental right and      access to abortion. It first targets women--particularly poor      women and women of color who rely on the government for their      health care--and seeks to permanently deny them coverage for      a benefit to which they are entitled. Then, under the guise      of ``safeguarding'' taxpayer dollars, H.7 advances an      aggressive campaign to destabilize the insurance market for      abortion coverage. Congress should be eliminating barriers to      women's ability to exercise their constitutionally protected      right to safe, legal abortion. Instead, H.7 would      interfere with women's personal medical decisions by putting      even more bathers in the way.       For these reasons, the ACLU opposes H.7 and urges      members of the House of Representatives to vote no.           Sincerely,     Faiz Shakir,       Director, Washington Legislative     Georgeanne Usova,       Legislative                                  ____       Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations strongly      urge you to oppose the deceptive ``No Taxpayer Funding for      Abortion Act'' (H.7), a bill designed to fundamentally      alter the health insurance market--from a market where      abortion coverage is the industry standard to one where      abortion coverage is eliminated. H.7 does this by changing      the laws that govern both private and public insurance and by      twisting the tax code into a tool to take away abortion      coverage from women who have it. Ultimately, this bill is      designed to deny women the decision whether or not to have an      abortion by taking away their insurance coverage.       H.7 twists the tax code into a tool to take away health      insurance coverage that women have today. For example, the      bill would deny millions of women and families premium tax      credits if they purchase a health insurance plan that covers      abortion. The bill would force these women--particularly low      and moderate income women--to forego a health insurance plan      that includes abortion in order to get the premium assistance      they need. H.7 would also raise taxes on small businesses      by denying the Small Business Health Tax Credit to businesses      that offer health insurance that covers abortion. This credit      was created to encourage small businesses to offer health      insurance to their employees by making it more affordable.      This bill would penalize employers for choosing comprehensive      coverage for their employees and their families.       H.7 could cause the entire insurance market to drop      abortion coverage. The impact of H.7's changes could be      that women across the country lose comprehensive health      insurance that includes abortion coverage. The elimination of      abortion coverage in the Marketplaces is expected to set the      industry standard, meaning that all plans, inside and outside      the Marketplace, could drop such coverage.       H.7 introduces a new ban on private insurance by forcing      all multi-state insurance plans to drop abortion coverage.      Currently, the law requires that at least one multi-state      health insurance plan in a Marketplace must not provide      abortion coverage (except for narrow exceptions). H.7      would replace this requirement with a dramatic restriction      banning abortion coverage in all multi-state health insurance      plans.       The Rules Committee Print of H.7 includes new provisions      that would impose inaccurate and misleading disclosure      requirements regarding abortion coverage in plans offered in      the This bill overrides existing provisions of      the Affordable Care Act that provide consumers with      information about their health plans, and instead adds new      requirements intended to push insurance companies to drop      abortion coverage and deter women from purchasing plans that      include such coverage. Moreover, H.7 wrongly asserts that      there is a ``surcharge'' in plans that cover abortion, and      would require women to be misled with this falsehood. These      new provisions are not about disclosure, but about      eliminating abortion coverage, in line with the rest of the      bill's dangerous provisions.       H.7 would permanently ban federal health insurance      programs such as Medicaid from including abortion coverage.      H.7 would codify harmful legislative riders that deny      abortion coverage to women who receive health insurance      through the federal government. Moreover, H.7 makes      permanent a rider that denies the District of Columbia the      ability to decide whether to use its own local finds to      provide abortion coverage. These bans disproportionately      affect women of color and low-income women, denying these      women the ability to make their own important health care      decisions.       H.7 would endanger women's health by eliminating      coverage of abortion even in circumstances where a woman      needs an abortion to prevent severe, permanent damage to her      health. Because H.7 only makes exceptions in the cases      where the woman's life is endangered, or where she is the      survivor of rape or incest, it would leave women whose health      is seriously threatened by their pregnancies without access      to the care their doctors recommend to protect their health.      The impact can be especially harmful to women underserved by      the health care system and women with serious health      problems.       In summary, H.7 would deny millions of women the ability      to make their own decision about whether to have an abortion.      H.7 is a dangerous bill that jeopardizes women's health by      directly banning abortion coverage, by raising taxes on      families and small businesses that purchase comprehensive      insurance coverage, and by imposing ``disclosure''      requirements that encourage the elimination of abortion      coverage. The intent and impact of H.7 is to forever      eliminate coverage of abortion in all insurance markets. We      strongly urge you to reject this bill.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than 170,000      bipartisan members and supporters of the American Association      of University Women (AAUW), I urge you to oppose H.7, a      dangerous limitation on abortion that puts women's health and      rights at risk. H.7 would withhold abortion coverage from      virtually all women in the U.and potentially push insurers      into ceasing coverage of abortion care. This bill is a part      of a political strategy that seeks to interfere with women's      personal decision-making around their reproductive health      care.       AAUW supports the right of every woman to access safe,      accessible, affordable, and comprehensive family planning and      reproductive health services. We believe that all women      should be able to make their own decisions with advice and      support from those they trust the most. We know that women      look to doctors, family members, and other trusted      individuals, not politicians, to make important medical      decisions about their health.       H.7 would make abortion restrictions that are often      built into annual appropriations bills permanent. Such an      action would withhold abortion coverage from almost all      women--those who rely on Medicaid, federal insurance plans      and health programs, as well as those who are Peace Corps      Volunteers, Native American women, Washington, D.     residents, and many others. In addition, by creating      burdensome regulations for insurers to cover abortion      services, many more women would lose access to the care they      need. When policymakers deny women insurance coverage for      abortion, women are forced to either carry the pregnancy to      term or pay for care out of their own pockets. Consequently,      cutting off access to or placing strict limitations on      abortion can have profoundly harmful effects on public      health, particularly for those who already face significant      barriers to receiving care, such as low-income women,      immigrant women, LGBTQ people, and women of color.       Again, I urge you to oppose H.7, a dangerous limitation      on abortion that puts[[Page H630]]     women's health and rights at risk.

The rule defines how we are going to consider this legislation. This is a closed rule. This is a Putin rule. This is a rule that allows no opposing viewpoints to be brought before this Chamber to be debated and voted on. It is completely closed. On top of that, it didn't go through regular order.  Now, I know my colleagues will say, well, it went through regular order in the previous But there are 55 new Members of the House in this Congress, and I think they have a right to expect regular order from the leadership of this House when legislation is brought to the floor. The rule should be rejected because it is closed.  I would urge my colleagues, even those who may be sympathetic to the underlying legislation to, at some point, stand up to your leadership and say, ``Enough of this closed process.'' Open this place up a little bit. This is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, and yet we do everything but deliberate. At some point, I hope some of my Republican colleagues will be brave enough to stand with us who are calling for a more open process.  I also urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the underlying bill.  I also include in the Record an article from Politico entitled, ``Study: Abortion Rate Falls to Record Low.''                     [From Politico, 17, 2017]                Study: Abortion Rate Falls to Record Low                           (By Brianna Ehley)       The U.abortion rate dipped to its lowest level on record      in 2014, according to a new study by the Guttmacher            The abortion rate dropped 14 percent between 2011 and 2014      to 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women, researchers said. During      the same time period, the number of abortions dropped 12      percent to 926,200 in 2014.       Researchers suggested two main reasons for the decline: a      combination of greater access to contraception and less      access to abortion services in states that have enacted new      restrictions.       The number of clinics providing abortions dipped 6 percent      between 2011 and 2014, with the largest declines in access in      the Midwest and the       ``Abortion restrictions and clinic closures mean that      patients may need to travel greater distances to access      services,'' Rachel Jones, the study's lead author, said in a      statement. ``Some of the abortion rate decline is likely      attributable to women who were prevented from accessing      needed services.''  Mr.Madam Speaker, part of the reason for that is because women are having more access to good health care. Part of the reason why that number is getting lower is because of organizations like Planned Parenthood, which provide clinics and counseling and contraception to young women so that we can actually avoid more people being in the situation where they have to confront the issue of abortion. And yet my colleagues' next salvo is going to be going after Planned The abortion rate in this country is going down.  The underlying bill is not about making sure that taxpayer money doesn't go to fund abortion. That is what the Hyde amendment does.  The Affordable Care Act, by the way, makes it clear that no portion of the premium tax credits may be used to pay for the portion of comprehensive health coverage that is purchased in the marketplace that relates to abortion services. That is not what this is about.  This is basically the first attempt to really go after the basic constitutional right for a woman to be able to choose when it comes to abortion services. That is what this is about. The leadership of this House--indeed, the President of the United States--has made it clear they want to repeal Roe v. They want to put Justices on the Supreme Court who will repeal that decision. They want to pass legislation that will do everything to be able to deny women that basic right. That is what is going on here.  Finally, Madam Speaker, I am asking people to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can actually debate and vote on this issue of requiring Presidential candidates and Presidents to release their tax returns. I say to my colleagues in all sincerity, this President's refusal to release his tax returns, all these conflicts of interest that he has, this is a White House on a collision course with corruption. Donald Trump said he wanted to come to Washington to drain the swamp, but by not releasing his tax returns, by allowing all these conflicts of interest to remain, he is bringing the swamp to the White  Let us vote for transparency here. Let us vote in a way that the majority of Americans think we ought to do, and that is to require this President to come clean, to show us what his tax returns are, to show us what he is hiding, to show us where his investments are, to show us if there are any dealings with Russia or Putin or whatever.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can have that opportunity to be able to debate that issue, because if you don't vote ``no,'' I can guarantee you that the Committee on Rules will never make it in order. The Committee on Rules never makes anything in order that the leadership of this House doesn't put its rubber stamp on. I think that that is unfortunate. As I said before, the Committee on Rules is becoming a place where democracy goes to die. It is about time that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle stand up and say, ``Let's open this place up.''  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

47,topic-id,854,"Mr.President, first, let me start by commending the Senator from Louisiana for all of the thought and the work he has put into coming up with an alternative plan that would fix ObamaCare and result in more Americans having affordable health insurance. As a physician, Senator Cassidy cares deeply about his patients and about patients in general. His goal, which I share, is to make sure every American has access to affordable health care. I commend him for his hard work and leadership.  There has been much debate lately on the best approach to replacing and reforming the Affordable Care Act, also known as Some of my colleagues have argued for immediate repeal without any replacement, an option I reject, for it risks leaving millions of vulnerable Americans without affordable health insurance and would undo important consumer protections provided by current law.  Others have proposed repeal with a delayed effective date of 2 or 3 years to allow time for the Senate to devise legislation that would provide a better approach to health insurance. My concern with the repeal-and-delay plan is that the ObamaCare exchanges, already on very shaky financial ground, would go into a death spiral as consumers would face uncertainty and insurers would have no basis for pricing their policies.  Already we have seen insurers fleeing the marketplaces in many States, reducing choices for consumers. In some States, only one or two insurers remain on the exchanges, leaving individuals and families with few, if any, choice of insurance carriers. Every single one of the 23 State cooperatives whose startup costs were financed by ObamaCare has experienced severe financial problems and only five remain operational today.  Many States, including Maine, are experiencing double-digit increases in premiums, causing increased costs for consumers and for taxpayers. So repeal and delay would only exacerbate this problem.  I am pleased to see a growing consensus among Members of both the Senate and the House that we must fix ObamaCare, provide reforms at nearly the same time that we repeal the law, in order to protect families who rely on the program and to give insurers time to transition to a new marketplace that is based on more choices for consumers.  Many of us have been working for years on proposals to reform our health care system, to expand coverage, and to encourage new delivery systems that would help restrain the growth in health care costs. That is what the legislation that I am going to be pleased to be joining my colleague from Louisiana on, would do. It is focused on giving more choices while ensuring that consumers have access to affordable health insurance.  We have advanced bipartisan proposals in the past to deal with provisions of the law that have increased costs and discouraged employers from hiring full-time workers. Regrettably, every such reform has been met with a veto threat. That is why we continued to work.  In 2015, I joined Senator Cassidy in introducing a more comprehensive and creative approach, the Patient Freedom Act, which is the basis for the legislation we are going to be introducing soon. It would allow States to have more choices. If they like the Affordable Care Act, they can keep the Affordable Care If they want to go an alternative route that is more patient-centered, that would provide more choices and help to restrain costs, they can do that, too, and the Federal Government would bundle the funding that would otherwise be used for ACA subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid in their State and allow them to proceed along a more creative route.  We recognize how different the needs of our States are, but our citizens should have access to affordable health care and be able to choose the path that works best for them.  We will be talking more about the specifics of our bill when we introduce it, but I am excited about this approach. I am not saying it is perfect, but it is important that we put specific proposals on the table that our colleagues can coalesce around, debate, and refine so that we can move ahead and remove the fear and uncertainty of families who are relying on coverage through the exchanges without putting an undue burden on the employers who create jobs in this country.  Mr.President, let me again commend the Senator from He has worked so hard to come up with a fresh approach. He has been very open to suggestions that I and others have made.  We all understand the importance of maintaining the consumer protections that help individuals with preexisting conditions, that ensure that young people can remain on their parents' insurance policies until age 26, and that prohibit lifetime caps. Those provisions would remain. But what we want to do is to allow our States the option of selecting a different path that will lead to patient-directed reforms that contain costs and provide citizens with more health care choices. The Patient Freedom Act does just that.  Again, I want to commend my colleague Senator Cassidy for his leadership.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

487,topic-id,2447,"Mr.President, first, let me commend the Senator from Louisiana for his extraordinary work on this bill. It has been a great pleasure to work so closely with him as we have made a genuine effort to put together a bill that would be a reasonable replacement for ObamaCare that would help to bring people together.  I wish to commend the Senator from Louisiana for his expertise. As a physician, Senator Cassidy brings an important perspective to this debate, particularly since he has practiced for so many years in hospitals in Louisiana that serve the uninsured. So I wish to personally thank him for the privilege of working together to craft this bill.  There has been much debate recently on the best approach to replacing and reforming the Affordable Care Considerable confusion and anxiety exists about the current status of the law and about the future of health care in our country. However, what is often overlooked in this discussion is that while the ACA provides valuable assistance for some people who were previously uninsured, the system created by the law is under tremendous financial strain.  ObamaCare exchanges are on the verge of collapse in many The reality is that significant changes must be made. Doing nothing is not an option.  I am, therefore, both surprised and disappointed by the remarks of the Democratic leader to the press and on the floor today about the genuine effort that Senator Cassidy and I have put forward in introducing the Patient Freedom  First of all, let me point out that the Democratic leader could not possibly have read our bill since we haven't introduced it yet, and it is evident that he has misunderstood many of its provisions.  For example, in a press statement, he said we gutted the preexisting condition protections that we strongly support and that are codified in our bill in section 101(b). Again, that is section 101(b). It ensures that insurers cannot discriminate against individuals with preexisting conditions who pay their premiums.  I guess what disappoints me most is that the Democratic leader's response really represents what is wrong with Washington, The American people want us to come together. They want Democrats and Republicans to work as a team to solve the problems facing our If we are going to have a leader on the other side of the aisle denounce to the press and come to the Senate floor to criticize a bill that has not even been introduced yet, where are we? I really hope this is an aberration and that we can work together and that the compromises we put in the bill are recognized as a good-faith effort to bring both sides of the aisle together in the interests of the American people and in providing access to affordable health care. That is our goal.  We are not saying our bill is perfect. We are open to refinements. We have made a good-faith effort, and to hear it described inaccurately and as other than a genuine effort to solve a problem truly disappoints me.  The fact is, the ACA has been in effect for years. Yet nearly 30 million Americans still do not have health insurance coverage. Many of those who do have coverage through the ACA exchanges are experiencing large spikes in premiums, deductibles, and copays, increasing costs to consumers and taxpayers alike. Contrary to the predictions made by the early supporters of the ACA, premiums are increasing in nearly every State, with an average increase of 25 percent nationally.  In New York State, the average increase on the exchange is 16.6 percent. I don't know, but perhaps the Democratic leader thinks that is an acceptable rate of increase. It strikes me as pretty high, and even though it is below the national average, it is still in double digits. The situation is even more dire in some States like Arizona, where premiums have increased by 116 percent. In many counties throughout our country, there are only one or two health insurers offering plans on the exchanges, severely limiting consumer choice.  In my State of Maine, premiums for the individual market for 2017 have soared by 22 percent, on average, and plan options have become more limited. Now, while subsidies do cushion the blow for those consumers who are eligible for them, others have had to shoulder the full increase, and of course taxpayers have borne a greater burden. Moreover, individuals and families with incomes exceeding 250 percent of the poverty rate are not shielded from the dramatic increases in deductibles and copays. That is important to remember. The premium subsidy applies to incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty rate. It then drops off the cliff, and you are eligible for no subsidy whatsoever--there is no orderly phaseout. For help with copays and deductibles under the Affordable Care Act, the threshold is 250 percent of the poverty rate. These huge premium spikes and increases in deductibles and larger copays are having an effect on families and individuals--who are by no means wealthy--all over this  Millions with coverage under the ACA are also facing increasingly narrow networks, which means they may find their preferred doctors are not in their networks. This can be particularly difficult for rural States that may have few specialists and whose citizens rely on major medical centers in nearby If patients want to continue to see these doctors, they can be faced with enormous costs that are not covered by their ACA insurance. As one Mainer put it, ``[President] Obama said I could keep my doctor, and the insurance company says I can't.''  The co-ops created under the ACA to help provide health insurance coverage have been failing at an alarming rate. In fact, only 5 of the 23 remain operational. It is also important to carefully consider the effects that ObamaCare's Medicare cuts have had on providers like rural hospitals and home health agencies, many of whom are struggling.  In sum, prices are skyrocketing, coverage is narrowing, and the individual market is likely in a death spiral if Congress fails to act.  I know many Members of this Chamber share the goal of expanding access to affordable health care. Over the years, I have collaborated with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on a number of initiatives. Today I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator and Doctor Bill Cassidy, in introducing the Patient Freedom Act of 2017 to help ensure that Americans have access to affordable health care that improves choices and helps to restrain costs.  Let me emphasize again that our bill is a work in progress. It is not perfect. However, what it does--and it is virtually unique in this regard, in this Chamber--is it puts specific proposals on the table as we seek to craft bills to repair and improve the Affordable Care Other legislation being discussed,[[Page S403]]such as those designed to help small businesses pool risks so they can better afford to provide insurance to their employees, also deserves consideration. Let's get a lot of ideas on the table.  We have to start, and we have been willing to step forward and propose a specific bill. To be criticized for that by the Democratic leader is just so disappointing, particularly since the leader is well aware that I work across the aisle all the time to try to find solutions for our country.  The Patient Freedom Act is built on the premise that giving people more choices is superior to the one-size-fits-all approach that defined the Affordable Care We recognize that what works best for people in Maine or New Hampshire may not be right for people in New York or Our bill respects those differences by giving States options to choose the path that works best for their citizens.  Now, option one would allow a State to choose to continue operating its insurance markets pursuant to all the rules of the Affordable Care So if New York State wants to keep with the status quo, despite the 16.6-percent increase, on average, in the premiums for the individual market, New York State can make that choice. If a State chooses to remain covered by the ACA, exchange policies will continue to be eligible for cost-sharing subsidies and advanced premium tax credits, and the insurance markets will still be subject to ACA requirements. The individual mandate and the employer mandate will also remain in place for that Medicaid expansion States will continue to receive Federal funding. So if a State is happy with the status quo--with spiraling costs, with limited choices, with a market that is broken--fine, keep the In some States, maybe it is working well. States should have that option, and they would under the Cassidy-Collins bill.  More appealing to many States, however, would be what we call the better choice option in the Patient Freedom Act that would allow a State to waive many of the requirements of the ACA, except for vital consumer protections, and still receive Federal funding to help its residents purchase affordable health insurance. Senator Cassidy has explained how it would work so I will not go through that all again.  Let me just say that eligible individuals in States selecting this option would receive Federal funding deposited into their Roth health savings accounts. The aggregate funding for these per-beneficiary deposits would be determined based on the total amount of funding that the Federal Government would have provided in the form of ACA subsidies in each State, plus any funding each State would have received had it chosen to expand its Medicaid Program--even if, like my State, it has chosen not to do so. These deposits in the Roth health savings accounts would be phased out for higher income beneficiaries.  States selecting this option for every resident who does not have health insurance coverage through his or her employer or through public programs like Medicare or the VA or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program--in those States, the option would be a standard health insurance plan that would include first-dollar coverage through the Roth health savings account, basic prescription drug coverage, and a high-deductible health plan. States could automatically enroll their residents who are uninsured in this standard plan, unless an individual opted to use his or her health savings account to purchase more comprehensive coverage or opted out of coverage altogether. I can't imagine someone making the choice of opting out altogether when they would receive this generous subsidy.  In addition to Federal funds, individuals and employers could make contributions to these health savings accounts, and the balances would grow tax-free. The bill also provides for a partial tax credit for very low-income individuals who do receive employer-based coverage to help these workers pay for their deductibles and their copays.  Here is another important provision of our bill: Health care providers receiving payments from the Roth health savings accounts would be required to publish cash prices for their services. That would add transparency that is sorely lacking in our current system and that we need to move toward a more patient-directed health care future. For example, if your physician has suggested that you have a colonoscopy, you would know whether one hospital or one clinic would charge more than another so you can make the right decision for you.  Health care reform should be about expanding affordable choices, and that is what our legislation aims to do by allowing States to structure their individual health insurance markets and to do so without the burdensome individual mandate, the employer mandate, or many of the other restrictive requirements in the ACA that have substantially driven up costs and forced millions of Americans to buy coverage that is more than they want, need, or can afford. Americans should have the choice to purchase more affordable coverage, if that is what works best for them.  Let me again emphasize, since misinformation was given to the press about the consumer protections in our bill, the Patient Freedom Act would retain several important consumer protections, contrary to what was said earlier today by a colleague who hadn't read our bill. Dependents will be able to remain on their parents' health insurance policies until age 26. Insurance companies will still not be able to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions or discriminate based on health status. In fact, there is no medical underwriting for the standard plan offered under the better choice option. Insurance companies cannot cap benefits by including lifetime or annual limits in their policies, and they must offer to renew policies as long as enrollees continue to pay premiums. Insurance companies must also continue to cover mental health and substance use disorder benefits for individuals, a particularly important benefit given the nationwide scope of the opioid crisis that has seriously affected my State of Maine and so many other States throughout our country, ruining the lives of individuals, their families, and their communities.  Provisions like these vital consumer protections should be retained. However, the Washington centric approach of the ACA must be changed if we are ever to truly reform our broken health care system.  I am pleased to see a growing consensus among Members of both the Senate and the House that we must fix the Affordable Care Act and provide reforms at nearly the same time as we repeal the law. This will help protect the families who rely on the program and give insurers time to transition to a new marketplace that is based on more choices for consumers. That is what we are trying to do here. Reforms in the way we provide health insurance must ensure that individuals relying on the current system do not experience a needless and avoidable gap in coverage.  If we are going to reform the system, we must begin to put specific proposals on the table for our colleagues to debate, refine, amend, and enact. That is why the criticism is so disappointing. This is an attempt to put forth a possible solution that would appeal to Members on both sides of the aisle.  As we continue our work to find a responsible path to repealing and repairing the ACA, we should give the States the freedom to choose what they believe works best for their citizens, whether that means staying with the Affordable Care Act or selecting a different path--in my view, a better path--that will lead to patient-directed reforms that contain costs and provide more choice. The Patient Freedom Act does exactly that, and I commend my colleague Senator Cassidy for his leadership on this legislation. I also want to thank our cosponsors, including Senator Isakson and Senator Capito for their support as well.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS400.txt,2121,"REQUEST TO CALL UP H.R. 724, STATUE OF LIBERTY VALUES ACT OF 2017",2017.0,23.0,January
966,topic-id,855,"Mr.President, as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I am delighted to introduce, with my good friend and former ranking member, Senator Claire McCaskill, the Senior$afe Act of 2017, a bill that would help protect American seniors from financial fraud. I'm pleased that Senators Isakson, Casey, Tillis, Klobuchar, Wicker, Shaheen, Capito, Tester, Barrasso, Donnelly, Heller, and King have joined us in sponsoring this bill.  According to the GAO, financial fraud targeting older Americans is a growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9 billion annually. Stopping this tsunami of fraud is one of the top priorities of the Aging Last Congress, we held several hearings examining an endless variety of financial abuses targeting our nation's seniors. These range from the notorious IRS phone scam that burst onto the scene in 2015, to the incredible ``drug mule'' scam, where trusting seniors have been tricked by international narcotics traffickers into unwittingly serving as drug couriers, and then find themselves arrested and locked-up in foreign jails. The common denominator in these schemes involves innocent seniors falling prey and being tricked out of their hard-earned savings.  Sadly, not all scammers are strangers to their victims, in too many cases, seniors are exploited by someone they know well. Sometimes, that abuse is perpetrated by ``friends'' or family members who are handling the victim's affairs informally. Other times, the abuse is committed under color of a fiduciary relationship, such as a Power of Attorney or guardianship.  No matter the scheme, one factor is common to all--the fraudsters need to gain the trust and active cooperation of their victims. Without this, their schemes would fail. That is why it is so important that seniors recognize as quickly as possible the red flags that signal potential fraud.  Unfortunately, many seniors do not see these red flags. Sometimes they are[[Page S450]]too trusting or are suffering from diminished capacity, but, just as often, they miss the signs because the swindlers who prey on them are extremely crafty and know how to sound convincing. Whatever the reason, a warning sign that can slip by a victim might trigger a second look by fmancial service representatives trained to spot common scams, who know enough about a senior's habits to question a transaction that doesn't look right. In our work on the Aging Committee, we have heard of many instances where quick action by bank and credit union employees has stopped a fraud in progress, saving seniors untold thousands of dollars.  Let me give you an example. Last year, an attorney in the small coastal city of Belfast, ME, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for bilking two elderly female clients out of nearly a half a million dollars over the course of several years.  The lawyer's brazen theft was uncovered when a teller at a local bank noticed that he was writing large checks to himself on his clients' accounts. When confronted by authorities, he offered excuses that the prosecutor later described as ``breathtaking.'' For example, according to press reports, he put one of his clients into a nursing home to recover from a temporary medical condition, and then kept her there for four years until the theft of her funds came to light. Meanwhile, he submitted bills for ``services,'' sometimes totaling $20,000 a month, including charging her $250 per hour for 6 to 7 hours to check on her house, even though his office was just a one-minute drive down the road.  In another example, in 2015, a senior citizen in Vassalboro, Maine, was looking to wire funds from his account at Maine Savings Federal Credit Union to an out-of-state location, supposedly to bail out a relative who was in jail. Something about this transaction did not sound right to the credit union employee. She asked the customer, and he said he had received a call from an ``official'' at the jail--but that ``official'' had instructed him not to speak to anyone about this. The ``official,'' of course, turned out to be a con artist.  Fortunately, the credit union worker recognized this as a scam, and her quick thinking saved her customer from falling victim and losing his savings.  These stories demonstrate the critical nexus that financial institutions occupy between fraudsters and their victims. Their employees, if properly trained, can be the first line of defense protecting our seniors from these criminals. Regrettably, various state and federal laws can inadvertently impede efforts to protect seniors, because financial institutions that report suspected fraud can be exposed to litigation. The Senior$afe Act encourages financial institutions to train their employees, and shields them from lawsuits when they make good faith, reasonable reports of potential fraud to the proper authorities.  There is no doubt that financial fraud and scams targeting seniors is a growing problem that we must act on. Last November, the Aging Committee heard testimony from Jaye Martin, the Executive Director of Maine Legal Services for the Elderly, who told the Committee that her organization has seen a 24 percent increase in reports of elder abuse in just one year. Many of these cases involve financial fraud.  In a letter describing her support for the Senior$afe Act, ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS447.txt,2121,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

381,topic-id,1144,"Mr.Speaker, within hours of taking the oath as President of the United States, Donald Trump signaled that his much touted ``New Deal for Black America'' is just the same ``old deal'' of discrimination, voter suppression and establishment entitlement. In politics, as in life, actions always speak louder than words. And the speed of his repudiation of the inclusive agenda of the Obama administration shouts his intention to turn back the clock on civil rights for a broad swath of our nation.  Since the Supreme Court suspended the application of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County Case, African American communities around the nation have fought the passage of discriminatory voter identification laws as part of a scheme to suppress the vote. The states of Texas and North Carolina have been particular battlegrounds, where important victories were achieved in the federal courts. The work of civil rights advocacy groups received important support from the Voting Section of the DOJ Civil Rights Division in reversing some of the most aggressive state-passed voter suppression plans.  As many have feared, the election of Trump threatens to produce a radical change in support for voting rights from the White Unlike even President George Bush, who signed the reauthorization of Section 5 of the VRA, Trump has exhibited an hostility to voting rights not seen since the Civil Rights era.  By Friday afternoon, lawyers for the Department asked for a delay in the hearing scheduled for tomorrow on the Texas voter ID case, citing the change in presidential administrations. The motion noted that ``Because of the change in administration, the Department of Justice also experienced a transition in leadership, . . . and requires additional time to brief the new leadership of the Department on this case and the issues to be addressed at the hearing before making any representations to the Court.'' It is generally expected that DOJ will reverse course in the case.  This case is a bellwether of what can be expected from a Trump DOJ on civil rights. Given the size of Texas and the precedential impact of the case, the stakes in this litigation could not be higher for the minority community.  The voting law at issue in the case, known as SB 14, set strict requirements for permissible ID to vote. While it included such identification as a driver's license, passport and a concealed handgun license, it excluded identification like federal government or student  In July, the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans ruled that the law violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it disproportionately affected minorities. The Department of Justice had previously argued that the law violated the Voting Rights Act and was intended to directly impact the abilities of minorities to vote, as more than 600,000 minorities lacked the ID necessary under state law to vote.  The belief that the Civil Rights Division will change position and will be under attack is well founded. Last Thursday, it was reported that the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Violence Against Women Grants and the Legal Services Corporation would be target for elimination and the Civil Rights Division would have its funding cut as part of Trump plan for reducing the size of the federal government.  Most troubling, it was also reported that John Gore, an attorney who led the legal teams on several key cases attacking civil rights, would be the head of DOJ' s Civil Rights Division as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil  Gore was one of the defense attorneys who argued in court on behalf of North Carolina's legally dubious and discriminatory anti-transgender bill The bill blocks transgender people from using public bathrooms that align with their gender identity. The bottom line here is that Gore was on the side of discrimination in the country's most high-profile LGBTQ rights case of the past year. (Many will recall that this legislation generated a huge economic backlash against the state, including the relocation of major sporting events).  His record of being a legal champion for discriminatory causes appears to be a highlight of Gore's legal career. One of his main areas of expertise appears to be defending redistricting plans against claims of civil rights violations, with his online bio boasting of a number of successful such defenses.  One of the most high-profile civil rights cases Gore has litigated in recent years is the Florida Purge case. This case brought many of us to the floor to denounce yet another attempt at voter suppression that was designed to alter the balance of state politics. The state of Florida was found to have violated the National Voter Registration Act with a systemic purge of voters it suspected of being non-citizens. As the New York Times wrote of Florida's voter restriction attempt:       The program to identify and remove noncitizens from the      rolls prompted a national outcry and several lawsuits in 2012      because it was riddled with mistakes and was being pushed      through months before the election. A number of people on the      lists, which were sent by the state to county election      supervisors, were, in fact, citizens (including the two lead      plaintiffs in the lawsuit).  Just as we opposed the nomination of Jeff Sessions to serve as Attorney General, we must similarly build a record against John Gore to head the Civil Rights We simply cannot entrust our legacy civil rights statutes to any person who has shown a lack of sensitivity and balance in protecting the interests of justice in our society.  Though Trump's inaugural speech invoked an image of my home City of Detroit, I fear what his vision will mean for my community and vow to continue the struggle for jobs, justice and peace. He stated that ``the time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.'' I take him at his word and his actions send an unmistakable message: His action is to appoint a defender of discrimination to head the Civil Rights His action is to retreat from an agenda on Community Oriented His action is to undermine affordable healthcare. His action is to appoint cabinet officials who fail to represent the mosaic that is  The Congressional Black Caucus took to this floor tonight to outline our response to the President's Inaugural Address & New Deal for African-While our views may not find much in common, I believe we can agree on this: the time for talk is indeed over and the hour for action has arrived. This caucus will not stand idly by while an administration attempts to turn back the clock. The greatness of America is found in its diversity, inclusiveness and empathy. That is why we are the beacon on the hill. Whether we fly, walk or crawl, we are committed to moving this nation forward and will not turn back.[[Page H606]]    ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH599.txt,229,VOTER SUPPRESSION AND MUSLIM BAN,2017.0,23.0,January
660,topic-id,475,"Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.7, the so-called ``No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017.''  The Majority marks the 44th anniversary of Roe v. Wade this week with its latest attempt to undo that decision's unequivocal recognition of a woman's constitutionally protected right to choose to terminate a pregnancy.  We must recognize this bill for what it really is. H.7 is yet another attack by the Majority on women's health, a goal it accomplishes in several respects.  To begin with, H.7 would make it virtually impossible for a woman to obtain abortion services even when paid for with purely private, non-Federal funds.  It achieves this end by denying Affordable Care Act tax credits to income-eligible women and small business employers who choose insurance coverage that includes abortion.  Through its novel tax penalty provisions, H.7 departs radically from existing law, taking away women's existing health care and placing their health and lives at risk.  Despite the claims of its sponsors, H.7 does not merely codify current law, but, rather, goes well beyond it to deny women basic health care services.  Moreover, to the extent it bans federal funding of abortion services, H.7 is unnecessary, because such funding is already banned by the Hyde Amendment, and the Affordable Care Act maintains that ban.  For more than 30 years, Congress has prohibited federal funding of abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, through the Hyde Amendment and similar measures in annual appropriations bills.  Nothing in the Affordable Care Act changes this. That Act does not permit federal funding of abortion, and ensures that only private funds can be used to purchase abortion insurance coverage.  There is absolutely no risk that public money will be used to pay for abortion services.  So what is H.7 really about? Plain and simple, it is part of the Majority's relentless war against women's health and constitutional freedoms.  Members should understand that a vote for H.7 is not a vote to codify existing law. It is, instead, a vote to attack women's health and equality.  Finally, we should reject H.7's permanent restriction on the District of Columbia's use of local funds that Congress has approved.  H.7 not only infringes women's constitutional rights, but also intrudes deeply into local government decision-making by the  Women and families who live in the District should not be singled out for additional harm simply because of where they live.  Last Congress, the Obama Administration ``strongly oppose[d]'' a substantially similar bill, saying the legislation ``would intrude on women's reproductive freedom and access to health care; increase the financial burden on many Americans; [and] unnecessarily restrict the private insurance choices that consumers have today.''  I agree wholeheartedly with that analysis and, accordingly, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous bill.  ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgH633-3.txt,229,1415,2017.0,24.0,January
1711,topic-id,2057,"Mr.President, after two long one-on-one meetings with Mr.Rex Tillerson, after a thorough confirmation hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee that stretched over some 9 hours, and after extensive additional research and reading and digging into his record, his public statements, and his views, I announced last week that I would oppose the nomination of Rex Tillerson to be Secretary of State of the United  I will say that over our meetings, our conversations, and my review of his record, I have come to respect Mr.Tillerson as a thoughtful and seasoned and capable professional in his line of work, with impressive international business experience. And I will say that his quick action to sever financial ties with ExxonMobil is a strong example that I wish President Trump had followed with regard to his own private business interests.  I found encouraging some of Mr.Tillerson's statements in the confirmation hearing and his public stances, including his commitment to NATO, his respect for U.leadership in multilateral initiatives, from the Paris climate change agreement to the Iran deal, and his support for development programs throughout the world but especially in Africa, a continent where I have been engaged in my 6 years on the Senate Foreign Relations  His nomination has the support of highly respected former officials, from Brent Scowcroft and Bob Gates to James Baker and Condoleezza Rice, former Secretaries and National Security  But Mr.Tillerson and I disagree strongly on key issues. I believe, for example, that climate change is a pressing national security threat that must be addressed. Mr.Tillerson saw it somewhat differently. I believe in advocating for human rights, for a free press, and for democracy around the world because these principles advance our security and our economic interests here at home. I don't believe that human rights, press freedom, and democracy are add-ons, are things that we can address and deal with after national security is addressed. These are core to who we are as a nation and to the advocacy and engagement that I hope for and expect from our State Department and our next Secretary of  These are just a few of the reasons why I ultimately decided to oppose Mr.Tillerson's confirmation, but that is not why I have come to the floor today. I am here today principally because the challenge we face is not whether a single nominee is the perfect person for this particular role; the challenge we and the American people now face is to determine the future we seek for our country and the world stage and whether we will choose to continue to lead the free world.  Do we envision the United States leading by example through actions that show we will stand by our values, especially when it is challenging or difficult? Do we envision the United States leading a coalition of democratic allies and Muslim partners around the world in the global fight on terrorism, defending each other and promoting values of human rights, the rule of law, and democracy? Or do we accept a dark and dystopian vision that sees the world in strict zero-sum terms whereby any win for our allies or partners is automatically a loss for America; a vision in which we could abandon our values for political gain; a vision that distances us from the world both by a literal wall and a growing gulf in priorities?  For decades, Republicans and Democrats have agreed on foundational principles of U.leadership in the world. We engage with the world. We consistently and reliably support our allies. We lead by example, especially on our core values. We fight for the rule of law, for human rights, and for democratic institutions because doing so makes us safer and more secure.  Consider our alliances. The Heritage Foundation accurately pointed out that supporting our allies overseas and in particular our treasured and enduring alliance with our NATO partners in Western Europe isn't charity but, rather, a proven method for keeping the United States safe and secure. As Heritage puts it, alliances prevent wars by driving up the cost of aggression. Alliances deter our rivals and adversaries. Alliances promote stability, help us project power, and enhance our legitimacy.  Why does this matter? Why is this a current matter of debate? Why is this a pressing concern in the context of this nomination and in the work of this body? Take, for example, Russia under Vladimir It is the unanimous view of all 17 U.intelligence agencies that Russia conducted and organized an intentional campaign of interfering in our 2016 Presidential election and that Russia conducted a cyber attack, authorized at the highest level, with the intention to influence the outcome of our election.  I cannot imagine a more direct frontal assault on who we are as a nation than to seek to influence our democratic election. But on top of that unprecedented attack on who we are as a nation, Vladimir Putin's Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula and continues to support the murderous Assad regime in Today, Russia is preparing--even threatening--to intervene in upcoming elections across Central and Western Europe, including elections in our longtime close allies, France and It has been amassing troops on the borders of our NATO partners, such as Estonia and the other Baltic States, and conducting snap exercises up and down the border with It is precisely because of these acts of aggression that the NATO alliance is more relevant and more important than ever.  These aren't groundbreaking or controversial conclusions that I am reaching today. Yet President Trump's rhetoric as a candidate, his early actions as President, his compliments to Vladimir Putin, his claims that NATO is obsolete, and his intimation that he may not honor our article 5 mutual defense commitment to our NATO allies all call into question the President's understanding of the role that our alliances play. It also calls into question whether his administration understands the consequences of weakening or abandoning these alliance.  More than perhaps any nation on Earth, the United States has deeply benefited from the stable world order that we helped shape following the Second World After Americans went throughout the world to fight the forces of fascism and imperialism in the Pacific and the European theater in the Second World War, we sat astride the world as the most powerful country on Earth, with weapons possessed by no other, with the greatest manufacturing and military might on the planet, and we set about establishing an inclusive, rules-based, democratically oriented world order, from which we have benefited more than any other nation. NATO has become a key part of the alliances that we have relied on for that peace and stability in the seven decades since.  Let's not forget that the only time NATO invoked its mutual defense provision article 5 clause was when our allies came to our defense after 9/11. So to suggest that NATO is obsolete or outdated because it wasn't developed in a time where terrorism was a central threat gives a lie to the reality that our NATO allies have stood shoulder to shoulder with us and have fought alongside American service men and women in Iraq and Nearly 1,000 have given their lives, and our NATO allies have poured their blood and treasure into our defense and into our joint conduct against our enemies in Afghanistan and  Interpreters from Iraq and Afghanistan have kept our troops safe, and yet today those espousing ``America First'' would break our promises to these vital partners. I have to ask: To what end? When we turn our backs on our allies and friends, there are consequences. They may be prompted to seek to help themselves in new or unexpected or dangerous ways, such as developing their own nuclear capability or seeking armaments from Russia rather than working in partnership with us for their own security. They may seek to find new allies who do not,[[Page S524]]in fact, share our values. In all these cases, ``America First'' may gradually, tragically, become instead ``America Alone.'' That leaves us less safe and closes off economic opportunities around the world. So in seeking out a strategy that is purported to make us safer and stronger, President Trump may, in fact, accomplish neither.  A policy of ``America First'' doesn't just mean turning our backs on our allies and partners. It may also mean turning our backs on some of the world's most vulnerable people, with real consequences here at home. The Executive order signed by President Trump just on Friday, banning all refugees from the United States for 120 days, banning refugees for 90 days from seven countries and indefinitely from Syria, caused chaos and confusion at our airports and instilled concern--even fear--in American families across our country.  I have a key question today, introduced earlier by Senator Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, but not yet answered: Where does Rex Tillerson stand on this Executive order? How does he see it in our place in the world? How does he understand the centrality of the example that we show to the world in how we embrace human rights?  Sadly, I think this Executive order has validated the claims of jihadist groups like ISIS that recruit young men on the false claim that the West is at war with Islam, which is why these very terrorist groups are today cheering this Executive order. I think it has made us less safe by alienating Muslims in the United States and around the world. Why would we want to alienate the very Iraqis with whom we are training, serving, and fighting in the war against ISIS when they are a critical part of the ground forces that we are counting on to liberate Mosul from the tyranny of ISIS?  Most significantly, this Executive order may violate our Constitution and values by banning people based not on security concerns but on the basis of their religion, and by turning our backs on a decades-long commitment to welcome those fleeing credible fears of persecution, fleeing violence and chaos in their home countries. These may be the consequences of ``America First.''  It is well known but bears repeating that in 1939, a ship called the Louis approached American shores bearing nearly 1,000 mostly Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of the Nazi regime and the impending In one of our Nation's most shameful chapters, the United States turned away these refugees seeking our shores. One passenger on board the Louis received a telegram from the U.Government instructing him that passengers must ``await their turns on the waiting list and qualify for and obtain immigration visas before they may be admissible.'' Most of these refugees were forced to return to Europe, where they were murdered by the  This tragic episode from 1939, born of isolationism and, tragically, anti-Semitism and a mistaken sense that we could isolate ourselves from the challenges and the violence of the world was also part of a period when a group whose name was the America First Committee mobilized to try to prevent our entry into the Second World  I will say that these are the consequences of ``America First.'' The United States ultimately is less safe. Our allies may be made to feel uncertain or even betrayed. Americans will find themselves more fearful, and, our values, with which we have sought to lead the world, are cast aside.  That is why I believe this debate today is about far more than a single nominee for an important post in our State American leadership on the world stage is not as simple as ``America First,'' and the consequences of truly embracing the dystopian vision of ``America First,'' I think, will be tragic.  If Mr.Tillerson is confirmed, it is my sincere and earnest hope that he will challenge President Trump to rethink the dark and dystopian view of the world that he laid out in his inaugural address, and that he will instead bend his skills, character, and qualities to the hard work of realigning our role in the world to the course that Republicans and Democrats together have steered from this floor and from this body for seven decades.  As the world saw last weekend, the new Trump administration desperately needs someone in the room to speak truth to power and to temper its worst impulses.  I yield the floor.

This sale will involve the release of sensitive      technology to the United Kingdom in the performance of      services to sustain eight (8) United Kingdom C-17 aircraft.      While much of the below equipment supporting the C-17 is not      new to the country, there will be replenishment spares of the      below sensitive technologies purchased to support the fleet.       2. The Force 524D is a 24-channel SAASM based Global      Positioning System (GPS) receiver, with precise positioning      service (PPS) capability built upon Trimble's next generation      OPS technology. The Force 524D retains backward compatibility      with the proven Force 5GS, while adding new functionality to      interface with digital antenna electronics, to significantly      improve anti-jam (AJ) performance. The host platform can      select the radio frequency (RF) or digital antenna      electronics (DAE) interface. In the digital mode, the Force      524D is capable of controlling up to 16 independent beams.      The hardware and software associated with the 524D receiver      card is       3. The C-17 aircraft will be equipped with the GAS-1, which      is comprised of the Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas      (CRPA), with the associated wiring harness and the Antenna      Electronics (AE)-1, to provide AJ capability. The hardware is            4. The KIV-77 is the crypto applique for Mode V      Identification Friend or Foe (IFF). The hardware is      UNCLASSIFIED and COMSEC controlled.       5. Software, hardware, and other data/information, which is      classified or sensitive, is reviewed prior to release to      protect system vulnerabilities, design data, and performance      parameters. Some end-item hardware, software, and other data      identified above are classified at the CONFIDENTIAL and      SECRET level. Potential compromise of these systems is      controlled through management of the basic software programs,      of highly sensitive systems and software-controlled weapon      systems, on a case-by-case basis.       6. The United Kingdom is both willing and able to protect      United States classified military information. The United      Kingdom's physical and document security standards are      equivalent to U.standards. The United Kingdom has      demonstrated its willingness and capability to protect      sensitive military technology and information released to its      military in the past. The United Kingdom is firmly committed      to its relationship with the United States and to its promise      to protect classified information and prevent its transfer to      a third party.       7. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain      knowledge of the specific hardware or software source code in      this proposed sale, the information could be used to develop      countermeasures which might reduce weapon system      effectiveness or be used in the development of systems with      similar or advanced capabilities. The benefits to be derived      from this sale in the furtherance of the U.foreign policy      and national security objectives, as outlined in the Policy      Justification, outweigh the potential damage that could      result if the sensitive technology, were revealed to      unauthorized persons.       8. All defense articles and services listed in this      transmittal are authorized for release and export to the      Government of the United                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS387-3.txt,1825,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,23.0,January

She is someone who has shown that ability as Governor of South  She also has a clarity about her as it relates to representing U.interests. People on both sides of the aisle in our committee were able to recognize that her instincts relative to where the United States needs to be on certain issues--I think most of us understand that the United States leading on issues of human rights, leading on issues of conscience, that the American values we all hold dear and want to promote around the world are things that she has the ability to communicate and cares deeply about, and I think people were very impressed.  The United Nations has multiple issues relative to peacekeeping that have not been addressed. Sexual exportation and abuse by peacekeepers have been rampant, and things have not been done in that regard to curtail that activity or at least not in the ways that they should, and I know she is very passionate about that issue.  There is no question that she is not the most adept person at foreign policy. She would be the first person to say that. She has spent most of her time out of the country solely on economic development trips. I think where the United Nations is today is at a place where we need a really driven person who cares about our own U.national interests but also has the ability to break through the clutter and reform.  She has worked with legislators to bring people together, to make that happen in her own She has had an exemplary record in that regard. My guess is that is really the first effort that needs to take place. Over time, through the relationships she develops there, the travel that will take place, I am absolutely certain--especially with the drive that she has--she will develop some of the other capacity that I know she will want to utilize there at the United  I am here to recommend her.

He testified in a public hearing for more than 8 hours and afterward responded to over 1,000 additional questions for the record from committee members.

56,topic-id,953,"Mr.President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island for his courtesy.  Last week, the Senate took the first step in providing needed relief for the American people from a health care plan, the Affordable Care Act, that overpromised and underdelivered. Many people are hurting now as a result of the failed promises of They were told their premiums would go down, that they would be able to keep the policy they had if they liked it, and that if they liked their doctor, they could keep their doctor, none of which has proved to be true. So it is important that we keep our commitment to the American people. I believe we have gotten a mandate as a result of the election on November 8 that we keep our promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to deliver health care that is affordable and is a matter of individual choice and freedom of choice.  The basic problem with ObamaCare is that it was command and control right out of Washington, DC, where people didn't have sufficient humility when it comes to rearranging one-sixth of our national economy and believed that they could, in the process of writing a 2,700-page bill--that I doubt many of them read--take over and improve our health care delivery system.  It was sold on the basis of providing people access to affordable care, and in many instances, according to my constituents, they have seen their premiums skyrocket and deductibles skyrocket, effectively being insured but giving them no benefit of insurance coverage at all.  I realize there were some things that people liked to talk about when they talk about ObamaCare that were positive; for example, dealing with people with preexisting conditions. I agree that people should not lose their health insurance coverage when they change employers and be caught in a trap where your insurance company doesn't cover your preexisting condition, but you don't need ObamaCare in order to deal with that problem. People also like the idea that single adults living at home can continue to be listed on their parents' health insurance up to age 26. That is enormously popular on a bipartisan basis. Again, we don't need a 2,700-page takeover of the health care system in order to deliver some of these consensus items of reform.  I believe, and we believe, that there are certain principles that ought to govern the replacement of ObamaCare that we will see unfold in the coming weeks; first and foremost, moving the health care decisions outside of Washington and back to where they belong--to patients, families, and their doctor.  We also believe patients ought to have more tools, such as health savings accounts which they can use to pay for their regular health care along with perhaps a catastrophic coverage which would help them in the event of an unexpected health care condition that would require hospitalization. If you are young and healthy and don't need all the money you set aside in health savings accounts, you can keep that money and use it for your eventual retirement.  We also believe we ought to break down barriers that restrict choice and permit Americans to pick an insurance plan that is best for them and their family. One of the worst aspects of ObamaCare is that Washington, DC, said: Here is your health care coverage, and we are going to punish you with a penalty if you don't buy it, forcing people to buy coverage that they didn't want and didn't need--for example, a single male being forced, in essence, to buy maternity coverage. That is just 1 of the 10 essential health benefits that was mandated in ObamaCare that drove the cost of insurance through the roof, not to mention the fact that the pools of people who were insured tended to be older and less well, thus driving premiums again through the roof.  Another principle that is really important to our health care reform replacement is empowering small businesses to provide employees with the kind of health care coverage that meets their needs through association health plans so they can pool their risks together to bring costs down and to increase their choices. We believe there ought to be flexibility on the part of the States when it comes to Medicaid spending. We ought to, in my book, give the States the money and the block grant and say: Come up with a health care delivery system for Medicaid's low-income citizens that best suits their needs. We haven't done that under We have had a mandate and tied the hands of the States when it comes to coming up with alternatives to health care delivery.  Finally, when it comes to employers that provide 61 percent of the health care coverage for Americans, rather than tying their hands and driving up costs, what we ought to do is allow for increased flexibility for employer-sponsored plans that will help bring down the costs. We hear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talking about ObamaCare like it was the gold[[Page S331]]standard: There is nothing wrong with it. It is just perfect as it is.  Well, I don't have to tell our Democratic friends about the unintended consequences of this partisan exercise. ObamaCare was passed without a single Republican vote so the problems that have developed from it are problems that were created by our Democratic colleagues. Having said that, we hope they will work with us to come up with an alternative which we believe would be an improvement on the status quo, to make health care more available, at a price people can afford, with choices that would be theirs, not a mandate out of Washington,                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS330.txt,1692,A RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS AND NEW DEAL FOR,2017.0,17.0,January
61,topic-id,900,"Mr.President, let me talk just a minute about the nominations process. In 2009, when President Obama was sworn into office, there were seven Cabinet members sworn in on his first day in office. That is a demonstration of the good faith and civility that ordinarily extends in the peaceful transition of power from one President to another. That doesn't mean we were excited on this side of the aisle about the fact that President Obama won as opposed to our preferred candidate, but we believed it was our responsibility to carry on this tradition of peaceful transition of power. The President, having won the election, was entitled to surround himself with his team, subject to the vetting and the confirmation process and the process known as advise and consent.  I believe we need to see some cooperation from our colleagues across the aisle, including the confirmation of the next Attorney General of the United States, Senator Jeff Our Senate colleagues know Jeff They have worked alongside him. They don't need to read his resume, they don't need to know more about his record because they know his heart. They know Jeff to be an honorable and decent man who believes fervently in the rule of law and who will drain that swamp known as the Department of Justice, which has become an outpost of the political operation in the White House, and restore it to its rightful reputation as a Department of Justice that believes in equal justice under the law and doesn't play politics.  I would also state that our colleagues across the aisle ought to work with us to confirm the next Secretary of State, Rex Mr.Tillerson, I believe, is an inspired choice for Secretary of Some have wanted to say that the relationships he has developed around the world working on behalf of the shareholders of ExxonMobil are a liability. I actually view it as a spring. When you are talking to somebody, you are less likely to get involved in a fight or get involved in a misunderstanding that might lead to some unnecessary conflict. I don't have any doubts about his willingness and commitment to work on behalf of the United States and all of our people, just like he has worked on behalf of the shareholders of the business he has run for all these years.  Finally, let me just say a word about the Secretary of Defense nominee, James We overwhelmingly passed a waiver that would reduce the number of years a uniformed military officer had to be out of the military before they would be eligible for Secretary of I think the reason it passed by such a wide bipartisan majority is people realize there aren't many men or women in the world like James Mattis with the qualities that he brings to this important job. He is a real warrior statesman. Someone who has walked the walk and seen live combat during a 40-year career in the U.Marine  During his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week, all of us had a chance, along with our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, to ask him how he would handle a host of foreign policy and national security issues. During the question-and-answer period, he mentioned the importance of preserving our country's military power, but he also noted that our Nation has historically held the power of inspiration by our example, inspiring others around the world with our democracy. That extends well beyond our uniformed military and the threat of military might. That is something that should be cultivated well beyond our military preparedness. The point is, with General Mattis, we have a strategic thinker who sees the big picture, and I am confident he will lead our military in a way that advances our interests around the world, and what I am particularly looking for are leaders in the Trump administration who will restore America's leadership role around the world wherever we go and wherever we look because I believe, in my heart of hearts, that one reason the world has become more dangerous and less stable is because many people around the world who are adversaries have viewed the Obama administration as retreating from America's traditional leadership role in the world, and believe me, there are plenty of countries--plenty of bad actors--that are willing to take advantage of that void when America retreats and doesn't demonstrate its historic leadership role.  I hope all of our colleagues will join us in supporting not only General Mattis's confirmation but Secretary of State Tillerson's and all of the others, including the Attorney General nominee, Jeff Sessions, and all of the other nominees of President-Elect They have every right to a thorough vetting. They have every right to ask hard questions to get information to help them vet these nominees. That is our job. In the end, they should not delay for just delay's sake, which unfortunately some of them have threatened to do. That will not help anybody. It will not help this new administration, it will not make America a safer place, and it will make us more vulnerable to those around the world who want to disrupt the peaceful transition of power from one Presidency to the next.

433,topic-id,2005,"Mr.President, I had a chance to listen to our friend, the Democratic leader, and it is becoming clearer exactly what his strategy is for dealing with the aftermath of the November 8 election, in which Republicans retained the majority in both Houses of Congress and picked up the White House to boot. I realize it was a shock to our Democratic friends--the election that occurred on November 8 and the verdict of the American people, given the choices they were presented. What is becoming increasingly clear is that the Democratic leader, the Senator from New York, believes that Democrats and the country are better served by being an opposition party--in other words, opposed to everything that is proposed by either the President or anybody on this side of the aisle.  Rather than working together with us to try to build consensus, to try to address the challenges that face the country, what they are going to do is to sit back and enjoy the failure--which is what they are hoping and praying for--when we try to do this alone. We know our system is built on bipartisan cooperation and consensus building, and I have to tell my friend, the Senator from New York, Mr.Schumer, that I doubt his party's political prospects are going to improve as long as people see them as a restoration of the status quo at a time when they voted for change. Rather than working together to find solutions to the challenges that face our country, they have decided to sit back, drag their heels, oppose, and say no to each and every constructive solution offered by either the White House or this side of the aisle. I really do hope they decide that this is a recipe for political failure, continuing to wander in the political wilderness.  At a time when the voters voted for change, they are arguing for a restoration of the status quo--the direction that the country, the majority of voters, and certainly those whose votes are reflected in the Electoral College felt was a wrong direction for our country.  So I believe that most Americans greeted the peaceful transfer of power[[Page S370]]as reflected by the inaugural ceremonies of last Friday with relief and welcomed a new day in the country.  My wife and I had the chance to attend those inauguration ceremonies. Let me first say to President Trump, the First Lady, and his family, as they start this journey leading the Nation, that I wish you well and offer my help, because I believe if President Trump succeeds and if his administration succeeds, then there is a better chance that the country will succeed, and it is not going to happen by opposing each and every idea of the administration, which our Democratic colleagues seem bound and determined to do, being seen as merely obstructionist and being naysayers rather than constructive solution finders for the problems that confront the country. I am very hopeful about what the future holds, and I look forward to working with the new President in the years ahead to strengthen our country.  One obvious way all of us can support this peaceful transition of power, which is the hallmark of our democracy, is by making sure that President Trump has the counsel and advice of the men and women he has chosen to serve with him in his Our Democratic colleagues at one point want to criticize the President for not making a smoother transition, while enjoying every difficulty encountered, at the same time by denying him the Cabinet that he has chosen to serve with him to lead the country.  We have said it before, but it bears repetition. On January 20, 2009, when President Obama was sworn into office, people on this side of the aisle weren't necessarily happy with the electoral outcome. Our preferred candidate did not win, but that didn't mean we obstructed President Obama's choice for his Indeed, we agreed to seven Cabinet members being approved on the first day that President Obama took office, on January 20, 2009.  Well, all of these positions are important and are necessary to make the transition of power in our democracy as smooth as possible. Posts such as Secretary of Defense and Homeland Security and the CIA Director, which we will be voting on later today, are particularly critical, given the national security responsibilities associated with them.  While I am glad we confirmed General Mattis and General Kelly on Friday, we should have voted on the nomination of Congressman Mike Pompeo to head the Central Intelligence  Mike Pompeo is well qualified for this position as CIA Director, but unfortunately some of our colleagues want to slow-walk his nomination. How is it that 89 Members could vote to proceed to confirm his nomination for today last Friday but still they denied us the opportunity for an up-or-down vote last Friday, which we should have had?  Our colleague from Oregon said that he wanted some debate during the light of day. Well, we were willing to stay as late, or into the weekend, as we needed to in order to get Congressman Pompeo confirmed, but, no, he wanted to delay it until today, so presumably there would be less competition for airtime on the evening news. I can't think of another reason he would have delayed that confirmation.  I just want to remind our colleagues that our country continues to face incredible threats, and they are not hitting the pause button. Instead, it is possible that some of our foes could try to test the resolve of President Trump and his new Cabinet during this period of transition, where everybody recognizes this is a period of vulnerability for the United  I am reminded of a sobering quote from the Director of National Intelligence during a hearing in 2016. Former Director Clapper, who served our intelligence community for more than half a century, testified: ``In my 50-plus years in the intelligence business,'' he said, ``I cannot recall a more diverse array of challenges and crises than we confront today.'' That is the former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, who spent more than half a century in the intelligence community.  So with that in mind, you would think that we could all agree that the President needs his national security Cabinet at his side, particularly his CIA Director, a Cabinet position integral to keeping our country safe. That is why, in my view, we must confirm Congressman Pompeo as the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency as soon as possible.  For those who don't know Mike well, he served in Congress for several years, including as a member of the House Intelligence And I have no doubt, as Director, he will do all he can to make sure that those serving in the intelligence community have the tools and the respect they need and deserve to keep America safe.  So we need to get this done and to get this done without further delay. Let's not keep the President of the United States from his team, a team that could help him better serve and better protect the people of this country.  And, even more, we need to have our Democratic colleagues recognize that the election is over. The votes have been counted. President Trump has been sworn into office. So we need to end the electioneering that has succeeded all of their activities since November 8. They haven't stopped the campaign.  The campaign is over. The voters have spoken. And we need to get busy governing on behalf of all the American people.  Some of the comments that were made on the floor last week by Senator Wyden from Oregon--when he objected to voting on the nomination of Congressman Pompeo, he raised the issue of surveillance programs and referred to the so-called 215 program that was designed to collect metadata, but not content, of foreign nationals. He referred to the USA FREEDOM Act, which Congress passed and which replaced the old 215 program with a new approach. But one thing he overlooked is that both the Senator from Oregon and I voted for final passage of the USA FREEDOM Act, as did Congressman They voted for the same piece of legislation, yet the Senator from Oregon wants to take the new CIA Director to task for apparently having some divergent views from his own, when they both voted for the same reforms in the USA FREEDOM That is why it seems so disingenuous when he suggests on the floor, as he has done, that Congressman Pompeo does not believe that there are any legal boundaries for surveillance programs. Indeed, in the Intelligence Committee last week, Congressman Pompeo, during his open hearing, said he would abide by the law of the land, as I am sure he will, and as we all must.  Surely the Senator from Oregon does not think that support for expanding access to certain metadata is grounds for opposing the nominee. In fact, 59 Members of the Senate and a majority of the Senate's Intelligence Committee last year voted to make clear that the government should be able to access Internet metadata with the use of national security letters.  Just to be clear, we are not talking about content. We are not talking about private information that is subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment of the U.When the government wants access to private information, subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy, it requires a search warrant, along with establishing probable cause to believe that a crime or threat is present.  So it is a little disingenuous to be arguing about metadata, which is not content, which is not protected by the Fourth Amendment, which doesn't require a search warrant, as a reason to object to Congressman Pompeo's nomination as CIA Indeed, as I pointed out, the Senator from Oregon and Congressman Pompeo and I all voted for legislation that he believes addressed the concerns he had with the previous metadata collection program.  Then there is the detention and interrogation policies of the U.Government post-9/11. It is time to turn the page on this chapter of the CIA's history. We need to focus now on how to defeat the threats of today and tomorrow, not relitigate the battles of yesterday.  But, to be clear, Senator Jeff Sessions, the President's choice for Attorney General, has made clear that the enhanced interrogation policies that were used with the approval of the Office of Legal Counsel and the authorities during the Bush administration no longer would be permissible because[[Page S371]]the Army Field Manual is now the law of the land. Congressman Pompeo voted for the legislation that made that change to Federal law, and he has pledged to follow it. So I am not sure what more we can ask of a nominee.  Finally, later today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on the nomination of Rex Tillerson, President Trump's nominee to serve as the next Secretary of I have known Mr.Tillerson for a number of years now. Over time, I have come to admire and respect him for many reasons. He has proven over a decades-long career in the top echelons of a large, global company that he has what it takes to represent not the shareholders that he has been representing but the American people throughout the world in the most sensitive diplomatic and international matters you can imagine. And, most of all, he has proved time and again that he is a man of strong conviction and character.  I have confidence that Mr.Tillerson will help the United States regain our leadership role in the world by unapologetically supporting our allies and our friends while keeping a check on our adversaries. He is, simply stated, the right man to lead our State Department, and I hope that the committee supports his nomination and that the full Senate votes to confirm him soon.

(2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders      from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy      communities. With input from the public, the Committee on      Human Spaceflight concluded that many practical and      aspirational rationales together constitute a compelling case      for human space exploration. These rationales include      economic benefits, national security, national prestige,      inspiring students and other citizens, scientific discovery,      human survival, and a sense of shared destiny.       (3) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars      is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight      program.       (4) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that the      National Aeronautics and Space Administration define a series      of sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and      technology development as needed to achieve the long-term      goal of placing humans on the surface of     3.

Our enemies have made a deliberate choice to oppose our way of life, and if we are to protect it, we must be equally deliberate, clear-eyed, and hard-nosed in our defense.  I have every confidence that Mike Pompeo will do that. He has succeeded in everything he has ever done. After his military service, he excelled at Harvard Law Later, he started his own company and went on to serve as president of another. He is a community leader in his adopted home of Wichita, where Kansans have elected him in repeated landslides to serve them in the House of In the House, Mike is a sober, respected voice.  In short, Mike has spent his entire life preparing for a moment like this. It is clear why President Trump didn't interview anyone else for the job after meeting  It is a big job, and the CIA will benefit from new blood and fresh leadership. Mike is ready for the job. As he said himself, he doesn't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to protecting our security and our privacy. Some politicians may say things like that, but it is all talk. It is nothing but talk. With Mike, it is the real deal.  Don't take my word for it. Here is what prominent Democrats are saying about Mike Leon Panetta, a respected public servant and former CIA Director himself, says Mike Pompeo ``is somebody who understands the intelligence agencies, is smart, and somebody I think will be a good director.''  John Brennan, who just departed as CIA Director, says he ``looks forward to being able to hand this baton over to somebody who is as dedicated an American as Mike Pompeo.''  Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says Mike Pompeo ``is bright and hard-working'' and ``he is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA director.''  I couldn't agree more. It seems, among the people who actually know Mike Pompeo--and who actually know the job--there are no last-minute political stunts or petty delaying tactics. They understand intelligence is deadly serious business and ought not be treated like a political football. In a world as dangerous as ours, with threats gathering every day, there is no more time for dithering. We need a CIA Director of the highest caliber, and Mike Pompeo is the man for the job.  I commend President Trump for this inspired nomination, I thank Mike for once again answering the call of duty, and I also thank his wife Susan for her love and steadfast support of Mike in the trying times and sacrifices that inevitably will lie ahead.  The time has come to put aside partisan politics and do the right thing for our country and the brave men and women of the I call on every Senator to vote for confirmation and to send to the CIA a strong leader, a wise counselor, and a fierce patriot.

1271,topic-id,736,"Mr.President, so once again we are hearing the Democrats and the media traffic in fake news. We heard a lot on this floor and over the weekend about a Muslim ban. This is a so-called Muslim ban that applies only to seven countries, and it does not apply to Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Nigeria--the five largest Muslim populations in the world. I have heard lots of claims on TV about 134 million Muslims who could be affected. Of course that leaves 1.6 billion Muslims who are not affected.  This is not a Muslim ban; this is a temporary pause of movement from seven countries, which President Trump did not pick from thin air. He picked from acts of this Congress and the Obama Department of Homeland Security--five countries in a state of near anarchy; a sixth country, Iraq, which has had a large part of its territory overrun by the Islamic State; and a seventh, Iran, which is the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. Moreover, it is not a ban; it is simply a temporary pause for 3 to 4 months to evaluate whether Obama administration policies are strong enough to keep this country safe.  We also heard claims that this is somehow unconstitutional. However, there is no free-floating global right of people around the world to come to this country. President Trump's order is nothing more than a temporary pause on migration from countries with very weak state institutions or which sponsor terrorism, while the President and the administration take a more thorough review of our vetting procedures and the refugee program as a whole.  Secretary Kelly has stated that it does not apply to green card holders. Secretary Mattis is reportedly advising that the long-term policy accommodate Iraqis with a documented history[[Page S469]]of serving with our troops, which I obviously support.  In fact, a temporary pause for security evaluations is so sensible that in November 2015, after the Paris terrorist attacks, even the minority leader suggested that ``a pause may be necessary.'' It wasn't beyond the pale then, and it is not now. Moreover, the people who are enforcing our laws on the frontlines agree with President The union for Border Patrol and Customs Enforcement agents has stated that they support this order and two other related immigration orders.  Yet here is the minority shedding crocodile tears over President Trump's immigration refugee policy, but where were those tears for the last 8 years when President Obama's foreign policy created all of these refugees? Where were the tears when President Obama overthrew the Government of Libya with nothing to follow? Where were the tears when President Obama withdrew from Iraq, leaving that country to fend off Iran and the Islamic State? Where were the tears when President Obama gave Iran $100 billion to continue its imperial campaign throughout the Middle East, to include overthrowing the Government of Yemen through its proxies? And most notoriously, where were the tears when President Obama stood idly by and watched Syria go up in flames? Spare me the tears now.  If the minority is worried about the President's counsel and wants to make a difference in the real world, I suggest we get to work and we confirm Rex Tillerson to be the Secretary of State and Jeff Sessions to be the Attorney In the meantime, I object.

1703,topic-id,559,"Mr.President, I want to express my support for Rex Tillerson to be our next Secretary of Mr.Tillerson is one of the most distinguished businessmen in the world. His reputation precedes him. I don't have to recount for all of you his remarkable career--rising from an entry-level production engineer to CEO of ExxonMobil, the largest oil company in the world. Mr.Tillerson's story should be an inspiration to kids across this country: Through hard work, discipline, and striving, you can achieve your dreams, even if you weren't born into wealth, power, or privilege. Like the Boy Scouts he has mentored, like the Eagle Scout he was, Mr.Tillerson inspires by his example.  No one can doubt Mr.Tillerson has acquired a wide range of skills throughout his notable life, as well as a gold-plated reputation. I think it goes without saying that a man of such varied experiences will bring a well-informed and shrewd perspective to the post. In fact, I would suggest that it is the very perspective which recommends him most for the job.  I met with him in December, and we had a wide-ranging conversation about Russia, the Middle East, human rights, and the many other geopolitical challenges and opportunities facing our country. I was impressed by the breadth of his knowledge, his familiarity with so many world leaders, and his understanding of their peoples. The one thing that really stood out to me was his clear-eyed, hard-nosed prudence. It is little wonder that Mr.Tillerson comes highly recommended by Dick Cheney and Bob Gates, seasoned statesmen with no illusions about the world and no doubts about America's role in it. I am confident that as Secretary of State, he will protect the interests of the American people just as he protected the interests of ExxonMobil's shareholders as their  I have heard some Senators wonder whether a businessman can really walk away from a company and its financial interests--as if it were the money that made the man, instead of the man who made the money. Their concern reminds me of similar questions raised about one of the best Secretaries of State in the modern era, George When President Reagan nominated him, Secretary Shultz was president and director of the Bechtel Group, a large construction concern with business across the Arab world. People asked whether Secretary Shultz would therefore tilt U.policy toward those countries. I think anyone looking back today on his record would marvel at those fears.  In 2015, the World Jewish Congress awarded Secretary Shultz its prestigious Theodor Herzl Award on behalf of his work with America's good friend Yes, Secretary Shultz went on to lead a very successful tenure, working with different countries all over the world and always putting America's interests front and center.  If anything, Rex Tillerson's business experience will only enhance his ability to provide the President his sound, unbiased judgment. If you need any more evidence, just look at the way Mr.Tillerson has conducted himself throughout the confirmation process. He has answered every question and addressed every concern. He has been calm and steady under pressure. These are precisely the qualities we need in our next Secretary of  Today, I offer my strong support for an outstanding businessman and an American patriot, our next Secretary of State, Rex I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for the nomination.

229,topic-id,707,"Mr.Speaker, there is no better sign of a healthy economy than a healthy real estate market. We know this in this country from bitter experience since the real estate and financial collapse of 2008.  In my State in Connecticut, we are barely at a place now where home sales and home equity has even come in a positive direction and climbing back towards what existed back in 2008 when the collapse occurred.  Listening to the President's speech on Friday where he very powerfully talked about the forgotten American, middle class individuals and working people who really felt that they were left behind in terms of the work that happens in this city, he clearly touched a nerve that propelled him to the White As I said, it was probably the most powerful part of his message that he delivered on  I mention that because it was astonishing that within an hour after taking the oath, President Trump signed an executive order rolling back a rate reduction for mortgage insurance for homeowners. What that means is that for many homeowners--particularly first-time home buyers--they need to have mortgage insurance in order to qualify for a mortgage. That ensures that if there is a default, that the mortgage will be paid off. It de-risks the loan so that, again, particularly people who are first-time home buyers can actually buy a house. The Federal Housing Administration, FHA, runs this mortgage insurance program.  Again, there was a rate reduction that was slated to go into effect on January 27, from 0.85 percent down to 0.6 percent. President Trump canceled that reduction.  So what does that mean?  The National Association of Realtors, which is hardly a partisan group, has, in the wake of that order, released numbers that about 750,000 to 800,000 homeowners are going to be adversely affected by losing those savings that are just going to go to the government, by the way. Those mortgage premiums basically are paid into the government. And right now there is a surplus in that account, which is why the rate reduction was slated to go into effect. There is no reason for the government to be overcharging for mortgage insurance, given the healthy balance that exists in that mortgage insurance account.  They also calculate that 30,000 to 40,000 home buyers will not buy a home in 2017 because of that order that was issued on Again, these are people who--$500 to $1,000, which is going to come out of their pocket in terms of higher payments because of this executive order--are basically going to be priced out of buying a home. The home builders, the realtors, the people who are closest to the market and clearly are not partisan--I mean, I know a lot of these guys in my district, and they are staunch Republicans in many cases--are dumbfounded at the fact that that order, of all things, within the first hours of the new administration, would be a priority for, again, the new Trump administration.  We have work to do in terms of getting this economy turned around, but if you look at home ownership, home construction, buying a house, having a healthy real estate market, that is absolutely the sweet spot of trying to succeed in this country. We do not need to be overcharging Americans for mortgage insurance, which, again, is the gateway for home ownership, particularly at that lower end of the market. Because every time someone buys a house for $200,000 or $250,000 in Connecticut, which is towards the lower end, or even lower in other parts of the country, that frees up existing homeowners either to buy up or to retire or get a condo. When those people are locked out--which raising these mortgage insurance premiums are going to effectively do--we are just stifling the real estate market from recovering. That is a bad start in terms of an administration that says it is about growing America's economy.  I will pledge to my constituents that I am going to do everything I can to reverse that unwise order and help the folks who are out there doing the hard work of selling houses, building houses, hiring people, to accomplish their goal because when they succeed, America succeeds.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH564.txt,1836,MORTGAGE INSURANCE HURTS HOMEOWNERS,2017.0,23.0,January

Mr.Speaker, again, I rise in support of this measure. As Mr.Kinzinger indicated, this is the third try that we have pushed this bill on a bipartisan basis, and hopefully the third time will be the charm. It was introduced only 10 days ago, and the fact that, again, we are moving so quickly hopefully is going to send an encouraging signal that the Senate can really move forward and finish this very, I think, important and useful piece of legislation.  There are about 737,000 ham radio operators that have been licensed by the Federal Communications Commission across the country. As has been said, they provide a great backup for emergency services around the country. Again, in Connecticut, where we did get hit with Hurricanes Sandy and Irene in back-to-back years, the harm that was done to the wireless communications system as well as just the regular radio system really put the spotlight on the fact that ham radio operators were critical in terms of keeping police, fire, and small communities and State services in up-to-date, realtime communication regarding both weather conditions as well as public safety conditions. So the work that they perform is not just kind of a hobby; it really has great value to the country.  What I think this bill tries to address is that, in 1985, the FCC issued an order and ruling basically describing ham radio as critical to the Nation's information and communication infrastructure, and that reasonable accommodation should be made in terms of public entities like zoning boards and land use bodies. It did not extend, however, to private land use restrictions.  Since the 1980s, there probably hasn't been a deed signed in the country that hasn't had land use restrictions, and this bill really tries to, I think, adjust to that reality with the compromise language that has been put forward so that condominium associations and, again, neighborhood developments have to reasonably make sure that this network is going to be able to function.  The good news is that the technology has moved forward so well that the antenna intrusion really is not what it used to be, that the equipment that they have is quite remarkable to see how strong their signals are and the reception is with, again, just really almost tiny antenna technology.  So, again, this legislation I think really updates the FCC's promotion of ham radio. Communities that are going to end up depending on it because of natural disaster and other emergency situations I think will benefit strongly. So again, I congratulate all the members of the Energy and Commerce I thank Mr.Doyle again for generously yielding his time to me.

965,topic-id,401,"Mr.President, as a fifth-generation Montanan and product of Montana public schools from kindergarten through college, husband to an elementary school teacher, and father of four children, I understand how important a first rate education is to our kids' future. That is why I am reintroducing the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success, or A-PLUS, Act this This measure will help expand local control of our schools and return Federal education dollars where they belong: closer to the classrooms. By shifting control back to the States, individual and effective solutions can be created to address the multitude of unique challenges facing schools across the country. Through these ``laboratories of democracy,'' Americans can watch and learn how students can benefit when innovative reforms are implemented on the local level. This bill would give states greater flexibility in allocating federal education funding and ensuring academic achievement in their schools. With A-PLUS, States would be freed from Washington-knows-best performance metrics and failed testing requirements. Should this legislation be adopted, states would need to adhere to all civil rights laws and work towards advancing educational opportunities for disadvantaged children as well. States would be held accountable by parents and teachers because a bright light would shine directly on the decisions made by State capitals and local school districts. With freedom from Federal mandates comes more responsibility, transparency, and accountability on It would also reduce the administrative and compliance burdens on state and local education agencies, and ensure greater public transparency in student academic achievement and the use of federal education funds. Increasing educational opportunity in Montana and across the country isn't going happen through federal mandates or one-size-fits-none regulations. We need to empower our States, our local school boards, our teachers, and parents to work together to develop solutions that best fit our kids' unique needs. That is precisely what my A-PLUS Act does. Washington is the problem--and we have the solutions in Montana and in states across the country. The A-PLUS Act goes a long ways towards returning the responsibility for our kids' education closer to home and reduces the influence of the Federal Government over our classrooms. I want to thank Senators Cruz, Perdue, Johnson, Lee, and Rubio for helping reintroduce the A-PLUS Act this I ask my other Senate colleagues to join us in empowering our schools to serve their students, not DC bureaucrats, and support this important piece of legislation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS447.txt,2138,COUNTERTERRORISM ADVISORY BOARD ACT OF 2017,2017.0,24.0,January
967,topic-id,640,"Mr.President, small businesses are the backbone of They generate more than half of the country's private GDP and support millions of families. In Montana, small businesses are innovating, offering new products and services, and creating jobs.  The business community relies on the Internet to access the global marketplace. In rural states like Montana where it is costly to provide internet access, consumers and businesses depend on small businesses to provide connectivity. Without small broadband providers, many Montanans would not have the internet access that most of us take for granted.  Burdensome regulations like the FCC's net neutrality rules are strangling our small businesses and preventing growth and investment. The enhanced transparency requirements in particular require small businesses to disclose an excess amount of information including network packet loss, network performance by geographic area, network performance during peak usage, network practices concerning a particular group of users, triggers that activate network practices, and the list goes on. Small companies operate with a small team of employees and do not have a team of attorneys dedicated to regulatory compliance. Small businesses simply do not have the bandwidth to take on additional regulatory burdens.  That is why I am proud to introduce the Small Business Broadband Deployment Act of 2017 with my colleague Senator The bill provides a temporary small business exception to the net neutrality enhanced transparency requirements. There is broad support in the record for this exception, including support from the American Cable Association, Rural Wireless Association, Competitive Carriers Association, Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, CTIA--The Wireless Association, Rural Broadband Provider Coalition, WTA--Advocates for Rural  Providing relief from burdensome disclosure rules will allow small businesses to focus on deploying infrastructure and serving their customers rather than spending time on regulatory compliance.

All it takes is common sense to see that President Trump's ownership and his family's operation of hotels and golf courses and rental properties is ripe for corruption.  President Trump's failure to completely divest his ownership interest not only violates tradition followed by every other modern President, it is unconstitutional. The Constitution prohibits any U.official--including President Trump--from taking payments from foreign governments.  His ongoing involvement in The Trump Organization will let foreign governments funnel payments to his businesses. Foreign operatives will try to curry favor with the administration with no accountability to the American people.

But the GOP majority has chosen to ignore the calls for women to be able to control their own bodies and their own health care. This bill says to American women: your bodies, Washington's rules.  The majority uses talking points about getting Washington out of health care when they are fighting to kick 32 million people off their insurance, but when it comes to women's bodies, House Republicans are happy to step between a woman and her doctor.  As a man, I have never had to drive across State lines to find a doctor. I have never had my doctor silenced about a medical procedure. As a man, I have never had to endure an invasive and unnecessary procedure to satisfy someone else's twisted political desires. These experiences are all too common for women in America today.  While I and my male colleagues in Congress get to have an open and honest relationship with our doctors, this bill will deepen the ugly fight against women's control of their own bodies.

1542,topic-id,434,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of H.549, the Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility With more than 10 billion riders using surface transportation annually and limited security screening, it should not be surprising to us that terrorists have an interest in targeting mass transit. We saw it in London, Madrid, Brussels, and when a terrorist left a backpack of IEDs at a transit station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, last fall.  Given the repeated calls from ISIS and other radical Islamic terrorist groups for lone wolves and sympathizers to plan smaller attacks where larger crowds gather, we must ensure that the first responders and transit agencies have the tools they need to secure our transit systems.  That is why, last Congress, I introduced the Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility This bill addresses concerns raised during a field hearing the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held last year in Ranking Member Payne's district on preparedness for incidents impacting surface transportation. As chairman of that subcommittee, I introduced this legislation to ensure action follows our subcommittee's oversight, and that is why I reintroduced this commonsense legislation in the 115th  Witnesses at last year's field hearing testified about the importance of the transit security grant program, but found that the period of performance was a challenging timeframe to meet, especially for completing vital, large-scale capital security projects. These projects are vital to transit agencies to help enhance their security features systemwide and harden infrastructure.  H.549 addresses this challenge by codifying the period of performance for transit security grant program awards at 36 months for the majority of eligible projects and extending the period of performance for large-scale capital security projects to 55 months.  Additionally, transit security grant program awards can be used to provide personnel with effective security training. Unfortunately, recipients of these awards are not currently permitted to use transit security grant program funds to pay for backfilling personnel attending such training. In some cases, that extra cost at the transit agency has resulted in an inability to send staff for vital security training. My bill will permit transit security grant program funds to be used for this purpose, consistent with other Homeland Security grant programs.  The current threat environment is evolving and complex, which makes it even more imperative that the transit security grant program provide flexible solutions for grant recipients. I am proud to sponsor this bipartisan legislation, which passed the House by voice vote last year.  I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.549.  I reserve the balance of my time.

1548,topic-id,353,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in support of H.687. This legislation would establish a review process for grant applicants seeking to purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed national voluntary consensus standards.  With threats consistently evolving, it is reassuring to see new technology emerge which will promote the safety of our communities and first responders. However, emerging technology is frequently developed faster than voluntary consensus standards can be implemented.  Recipients of grants under FEMA's State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative must procure equipment that meets these standards. Unfortunately, if emerging technology or equipment does not have a voluntary consensus standard and a grant recipient would like to use those funds to purchase such technology, FEMA does not have a uniform process to consider applications for that equipment.  H.687 requires FEMA to develop such a process for reviewing these requests. Previously, this bill was introduced in the 114th Congress by the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr.Payne, and subsequently received bipartisan support by my subcommittee and the Committee on Homeland Security as well as the House when it was passed under suspension of the rules in September of 2016.  I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Payne) for reintroducing this commonsense bill. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.687 because it will ensure our first responders have the ability to purchase equipment and emerging technology needed to effectively adapt to the current threat landscape.

1555,topic-id,475,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.584, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2017.  Cybersecurity is a major national security issue and the threat is real and immediate. Day in and day out nation-states or criminal actors target the United States' critical infrastructure, the private sector, and everyday Americans, and they are succeeding. However, even with the heightened awareness on cybersecurity, it appears that the United States is not adequately prepared to prevent and respond to cyber attacks.  Since 2012, FEMA has released an annual National Preparedness Report, which highlights States' progress in meeting 32 core capabilities, as defined by the National Preparedness Every year, States have ranked their cybersecurity capabilities as one of their lowest.  I found these facts very alarming and wanted to learn more about the current state of cyber preparedness. That is why, last Congress, my subcommittee, the Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee, held a joint hearing with the committee's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee to look at cyber preparedness and how the Federal Government can help States address some of the challenges they face.  We heard from a Homeland Security adviser, a fusion center representative, the Center for Internet Security, a chief information officer, and a chief technology officer, who explained the great progress the United States has made in enhancing their security capabilities. However, they cautioned that challenges still remain, especially with regard to information sharing of cyber threats and risks, and whether Homeland Security grants may be used for cybersecurity enhancements.  Last Congress, I introduced this bill to address the findings from that hearing. I introduced this bill in this Congress to ensure that States and first responders have the resources needed to prepare for and protect against cyber attacks.  This commonsense legislation will: Enhance cyber risk information sharing with State and major urban area fusion centers; authorize representatives from State and urban area fusion centers to be assigned to the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center; and permit the NCCIC personnel to be deployed to the fusion centers.  It will allow information sharing on cyber preparedness best practices with State and local stakeholders.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.690, the Gains in Global Nuclear Detection Architecture Act of 2016, sponsored by Representative H.690 directs the Department of Homeland Security's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to develop and maintain documentation that provides information on how the office's research investments align with gaps in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture and the research challenges identified by the Domestic Nuclear Detection  It further directs the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to document the rationale for selecting research topics and to develop a systematic approach for evaluating how the outcomes of the office's individual research projects collectively contribute to addressing the research challenges.  ISIS has declared its intention to develop weapons of mass destruction, which include nuclear devices, as well as radiological dispersal devices. The key to preventing this from happening is to make sure that nuclear material never falls into terrorist hands.  According to data compiled by the International Atomic Energy Agency, there were nearly 1,150 incidents involving theft, criminal possession, or loss of radiological material reported between 1993 and 2014. The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California identified 325 instances alone between 2013 and 2014 in 38 different countries where nuclear or radioactive material was stolen, lost, or outside of regulatory control.  The amount of nuclear material in peaceful uses in the world has risen by 70 percent since 1999. It will continue to grow in the coming decades as global use of nuclear power increases.  Just last summer, six men were convicted in Tbilisi, Georgia, for trying to sell uranium-238; and in January of 2016, three members of a criminal group were detained for trying to sell caesium-137, which could be used to make a dirty bomb.  We must ensure that terrorists never get their hands on radioactive materials. This bill will enhance the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office's ability to provide radiation detection devices specifically aimed at preventing terrorists from being able to obtain enough radioactive material to construct a dirty bomb.  This bill will ensure that the research topics it chooses to invest in to enhance our ability to detect smuggled nuclear materials are aligned with the gaps that have been identified in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture, a multiagency framework for detecting, analyzing, and reporting on nuclear and other radioactive materials that are out of regulatory control.  Requiring the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to document their rationale for choosing research topics will ensure that the most important gaps in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture are addressed.                              {time}  1615  I would like to thank Mr.Richmond for the work that he and his staff have done on this legislation.

Mr.Speaker, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise in support of H.655, the Securing the Cities Act of 2017.  Representing New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and Brooklyn, and as a former district attorney, I fully understand the importance of protecting our major cities from catastrophic terrorist attacks. In keeping our pledge to never forget 9/11, it is our duty to ensure that such an attack never happens again. This legislation underscores our commitment and gives the Department of Homeland Security the tools it needs to carry out this mission.  In 2015, the Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing at Ground Zero in lower At that hearing, we heard from Commissioner Bratton of the New York City Police Department who described the current threat environment facing New York In his testimony, he specifically referenced the risk that terrorists may introduce illicit nuclear materials into the city to conduct an attack. Similarly, Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly recently stated: The United States must prepare for the eventuality of a catastrophic attack given the potential impact and consequences.  This bill establishes the Securing the Cities program at the Department of Homeland Security to enhance the ability of the United States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high-consequence events using nuclear and other radiological materials in high-risk urban areas.  The Securing the Cities program within the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office provides training, equipment, and other resources to State and local law enforcement in high-risk urban areas to prevent a terrorist group from carrying out an attack using a radiological or nuclear device.  The Securing the Cities program began in 2006 as a pilot program in the New York City region which included Jersey City and Since 2007, the New York City region has purchased nearly 14,000 radiation detectors and trained nearly 20,000 personnel. The pilot program has been so successful it was expanded to the Los Angeles/Long Beach region in fiscal year 2012, the National Capital Region in fiscal year 2014, and to the cities of Houston and Chicago in 2016.

Mr.Speaker, the threat of a terrorist attack using a chemical or biological agent is real. We must ensure our first responders have the tools and capabilities they need should such an event occur.  In my district, the City of New York has put their Homeland Security grants to good use for this purpose. In 2014, they held a full-scale exercise which simulated an anthrax attack on the city. Participants from agencies across the city, including the health department, the New York City Police Department, and the Office of Emergency Management worked to set up locations to quickly distribute lifesaving medical countermeasures to city residents across the five boroughs.  We must ensure that the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative funds continue to be available, despite any changes to yearly grant guidance, for exercises like the one conducted by New York City and other important medical preparedness activities.

None of those are good options, and there is a reason why there is a backlash against this repeal effort across the country now, even among many Republicans as they consider the chaos that would be created by simply repealing it.  I don't know the merits of the proposal they brought before us. I can tell you, having been through the debate on the Affordable Care Act, which went on for years, that there are many complex questions that need to be addressed to satisfy all of us that we are doing the best we can do to give affordable, quality health care to more and more people across the United  The Congressional Budget Office just put out its report on what would happen if we just repealed, and it is a disaster. The number of people who are uninsured would increase by 18 million in the first new year following enactment of a repeal bill.  Later, after the elimination of the ACA's expansion of Medicaid eligibility and subsidies for insurance purchased through the ACA, that number will increase to 27 million more uninsured and then to 32 million in 2026.  Premiums in the nongroup market--and those are folks who don't work for companies that provide health insurance--premiums in the nongroup market, with just repeal, would increase by 20 to 25 percent in the first year and then reach 50 percent in the year following the elimination of the Medicaid expansion and would double by 2026. So fewer people would have insurance, and those who do would pay dramatically more.  So we shouldn't take this as just a matter of being able to have a bragging right about repeal. If we are serious about legislating, we should be looking at the options to find out how to make the Affordable Care Act better or how to approach it in a different manner.  I commend my colleagues on the Republican side. Here is what it comes down to: If a handful of Republican Senators will say to the leadership: We are not going to vote to repeal until we have a replacement, then we can have a constructive conversation. But this notion of repealing the Affordable Care Act and then getting around to replacing it at some later time is irresponsible, will create chaos, and really says[[Page S328]]to the American people: We are no longer committed to making sure your family has the peace of mind of good health insurance. So I thank them for the efforts they have put into this, and I look forward to working with them.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS326.txt,326,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

50,topic-id,1244,"Mr.President, yesterday I went to the White It was a great celebration of the World Series champion Chicago Cubs being recognized in the White House by our President from Illinois, Barack Of course, he is a White Sox fan, and he didn't apologize or change his stripes, but it was a great day of celebration. During the course of it, he said it was his last public event in the White House, and I came to realize that we are only days away from a new President and President Obama leaving.  I think back to a memorable moment in my life which most people wouldn't have remembered, but I will never forget. It was July 27, 2004. The place was Boston, At the last minute, I was called on to introduce a friend of mine, a skinny lawyer and State senator from Illinois who was about to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National His name was Barack I had known him for several years. I knew he was an extraordinarily gifted politician, and I knew he was a very good person.  I had seen him inspire many audiences back home, including some in the most unlikely places. I once saw him hold spellbound a group of blue-collar workers and farmers in Carroll, IL--a town which in the 1960s was completely devastated by racial tension and the presence of a local branch of the Ku Klux Klan--but even I was not prepared for the powerfully moving speech Barack Obama gave after I introduced him in It has been quoted in the He told us:       There is not a liberal America and a conservative America--     there is the United States of There is not a Black      America and a White America and Latino America and Asian      America--there's the United States of  He went on to say:       The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red      States and blue States; red States for Republicans, blue      States for But I've got news for them, too. We      worship an awesome God in the blue States, and we don't like      Federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red      We coach Little League in the blue States, and, yes,      we've got some gay friends in the red There are      patriots who opposed the war in Iraq, and there are patriots      who supported the war in  He only spoke for 17 minutes at that Boston convention--17 minutes--and in that time, he gave voice to what another tall, lanky lawyer from Illinois once called ``the better angels of our nature.'' He touched a longing deep within the hearts of millions of Americans who wanted to believe in those better angels, who wanted to believe in what Barack Obama called ``the audacity of hope,'' the audacity to believe that America, which had achieved so many miracles, was capable of even greater goodness. People inside the convention hall and millions outside who heard that speech all had the same reaction: I have seen America's future.  I remember going back to Illinois a few days after that convention and campaigning with Barack as he was running for the U.He went to the most unlikely downstate towns--Calumet, IL; Freeport, Huge crowds were coming in from adjoining States because they had seen him give that speech at the Democratic I knew there was something special about him.  His grandmother called him after he gave the speech. She gave him some advice. ``You did well,'' she said. ``I just kind of worry about you. I hope you keep your head on straight.'' Good advice for all of us.  A little over 4 years later, my friend--then the U.Senator from Illinois--was elected the 44th On inauguration day 2009, 2 million Americans stood shoulder to shoulder outside on the Mall near the Capitol dome and cheered as the son of a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas placed his hand on the family Bible of Abraham Lincoln and swore to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United  For the last 8 years, President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, their daughters Malia and Sasha, and First Grandmother Marian Robinson have made their home in the White What an irony--they were living in a house originally built by slaves.  The audacity of hope. The awe-inspiring strength of America to continually seek and stretch to be that ``more perfect Union.''  Part of the miracle of America is also the peaceful transition of power from one President to the next. As we prepare for the transition to a new President, we would do well to look back on the historic Presidency of Barack He was elected and reelected President both times convincingly.  His grandmother would be proud that he has not only kept his head on straight, he has held his head high, kept his priorities straight even amidst often unprecedented, unyielding opposition and searingly personal attacks. As First Lady Michelle Obama told us, the motto for the entire Obama family has been ``When they go low, we go high.'' We have seen that grace in them time and time again.  President Obama is a profoundly good and decent man who has served America with dignity and integrity. He has been thoughtful, calm, and resolute--never rash or impulsive. He is a disciplined leader who has grappled honestly with complex challenges facing America and the world, and he has delivered solutions that improved lives.  In his farewell speech in Chicago, President Obama quoted the fictional hero Atticus Finch, reminding us: ``You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.'' Putting himself in another person's shoes, seeing life through another person's eyes, and finding shared hopes is a lifelong habit and a special gift of this  He has tried his level best to heal and unite our divided His accomplishments are significant, and history will record many of them as profound.  He was first elected at a time when America badly needed hope. President Obama inherited--inherited--the greatest financial and economic crisis since the Great The country had lost more than 2 million jobs in the previous 4 months before he was sworn in. By inauguration day, the country's top four banks had lost half their value in less than a year. There was an urgent danger that not only the American economy would collapse, but the economy of the Western world was teetering in the balance.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, called the stimulus bill, saved the U.and global economy from a major crash and helped create the conditions for recovery. Unemployment today is at 4.9 percent. America has just seen the longest streak of private job creation in the Nation's history. To borrow a phrase, thanks,  Our friends across the aisle said: Let America's auto industry die. The Obama administration said: No way. They decided to place their bets on American manufacturing and workers instead. The Center for Automotive Research estimates that the special bankruptcy process for General Motors and Chrysler saved at least 1.5 million American jobs. Detroit has posted record profits for 7 years in a row. Barack Obama would not give up on American autoworkers or American auto companies, and it paid off.  Predatory lending and other systemic abuses were the cancer at the heart of the great financial meltdown of 2008 and 2009.  The PRESIDING The Senator's time has expired.

52,topic-id,1897,"Thank you, Mr. Under this President, Congress passed the most comprehensive overhaul of financial regulations since the Great Depression, protecting consumers and taxpayers.  President Obama inherited a Federal budget hemorrhaging red ink. Under his watch, the budget deficit has fallen $1 trillion, despite record investments in education, green energy, broadband, high-speed rail, medical research, and other high-return priorities.[[Page S329]]  He brought us the Affordable Care I am not going to dwell on it because I spoke on it before when the other Senators were on the floor.  There was a skit on ``Saturday Night Live'' last week that talked about, would the Republicans be happy if we banned the word ``ObamaCare''? Can we stick with the Affordable Care Act since it is helping so many people? Sometimes we think that is what this is all about: We have to get rid of it because it has his name on it. Well, we shouldn't. We should reflect on the good that it has done and make sure we do nothing less in the future. Health insurance costs are going down at the fastest rate in 50 years. Medicare gets an additional projected 10 years of solvency because of the Affordable Care Numerous Republican Governors, including Vice President-Elect Mike Pence, have used Medicaid expansion of ObamaCare to reduce the uninsured in their  On the issue of climate, I will defer to my friend from Rhode Island, who has stepped off of the floor for a moment, but when it comes to this, President Obama has taken climate change seriously. He does not view it as an unproven theory or a Chinese-authored hoax; he believes it is a fact, and so do It is a threat to the existence of humanity, and we are running out of time to prevent a climate catastrophe.  Americans built on the historic breakthrough at the 2015 U.summit on climate change in When that summit ended, 195 countries joined the United States and agreed to lower greenhouse gas emissions.  The President once told a group of young people: ``I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that is beyond fixing.''  We have a safer and more secure This President brought troops home--massive numbers of troops--who were dispatched around the world in harm's way. He understands we can't fix all the world's problems. We learned that the hard way. He banned the use of torture. We have seen the withdrawal of the majority of U.troops from Iraq and Al Qaeda has been decimated, Osama bin Laden is history, and ISIS is on the run.  Under President Obama, Americans led the successful global effort to conquer an Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and he helped preserve a democratic Ukraine, despite the aggression of Vladimir Putin of He has restored relations with Cuba after 50 years of a failed policy. The President and John Kerry had enormous diplomatic success with the Iran agreement to protect our friend and ally Israel and many other states in the Middle  I want to close by saying that his efforts in two areas are personal to me. Criminal justice reform, this President is determined to make sure our sentencing laws are just. There are things going on now that are just indefensible. We have been jailing people and imprisoning them for drug crimes for decades--unacceptable. The President is determined to get this done. We did part of it. I hope we can do more.  Finally, let me just say that this President, more than any, has really shown a caring for the DREAMers, a bill I introduced 16 years ago, so that those who came to the United States as children, through no fault of their own undocumented, would get a chance. That was it. He put together DACA, an Executive order which gave them that chance.  We have to work now to protect these bright, young people. I am so encouraged that Speaker Paul Ryan, at the CNN town meeting last week, acknowledged this and said he was willing to work to make sure we protected them. Barack Obama was the one who gave them this opportunity, and now it is up to us to follow through and give them a fair shake in life.  Mr.President, to reiterate, the affordable Care and Patient Protection Act that our colleagues across the aisle are now rushing headlong to repeal--without anything to replace it--represents the greatest advance in economic fairness and security for most Americans since at least the creation of Medicare 50 years ago.  ObamaCare has made the health coverage of all insured Americans more secure and more valuable by: outlawing discrimination based on pre-existing conditions; eliminating costs for checkups, mammograms and many other preventive measures; and allowing young people to stay on their parent's policies until age 26--among other new protections.  It has reduced the ranks of uninsured Americans by 20 million, and it has saved money. That's not a matter of opinion, it's a fact.  According to an analysis by the respected, nonpartisan Brookings Institution, health insurance exchange premiums are 44 percent lower today than they would have been without  Health insurance costs are going down at the fastest rate in 50 years.  Numerous Republican Governors--including Vice President-Elect Mike Pence--have used the Medicaid expansion in ObamaCare to reduce the uninsured in their That's a good thing.  But now President-Elect Trump and our Republican colleagues tell us that they want to repeal ObamaCare, cancel those patient protections, go back to the days when insurance companies write all the rules, and leave 20 million Americans without insurance.  They say they will come up ``fairly easily'' with something better than  I say to my friends: If it were easy, it would have happened already. Work with us to fix the things that can be improved, not kill it. Lives are at stake.  President Obama understands that climate change is not an unproven theory or a Chinese-authored hoax, it is a fact. It is a threat to the very existence of humanity and we are running out of time to prevent a climate catastrophe.  Under Barack Obama, America went from being the chronic spoiler to being a world leader in global climate change negotiations.  We reached a sweeping bilateral climate pact with China to cut greenhouse gas emissions--something critics said could never happen.  American built on that historic breakthrough at the 2015 U.summit on climate change in When the summit ended, 195 countries had agreed to lower greenhouse-gas emissions.  The President once told a group of young people: ``I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that's beyond fixing.''  He has done his part to keep that commitment. We should build on his progress, not reverse it.  The cornerstone of President Obama's foreign policy is a recognition that America remains the world's one indispensable nation and that we, and the world, are safer when America chooses engagement over either isolation or unilateralism.  He also understands that America cannot fix all of the world's problems. We have to choose wisely, based on our ideals, our priorities and our limits.  He banned the use of torture. He has seen the withdrawal of the majority of U.troops from Iraq and Al Qaeda has been decimated, ISIS is on the run, and Osama Bin Laden is dead.  Under President Obama, America led the successful global effort to contain and conquer an Ebola epidemic in West  And we helped preserve a democratic Ukraine against Russian aggression.  President Obama announced plans to restore normal relations with Cuba--reversing 50 years of a failed policy that done at least as much harm to America's relations with our neighbors in this hemisphere as it had done to depose the Castro regime.  The President and Secretary of State John Kerry made a momentous diplomatic success in negotiating an agreement to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons, protecting our ally Israel and many nations across the  The Iran nuclear deal holds the promise of defusing a ticking time bomb. If Iran fails to live up to that promise, we will know quickly and we will take the steps to stop them.  I want to touch briefly on two other issues that I have worked on very closely and to which I am deeply committed.  The first is the growing, bipartisan movement to end America's era of overincarceration.  America has 5 percent of the world's population--and nearly 25 percent of the world's prisoners. That ignominious fact is largely the result of inflexible antidrug laws that disproportionately punish people of color, especially poor people of color.[[Page S330]]  In 2010, President Obama signed a law that I introduced with Senator Sessions called the Fair Sentencing It replaced a Federal law that demanded dramatically harsher sentences for convictions involving crack cocaine than powder cocaine.  I have worked with Democrats and some brave Republican colleagues for a few years to further reform Federal sentencing--to allow Federal judges some discretion in nonviolent drug cases, and eliminate ``three strikes and you're out law'' and other overly harsh and inflexible laws that are overly harsh and hugely expensive to enforce.  In the absence of action from us, President Obama has used his powers to commute the sentences of more than 1,000 people--more than 50 times the number of people whose sentences were commuted by President George Bush and more than the past 11 Presidents combined.  We can't have it both ways. If we don't want President's to use their lawful Executive authority to correct injustices, we need to correct those injustices ourselves. I hope we will do so in this new  Finally, we must--we must--fix America's broken immigration system.  And let's start by assuring DREAMers--those young people who were brought to this country as children and who are undocumented through no fault of their own--that we will not deport them from the only nation they have ever called home.  I have come to this floor dozens of times to tell you their stories. They are scholars, American soldiers, researchers, doctors, engineers, lawyers, clergy members.  DACA--the President's Executive order--allows them to stay in this country temporarily while Congress works to pass a comprehensive immigration reform plan that meets the needs of our economy, and honors our values and our unique and powerful heritage as a nation of immigrants.  More than 750,000 DREAMers put their trust in our Government and came forward to register under  What will happen to them if--as many fear--DACA is not extended?  Immigrants are not a threat to Immigrants are The sooner we acknowledge that fact and align our laws with it, the better we will be.  Mr.President, I could go on for quite some time about what President Obama, Vice President Biden, and their administration have meant for America, but time precludes that so I will close with these last thoughts.  In that historic speech he delivered in Boston 12 years ago, President Obama told us that, in his father's native tongue, the name ``Barack'' means ``blessing.''  President Obama leaves office now as the most popular politician in America, and assured of his place in history. I believe that America has been fortunate--even blessed--by his service and sacrifice as our  President Obama has also warned us that ``History travels not only forwards; history can travel backwards, history can travel sideways.'' I hope that we can all pledge, regardless of party, to keep history moving forward.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Lankford).

He has been living and farming there his entire life. And after 14 years in the Illinois Senate, John retired and returned to the family business.  John Sullivan grew up on his family farm in Macomb, Nauvoo, and He spent his summers taking care of livestock and baling hay. In 1981, John graduated from Quincy College--known today as Quincy University--with a degree in history. After college, he went to auction school and obtained his real estate license. He sold insurance before taking a job in Rushville with Production Credit  He didn't know anyone in Rushville--a town of just over 3,000 people--but he joined the local parish and quickly made friends. As fate would have it, Joan Merna moved to town and joined the same parish. Their friends decided to introduce them, and the rest is history. Today, John and Joan have been married for more than 33 years. And if you talk to their friends, they will tell you their marriage was one of the best things that happened to They are a great team and have a wonderful family  In 1986, John joined the family real estate and auction business, which his children and siblings still run today. Nearly 20 years later, he sat down with Joan at the kitchen table and decided to run for office. It was something he always wanted to do--and 2002 was as good a time as any. Before John, no one thought a Democrat could be elected Senator in western For years, good candidates tried and failed. But John won office the old-fashioned way--by knocking on doors, walking in parades, and listening to people. He also had a secret weapon--six brothers and four sisters. Republicans said it was like running against the Walton family. And a couple of his brothers look just like The resemblance was so great that, during that first campaign, people sometimes thought John was everywhere all at once. They didn't realize that sometimes they were seeing one of the Sullivan brothers.  John learned fast and rose in just a few years from a political novice to a leader of the Democratic Party in the Illinois If you want to see John's legacy, you can look at the extensions of Route 336 and Route 67--main arteries that created hundreds of new jobs--and will continue to bring new jobs to the region long after we are gone. He has secured more than $820 million for Western Illinois University in Macomb--and over $16 million to keep the Quincy Veterans Home Guest House open.  But the greatest part of John's legacy is the civility, reason, and dignity he has brought to his work--qualities that are needed in public service today. John understands that getting things done involves finding middle ground and getting along with people. Progress is a long march. It demands patience and perseverance. And sometimes, it requires the wisdom and humility to compromise, a lesson John learned from his parents, growing up as one of 11 children. When fights broke out, his parents didn't get involved, they simply said: ``Figure it out and just get along.'' And they did. John took the same approach to governance and built his reputation as someone who is always willing to listen to the other side to see if there is a way to move forward[[Page S340]]together. He knows that principled compromise isn't capitulation, but how democracy is supposed to work. He will be sorely missed in the Illinois  Despite his many achievements, his proudest accomplishment is his family. John and Joan still live on their family farm in Rushville where they raised four children.

On the wall in John's Senate office was a photograph of his dad, along with the advice he gave him. He told John: ``Don't forget the little guy.'' Throughout his career, he has never forgotten the little guys--family farmers, small business owners, and hard-working people wondering how they will send their children to college or retire with dignity. John has stood with them and been their champion. Now, as he enters the next chapter in his life, I want to wish him and Joan many years of happiness and the best of luck with the family business and family farm.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS339.txt,326,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

141,topic-id,556,"Mr.President, I listened carefully to the statement by theRepublican leader on the floor, and I am hoping we can reach some agreement later today as to the nominations to be consideredthis day and very quickly next week. I will, for the record, make it clear that the seven nominees who moved through on thefirst day of the Obama administration were people who had their ethics statements filed on time, had filed all the legallyrequired papers on time for review.  Unfortunately, that is not the case for all of the nominees by the new Some of them bring to this nomination some extraordinarily challenging financial data, and because of theircompanies, because of their lifestyles, because of their wealth, it takes longer to go through these documents than it does forpeople of modest means. When we proposed, by the Obama administration, Penny Pritzker, of Chicago, to serve as Secretary ofCommerce, it took 6 months to clear the paperwork on her financial background. The more complex the financial data, the moredifficult and challenging it is for the committees of the Senate to do their work and to do it properly.  We want to makecertain we don't cut any corners. We don't want to create any advantage for any single nominee. They have to be held to the samestandard as the nominees under the Obama administration. I am hoping we can move on it with dispatch on some of these nominees,and I don't quarrel with the Republican leader's premise that there are some noncontroversial nominees who would be easier tohandle than others.  Let me quickly add, for those who have forgotten the record of the Republicans in the Senate when itcomes to delaying nominations, exhibit A will continue to be the vacancy on the U.Supreme For the first time in thehistory of the United States of America, the Republican majority in the U.Senate refused a hearing and a vote on a nominee tofill a vacancy on the U.Supreme That went on for the entire duration of the Obama Some 11 months, thatposition on the highest Court in the land remained vacant because of the specific political strategy of the Republican leader onthe other side.  He said: We will keep this open in the hopes that a Republican President will be able to fill it. He had agrin and a smile and, I guess, a feeling of accomplishment on election day when a Republican was elected That vacancycontinued for political reasons, regardless of the fact that it created at least a hardship and some confusion on the highestCourt of the land. It went on for 10, 11 months, and it continues to this day.  I might also remind him that the nominationof Loretta Lynch for the highest law enforcement position in America sat on that Senate calendar for months, with no objectionstated by any Member on the other side. They refused to call her name and allow a vote for the Attorney General of the UnitedStates of Similarly, an Assistant Secretary of the Department of Treasury, a key position to deal with terrorismfinancing, was held on that calendar, I believe, for a year or more with no controversy.

This nomination is not a referendum on President DonaldTrump's immigration policy. If it were, I would have voted against the nomination.  In considering this nomination, thequestions are whether General Kelly is unqualified to serve as Homeland Security Secretary and whether his views are too extremeto lead our homeland security and immigration enforcement efforts. In my view, General Kelly easily passes both tests.  Gen.John Kelly is clearly qualified to head up the Homeland Security He served honorably in the U.Marine Corps formore than four decades, first as an enlistee and later as an officer, culminating in his role as commander of U.As SOUTHCOM commander, Kelly oversaw a variety of operations in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America fromheadquarters in  General Kelly knows better than most what is at stake in our efforts to protect our Nation from harm.He served three tours in Iraq, and in 2010, his son, Marine 1st Robert Michael Kelly, 29, was killed in southern Afghanistanwhile leading his platoon on a combat patrol when he stepped on a concealed bomb. He is the highest ranking military officer tolose a child in combat in Afghanistan or  I am sure that I will disagree with General Kelly on some occasions, but hedoes not have a track record of extreme statements on immigration or the other issues that will be under his jurisdiction asHomeland Security  I know that some of my Democratic colleagues voted against General Kelly's nomination becausehe refused to publicly commit to keeping the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--DACA--program in place and to protecting DACArecipients from deportations. Reasonable people can disagree, and I respect my colleagues who are voting against General Kelly'snomination, but I don't believe this justifies opposing this nomination.  There is no one in the Senate who is more committedthan I to protecting the DACA program and no one who has worked harder to protect the young immigrants who are eligible for thisprogram. Seven years ago, I was the first Member of Congress to ask President Obama to establish the DACA program. DACA is basedon the DREAM Act, legislation I first introduced 16 years ago that would give undocumented students who grew up in this countrya chance to earn their citizenship.  The young people who are eligible for DACA and the DREAM Act are known as Overthe years, I have met hundreds of DREAMers and I have come to the floor more than 100 times to tell these DREAMers' stories,which make the case for DACA and the DREAM Act better than I ever could.

We spent most of our time discussing DACA and the General Kelly promised me that, if he was confirmed, hewould be a part of the discussions about the future of He said that he felt strongly that DREAMers should be protectedfrom deportation and that he would fight for that view. General Kelly also committed that he would come to Chicago with me tomeet with a group of DREAMers and to visit an immigration detention center, so that he would understand the human impact of thelaws he will be enforcing.  Based on these assurances, I am pleased to be able to support General Kelly's nomination. But letme be clear. If General Kelly supports an effort by the new administration to rescind DACA or deport DREAMers, I will fight himtooth and nail.

858,topic-id,2735,"Mr.President, I was listening carefully to the comments made by my colleague from West I thank her for coming to the floor and expressing her feelings about the Affordable Care It is truly an article of political faith on the Republican side that we must repeal We have heard that for 6 years, maybe longer, and each and every time, Democrats have asked: And then what?  We have asked Republicans: What would you replace ObamaCare with? Until some of the most recent moments, there was never an answer. Now they are starting to put at least some ideas forward, but repealing ObamaCare and then talking about the possibility of replacement is a disaster. It is an invitation to uncertainty and chaos. We might expect that from a Democratic Senator who voted for the Affordable Care Act, but what I ask my colleagues in the Senate to do is, please go home. Please go back to your Do as I did yesterday. I called together the administrators of hospitals in Central Illinois, smalltown rural hospitals and larger hospitals such as Memorial Medical Center in my hometown of I asked them, in a nonpressurized setting: What would you do? What is wrong with the Affordable Care Act? How would you change it? What would be the impact of repeal?  I knew, and they did as well, that there had been some reports from the Congressional Budget Just last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office told us exactly what repeal without replace would look like: 18 million Americans would lose health insurance in 12 months, 32 million within 10 years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, if they went through with the Republican repeal plan, premiums in the individual health insurance market would increase by 20 to 25 percent the first year and double within 10 years.  Despite this, on his first day in office, President Trump signed an Executive order that began to dismantle our health care system. We still haven't seen the President's secret replacement plan, even though he has repeatedly said he wants to replace the law at the same time he repeals it, and we are going to be so proud of what he does.  Let's talk about what repeal without replace means in Illinois, now that I have taken it home and asked the people who are actually running the hospitals. With repeal, 90,000 young people[[Page S413]]in Illinois would be thrown off their parents' health care plans. More than 7 million Illinoisans with health insurance through their employer would once again be subject to discriminatory health insurance practices, like discrimination based on preexisting conditions, annual and lifetime caps on coverage, and discrimination against women. In my State, the Republican repeal plan would have an impact statewide because insurance plans statewide could once again decide not to cover maternity or newborn care, mental health, or substance abuse. Those things are required under the Affordable Care That would be removed with this repeal.  In my State, more than 1 million people would lose their health insurance--in fact, 1.2 million, to be exact. According to the Illinois Hospital Association, my State would lose $11 billion to $13 billion in annual economic activity with Republican repeal, translating to a loss of up to 95,000 jobs. Let me talk about those jobs in towns like Taylorville and Pana, IL, near my hometown of Those are good-paying jobs. Sometimes they are the best paying jobs in the community. Those would be the jobs lost by the Republican repeal of  For years, we have been hitting back against misguided and misleading claims about the Affordable Care Who is hitting back now? And not just hospitals. Health care providers across the board are pleading with the Republicans: We know you have some campaign promise you want to keep, but keep first your promise to the people you represent to provide quality, affordable health care.  Senator Tammy Duckworth and I have sent letters to every single Illinois hospital--over 200 of them--asking about the impact of repealing the Affordable Care Act without enacting a replacement to prevent total chaos. Just yesterday morning, I met with these hospital administrators and heard firsthand. I met at Memorial Medical Center in Springfield, IL, representatives from Hopedale Medical Center, Pana Community Hospital, Carlinville Area Hospital, and Warner Hospital and Health  Memorial Health System is a nonprofit, community-owned health care organization. When I asked about the impact of repealing the Affordable Care Act, here is what they told me: ``Repeal without replacing the ACA would adversely impact patients' access to care and our hospitals' and health systems' ability to provide services as well as potentially result in job losses.'' They went on to say that Memorial Medical Center in Springfield, with Republican repeal of ObamaCare, could lose over $140 million over the next 6 years, and their uncompensated care costs would ``rise dramatically due to both a rise in charity care and decline in Medicaid coverage and reimbursement.''  They cautioned:       We would be forced to cut spending by reducing services,      reducing staff, and delaying investment in new technology and      facility improvements. . . . Losses of this magnitude with      repeal of the [Affordable Care Act] coverage simply cannot be      sustained and would adversely impact patients' access to care      and our hospitals' and health systems' ability to continue to      provide services.  This is not the only hospital telling me in our I am from downstate Illinois, proud to represent Chicago, but I have represented in the Congress and in the Senate smalltown rural America, communities where the hospital makes a difference. If you don't have a hospital nearby, you could be an hour's drive--if you are lucky--from quality medical care, not to mention the impact that hospital has on the local economy, keeping and attracting new businesses.  According to the Illinois Hospital Association, the 15th Congressional District of Illinois stands to lose $470 million under Republican repeal of the Affordable Care That means 3,400 jobs lost in that congressional district in Central Illinois with repeal of affordable care. We talk about good jobs and creating them in this The President goes and makes trips, as he should, to try to save American jobs. Yet the first congressional action by the Republican majority this year is to threaten 3,400 jobs in the 15th Congressional  Washington County Hospital in Nashville, IL, is a 22-bed critical access hospital 50 miles from They provide acute care, surgical service, and gynecological services. When I asked them what Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act would mean to Washington County Hospital in my downstate area, they said the following:       To eliminate [the ACA] would be detrimental to the      thousands of people in our county that were previously      uninsured either because of part-time work or serious health      problems.       I guarantee that [repealing the ACA] without a strategic      healthcare replacement plan, will result in more downsizing      and more staff reductions at Washington County Our      community cannot continue to lose these good paying jobs and      I believe our county residents will continue to move to      neighboring states with more favorable job markets, better      job security and stable benefits.  They ended their response with this warning:       I truly fear that many Illinois communities will lose their      Critical Access Hospitals--the only sources of healthcare in      many of our rural counties and a vital part of infrastructure      in our communities.       As you know, our rural areas have vulnerable populations of      elderly folks that have many chronic healthcare needs and      limited ability to travel long distances for emergency care.      . . . I sincerely hope that you heed the warnings of our      physicians and hospitals--do NOT repeal the ACA in a hurried      political rush.  Washington County is not a blue county, it is not a Democratic county. It is a county that votes regularly for the other party. It is a conservative-voting populous, representing a lot of farmers and small businesses, and this is their hospital administrator warning the Republicans here in the Senate and the House: Be careful what you do in eliminating the Affordable Care  According to the Illinois Hospital Association, the 16th Congressional District in Illinois stands to lose $453 million under Republican repeal of ObamaCare, and that means the loss of 3,300 jobs.  SwedishAmerican Hospital in Belvidere, IL, in the northern part of my State, provides health care to Belvidere, Boone, western McHenry, and northern DeKalb When asked how the hospital has fared since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the administrator of SwedishAmerican said the following:       The passage of ACA has afforded our health system with      significant benefit related to [compensation] of patients      with uncompensated care. . . . SwedishAmerican experienced an      average annual increase of $43 million in Medicaid payments,      and a $10 million reduction in uncompensated care.  When asked about the impact of the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act, SwedishAmerican Hospital of Belvidere, IL, said the following:       The impact would be significant . . . it would create an      unsustainable financial result and we would be forced to make      significant reductions in staff and curtail future plans for      capital expenditures.  Yesterday, at my roundtable in Springfield, I asked some of these hospital administrators: What is wrong with the Affordable Care Act? And they told me. Let me add quickly, I believe--as they do--there are things which need to be changed in that law. It is not perfect, by any means. They talked about the cost of care, and they should. In some areas, premiums have gone up too quickly, and the availability of insurance is not as it should be.  I have talked to the health insurance companies, including the big companies like Blue Cross Blue They have told me specifically that the method of enrollment now under the Affordable Care Act leaves loopholes for people to jump in and out of coverage as they need it. You cannot run a viable insurance risk pool if people are only forced to sign up when they are facing a health care crisis. You have to have healthy people paying premiums to cover those who get sick and need to be compensated.  So there are things certainly within the Affordable Care Act which need to be changed, and these administrators told us.  So I said: I hear commonly from my Republican friends, if we would just allow people to buy health insurance over State lines, there would be more competition.  They laughed. They said: You mean to say, if you heard that there was a health insurance plan in Alabama and you lived in Illinois, that you would buy health insurance there; is that the idea?[[Page S414]]  I said: I suppose. I hear it over and over again, if we could just buy policies across State lines.  They laughed. They said: Do you know what is going to happen? Do you know what happens when you buy insurance in Illinois and they tell you the hospitals and doctors who are eligible? You certainly want to have doctors in your home area eligible who may not be eligible under an Alabama plan. That makes sense.  Secondly, they said: If people outside the State who are truly sick start buying into Alabama to get lower premiums, the premiums are going to go up. They are going to engineer the risk pool to make sure that it is viable.  That is a notion that they rejected out of hand. I asked them about health savings accounts. That is another thing you hear over and over again. If people could just set aside nontaxable income and leave that in a pool of money to pay their copayments and other expenses, then there would be a disincentive to overutilize health care. These administrators said: But people who are living paycheck to paycheck don't have money to set aside--even non-taxable money to set aside at that point--and, ultimately, many of them would put off care they desperately need until they become even sicker.  Each one of these approaches has its critics. There are people who think we ought to look at it more carefully. I think that ought to be the bottom line. To my Republican majority, look at this carefully. It is not a matter of keeping a campaign promise; it is a matter of keeping a promise to the people you represent not to leave our health care system in chaos.  I hope President Trump and my congressional Republican colleagues are listening to what my constituents back home told me yesterday, things that they will hear themselves if they will go back home and listen to people who run the hospitals in the communities where the voters they represent live.  I wish to conclude with a quote on the subject from William Gorski, president and CEO of SwedishAmerican, who wrote to me. He said:       I must also speak forcefully as a former practicing      physician. Irrespective of any financial impact of repeal,      real lives are at stake here. President Obama's vision      recognized a great understanding of the importance of health      care access to the quality and outcomes of care. Any      diminishment of this access threatens the health and well-     being of millions of our fellow citizens. . . . My strong      view is that rather than repealing the ACA, we should be      looking for ways to refine and expand it.  That comes from a doctor. I solicited his view. I don't know him personally, but it represents the feelings of many.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the State Journal-Register article from Springfield, IL, on my meeting yesterday.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the State Journal-Register, 23, 2017]        Durbin Hears Hospitals' Concerns About Obamacare Repeal                            (By Dean Olsen)       Executives fromfrom Springfield-area hospitals and health      systems told U.Dick Durbin Monday morning that a      threatened repeal of the Affordable Care Act by Congress      would jeopardize local patients' access to medical services      and harm their organizations' finances.       ``We'd just hate to see this go away,'' Memorial Health      System chief executive officer Edgar Curtis said of the law,      also known as Obamacare, during a meeting at the Memorial      Center for Learning and Innovation with Durbin and leaders      from other hospitals.       Tina Casner, chief executive officer of Pana Community      Hospital in Christian County, said Illinois' expansion of      Medicaid eligibility--funded by the ACA--and reduced-price      private insurance sold through the state's health insurance      exchange have reduced the number of uninsured patients and      improved the 25-bed hospital's bottom line.       ``There are now folks in our community who are seeking that      care,'' she said.       Durbin, D-Springfield, said he doubted that congressional      Republicans pledging a comparable replacement of the ACA      would be able to fulfill their promise without big gaps in      coverage for many       Instead of ``repeal and replace''--the plan for the ACA      supported by local congressmen Rodney Davis, R-Taylorville,      and Darin LaHood, R-Dunlap--Curtis said he is ``very afraid''      that Congress instead will ``repeal and delay'' a decision on      a permanent replacement.       Action to repeal without a replacement is likely to cause      disruptions in care because more insurance companies would      pull out of the exchange and increase the prices of plans      even more, health-care industry officials have said.       Durbin, the 2 Democrat in the U.Senate, was told by      hospital administrators that the federal law isn't perfect      and needs to be tweaked, especially when it comes to the high      cost of private coverage and excessive paperwork.       ``I'm for that,'' he said.       But he and the administrators expressed concerns about      Republicans' plans to change Medicaid from a federal      entitlement program to a block grant given to individual      states as a way of getting control of Medicaid's rising cost      to the federal government.       The Illinois Health and Hospital Association has said block      grants for Medicaid could lead to reductions in funding in      Illinois, a state that already spends less per Medicaid      patient than almost all other states.       Jerry Kruse, dean and provost of Southern Illinois      University School of Medicine, said the expansion of Medicaid      eligibility ``has been really great for us.''       The expansion has decreased the uninsured rate by 80      percent for patients of SIU's federally subsidized outpatient      primary care clinic, the SIU Center for Family Medicine, he      said.       With insurance coverage, formerly uninsured patients are      less likely to worry about incurring medical bills they can't      afford to pay and more likely to seek care, Kruse said.       ``It's that peace of mind,'' he said.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS412-2.txt,326,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

862,topic-id,1250,"Mr.President, it was 16 years ago when I introduced the DREAM The DREAM Act was a response to a call I received in my office. A young woman had been brought to the United States as an infant, at the age of 2, from She lived in the United States and grew up here. When she became an accomplished pianist and was accepted at some of the best musical schools in the Nation, she started to apply but didn't know what to put down in terms of her citizenship. She called and asked, and it turned out that her mom and dad had never filed the papers that would have allowed her to become a citizen of the United She was undocumented. Through no fault of her own--brought to the United States--her papers weren't filed.  She grew up in Chicago, went to school, and did well, despite having a family of modest means. As I said, she developed a skill as a pianist and now had an opportunity of a lifetime and wanted to know what her legal status was. We checked the law, and it was pretty clear. She was undocumented, and the laws of America said you have to leave for 10 years, go outside of the United States, and petition to come back.  It didn't seem fair or reasonable that a child, an infant of 2, would be held responsible for mistakes made by their parents, so I introduced the DREAM The DREAM Act said that if you are one of those kids and you finish school and you don't have a serious criminal record, we will give you a chance--a chance to become legal in America, a chance to become a citizen.  Those kids grew up going to school in our classrooms, pledging allegiance to that same flag we pledge allegiance to. They believed they were Americans, but it was not so in the eyes of American law.  I introduced this bill 16 years ago. It passed the Senate in one form, the House in another. It has never become the law of the land. A few years ago I wrote to President Obama and said: As President, can you find a way to protect these young people until we do what we are supposed to do in Congress?  He did. He created something called By Executive order, these young people could apply, pay about $500 in a filing fee, go through a criminal background check, and if they had no problems--no threat to this country--be allowed to stay here on a temporary 2-year basis. They could go to school but with no Federal help, no Federal assistance for their education. They could work and renew it every 2 years. That is  Over 750,000 kids signed up. These were kids just like the one I described earlier--now young people who are going to college and doing important things with their lives. I have come to the floor over 100 times to tell their stories because political speeches, as inspiring as they are, usually don't move people.

This award is given to students in the top 10 percent of their class.  Belsy was a member of a number of academic honor societies and the premed club. She worked as a researcher in their biology department. She was a leader of her college's Habitat for Humanity chapter and worked as a resident assistant in the student dorms and a tutor for high school students.  In 2013, Belsy graduated from Mercer University with a bachelor of science degree in biology, with minors in chemistry and math. She is now in her second year at the Loyola University Chicago School of That is where I met her.  Like many States across the country, my home State of Illinois faces a shortage of physicians in the inner cities and in the downstate rural communities. As a DACA student at Loyola medical school, Belsy has promised that after she graduates and becomes a doctor, she will work for several years in underserved areas in my home State of  Even with her busy medical school schedule, Belsy volunteers as a translator at Loyola medical clinic. She is a member of Viva la Familia, a group which educates families on healthy lifestyles, and she mentors undergraduate students who are interested in medical school.  She wrote me a letter and said:       DACA means the world to me. It has allowed me to continue      the arduous journey of becoming a physician, and without it,      I would not be where I am today. All I've ever wanted was the      opportunity to prove myself and to further my education so      that I can give back to those who need it the most. I am so      close to achieving my dreams and finally making a difference      in the community, but if DACA is repealed, those dreams might      never become reality.  If DACA is eliminated, what happens to Belsy? If it is eliminated, she loses her right to legally work in the United States and may have to drop out of medical school, and that alone--the clinical experience in medical school--requires actually working. If she can't work, she can't pay for her education.  Aside from State of Illinois financing opportunities, Belsy doesn't qualify for a penny in Federal assistance to go to medical school. It is an extraordinary hardship on these students, but they are so darned determined, they do it anyway.  I have been encouraged recently because statements made by President Trump, as well as yesterday his press secretary and earlier in the day his chief of staff, lead me to believe that he understands the seriousness of this problem.  Young people like Belsy, thousands of them across the United States, are simply asking for a chance to have a good life, to make this a better nation. We could use her. We could use her medical services and talents as a doctor in my State of Illinois, in the State of Texas, in the State of North Dakota, and virtually every State of the Why would we want to lose a great potential doctor like her? We need her, and we need people like her.  I hope my colleagues and President Trump will join me to continue the DACA program. I hope this administration will work with Congress to pass the BRIDGE Act, a bipartisan bill I have introduced with Senator Lindsey Graham to create a transition for those like Belsy, protected by DACA, so that until this Congress--as it should--passes comprehensive immigration reform, we would protect these young people from deportation.

1275,topic-id,3146,"Mr.President, this is the 11th day of the Trump To say that these have been tumultuous days is certainly an understatement. What happened over this past weekend really was unsettling to many people all across the United  Candidate Trump made it clear that he had strong feelings about refugees and strong feelings about immigration, but I don't think anyone anticipated the Executive orders that were issued by the Trump administration, by the President, on The net result of that we saw across the United States at O'Hare International Airport, JFK, Dulles, many other airports. International travelers, en route, learned that the laws of the United States were being changed because of President Trump's Executive order. As a result, there was a lot of confusion and uncertainty, and hardships were created. Individuals who were coming to the United States as refugees were being turned away.  For the record, this decision to indefinitely suspend the admission of Syrian refugees into the United States is not a decision based on fact. Since 9/11, since the war in Syria began, we have not had a single--not one--instance of terrorism by a Syrian refugee--not one. The United States has not stepped up as other countries like Canada have in admitting Syrian refugees. We have gone to great lengths, extraordinary lengths, to give background checks that are as consuming as one can imagine, to verify their identity and their safety to the United  Overwhelmingly, these Syrian refugees are the victims of a deadly war which has gone on for years, and overwhelmingly they are children with their mothers. I have met them. I sat down with them in It is heartbreaking to think that they have lived through war, may have been lucky enough to make it to a refugee camp, and then waited for years--for years--to be cleared by the United States and be given a chance to come to this country.  It has to be a heartbreaking process. Through it all, many of them have endured losses in their families that they will never be able to forget--injuries and deaths of people whom they love. These are men and women in Syria escaping a deadly war and the terrorists who have ravaged that country. They have tried to come to the United States for safety and security.  The history of refugees in America is one that in modern version is very admirable, but unfortunately before--during World War II--it was a sad chapter in our history. Not only did we inter about 120,000 Japanese Americans in camps during the war for fear that they would betray the United States, but during that war, time and again, the administration of President Roosevelt as well as Congress refused to allow those who were escaping the Holocaust in Nazi Germany to come to the United  Here on this Senate floor where I stand, an effort was made by Senator Robert Wagner of New York to admit 10,000 Jewish children out of Nazi Germany into the United States so that their parents would have the peace of mind that they would not be killed by the war or the That measure was defeated on the floor of this Prior to our entry into the war, those who tried to escape Nazi Germany and come to the United States were turned away by the United States.[[Page S470]]  The most notorious example was the SS Louis, which sailed from Germany, came to, first, Havana, Cuba, then to Miami, FL, and was turned away in both places with about 900 passengers who feared for their lives because of the anti-Semitism and the killing that was taking place in Nazi  They tracked that passenger list. Several hundred of them were rejected by the United They were not given refugee status. They were forced to return to Several hundred of them perished in the  It was after that bitter experience that the United States decided to try to set an example for the world when it came to compassion and humanity for refugees. We stepped up time and again to be that place of security and safety. We can point proudly to the fact that when the Cubans were fearful of a Communist takeover in their country, fearful for their lives and their rights and their liberties, they came to the United States in tens of thousands.  Now Cuban Americans, a proud part of our country not only in Florida but around our Nation, can point to the U.refugee policy as the means by which they finally made it to the safety of the United Here we were in a Cold War with the Soviet Union; Cuba, 90 miles off our shore was being taken over by a dictator, Fidel Castro, who was declaring his loyalty to the Soviet Yet we were readily receiving tens of thousands of refugees from Cuba in the midst of that Cold Talk about a chance--and taking a chance. Those men and women who came to the United States were not vetted for months, years, and in many cases not at all. They were allowed into our country. Thank goodness we did it. It was the right thing to do.  Time and again, whether it was refugees coming in from Vietnam after the end of that deadly war or whether it was Soviet Jews, persecuted by the Soviet Union, trying to escape, coming to the United States, we opened our doors and said: The United States of America will set an example for the world when it comes to refugees. That defined who we were and who we still should be.  Now this new President is ready to walk away from that. If we had one instance of a Syrian refugee coming into the United States after that vetting process who caused harm to our citizens or engaged in an act of terrorism--if we had one--then perhaps this President could start to make his case.  All he has is fear, unreasoned fear, unproven fear. We recall what Franklin Roosevelt said to this Nation, standing right out here on the steps when he was inaugurated in March of 1933: We have nothing to fear but fear itself. It is fear itself that is motivating this President to make decisions inconsistent with more than 50 years of American history and inconsistent with American values.  When you meet these refugees and you hear their heartbreaking stories, how can you say that there is no room for you in this country? Yet that is exactly what he said.  Sadly, he not only came up with this Executive order, he did it in a fashion where the agencies that were supposed to implement the order really were caught by surprise. Now they are priding themselves on the fact that they can turn on a dime when given instructions that are important for national security. But in this case, where national security was not the motive--political security was the motive; I am talking in the crassest terms. In those cases, these agencies were forced to make split-second decisions, and some of them were horrible.  A man who came to the United States from Iraq, from one of the seven countries designated by President Trump, came from Iraq after having risked his life for American soldiers. He was rewarded with an opportunity to come to the United States, was detained at the airport, questioned at length, threatened to be returned to Iraq, and finally--after 19 hours--allowed to stay.  There is story after story of families coming to see someone who was on the deathbed, their last chance to be together, and families who had gone overseas for what they thought were just casual or really easy trips who were subject to detention and some turned away. Why? It certainly was not in the interest of the security of the United States, and it was not handled in a professional manner. It was impulsive and not decisive. It was ill conceived instead of wise.  Here we are today. As I stand here at this chair and this desk in the Senate, across the street thousands have gathered in front of the Supreme Court to express their outrage over the Executive orders issued by President I am happy to report that almost one dozen Republican Senators have joined us in expressing reservations about this policy.  It gives me hope that maybe on a bipartisan basis we can rein in some of the excesses of this administration. God forbid we ignore the basic constitutional issue that has been raised by these Executive orders. It is no coincidence that these seven countries are predominately Muslim countries. It is no coincidence that President Trump went on a Christian broadcasting station and said preference would be given to  The Constitution which we are sworn to uphold and defend, the Constitution which guides this Nation is one that was written at a time when religion was a divisive issue that led to people coming to the United  I think in this section, our Founding Fathers probably showed more wisdom and more understanding of our future than any other on the issue of religion. They only said three things in the entire Constitution, three things over 200 years ago. They said that this Congress, this government, will not establish an official religion. They did that, of course, many of them having come from England, where they had a national church. They didn't want that in the United Most importantly, they said each person in America had freedom of religious belief, to believe what they wished or to believe nothing if they wished, and that would be an honored freedom under our Bill of The third element: Religion could not be used as a litmus test for public office. That is it.  When you think of all the wars and all the deaths and all the persecution based on religion, the fact that we have largely escaped it is because of the wisdom of that document.  Now comes this 45th President of the United States who decides to rewrite the book, to ignore this basic constitutional direction and mandate, and to say on the Christian Broadcasting Network: We are going to favor Christian refugees coming to the United That, to me, is unacceptable and unconstitutional, and inconsistent with who we are, what we are, and the values we treasure in this country.  My mother was an immigrant to this country. I never knew my grandmother, who brought her over on the ship from I do have one thing now in my office upstairs that my grandmother carried with her to this country. It is a prayer book. We are a Roman Catholic family. She was a Roman Catholic in The Russian Orthodox religion was being pushed by the czar, who was dominant when they left Lithuania, and they banned Catholic prayer books written in  I never knew my grandmother. I wish I had. She risked everything to bring that Catholic prayer book, that contraband from czarist-controlled Lithuania into the United I have it upstairs. It means the world to me that this woman with limited formal education but unlimited courage was willing to risk a lot, bringing three small children into this country, carrying with her that prayer book which might have gotten her imprisoned in Lithuania back in her day. So religion means a lot to our family, not just on a personal basis but what America means when it comes to religion.  When this President is so casual with the constitutional guarantees of religion, I don't believe he is serving the United States or honoring the history that came before him.  There have been so many issues that have come up during the 11 days of his Presidency, but President Trump's decision to turn away innocent people fleeing persecution, genocide, and terror and to ban immigrants on the basis of religion is the worst, in my view. This attack is not only un-American, it risks alienating 1 billion Muslims around the world. Some of the most conservative people in this country--I am certain Republicans--have said over and over again: Don't do this. There are Muslim countries that are[[Page S471]]allies in fighting terrorism, and if you alienate them, it is going to lessen our ability to stop the spread of Al Qaeda and  Furthermore, this is a recruiting tool. You know what is going to happen. Those who hate the United States are going to use this action by President Trump to verify their belief and their credo that the United States is anti- There was a Republican President, George Bush, whom I disagreed with many times, but thank goodness, after 9/11, he had the wisdom and showed the leadership to come before the American people to say: We are not going to condemn the Muslim religion. We are going to go after those who corrupted it, but we are going to honor it as a religion of peace.  How different President George Bush, that Republican President, was to President Donald Trump, this Republican  Senator Dianne Feinstein is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary She has introduced a resolution, on which I am proud to be one of the original cosponsors, to repeal and rescind these reprehensible President Donald Trump Executive orders on refugees and immigration.  We are in the midst of the worst refugee crisis in the history of the world. More than 65 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes. The brutal Syrian conflict, which is the epicenter of this humanitarian crisis, has killed hundreds of thousands, injured more than a million, and displaced half of the population of that country. In some areas, children literally starve to death in This conflict has forced more than 4.7 million refugees to flee. Around 70 percent of them are women and children who are looking for a safe place in this world. Half of Syrian children today are not in school because of this conflict and because of the forces that have dispersed them around the world. Millions in and outside of Syria need humanitarian assistance.  Last week--the same week President Trump signed this awful Executive order on refugees--the United Nations issued an appeal for $4.6 billion to meet the basic needs of Syrian refugees and struggling communities hosting them in neighboring countries.  Lebanon is a country where I believe half of the children in school today are Jordan, one of our best friends and allies in the Middle East, has made more sacrifices on behalf of refugees per capita than any nation on What message does it send to our friends in Jordan that while they risk the security and safety and stability of their nation to absorb these refugees from Syria and around the world, that as an official policy of President Donald Trump, the United States no longer will even consider allowing a Syrian refugee to come to the United States? How can we in good conscience ask the King of Jordan to risk his monarchy and his country for refugees when President Trump says they are not allowed in the United States?  Earlier this month, I am happy to report, more than 1,700 Jewish rabbis called on our government to maintain and strengthen the refugee program for refugees of all ethnic and religious backgrounds--not to halt it, pause it, or restrict it. This weekend, I was so proud of the Catholic cardinal in Chicago, Blase Cupich, who came out and said the Executive orders of Donald Trump are not consistent with American values and certainly are not consistent with the beliefs of the Catholic Religious leaders all across the country are speaking out. They understand that this is more than a political test; this is a moral test of who we are as  Many of the refugees who came to this country were fleeing regimes that were hostile to the United We gave them safety.  Refugees are the most carefully vetted and investigated of all travelers. Before refugees are admitted into the United States, they go through security screening that is almost unheard of. All of that screening takes place before they can even consider being allowed to set foot in America, and Syrian refugees go through an even stricter review. Extreme vetting? I have news for this President: Syrian refugees and refugees all over the world are already going through extreme vetting.  Shutting down the Refugee Resettlement Program won't protect our security. It plays into ISIS's argument that the United States is waging a war against  Listen to what Michael Hayden, former Director of the CIA and National Security Agency under Presidents Bush and Obama, said about President Trump's Executive order:       It's a horrible move. It is a political, ideological move      driven by the language of the campaign and, frankly, campaign      promises--promises in the campaign that were hyped by an      exaggeration of the threat. And in fact, what we're doing now      has probably made us less safe today than we were Friday      morning before this happened because we are now living the      worst jihadist narrative possible, that there is undying      enmity between Islam and the Muslims out there who were      not part of the jihadist movement are now being shown that      the story they were being told by the jihadists--they hate      us; they're our enemy--that's being acted out by the American      government. And frankly, at a humanitarian level, it's an      abomination.  That statement was not made by the Democratic National Committee; it was made by Michael Hayden, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency under Presidents Bush and  If we are serious about protecting America, we should be serious about closing the real loopholes that might threaten us. Think of the hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program who go through no vetting, not even fingerprinting, before they get on a plane to come to the United Want to close a loophole in security? Let's look at that one seriously.  Instead of real security threats, President Trump is focusing on innocent people--children, women, families who are fleeing terrorism.  Today's refugees, like millions before them from all over the world, will become proud Americans who contribute greatly to our society and economy.  Albert Einstein was a refugee. Thank goodness he came to the United Today, so many of the leaders of our major corporations and high-tech companies are immigrants to this country and, in some cases, refugees.  Building walls on our borders and fear in our hearts will not move America forward. Let's not continue the cruelty or deception of blaming immigrants and refugees for our security and economic challenges. Let's work together to build a better America for all Americans, including new Americans, no matter the color of their skin, where their parents were born, or how they pray.

1700,topic-id,2089,"Thank you, Mr. Mr.President, Rex Tillerson of ExxonMobil has been nominated to be our Secretary of We are going through a procedural 30 hours of debate, moving to that issue. As we can tell, many speeches are being given on the floor on a lot of different topics, but the underlying order of business is the next Secretary of State of the United States of His nomination comes to us at a particularly challenging time. We live in a dangerous world. We know that. We learned it on 9/11, and we learn it every day when men and women in uniform are risking and sometimes sacrificing their lives for this great  We also live in a complicated moment in time with the changeover in Presidents and clearly a changeover in foreign policy. We note that in the first 12 days--the first 12 days of the Trump Presidency--how many serious foreign policy issues have arisen, some the creation of the new President of the United  It is customary, it is traditional, for the President of the United States to make one of his first major visits to Mexico, or Mexico to the United The reason, of course, is they are our third largest trading partner, and in so many different areas, we work together closely with We certainly work together with them on issues of security, issues of terrorism and narcotics and trade issues that go on, on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this new President Trump is off to a rocky start with the President of Mexico, to the point where the President of Mexico canceled his visit to the United  Strong statements were made during the campaign by President Trump about building a wall and the Mexicans will pay for it. How many times did we hear that? Over and over again, the Mexican Government has said: We will never pay for it. So that standoff over a campaign threat or promise is at this moment inhibiting a relationship which traditionally has been strong for generations.  Secondly, since being elected President of the United States, President Trump has said that NATO is obsolete. NATO is the alliance created after World War II to protect Europe against aggression from outside, particularly from the Soviet Since the fall of the Soviet Union, NATO has expanded to include many other countries--the Baltics, for example, and As a result, these countries have become dependent on NATO for their security.  The theory behind NATO is very basic. If one of our NATO allies is attacked, we will all defend. So we can understand why a small country like Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, even Poland, realizing that they are vulnerable to Russian attack, count on When the President of the United States says that NATO is obsolete, people living in those countries wonder: What about tomorrow? What happens tomorrow if Vladimir Putin, who has been guilty of aggression in Georgia, as well as Ukraine, decides to pick a Baltic country next?  So the uncertainty created by President Trump's statement on NATO is one that haunts us to this moment.  But the one that is really overwhelming over the last few days is President Trump's Executive order when it came to refugees and immigration. The story of refugees in the United States does not have a good start. Going back to World War II, a man named Breckinridge Long was in charge of immigration into the United States during that war. He worked in the administration of Franklin Sadly, his view on refugees was harsh, and as a result, the United States was caught up many times denying access to the safety of the United States to people who were vulnerable to persecution and genocide. The most noteworthy example was the[[Page S513]]SS Louis in 1939, which brought 900 people from Nazi Germany to the United States to escape the They were turned away. They were forced back into Europe, and hundreds died as a result of it. That was the policy of the day.  When Robert Wagner, the Senator from New York, asked that we allow 10,000 German children to come into the United States to escape the Holocaust, that measure was defeated in committee in the U.Senate--children coming to the United  After World War II, when we saw 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and so many others whose lives were compromised and lost, we decided to change the U.approach when it came to refugees. Instead of pushing back against them, we began to embrace them. And do you know what has happened since? We developed a reputation around the world as the safe place to be, the country that cared. Ask over 600,000 Cubans who came to the U.shores to escape Castro's regime. Remember, at that time, Castro had allied with the Soviet Union, our mortal enemy of the Cold Yet, without vetting--without extreme vetting--we said to these Cubans: You are welcome to be safe in the United States, and they came in the thousands. Are they an important part of America? You bet they are, and there are three Cuban-American U.Senators to prove it.  Today, a question has been raised by the Trump regime as to what our view is going to be toward refugees in the future. Thank goodness we didn't raise it with Cuba, nor did we raise it when Jews in the Soviet Union were facing persecution. They asked for a chance to come to the United Synagogues and communities across the United States opened their arms and gave them a chance, and over 100,000 came to our shores. We are better for it. We really have demonstrated that our ideals and values as a nation apply to those who came to our shores.  The list goes on and on, from Yugoslavia to Viet Nam, to Somalia, and many other places where the United States has shown that we are a caring nation. Now comes this new President who says: It is America first; we are going to redefine this refugee policy.  Well, this redefinition of America around the world is something that many of us believe is just plain wrong. These Executive orders were issued by President Trump without consultation with even his own Cabinet members who have been appointed. Those in the area of national security, for example, weren't consulted before these Executive orders went into effect. When I talked to the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection, it turns out they were given instructions at the last minute as to how to treat passengers coming into international terminals over the weekend.  I know what happened at O'Over 130 people were stopped and detained and questioned, and some were never allowed to board planes in other countries, and some were returned to those countries. It was chaotic. It didn't show basic competency in running a government, and it was fundamentally unfair.  Let me say it wasn't just a matter of an uncomfortable situation. It wasn't just a situation of people being inconvenienced. One of our priorities when it comes to refugees, even from those seven countries that President Trump noted, were those who were in desperate medical conditions. So when the President said: I just wanted a pause--a pause for these seven countries--let me ask what we think that pause means to that 9-year-old Somali child in an Ethiopian refugee camp with a congenital heart disease that can't be treated anymore in that camp and who was finally going to get to come for medical care in the United That pause by President Trump could be deadly. A 1-year-old Sudanese boy with cancer. A Somali boy with a severe intestinal disorder living in a camp that doesn't even have medical facilities. A pause. We will get it together. We will get back to you later. That is the kind of human condition that is being affected by these orders issued by our new Is it any wonder that so many people around the world have reacted?  First, they should react when it comes to our security. Do we know how many terrorist refugees have come from these seven countries on the list? Not one. Not one Syrian refugee has engaged in terrorist activities in the United If you watched ``60 Minutes'' over the weekend, you will understand why.  This is not an easy ask. You don't just hold up your hand and say: I am ready to go to the United You first submit your name to the U.Commission on Then we cull the list to find the ones we might consider in the United States, and that is about 1 percent. Then we put them through a vetting process that can go on for 2 years--2 years of being interrogated, investigated, examined, watched, and challenged. Then, finally, after those years, they may have a chance to come to the United  So now we are going to move to extreme vetting? What is that going to be--trial by fire? What is left? We are doing the very best. The fact that there has not been one refugee from any of these countries engaged in terrorism is an indication that we have a good process that is stronger than any nation on Yet the President has said we are going to stop these refugees from coming indefinitely from Syria and for months from these other six countries.  Then he made a statement on a Christian broadcasting show that he was on that really went far over the line. During the course of the campaign, he said repeatedly: This will be a Muslim ban. Then he said: They told me to stop saying ``Muslim ban,'' so he stopped for a while.  It turns out that Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said: Well, he called me in and said, How do I put together something legal that is a Muslim ban? I think Mayor Giuliani may have been speaking out of school, but it is an indication of what was really going on in the Trump campaign and this administration.  On this Christian broadcasting show, the President was explicit that he would give priority to Christians because he believes they would be persecuted in those countries. That flies in the face of some fundamentals in this country--the fundamentals of our Constitution--because we have said that when it comes to religion, this government shall not favor any religion. Here we have the President of the United States on a television show saying the opposite.  It is being challenged in court, at least to some extent. It has been slowed down by retraining orders issued by Federal courts and judges around this country.  Last night, the Acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, said that in good conscience, she could not defend President Trump's decisions in these Executive orders. For that act of courage, she was fired. I am sure she expected it. But I want to say that for a woman who has given her life--20 years of it, at least--as a prosecutor and who had an exemplary career at the Department of Justice, my hat goes off to her. I think she did what she thought was right and faced the consequences. History will prove her right and this decision by the administration wrong.  So now we have Rex Tillerson, who wants to be Secretary of State of the United States of How would you like to take over that job tomorrow in light of what I have just mentioned--the Executive orders issued by the President without consultation with the Department of State; judging NATO to be obsolete in his Twitter; and then having a relationship with Mexico where the President is cancelling trips to the United States, not to mention other things said about China and other countries. It is an awesome challenge. It is a challenge that we have to ask whether Mr.Tillerson is prepared for. He has had 40 years of success with ExxonMobil, starting as a production engineer and going to the top of the company. Now the question is, Is he ready to give up his loyalty to a company and to have a loyalty to a country even if the decisions he has to make as Secretary of State may be inconsistent with the best business policy for that company?  I am going to yield the floor. I see my colleague from the State of Wyoming is here. I believe this will be ongoing, so I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from               Nominations of Jeff Sessions and Tom Price  ",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgS504.txt,326,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 38, DISAPPROVING A RULE",2017.0,31.0,January
1702,topic-id,1765,"Mr.President, the Senator from Wyoming from the other side of the aisle is my friend. We spend time in the gym together; I go there regularly--for no apparent reason. But we are friends, and we disagree on some political issues. I just wish to clarify one or two things.  When it comes to Congressman Price, I don't know him personally. He has been chosen by President Trump to head up the Department of Health and Human Services, one of the biggest and most important. He has stated, as a Member of Congress from Georgia, that he believes we should change the Social Security system as well as the Medicare system and privatize That is a worrisome suggestion for 50 million or more Americans who count on Medicare and do not exactly look forward to being placed in the loving arms of an insurance company at some point late in their lives. So there are questions there.  But the question at hand was brought to the attention of the American public today, not in some liberal newspaper, but in the Wall Street It turns out that Congressman Price has been engaged in the purchase of stock that[[Page S515]]has a direct impact on the medical profession. Whether he properly filed disclosures in buying that stock or whether he did something improper is still to be resolved.  Part of the reason the nominees for President Trump are taking longer than others is that many, like Congressman Price, have extensive financial holdings. We found that when a billionaire from Chicago--Penny Pritzker--was nominated for Secretary of Commerce under President Obama, it took literally 6 months for us to gather all the financial information about her and to divest her of any potential conflicts of interest. It turns out that many of these nominees did not have their ethics filings on file in time to be considered in a timely fashion, and, in some cases, information about them was found to be in conflict with reality, and now there is a further investigation necessary. It isn't just a matter of spite; it is a matter of doing our due diligence, as required by the Constitution and required in the U.                         Affordable Care Act  A word about ObamaCare: My friend from Wyoming, a medical doctor himself, has felt strongly against the Affordable Care Act since its passage. I view it a lot differently.  There are currently 1.2 million Illinoisans--1 out of 10 in our State--who have health insurance because of the Affordable Care Over half of them are now brought into the Medicaid system, the others are on insurance exchanges, and many of them have their premiums subsidized by our Federal  In addition, every person in America who has a health insurance plan has benefited by the Affordable Care Why? Because we took some of the worst abuses in health insurance and said: You can no longer do that and sell health insurance in this country. One example is lifetime caps--caps on the amount of money that a policy will play. Now, $100,000 in coverage may sound like a lot, until you are diagnosed with cancer--and then it disappears in a matter of days and weeks. So we eliminated lifetime caps on coverage.  The second most important thing we did was to say: You can't discriminate against someone because they have a preexisting condition. Is there anyone alive that doesn't have some preexisting condition? If it was bad enough in the bad old days before the Affordable Care Act, that was enough to either disqualify them from health insurance or to run the premiums up to the high heavens. Now you can no longer be discriminated against because your husband has diabetes, your wife survived breast cancer, or your child has survived a cancer scare themselves. We have eliminated that in all health insurance policies.  The third thing we did was to say that every health insurance policy sold in the United States has to cover mental illness and substance abuse treatment. The people who pushed for that--Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Republican Pete Domenici of New Mexico--both had family histories of mental illness, and they said health insurance ought to cover mental illness. They finally prevailed. It was included in the Affordable Care Act, so it means that, across the board, all of us who buy health insurance are buying care for mental illness.  Is substance abuse treatment important? Think about the opioid and heroin epidemic across the United States--across my State of Where would these families be, with a person in the family suffering from addiction, if the health insurance plan didn't provide some coverage? The Affordable Care Act requires that.  When the Republicans say that they want to repeal it, the obvious question is: And then what? What happens next, when the insurance companies can stop covering these critical areas?  There is another thing. My wife and I have raised some kids who have gone through college, and when they finished college they didn't quite go into their long, permanent career. They had a bunch of jobs, looking for the right place.  I can recall calling my daughter, fresh out of the University of Wisconsin, and saying: Jen, do you have health insurance? I know you did as a student.  She said: Dad, I'm fine. I'm strong and healthy. I don't need it.  That is the last thing a father wants to hear.  Do you know what the Affordable Care Act says? My daughter--anyone's daughter--up to the age of 26 can stay on my family plan. How about that for common sense? There are 90,000 young people in Illinois protected by the family plans because of that provision. Now we hear from the Senator from Wyoming that this is a big failure and we have to repeal it.  The last thing we did is important to every senior citizen on Medicare across the United There used to be something called the doughnut hole. It is even hard to describe, but it related to paying seniors for their prescription drugs. Here is what it said; try to follow this: We will cover you for the first few months of the year, with Medicare paying the prescription drug cost. Then you are on your own for 3 or 4 months. Once you have delved into your own personal savings up to a certain amount, we will come back and cover you again.  Go figure. It would take a Congressman or a Senator to dream up something like that, and seniors across the country felt completely vulnerable. When they went into that period of no coverage, many of them stopped taking their drugs. That is not a good thing. So we closed that gap. We closed that doughnut hole.  What does it mean to seniors in Illinois? On average, they save $1,000 a year because the Affordable Care Act brought this reform to Now the Republicans say: Let's repeal that. Do they want to explain to the seniors in my State that they now have to turn for their savings for that gap period again? We don't want to see that happen.  For 6 years, Republicans have said repeatedly that they want to repeal Repeal They say it in their sleep. They have vote after vote--I think 60 different votes in the House--to repeal it, knowing it would never happen with President Obama in the White Now, the dog done caught the bus. Here they are, in the majority in the House and the Senate with a Republican President, and their first order of business: Repeal  Do you know what they are learning? All across the United States, medical health care providers--hospitals, doctors, clinics, and others--are telling them that will be a disaster. If you eliminate the Affordable Care Act without a replacement as good or better, you are going to leave chaos in the system and a lot of people without the protection of health insurance.  So after 6 years, you would think the Republicans would have a replacement plan. Right? A substitute. They have had all this time to think about it. No, not yet; they are still thinking about it, but they are determined to repeal.  I met with hospital administrators around my State last weekend and will continue to in the future. They are worried. We estimate Illinois hospitals will lose over 90,000 jobs with the repeal of the Affordable Care We know that downstate hospitals and hospitals in rural areas--in many States represented here--are going to be forced to close. What happens when you close that smalltown hospital in downstate Illinois? What used to be a 20-minute ride to the hospital becomes a 1-hour drive. How important is that? Well, when you are in labor, it is important or if you just had a farm accident or you are responding to something that happened on the highway, it is critical, life-or-death important. So you would think Republicans would have a plan to keep these hospitals open. They don't. We haven't seen a substitute.  They rail against ObamaCare; they rail against the Affordable Care They don't criticize the individual components I have described because they are wildly popular with the American people.  The irony of this is that we have spent 6 years trying to convince people that the Affordable Care Act, even with its flaws and faults--and it has them, but even with that, it is good for We got nowhere. We were beating our heads against the wall.  Then, when the Republicans took over and started talking about repeal, people were stepping back and saying: What am I going to lose if they repeal it? The approval rating for the Affordable Care Act since Donald Trump was[[Page S516]]elected is going up, as people come now to finally understand the value of it for their families and their businesses.  So I say to my friends on the Republican side, as I have said over and over again: The Affordable Care Act is not a perfect law. The only perfect law was carried down the side of a mountain by Senator Moses on clay tablets. Everything else can be improved, and I am ready to sign up for that improvement. First, jettison this whole talk of repeal. It is totally irresponsible. If we want to have a constructive conversation about how to make the Affordable Care Act more affordable, covering more people, finally doing something about prescription drug costs, let's sit down and do it together on a bipartisan basis. Starting with repeal is a nonstarter.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgS504.txt,326,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

I want to thank Chairman Ed Royce, and I am pleased to cosponsor this bill that he has introduced to make it easier for people around the world to harness the power of the This bill passed in the last Congress but didn't make it through the Senate, so I am glad we are taking it up again.  Mr.Speaker, we know the way this incredible tool has shaped the world in the last generation. The Internet can instantaneously connect people across the world from each other who a few years ago would never cross paths in a lifetime. It allows citizens and journalists living under oppressive regimes or in war zones to get information out to the world. It allows entrepreneurs in emerging markets to sell their products in global markets.  To be sure, the power of the Internet can cut both way. ISIS has proved all too adept at using social media to recruit fighters and spread its hateful message. But put to its highest purpose, the Internet can help drive economic growth and spread stability and prosperity.  Unfortunately, too few people around the world have access to this tool. Roughly 60 percent of the world's population is not online, and the growth rate of Internet access is slowing. If you live in a poor community or a rural area, sometimes just because you are a woman, it is harder to take advantage of the  We know where that lack of access is holding populations back. Three-quarters of those who are offline live in just 20 countries.

Chairman Royce's legislation calls on the administration to ramp up efforts around the world to expand access to the It encourages the State Department, USAID, and the Peace Corps to focus on Internet access as a diplomatic and development priority.

In closing, I read a few weeks ago that the new administration was planning to retool the State Department to focus more on terrorism. The article suggested that the State Department might do away with some of our smart power efforts. That would be a mistake. I look at an effort like this one, expanding access to education, and I know that it isn't taking away from our ability to combat terrorism. In fact, it is critical to that fight.  When we help more young people get access to a good education, we are giving them the tools to think critically and resist those who mean us harm. We are helping give people an alternative, a path forward for their lives.  When kids don't have these skills, who do you think shows up? When children are told from a young age, with no competing message, that America is their enemy, how does that shape their lives?  So I hope that this bill gets to the new President's desk and that he sees the value not just in expanding access to education, but in the wide range of foreign policy priorities that help to project stability and make communities stronger, that show the world that the United States is a friend and a partner, and not an enemy.

282,topic-id,220,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.290, the FCC Process Reform Act of 2017.  I'm particularly proud of a bipartisan provision I first authored in the 112th Congress that I'm pleased is included in this legislation today. This provision would modify current FCC rules to allow three or more Commissioners to hold non-public collaborative discussions, as long as no agency action is taken.  Today, under the FCC's ``Sunshine Rule,'' three Commissioners or more are prohibited from talking to each other outside of an official public meeting. The FCC oversees industries representing approximately one-sixth of the American economy. It must be able to collaborate freely and deliberate on our nation's most pressing communications issues, from enhancing universal service and public safety, to making more spectrum available for mobile broadband.  As Congress looks at ways to help modernize the FCC, this bipartisan, commonsense provision will help to promote greater discussion among the five FCC Commissioners and ensure they can benefit from each other's expertise and experience. Through greater collaboration, the FCC will be better positioned to respond to a fast-paced and rapidly growing telecommunications industry in the 21st century.  I thank Chairman Walden for including this provision in the bill the House has passed today.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Those who seek or hold the most powerful office in the world should be held to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the best interests of the American people are met.  Tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information, including whether the candidate paid any taxes, what they own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they have made charitable donations, and whether they have taken advantage of tax loopholes or offshore tax shelters.  The President and his spokesperson have both recently said that he will not release his tax returns because the American people ``don't care.'' I beg to differ. The top petition on the Web site of the White House calls for the release of the President's tax returns with over 300,000 signatures already on it. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released last week found that 74 percent of the American people, including 53 percent of whom are Republicans, believe the President should release his tax returns.

Additionally, I must state my view of the recent action taken by President Trump which I assert has reduced the national trust in our democracy.  In the short time since President Trump has taken office, he has set forth a national security plan that would require broad spending increases. He has set forth an executive order to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement in place. He has seemingly put us directly at odds with Mexico, our bordering country, due to a wall that he has set forth as one of his key proposals, and then expected and even demanded that they actually pay for it.  He has ignored the facts and has declared that 3 to 5 million people allegedly voted fraudulently in the election.  And last, but certainly not least, he has set forth an executive order banning travel from Muslim countries and suspended the refugee program, an action that makes our Nation less safe.  Over the weekend, I joined with Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, Representative Robert Brady, and Representative Brendan Boyle and spoke directly with those who were immediately impacted by this executive action.

That is why I am here today to bring awareness to National School Choice  School choice is a straightforward concept in that parents should have the choice about where to send their children to school and about picking the best educational environment for their children. This includes many options: traditional public schools, charter schools, magnet schools, private schools, homeschooling, and more. By choosing the appropriate educational options for their children, parents enable them to succeed.  Nationwide, approximately 2.6 million students are currently enrolled in more than 3,200 public magnet schools; more than 3 million are enrolled in charter schools; and 2.3 million are homeschooled. According to the National School Choice Week's organizers, 70 percent of Americans support school choice, and those numbers are even higher among growing demographic groups.  Some would say that school choice hurts public schools. I beg to differ. Studies have shown that student outcome in public schools actually improves with the more choices there are.

The Executive order prohibits individuals from Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen from entering the country. It even bars relatives of Americans from visiting. The order suspends the entire U.refugee program, and most egregiously, Syrian refugees are banned indefinitely unless they are These provisions are not what America is all about.  First, the order is unnecessary. Individuals from the 7 targeted countries and 150 other nations are already thoroughly screened. Visitors fill out visa applications. They submit photographs that run through biometric databases. Their personal information is reviewed, including names, addresses, and dates of birth. They are interviewed at a U.consulate. The process could take months to complete and eliminates the need for the travel ban.  In addition, the move to ban refugees has no legitimate national security reason because these refugees undergo an even more thorough screening process that can take up to 2 years to complete. The vast majority of refugees are women and children who have experienced the absolute worst of humanity.  Let's not forget the heart-wrenching image of the small body of Aylan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy, washed up on a beach, dead. I will never forget this small boy in his short pants, his shoes, and his socks, lying on that beach. To turn away women and children and men in their time of dire need is not what this Nation is all about.  Let me make this point: The poor execution of this Executive order has resulted in chaos and confusion. It is unclear whether the Justice Department or Homeland Security had any input. There seems to have been a disagreement about whether it would apply to green card holders. There was confusion about whether it applies to[[Page S492]]individuals already in transit or approved for travel. Even airport directors--I have spoken directly with the directors of Los Angeles International and San Francisco International, and there was confusion about how it applies. Even airport directors were left in the dark about how many people were detained and who they were.  Sara Yarjani was one Californian caught up in this mess. She is an Iranian national studying at the California Institute for Human Science in San Diego under a valid student visa. After being detained at LAX for 23 hours, she was sent back to Europe, a clear violation of the nationwide stay against the order. What I am saying is that the court stay was actually violated. This is just one of more than 100 stories from the weekend.  I believe this order is also unconstitutional. The First Amendment prohibits government from establishing a religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The order violates this First Amendment by targeting Muslims and favoring The order may also violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which forbids the government from burdening the person's exercise of religion. The law bars any discrimination based on national origin in the issuance of a visa.  Finally, detaining people at airports may violate their Fourth Amendment rights.  This was an ill-considered overreach, as the courts showed over the weekend, and it should be repealed.  So the bill that 27 of us are introducing rescinds the President's Executive order. The text is simple because the message is simple: We won't stand for these types of actions.  In conclusion, I would like to say that I am so proud of the peaceful demonstrations we saw, and I join those who are so passionate about the free exercise of religion and free speech. These are our values, Mr.President, as a nation, and I will be right there with you if anyone tries to violate them.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS491.txt,1332,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

961,topic-id,634,"Mr.President, I rise to speak of legislation I am introducing today--the Transportation Investment Recalibration to Equality Act, or the TIRE The TIRE Act would suspend the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirement on all transportation-related infrastructure contracts. This would free up billions more in taxpayer dollars to be spent on jobs and on projects.  For those who are not familiar, Davis-Bacon is a Depression-era law that requires contractors on Federal construction projects to pay workers no less than the so-called local prevailing wage. Now, since its enactment over 80 years ago, the Department of Labor has been unable to devise an effective system for determining prevailing wages.  In fact, a 2004 Department of Labor inspector general report revealed that Federal wage reporting surveys, which are a key metric used to determine prevailing wages, are fundamentally flawed. Of all the wage report surveys reviewed by the IG, 100 percent contained flaws. Let me say that again: 100 percent of all the surveys were flawed.  In addition, some of the wage surveys have not been updated since the 1980s. The bottom line is that every time Davis-Bacon applies to a Federal project, less money is going to construction and more money is going to meet onerous wage requirements. According to the Beacon Hill Institute, Davis-Bacon forces taxpayers to pay 22 percent above the market rate for labor on Federal infrastructure projects.  This is largely the result of disproportionate union participation in flawed wage surveys that skew Federal decisionmaking. Now, despite representing only 4 percent of the construction industry, unions are able to leverage their clout with Federal bureaucrats to inflate more than 60 percent of prevailing wages--talk about benefitting a few at the expense of the many.  Here is some perspective on what it means in real dollars. In 2016, the Federal Government spent $23 billion on Federal construction projects, and 2.1 billion of these dollars was spent on above-rate labor costs.  Again, $2.1 billion of the $23 billion spent was on above-market-rate labor costs. This means that nearly 10 percent of all Federal construction spending last year went to inflated contracts. Not only does this translate into less construction funding going to actual construction, but according to George Mason University, it results in roughly 30,000 lost construction jobs.  So we lose both on the projects and the jobs that are created. More broadly, it discriminates against small businesses that don't have the resources to meet onerous Federal reporting and compliance requirements. Now, while it may be well-intentioned, Davis-Bacon ends up eliminating decent-paying construction jobs and hampering infrastructure spending.  I have often talked to State and local officials who will say that if you have two bridges across the same river, even if they are just 100 yards or 200 yards or a mile apart with the same underlying costs--or what should be the same underlying costs--if there are Federal moneys involved in one and no Federal moneys involved in the other, the one with Federal moneys will cost significantly more, and a big portion of that is because of Davis-Bacon requirements.  Now, in this body, we have to look for issues to bridge the partisan divide. It turns out that one of these issues is bridges, roads, dams, and other infrastructure projects. Fixing our Nation's crumbling infrastructure is a top priority for many in Congress, and the new administration has touted a large infrastructure package as one of its agenda items.  However, despite the bipartisan consensus on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue for infrastructure investment, visions for the road ahead actually diverge. With a projected pricetag north of $800 billion for highways and bridges alone, every Federal dollar needs to be spent as efficiently as possible.  The TIRE Act will return wage determinations for Federal transportation projects where they belong, and that is the market.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS447.txt,1633,FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION PROCESS REFORM ACT OF 2017,2017.0,24.0,January

So I am grateful for his hard work, most grateful for his friendship, and very grateful for his leadership. I thank him so much for the time.  Mr.Speaker, when Presidents give their inaugural addresses, we are very accustomed to lofty narratives, to visionary ideals, and to sweeping language. But last Friday, President Trump spoke very differently. The only sweeping thing in the President's speech was his reference to the windswept plains of Of course, when I heard that, I perked up.  President Trump's speech was a striking and direct call for a new, healthy nationalism. He spoke to the people, about the people, and for the people. A certain awkwardness marked the beginning of his speech, not only because of the initial confrontational style from the outset, but it also began to rain as the President started, creating a bit of an uncomfortable moment. But then the rain suddenly stopped and his speech gained momentum. He discussed, in hard terms, some of the stark realities we are facing and how they might be resolved for our country.  Mr.Speaker, we all know this, that defining problems is an easy task, but finding solutions is much harder. While President Trump's speech lacked specifics in that regard, nonetheless, there was extraordinary power in the attempt to articulate an America that has been lost to globalized supply-side elitism, an America that has been lost to drugs and crime, and an America that has systems that no longer seem to serve all persons. It just seems that no matter how hard individuals work, they just can't get ahead.  Mr.Speaker, our President's speech was an authoritative call for a new national unity, particularly for those forgotten. The idea that America can do better, that we must do better, and that we will do better for everyone was clearly conveyed by President  I recognize the tone of this speech will not have universal appeal. It was to the point, direct, and firm. It was not a delicate, textured speech. But the President was clear when he declared: ``The American carnage stops right here and stops right now.''  Mr.Speaker, we are witnessing a renewed and important and essential focus on reviving America's economy. The multinational corporations of this world are on notice: they cannot play both sides of the balance sheet, being for us and against us at the same time, and the benefits of exchange will have to be fair for all. Frankly, I believe this creates possibilities, possibilities for authentic relationships with peoples around the world rather than a transactional one. If this objective can be achieved, it will be constructive indeed. A healthy American nationalism will lead to properly ordered international engagement--for our benefit and the benefit of others.  Mr.Speaker, when the President spoke before the entirety of our government, he also spoke before the House of The President's authoritative style, communicating the desire to devolve power from Washington as well as Wall Street, interestingly repositions Congress to its appropriate role in governing society through the power of the people.  Mr.Speaker, it is statistically shown that the majority of Americans believe that it is the job of Congress to do whatever the President says. This is not true. Congress is an independent, coequal branch of government that makes the law, which is interpreted by the judiciary and enforced by the But across Democratic and across Republican executive administrations more and more power has been taken by the executive and has been ceded by This balance of power, this necessary balance of power, this original idea of the balance of power, has been out of balance for 100 years, and perhaps now a realignment begins.[[Page H595]]  Mr.Speaker, whether you love President Trump or you loathe him, or whether you are someplace in between with certain apprehensions but hoping that President Trump succeeds, Friday, Inauguration Day, was an extraordinary American day.

I similarly thank him for many nights coming to this floor and defending values that are not only uniquely American, but which are unmistakably conservative. I appreciate him for being the fire keeper on this floor for those values and those principles for constituents in his district and in mine and all throughout this great country.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of my fellow northwest Floridians, brave airmen who serve at Eglin Air Force Base and Duke Field and skilled[[Page H731]]aviators who train out at NAS Pensacola and Whiting Field and some of the planet Earth's most hardened and successful warriors in the 7th Special Forces Group and those who also deploy out of Hurlburt Field in northwest They are the best among us and they often inspire the best within us as a consequence of their patriotic service.  So when I encounter them at townhall meetings or in church or at grocery stores, I often ask: How do you do it? How do you leave your family, your home, your community, risk your life, your health to go to places that many Americans couldn't point to on a map and to fight against an enemy who is evil and vicious and determined and increasingly equipped?  And almost to a man and woman, they tell me: We fight them over there so that we don't have to feel the consequences over here in  It is that spirit that I join in supporting and honoring in my full-throated and unequivocal support of President Trump's most recent executive order so that we are not devaluing the service of my constituents by risking the lives and the health and security of Americans here in this great country.  Mr.Speaker, I wish so much that President Trump's executive order were unnecessary. I wish that we lived in a world that was more stable and secure, where America could welcome with open arms anyone from anywhere for whatever reason at whatever cost. But the reality is that American taxpayers can't pay for everything, and American families cannot shoulder the risks of insecurity for the consequences of terrible foreign policy decisions that have been made over the last 8 years.  Maybe if the former President hadn't withdrawn from the Middle East, these regions would be more secure. Maybe if our policies hadn't so destabilized north Africa that we had failed state after failed state functioning as a caldron of Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism, this order would not have been necessary. But, alas, it is necessary.  I think it is important to distinguish between the realities of this executive order and the hysteria that has been created by the media. Some would believe, if they were to look only at media reports, that this was a ban on all Muslims who would seek to come to this country.  Let me affirm: our war, our conflict is not with the Muslim faith. As a matter of fact, this consequence, this conflict we are engaged in is all about the future of that faith and religion, and I am hopeful as a Christian that we are able to forge a lasting peace among all people on The reality is that there are more than 50 countries that are majority Muslim, and most of those countries will see no impact as a consequence of this most recent executive order. But there are seven countries--I guess it is perhaps a bit generous to call them countries, Mr.Speaker, because they are failed states that function to do very little other than to breed more terror and discontent and anti-But from those seven countries, the President has taken the position that we ought to take a closer look, we ought to have a belt-and-suspenders approach to the security of American families. Of the more than 325,000 people who have recently come to the United States from foreign countries since the President's most recent executive order, about 100 have been kept for additional screening, more thorough review, and a more thoughtful approach.  So as I stand here with the gentleman from Texas, Mr.Speaker, know that I am in full support of President Trump's most recent order. When I go back to northwest Florida and I look into the eyes of the warfighters, the airmen, the sailors, and the patriots, I will know that in this House there were those who were willing to stand with them, honor their service and sacrifice, and do everything possible to put America first and to keep Americans safe.

I guess the difference with President Trump is that he is willing to take action immediately, and that we are not going to have a Presidency with a bunch of handwringing and bedwetting over the questions that impact the safety of Americans and the dignity of this country and its borders.  President Obama was unwilling to heed the counsel of those in his own administration who indicated that there were insufficient vetting procedures in place previously.

Not long ago, we heard members of the Congressional Black Caucus take to this floor and make the argument that it was hypocritical and improper that in President Trump's order and in the follow-on execution of that order by the Department of Homeland Security that there would be some preference given to religious minorities in these predominantly Muslim countries, particularly Christians, who are often persecuted, harmed, or killed. In many circumstances in which the President has allowed for through exceptions to his order, there will be people from these seven countries allowed into the United States as a consequence of the persecution that they feel and that they endure as a consequence of their Christian faith.  And so my question to the gentleman from Texas is whether or not he shares the Congressional Black Caucus' view that it is improper to treat Christians who are being discriminated against in these predominantly Muslim countries differently and to give them the opportunity to immigrate to the United States of America and realize freedom in the absence of this terrible persecution that they feel?

1605,topic-id,3755,"Madam Speaker, today is Tuesday, January 31. It has been 11 days since the inauguration of our new President; and, oh my goodness, has it been an extraordinary 11 days. I just hardly know where to begin.  Normally I come up here, and we talk about how we can grow the American economy, how we can provide jobs, how we can see a return of our manufacturing industries, but I am compelled today to pick up comments on the last 11 days.  I was at a dinner out in California on Friday evening, and a wide variety of people from multiple interest groups were there: some labor unions, some farmers, senior citizens, healthcare folks, teachers. There was an overwhelming sense of concern--deep concern--about the direction this country is going. Some of these friends of mine were Republicans and others were Democrats; some liberal, some conservative.  But to a person, they came up to me and said: Oh, my God, what is happening in Washington? Where is this going? What is he doing? What does it mean to us?  And some of them said: Will they really actually terminate the Affordable Care Act? Is ObamaCare really going to end? What about my insurance policy; will I lose it? I am on Medi-What will happen to me?  And teachers saying: How does this fit with the effort to improve our schools?  And some that had been in the military looked at some of what was going on and said: But veterans' care, this hiring freeze affects the Department of Veterans What does it mean to me? What is happening in Washington?  Some others were concerned about, well, there is going to be this transportation bill, infrastructure bill. How are they going to fund it? Is it really going to happen?  I have been to many events in my years in public office, but I have never been to an event in which there was this overwhelming concern about what's going to happen in  I have seen changes occur. Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan, there was concern, but not the kind of angst, deep emotional concern about where this country is going. I have seen George H.Bush to Bill Clinton, and I am sure there were many Republicans concerned about where Bill Clinton would go, and then Clinton to George Bush, and then to Obama, but nothing like this.  It is not just last Friday night. Today, in front of my office in Davis, California, 200 people showed up to say: You have got to do something. You have got to make it clear that we can't have these shutting down our borders. You can't let them do that. Davis, California, the University of California, there are 5,000 foreign students and teachers on that campus. There are more than 200 from the countries that are affected by the immigration and by the ban on people coming in from those seven countries. What does it mean, they asked me? And what about the Affordable Care Act?  All across this Nation people are demonstrating. It is now 20 minutes to 7 here in Washington, D.C., and I suppose at 8 tonight the President is supposed to give a nationwide address on his next Supreme Court nominee. I am quite certain that tomorrow morning there will be another eruption of concern by Americans as to what does it mean if the Supreme Court throws out the role of the Federal Government in protecting voter rights? What does it mean if the Federal Government isn't there to assure that a woman's body is her own?  All across this Nation people are going: Oh, what is happening?  Executive order after executive order, starting with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and instructions to every agency of the Federal Government to stop it, see that it doesn't work. And here in Congress, a budget resolution that calls for the elimination of the financial support for the Affordable Care Act which, if you remove the money, what happens to the subsidies, the tax subsidies that people are able to use to be able to afford healthcare insurance, the additional money that goes to the States for their Medicaid programs?  And, oh, what about the seniors? If that budget resolution actually goes through, the money that is in the Affordable Care Act to provide the seniors the opportunity to have their drug benefit costs reduced, affecting millions of American seniors, the money is gone. Will the drug benefit be gone also? Most assuredly it would unless, of course, you want to just increase the deficit.  And about that free annual visit that is available to seniors that has clearly extended the life of thousands or tens of thousands of seniors because they find out they have high blood pressure. They can take a cheap pill, get that blood pressure down and not have a stroke. Or maybe diabetes, the onset of diabetes. That free annual benefit checkup, will it still be available if the budget resolution and if Mr.Trump's attack on the Affordable Care Act actually happens?  People are worried. People are frightened. And they should be. They should be. Because this goes to the very ability of Americans to carry on their tasks, protections that are necessary to protect Americans from fraud. The House of Representatives today voted to pass a rule that would lead to the elimination of protections that Americans have in their financial services. I don't know how we repeal the Affordable Care  And how are we going to protect America by building a wall? What is it going to cost? 15, 20, 30 billion dollars?  Most people who look at the immigration issue rationally would say it is not going to solve the problem. And besides that, the problem is dramatically reduced as a result of the Mexican economy growing and jobs being available there as a result of the enormous build-up that has already occurred with the Border Patrol and the immigration service. We have seen a dramatic reduction.  I was told today by some people that work in this field in California that the people who are coming into the United States illegally are mothers and children from Central America who are seeking refuge from the horrible gangs and violence in Central They are not sneaking over the border. They are presenting themselves at the border as refugees. We will come back to the refugee issue in a few moments.                              {time}  1845  How proud he looks, signing yet another executive order, this one on a wall. We are going to build a wall, 1,400 miles of wall between the United States and So with a look of pride, he wants to spend anywhere[[Page H809]]from $15 billion to $30 billion. So tell me what you could do with $15 billion. That is the minimum cost of the wall. Most people say it is probably closer to $30 billion.  What could you do with $15 billion? Well, I suppose you can build part of a wall, or you could start to build a wall. You are certainly not going to finish it. But let's just say you have got $15 billion and that is your down payment on a wall that most everybody says wouldn't work. That is not a joke. If you build a 50-foot-high wall, someone will get a 51-foot-tall ladder.  I am familiar with the universities in California State University has 460,000 students. So for $15 billion, you could fund the entire California State University system, provide tuition-free education for 3 years for 460,000 students, and pay all the faculty and the janitors and all the others. That is for $15 billion.  Now, if it is a $30 billion wall, then it is 6 years. So a junior in high school, for $30 billion, could go free, tuition free, all expenses paid. Every professor, every janitor, fully paid for 6 years--460,000 students and thousands upon thousands of professors, teachers, janitors, et cetera.  Or you could replace every pipe in Flint, Michigan, 270 times over. Do you want to solve the problem in Flint, Michigan, the lead pipe problem? 270 times for $15 billion, or that is more than 500 times, 540 times.  Or maybe you are concerned about Alzheimer's. And what American family is not concerned about Alzheimer's? If we were to spend that $15 billion on research, we would undoubtedly be able to develop a treatment--and this is what the scientists and doctors and researchers say. And we did increase the funding from around $500 million to just under $1 billion last year. But if you were able to ramp it up and develop that treatment for Alzheimer's, you could delay the onset of Alzheimer's in your family, or mine, by 5 years. And what does that mean? It means about a $220 billion in savings to the American taxpayers because that is money that will be spent for Medicare and  Or maybe you are just interested in national defense. Do you like submarines, the new Virginia class submarine? Well, let's see. We could build five of them. Or maybe you like aircraft carriers. For $15 billion, you could build one of the new aircraft carriers and an additional submarine.  So President Trump, what is our choice? You don't like these choices, and you want to build a wall that nobody believes will do much good dealing with illegal immigration?  Oh, I like this next one; 27,777 4-year, full-ride scholarships for an undergraduate program at the University of That is about the total undergraduate population at the University of California, Davis, which I have the honor of representing.  But we are going to build a wall. We are going to build a wall. For what purpose? 435 of us here and 100 Senators and one President have a task of making choices about what America is all about, choices about how we spend your tax money. You want your tax money spent on a wall?  Oh, excuse me. Mexico is going to pay for it. Do you think so?  The President has started a trade war with Mexico, has created a serious diplomatic crisis with our neighbor and our third largest trading partner, over trying to force Mexico to pay for his wall. Oh, that was really smart. But, hey, he's the President and he thinks he can do what he wants to do. Well, the Mexican President said, no, no, it is not going to be paid for by  So who is going to pay for it? I say we have choices. I would much rather us spend our money on education, national defense, Alzheimer's, and on things that actually help Americans in so many different ways. That is just one of the issues that is in play.  Immigration? Oh, we put out a new executive order on immigration, and seven countries around the world cannot have their citizens any longer come to America for some period of time, and refugees from those countries can't come to What are those countries? Well, let me see. Among the seven, I believe there is this country called  Excuse me, Mr.Isn't Iraq our ally in fighting ISIS? I think so. It is their troops plus 6,000 of our troops that are now engaged in a bitter fight to reclaim Mosul, to wipe ISIS out of And so you are going to put a limitation on Iraqi citizens and refugees coming to the United States? I am sorry. I don't understand what sense that makes, Mr.Do you? Do you understand what you just did?  There is a four-star general in Iraq who is responsible for their Special Forces that are leading the fight in Mosul right now. This man's family came to the United States for safety because of the problems that existed there in He cannot visit his family. Unless there is some sort of a waiver that has suddenly been developed for four-star Iraqi generals, he cannot go to Central Command in Tampa, Florida, to work on a strategy for the rest of the fight.  Oh, my What is going on here? What is happening? What sense does any of this make? Foreign policy experts, national security experts, experts on ISIS, on radical Islam all say the same thing. The ban on people traveling from those seven majority Muslim states will have a negative effect on our ability to deal with That is what they say. Not my view, that is the view of security experts all across the spectrum, from the most conservative to the most progressive and liberal and everybody in between. This makes no sense whatsoever, Mr. We sometimes use the word ``half-baked.'' This is not even beginning the process of being baked. This was put together by somebody that didn't know what they were doing. If they had consulted with policy experts outside of that little cabal in the White House, somebody might have said: Time out, time out, time out. Let's think this through. Why Iraq?  What is going to be the second step here? Easy enough, we are going to set the ban. But what does it mean? What does it mean to Muslim countries around the world that suddenly America is seen as shutting the door--or, shall we say, slamming the door--on Muslims? What does it mean here in the United States? It means that we are not safer. It means that our country is not protected, and, in fact, the action taken is counterproductive. That is what it means.  Who did this? Who is the architect of this policy? Was it the State Department? Apparently not. Was it the Justice Department? We know from the midnight firing--well, I guess it was actually 6 o'clock firing--yesterday of the acting Attorney General that it wasn't the Justice They had an opportunity to review and look at the legality of the ban. They didn't involve themselves, and apparently the military didn't involve themselves.  So who was it that dreamed up this ban on men, women, children, refugees coming from seven countries?  None of the residents and refugees from those countries in the last 40 years has been responsible for one terrorist death in the United But those countries from which we know the terrorists came, from 9/11, were not included.  Saudi Arabia, not included in the ban. How is that, if we are worried about this problem of refugees who are citizens from those countries coming into the United States to carry out terrorist acts? Why didn't you look at Saudi Arabia? That is where most of the 9/11 folks came from. Or maybe Chechnya or Congo or  So who wrote it? Who is responsible? Well, two names have emerged. One, a Mr.Miller, and another, a Mr.Bannon, a Mr.Bannon who is the architect of the emergence of the alt-right. We are not talking about the conservative right. We are talking about the far right White nationalist movement in this  Mr.Bannon, who became Mr.Trump's campaign chairman, who is now the key person in the White House, not just on political policy, but on national security policy. He is said to have said, in 2013, that he is a Leninist and his goal is to blow up the system. He says he doesn't remember having said that. Well, I will take him at his word. But I do know that what he did with this ban for these seven countries is to make our Nation less safe. That, we know.  And just to double down on this issue of this superconservative fellow Mr.Bannon and his cohort Mr.Miller, just to make clear where we are headed, there has been a reorganization of the[[Page H810]]National Security These are the men and women that, over the years, have been responsible for making certain that our American policy maximizes our security that deals with international issues of great concern: what to do about China in the South China Sea, what to do about North How do we handle missile defense? How do we deal with Russia in the Ukraine? The National Security  So what happened yesterday? Well, the President, which he has a right to do, reorganized the National Security And two gentlemen, or two people, that have traditionally been on the National Security Council, who seem to know a little bit about national security, were previously in what is called the principles. These are the handful of people that meet with the President, the key national security leaders.                              {time}  1900  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is one of them and the Director of the National Intelligence organization--the two of them.  The President says: I don't need you in my little inner circle. Go away. You can be part of the larger thing, and when I want you, I will call you.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the person responsible for the collection of our national intelligence--push him aside.  Who came in to take the place of the two people--the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence? Guess who? Mr.Is he a national security expert? He spent a few years in the military decades ago, but now he is sitting as one of the principals on our National Security What is his mindset? Read his history. I wouldn't recommend you go to Breitbart--I wouldn't spend a whole lot of time on that--but there is a history here. There is a history, and it is a dangerous history.  This man is now sitting as the principal voice, because he has the President's ear, on the National Security Council--the fellow, together with Mr.Miller, who is responsible for the ban on immigrants, travelers, and refugees from seven countries, which has become a major international, diplomatic crisis. ISIS is already using that ban--it is right here in the newspaper--to recruit in the Middle East, to recruit in Africa, and to encourage homegrown violence and terrorism here in the United  Well done, Mr. Well done, Mr. And very bad for our country.  We are in the midst of executive orders, one after another--often two a day. My final concern is one that comes up 25 days from now. Five days ago, Trump went over to the Pentagon and signed yet another executive order. He came out of the meeting and said: We are going to have a new war plan. We are going to wipe ISIS from the face of the Earth, and the Pentagon will deliver to me in 30 days a war plan to wipe ISIS off the face of the   Go with care. Be slow to war.  We will see what that plan is. My guess is it will cost millions upon millions--if not billions--of dollars. It will put our troops--boots--back on the ground in Iraq and Syria, and we will start the cycle one more time. We will see. We will see what the Pentagon comes up with in a war plan. We have not been told the specific instructions that the Commander in Chief has given to the Pentagon; but I will tell you that this member of the House Armed Services Committee is very concerned. Keep in mind that our effort against ISIS and al Qaeda is based on a 2001 authorization to use military force in Afghanistan against al Qaeda and related entities. It has been stretched.  One of the things that I am quite concerned about coming out of the Obama administration is that that administration stretched the 2001--a 16-year-old--authorization to use force--a declaration of war against al Qaeda--to justify the American military actions in Iraq, Syria, Liberia, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, and  We will see what the war plan is--we will learn soon enough--and I suspect that this Congress will be asked to finance it. We will be asked to pay for the men and women who will be sent into harm's way and for the munitions and the airplanes and the other equipment necessary.  I would hope that all of us take a long, long look at this and that we ask this question: If we do that, then what happens next? We didn't ask that question when we went to war in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002. We didn't ask that question when we invaded Iraq a couple of years later. I am not sure we have asked that question as we reengage ourselves in the current Iraqi war and Syria; but we should always ask: What is the result of our action? What is likely to happen?  We have choices. We have choices to build a wall or to educate our children or to care for our seniors. We have choices about war or not. We have choices about how we deal with people around this world, choices about what we do with refugees--people who are fleeing persecution, fleeing death--who are doing the very, very best they can to care for their families and children in the most desperate of situations. We have a choice. We can slam the door on them and say ``tough luck,'' or we can do what ought to be the American tradition, and that is to provide comfort, to provide assistance, and to show the good part of  Mr.President, you have given us 10 days of the most disruptive chaos I have ever seen in my many years in public life. You have a choice, too, Mr.You have a choice to take a deep breath, to not try to carry out every one of your campaign promises, most of which I think were ill-founded. You don't have to do it on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. You can take a deep breath, and you can think, together with Mr.Bannon or with Mr.Miller or with, perhaps, somebody outside of your little inner circle.  Mr.President, you might ask other people what is the effect of what you are doing. Think about the second level of effect, and slow it down, and be aware that there are consequences. For every action, there is going to be another reaction. We are already seeing that. I am sure you have seen the millions of Americans in the streets protesting about which you have thus far done. Continue on, and you will see more because Americans are concerned. They are frightened.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Taylor).

The Longmont Chamber of Commerce has been an active      participant in helping all industries succeed and grow.      Annual events, like the ``Unity in the Community'' event,      draw more than 1,000 representatives from business,      government, and nonprofit organizations. In addition,      Longmont has received multiple recognitions for its ability      to problem solve, and make their community a better place to      live for all residents. In 2006, Longmont received the All-     America City Award from the National Civic League, and in      2008, was named as one of the Top 100 Best Places to Live by      Money       The Chamber of Commerce will continue to play a critical      role in the growth and development of Longmont, as the Front      Range sees an increase in population and business endeavors.

886,topic-id,709,"Mr.President, this past Sunday was the 44th anniversary of Roe v. I wish to take a moment to reflect on how far we have come since the Supreme Court decision.  Because of Roe v. Wade, American women for the last 44 years have had the right, the freedom, the privacy to make their own decisions about their own bodies with their doctors and with their families, without the Federal Government barging its way into the conversation and telling them what they can or can't do with their own bodies.  Roe v. Wade was one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in the history of women's rights in this Nation, but it was only a start. In the 44 years since, we have made so much progress with women's health, and much of that progress has to do with what we accomplished in the Affordable Care  Millions of American women now have access to health care coverage that used to be extremely difficult and expensive for a lot of women to get. Millions of American women now have access to affordable preventive health care services, including contraception, birth control, STD screenings, mammograms, breastfeeding support and supplies, and cervical cancer screenings, and since the Affordable Care Act was passed, the number of unwanted pregnancies has gone down, in part, because more women have access to affordable contraception.  There is no doubt that American women have better access to safe and affordable health care because of Roe v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act, but some of my colleagues are committed to turning back the clock on women's health and taking away women's access to this lifesaving care. They are doing everything in their power to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and they are determined to see Roe v. Wade get overturned.  One of President Trump's first Executive orders was so extreme that it would take away funding for any international organizations that even talk about whether a woman might want to terminate a pregnancy. We should never let this happen. If we take away women's access to the health care they need, it would be devastating--even life-threatening--for millions of American women.  This weekend, a massive group of women and men and children joined together in women's marches across the globe. They were there to speak out, to be heard, to protest some of these issues that would deeply affect American families and women in particular. I was so proud to march with them. I was inspired by them--their passion, their determination, and their commitment to never give up.  The women's marches were truly the biggest outpouring of support and activism I have seen in my lifetime and certainly that we have seen in this generation. They were loud and clear statements that we will not let the government dictate to us how we should manage these most personal decisions--when you are going to have a family, how big your family is going to be. Those are decisions that are made by husbands and wives, by spouses all across this country about what their family is going to look like.  I urge all of my colleagues in this Chamber to listen to the millions of Americans, the millions of women who would like to make those decisions themselves, who would like to choose their health care, who would not like to be charged more just because they are women, who would not like to see their health care coverage dropped the minute they become pregnant, who would not like to be told: You have a preexisting condition and we will not cover you. That is what we go back to.  We have to fight for the Affordable Care Act, and we have to make sure the Supreme Court does not overturn Roe v. Listen to your constituents. These marches weren't just in New York; they were in every State across the country. These marches were real, they were powerful, they were determined, and these men and women want to be heard.  Members of Congress, I hope you are listening to them. That is our job, to represent our country. Their voices must be heard. We shall not ignore them.  I yield the floor.

329,topic-id,822,"Mr.Speaker, I am very grateful to Mr.Lance for his great leadership on this issue. And I appreciate the comments of my friend across the aisle, Mr. This did pass by voice vote.  One can't help but wonder: How many times has this played out that we don't know about? How many times has there been a child that tried to dial 911? How many times has a panicked adult dialed 911 not knowing?  And I was in a hotel the other day where you had to dial 7 to get out.  How many times has somebody been killed trying to dial 911?  We don't know. There is no way to know. But we do know that this is the right thing to do. And the only reason this came forward is after the tragic loss of Her death occurred over several minutes. Normally in a town like Marshall, especially in a town like that, the police are going to be there within a minute or two when something goes on this long. It was a beating; it was a stabbing; her daughter was trying to dial.  After Kari had left this world, her daughter was sitting in Hank Hunt's lap. She was crying saying: I did all I could. I kept dialing 911 and it wouldn't go through.  Hank was torn up about it and got to investigating. That is when this was brought to light. When Hank brought it to my attention, we got to investigating. And we do have limits here in We are not supposed to go meddling, according to the 10th Amendment, in State and local affairs; but this is a matter of interstate communications. This is a matter for the This goes across State lines constantly. It is in the public domain across the country.

I also thank the FCC Commissioner Pai, who I understand will soon be the chairman, for all his efforts because he truly participated.  We found out that there is really no cost. If we pass this law such as it is, then the companies that produce these phones would just set the default position so that when someone dials 911, it goes straight to an emergency operator without having to dial a prefix, whether it is 7, 9, 3, whatever. So there is no cost in that. It is just telling them how to do the default.  What about existing lines?  And then we found from people that have installed these multiphone lines that, actually, if somebody calls and says, ``Hey, we need to get our phone system reset so you can dial 911 and it goes straight through,'' everyone that we have talked to that was in that business said, ``Oh, we will come make that switch for free.''  So we knew we had a bill here, we had a law--it goes across party lines, it goes across bicameral lines--we had an opportunity to pass a bill.  I am grateful to Senator Klobuchar in the Senate and all the bipartisan support there. As my friend, Mr.Doyle, pointed out, there is another push. Let's identify exactly where someone is within that multiline system. That will cost money.  There are some that have said: Look, if there is somebody that is making a secret call, they don't want the bad guys figuring out where the call is coming from.  So there are other issues involved here, but we have a bill that will save lives and it is agreeable across the aisle. It passed this manner in the past It will pass this way again today. So I urge not only our friends here in the House, but also my friends in the Senate, please pass this bill that we all agree on, save lives, and then let's have a full and thorough debate on the part that will cost money. We have some mom and pop hotels that say: If you make us buy a new phone system, the one we have won't be able to identify which room is making the call. You make us add to that, we are already in trouble. We are barely getting by. Please don't add more costs to what we are struggling to pay as it is.  Let's have that debate in a separate bill. Go in and pass this noncontroversial one for Kari's sake and for the sake of all of those that would come into the same situation. Let's just pass this bill. Kari, as her father and her daughters have said, will then not have died for nothing. Her loss of life will save lives in the future.  Again, I thank my friend, Mr.What a great American, the way he pursues matters of conscience. I appreciate again my friend across the aisle, Mr. I urge passage of this bill now, today.

727,topic-id,1460,"Mr.Speaker, I am so grateful that Representative Chris Smith is a Member of the United States Congress because of his leadership, because of his enormous heart, and his enormous caring.  It is amazing--those of us who believe in God--the way our lives develop. I was a guy that grew up; I never liked to hug anybody. But when we had three beautiful incredible girls added to my wife's and my life, I became a hugger. Fox has a show named ``Outnumbered,'' but that has been my life for years now.  I know there are so many people that say you are a man and you have no right to speak about this. I guess, when I was a judge, there were those who thought, since I was not a person that had been on both sides of a civil lawsuit or had been a defendant in a case, maybe I should not be able to say anything about or pass sentence. But we have laws, and laws are there to protect people.  I do believe, as our Founders did, in nature's God, that we have a Creator who provided us inalienable rights. But in this world, you have to fight for any inheritance, including your inalienable rights.  It does appear that nature gave a greater percentage of women a nurturing greater sense of loving and caring than most men. That gets changed for some of us when you have a house full of girls.                              {time}  1800  But I could identify with the doctor who had performed, I think he said, over 1,000 abortions, who came before our Judiciary Committee and testified about how it was just a procedure, how it was nothing to him, and how he would go into the uterus.  Of course, the pregnant mom was not dilated and not going to be able to deliver a baby that had begun forming, had a heartbeat. But that is why he would go in with his instrument, feel around with his clamps for something that felt long, and when he found it, he knew that it was either a leg or an arm, and he would grab it and pull it out from the baby's body, and continue till he did that four times, and then reach in and find something that felt bulbous, and he would--he knew the head could not come out in a bulbous form, and so he would crush it and pull out the baby's head. And that was the way he went about beginning the abortion of a child that had begun developing like that.  He never thought a thing about it until his daughter died, and then he became nauseated, and he was never able to do another abortion like that, and it became such a burden that he had done what he had done.  I know from my years on the bench as a judge, I know from my years as an attorney helping people, if something is built on a lie, the chances are that the outcome will not be good for a majority of people. I also know that if someone encourages and perpetuates a lie within some other person's life, they are not that person's friend.  So I would like to quickly reference an article published by WND called ``The Real `Jane Roe' '' and just hit some of the highlights about the real Jane Roe, the woman.  I was talking with my friend, Chris Smith, about Norma He is quite familiar with her, and I believe he said he had talked to her and had come to know her. Being the Christian that Chris Smith is, he cares deeply about people, and that included Norma  But this article says: ``At the age of 21, McCorvey was pregnant with her third child. She had given her other two children up for adoption and McCorvey did not want to say good-bye to her offspring a third time. So she decided to have an illegal abortion, but the Dallas clinic she went to had been recently raided and shut down. So McCorvey made up a story--she had been raped, she told her doctor and two lawyers. She signed an affidavit on condition of anonymity, and the lawsuit began.''  And she told WorldNetDaily: `` `I considered abortion and, because of this, I was put in touch with two attorneys, Sarah Weddington and Linda They had just recently graduated from law school and were interested in challenging the Texas abortion statute.' ''  She says: `` `Plain and simple, I was used.' '' This is Norma `` `I was a nobody to them. They only needed a pregnant woman to use for their case, and that's it. They cared, not about me, but only about legalizing abortion. Even after the case, I was never respected--probably because I was not an ivy-league educated, liberal feminist like they were.' ''  But she goes on and says--well, this was from a New York Times interview: ``McCorvey describes her meeting the two young attorneys. . . .  `` `Sarah Weddington sat right across the table from me at Columbo's pizza parlor, and I didn't know then that she had had an abortion herself. When I told her then how desperately I needed one, she could have told me where to go for it. But she wouldn't because she needed me to be pregnant for her case. I set Sarah Weddington up on a pedestal like a rose petal. But when it came to my turn, well, Sarah saw these cuts on my wrists, my swollen eyes from crying, the miserable person sitting across from her, and she knew she had a patsy. She knew I wouldn't go outside of the realm of her and I was too scared. It was one of the most hideous times of my life.' ''  She says: `` `My experience with pro-abortion leaders is that they are snobs. They claim they care about women and their rights but, in my experience, they care for nothing, not even themselves in a way,' '' McCorvey said.  ``McCorvey said in a 1990 New York Times interview that the rape lie caused her to be `terribly depressed.' ''  `` `I was brought up not to lie and, because of this story, I had to lie all the time. And the depression periods got deeper and longer until the night I cut my wrists.' ''  Well, it is one of the difficulties that attorneys have: when you represent someone and you are sworn to do the best job you can, it should be more than simply about getting the legal result that a lawyer wants. It ought to be about helping the client. You can't always do that.  But it is rather tragic that Jane Roe, Norma McCorvey, now looks back on that as the most hideous time of her life, and that she was taken advantage of by people that didn't care about her. They had an agenda.  I heard someone here on the floor talking about the Women's March and how that was for all women, except the hypocrisy of that march was it was not about all women because there were pro-life women that tried to march. It was about women that think exactly like they do, and nobody else gets to participate.  It is the same kind of mentality that would--when in the majority here in this body say: We want everybody to participate in debate, except we are[[Page H672]]going to have a record-setting number of closed rules so nobody can debate. We don't want your input on We don't care that you support what we do on preexisting conditions and on kids living with their parents.  Heck, some of us said 30 would be a better number than 26. They didn't care. They could pass it without our votes. They didn't want our input.  So then to hear people who treated us like that say we care about open debate, knowing that some of those same people came down here and grabbed microphones and, for the first time we can find in congressional hearing, prevented the majority from starting into session; and then they want to lecture us on openness and kindness and open debate? Really?  Let's go back to the Norma McCorveys of the world. Let's minister to them individually, as my church, as a number of ministries with which I am greatly familiar do. Let's help the real person. Let's help that child so that that little boy or that little girl doesn't have its arms and legs jerked out of the uterus. Let's help that child have a life that will be so full they will never think about slitting their wrists, as Norma McCorvey did. Let's vote for life.

1160,topic-id,1622,"Mr.Speaker, we are off to a fast start this year under the Trump administration. It is difficult, apparently, for some of the press to keep up with how quickly some of the things are going.  I did want to make clear something that has been completely muddled by the mainstream media. They keep wondering why they continue to lose out to news channels like FOX News and why some of the conservative news sources online do so well compared to the leftwing sources. It is because a majority of people really are seeking truth, really are seeking answers.  I realize that is not true for everywhere. The areas that Hillary Clinton won are basically relegated to the edges, the fringes of the country: around the coasts and southern valley, Chicago, Detroit, and some of those areas. It is really the fringe party.  After someone--anyone with the least amount of even a small modicum of fairness--looks at the actual executive order that Donald Trump issued, it seems eminently reasonable. When looking at it, for example, compared to orders signed by a President named Obama, a President named Carter--I couldn't find any CNN, MSNBC, or anything like CNBC, and I could have missed that somebody did break through all the misrepresentations of those networks and actually point out,[[Page H730]]because sometimes I am going by and I don't have the sound on and I will be reading the subtext, but you would think that someone in one of those networks would make a big deal out of the fact that Muslims were not banned under the Trump executive order. Yet people all over the world and all over this country are still under the mistaken impression they can trust certain networks. They still haven't figured out that they can't.  They see that, my gosh, the President has banned I actually have the executive order here because, just as I read ObamaCare before I voted against it, I have read the President's executive order. I made highlights in bold on some things. I saw that there is no reference--not one--to Muslims, to It is just not there. So it is a total misrepresentation.  Now, to try to cover for the way the executive order news is being spun, some of them, to try to grasp back just a small portion of something resembling fairness, would say the words ``Muslim-majority country banned,'' try to bring it back so they can work in the word ``Muslim'' when it wasn't about religion at all. It is about the safety of the United States, the people we are sworn to protect, the Constitution that we raise our right hand and we swear to protect. We just took that oath earlier this month, and already it is forgotten.  The refugee program that President Trump has paused is the same one that ISIS terrorists have repeatedly vowed that they are infiltrating, and they are intending to use it to kill The President is acting temporarily and prudently to give his administration and this Congress the time it needs to properly evaluate the refugee program and reform it to ensure that we help legitimate refugees and ensure the safety, as much as is possible, of the American people.  When an FBI Director warns that they have no information from a country with which to compare identity information that refugees have or present or even orally convey, then I would think at some point we would take that information seriously from the sworn testimony.  Now, I realize that the past administration has played fast and loose when you keep telling the American people and the Members of Congress that the attack in Benghazi was all about a video, and you even try to cover that by encouraging the producer of the video to be arrested and put in jail to help with this misrepresentation of the truth. Then I guess, under those circumstances, you don't take testimony from the prior administration Cabinet members all that seriously because you know that they have been out there and misrepresented the truth before.  I don't know if Klein's book about, I think it was, the blood feud between the Obamas and the Clintons was right, but there had to be a reason that Hillary Clinton did not come out on the Sunday shows after Benghazi and make this claim that was adverse to what she emailed her daughter and what she emailed to the President of Libya, saying that it was an attack. She didn't mention a video because it wasn't about a video. She knew that. I realize that, between the concussion, the problems, she may not remember that, but she knew it at the time.  According to that book, she called and talked to former President Bill Clinton; and she was encouraged not to go public and say it was about a video, that, in essence, that was indefensible. Nobody in their right mind was going to believe that, so she couldn't be out there.  There were thoughts being entertained of maybe resigning rather than going out and trying to defend that story, but, gee, they realized that if she was going to run for President in 2016 and she resigned right before the election in 2012, it would have likely cost President Obama a second term, and then Democrats would not be very kind and forgiving even though that would have been a stance based on truth and honor. If it cost the Presidency in 2016, it was just not something that could be done.                              {time}  2030  Apparently, according to the book and his sources that he says are close friends of the people involved, they decided the best way was not to resign and cost the President the reelection in 2012, but refuse under all circumstances to go on the Sunday shows and try to tell America six times that the attack at Benghazi was not planned; it was just instantaneous that arose from a protest over the video, but just don't go make that representation. Make that clear to the administration you are not going to do that, and then let the chips fall where they may. Because we haven't been able to figure out outside that representation in the book, why in the world did Susan Rice come out and say all that?  That should have been Hillary Clinton's role. So he provides the excuse or the reasoning. So Susan Rice goes out and over and over on Sunday shows, it was all about a video.  Well, I know from my days as a judge hearing of incidents where someone perhaps in a company that was not being honestly run would keep somebody in the dark so they could go out and make certain representations. The person really didn't want to know what the real truth was so they could come out and say with a clear conscience, here is what happened, and that wasn't it. So it may well be Susan Rice just did not know that her statements were lies. And if she didn't know, then they are not lies; they are just falsehoods she didn't know were false.  We don't know, but it is an interesting representation. And it still brings us back to the fact that in certain countries in the world, we don't have adequate information to check individuals coming in against. No matter how much the credibility of the FBI Director may have been harmed last summer when he came out and made a totally political move of outlining that Hillary Clinton basically committed a crime, but no reasonable prosecutor would pursue this, that is my interpretation of what he said basically, and those who have prosecuted--I have prosecuted. You know, there are a lot of prosecutors who would take that. But he made the statement. So I figured that was pretty political.  Despite that, when he says, you know, look, we had some information from some of these countries we got from their governments so that when we see their passport, we see some of this information, we could say, all right, we can check it against their government's records: What do you have on this person?  But we had heard from Syria, for example, that they had actually taken over facilities that could print official passports. So they could print a totally fictitious passport because they have the means to do it. They have captured that. Not only do we not have a cooperating government, but we have no information. We don't have fingerprints off IEDs like we did from Iraq, and most of the time we had cooperation so we could compare this information. But we had nothing in some of these countries that could give us the assurance that the leaders of radical Islamist groups were not doing exactly what they said they were, and that is infiltrating the refugees with people who were going to come in and kill They said they were doing that in At some point we need to take these things seriously.  I am thrilled to death to have a President--fortunately it is nice being thrilled to death instead of being beaten or knifed or hit with a truck. But I am thrilled to have a President who is taking seriously the things that the Obama administration found should be taken seriously. Let's be clear, no one is being discriminated against in the President's executive order based on religion. Christians, Jews, Muslims, any religious group, agnostics, atheists from the countries designated for a pause--it is not a ban; it is a pause so we can look better at what we need to do.  I am thrilled to be joined by one of our sharpest new freshmen.  ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgH729.txt,1801,MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS ALLOWABLE USE ACT,2017.0,30.0,January
1162,topic-id,258,"Mr.Speaker, as I told my friend from Florida, I am honored anytime he comes to the floor to speak because he knows what he is talking about. When I was a judge back in Texas, a young prosecutor also shared his first name, and he is now the He is as sincere and intelligent. Anyway, it is just an honor to serve with Mr.I wondered if he might yield for a question.  The Attorney General--I am sorry, this is the acting Attorney General because the Senate is dragging its feet on one of its own, Jeff Sessions, but this came out today in The Hill that ``Acting Attorney General Sally Yates sent a letter Monday ordering the Justice Department not to defend President Trump's executive order . . .'' even though it is an order that basically has been done by the Obama administration--except President Obama had done it one country that is included in the seven for 6 months instead of 3--and also by President I don't think he was a Anyway, these things have been done before, and the letter says we are not going to defend it.  This story from Lydia Wheeler today says: ``Yates's''--the acting Attorney General--``decision suggests she does not want to put the credibility of the Justice Department behind the order. . . .''  I wanted to ask the gentleman from Florida, does he have concerns that, if the Justice Department were to defend this executive order, it would hurt the credibility of the Justice Department when acting under its Democratic leadership?

1164,topic-id,432,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Great points. And I wish I were as articulate.  I have been critical of the majority leader in the Senate, Senator McConnell, but this story is from CNS Majority Leader McConnell says: ``Well, I think it's a good idea to tighten the vetting process.''  And he went on to say: ``I don't want to criticize them''--the Trump administration--``for improving vetting.''  And I applaud the majority leader for not running for the hills when all of the media does their typical thing and just goes freaking out. But, we found this story goes also, I think, to illustrate the point Mr.Gaetz was making. This is from Daniel Horowitz's article today. It turns out that 17 sitting Democrats in the House and Senate voted to ban visas from some Muslim countries and that law still exists today. Of course, this was back in 2002. And back at that time, you had some quite conservative Democrats in the House and Senate, people like Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Dianne Feinstein, you know, real bulwarks of conservatism, who voted to ban visas from these type countries, of the Muslim majority countries, as CNN would like to call them. Gee, names like Cardin, Markey, Menendez, Murray, Nelson of Florida, Reed of Rhode Island, Sanders of Wow, there is another conservative, Sanders of Schumer, another strong hearted conservative. Stabenow, Wyden, Durbin, Feinstein, Leahy, and  So it kind of begs the question: If this is only a temporary ban from countries until we can ascertain better vetting, how much worse is it for these 73 sitting Democrats to have voted for a permanent ban? That is rather shocking.  And it is notable that President Obama, not exactly consistent with former President George Bush who went 8 years without coming out and making formal criticisms--well, President Obama has said he is very heartened by all of the anti-Trump protests. We even have Democrats here in the House who said: `` . . . as we've heard before, the President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.'' Because I know my friend here in the House would not misrepresent the truth. So it just shows, obviously, he hasn't read this executive order that makes very clear it is not banning a religion or a faith, it is countries where we don't have enough information.  And I just find it interesting that we are standing on the side of 73 Democrats--Markey, Bernie Sanders, Feinstein, people like that--who thought it was a good idea when they were closer to 9/11.

1167,topic-id,972,"Mr.Speaker, my friend makes such a great point. I think the way this country has, in recent years, been so discriminatory as has been the United Nations against Christian refugees, I am afraid that this United States of America could be called to account for the slaughter of so many Christians who we could have helped. And as we know from the numbers, there are a lot of excuses by the U.as to why they are not helping an equal percentage of Christians to the percentage of makeup of those countries they are coming from. There have been all kinds of excuses.  But even our Secretary of State, under the last administration, John Kerry, admitted there was a genocide going on of Christians in the Middle Now, there is not a genocide going on of Muslims in these countries. There are Sunni versus Shia and vice versa, and there are clashes within the Islamic religion, but there is not a genocide of all Muslims in any of these countries. And yet there is clearly a genocide clear enough for John Kerry to note.  So one of the most heinous and outrageous answers that I have heard a U.general secretary make was--well, I didn't hear it, I read--that the U.general secretary was asked about a year and a half or so ago, when he was in charge of the United Nations' refugee program, and this issue of the U.not helping the same percentage, in fact, just helping a fraction of the percentage of Christians who exist in these countries, his response was basically that it was important to leave these Christians in the areas where they are being killed because they have historical precedence in those areas.  So we are going to bring Muslims out, according to the U.general secretary, because they didn't have as much historical significance, whereas the Christians who are being wiped out--throats cut, heads cut off, crucified, women raped, and just the most heinous of crimes committed against individuals are taking place--our U.general secretary and, apparently under our past President, the State Department felt like it was important to leave Christians there in larger percentages than existed among the refugees of Muslim because, hey, they have been there a long while, so let's leave them there, which ultimately means they will all be slaughtered. It is quite distressing.  But here is a point made by George Rasley today in an article, ``President Trump Stops Suicidal Immigration Policy . . . ,'' where he points out that:  ``Had President Trump's policy been in place participants in many Muslim terrorist incidents would have been prevented from entering our country, for example the Ohio State University attack by Somali `refugee' Abdul Razak Ali Artan, the September 2016 stabbing attack in a mall in Cloud, Minnesota, and two foiled bomb plots--one in Portland, Oregon, in 2010 and one in Columbus, Ohio, in 2000.  ``Indeed, some 74 terrorist incidents have been attributed to Somali Muslims alone. And while the Obama administration did its best to cover-up the immigration status of the perpetrators we know that at least 13 of them were admitted to the U.as `refugees.'  ``Fourteen were legal permanent residents at the time of their radical activity, and 10 were naturalized citizens.''  So it is quite disturbing.  And by the way, as a result of the Kentucky case where we had two refugees who had been brought in from Iraq, it was reported, in 2013, that in 2009, two al Qaeda Iraq terrorists were living as refugees in Bowling Green, Anyway, because of that discovery, the Obama State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for 6 months in 2011.  So I do think it is important, as people keep screaming around here, what I believe as a Christian, Jesus said: The greatest commandment is to love God, and the second, he said, is to love each other. But he had also stated: Love thy neighbor as thy self.  And what some have not realized, if you don't like America, if you don't[[Page H733]]like Americans, if you don't like our own country, and you don't love yourself, it is a bit hard to love your neighbor as yourself if you don't love yourself.  I think it is time Americans stood up and thanked God for--and/or thank whatever force they may be, some would say, or agnostic, whatever--just thank your lucky stars, but be thankful we have had the opportunities to live in the greatest country in the history of the world. And the only one who has truly given lives and treasure, not for imperialist sake but simply for freedom sake, for liberty sake, for people we didn't know, but we wanted them to share in freedom and liberty. That is a rare country. It has been a blessed and blessed country.  And I think it is important that if we are going to continue or get back to being that city on a hill, glowing that draws people to it, that would draw people to the Statue of Liberty, you have to be a nation of laws, you have to protect the people in the country, otherwise we go back to the Dark Ages, and we become a country that no one wants to come risk their lives to get to because there is nothing special.                              {time}  2100  We squandered our opportunities and refused to take up our responsibilities to protect this Nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1600,topic-id,4482,"Madam Speaker, I might say it is great seeing you in the chair. You are a natural fit. Maybe we can do something about that at some point.  It is an honor to speak in this hallowed There has been much ado made about contrived misrepresentations about what has gone on with President Trump's executive order regarding seven countries that the Obama administration designated as being problems when it comes to refugees coming from those countries.  It has been absolutely incredible. And I think some of us were talking that it really exemplifies why networks like CNN--that was the one, the only 24-hour cable news network--have lost so much to other networks. MSNBC, CNBC, and even Fox News got caught up in some of the misrepresentations, and I couldn't believe that they were spending the kind of time talking about a contrived issue.  Now, there was a problem in some innocent people being delayed and improperly handled, people who didn't deserve that. I am familiar with how that feels because I deal, like most of us do in this body, with TSA on virtually a weekly or even sometimes more often basis.  There is a great article here by John Hayward from January 29. Mr.Hayward says:  ``The sober and logical reasons for President Donald Trump's executive order on refugees and visitors are rising above the noise after an evening of hysterical over-reactions and emotional meltdowns on the Nation's TV networks.  ``Advocates of sane, secure immigration policy have long noted that it's almost impossible to have a reasonable discussion of the refugee and immigration issues, because it's been sentimentalized and politicized beyond the realm of rational thought.  ``This weekend brings them another superb example of media-magnified shrieking about fascism, bleating about `white nationalists,' howling about `religious persecution,' false invocations of the Constitution, and theatrical sobbing on behalf of the Statue of Liberty.''  We do have that water coming off the Statute of Liberty being analyzed, so that we can determine whether or not it is tears or something else.  ``For readers who want to wallow in the emotion, examples can be found in this handy dossier of hysteria compiled by the Washington But clear-eyed adults prefer to examine plain facts about Trump's executive order:  ``1. It is NOT a `Muslim ban.' ''  I have the executive order here. Unlike those in the Senate and those in the media, who were just excoriating President Trump and anyone involved in this executive order, I actually read it, unlike those people. I read the executive order.                              {time}  1745  And because I read the executive order, I understood there was no ban against Muslims, no ban against It was very straightforward. And Hayward's article points that out.  He said: ``You will search the executive order in vain for mentions of Islam, or any other religion. By Sunday morning, the media began suffering acute attacks of honesty and writing headlines such as `Trump's Latest Executive Order: Banning People From 7 Countries and More.''  And that was from And, Madam Speaker, I am very pleased that CNN finally got around to having a more truthful headline.  ``Granted, CNN still slips in the phrase `Muslim-majority countries' into every article about the order, including the post in which they reprinted its text in full, but CNN used the word `Muslim,' not The order applies to all citizens of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and It does not specify The indefinite hold on Syrian refugees[[Page H804]]will affect Christians and Muslims alike,'' not to mention people of every other religion and people of no religion.  ``As Tim Carney at the Washington Examiner points out, the largest Muslim-majority countries in the world are not named in the Executive  ``More countries may be added to the moratorium in the days to come, as the Secretary of Homeland Security has been instructed to complete a 30-day review of nations that don't provide adequate information for vetting applicants.  ``It is also noteworthy that the ban is not absolute. Exceptions for `foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3 and G-4 visas' are expressly made in the order. The Departments of State and Homeland Security can also grant exceptions on a `case-by-case basis' ''--that is all in the executive order--``and `when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.'  ``There is a provision in the Executive Order that says applications based on religious persecution will be prioritized `provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.' ''  And so it is important to note here, I think from the executive order, that it says applications based on religious persecution. That means that people that have applied for visas or immigration benefits to come into the United States who, themselves, raise their religion as a reason to let them into the United States, those need to be prioritized based on whether or not their religion is actually being persecuted, those holding those religious beliefs are actually being persecuted. And I think that is a rather intelligent way to approach things.  But in those cases, it would be the applicant that would raise the issue of religion, not the Trump administration, not the State Department, not Homeland It would be the foreign applicant trying to come into the United States who would be the one to raise that issue.  Now, the article goes on: ``This has been denounced as a `stealth Muslim ban' by some of the very same people who were conspicuously silent when the Obama administration pushed Christians--who are the most savagely persecuted minority in the Middle East, with only the Yazidis offering real competition--to the back of the migration line.''  So it is important to note that, for years, this administration has been part of the discrimination and persecution against Christians in the world against whom there has been a genocide in progress.  So when the head of the U.was in charge of the refugee program and was asked why is there not a similar percentage of Christians coming in as refugees to other countries to the percentage that Christians make up in that nation they come from, basically, the man who is now head of United Nations said, well, it is important to leave them where they have this historical presence, basically.  So in other words, yes, there is a genocide going on. They want to kill off every Christian in those areas, every Christian in the Middle East, and so the U.now Secretary General says let's leave them in the area where they are being wiped off the map, brutally killed. Let's leave them there until we can say this place where they were historically has now shown there are none there. They have all been brutally murdered as the U.watched and didn't help. It is outrageous how uncivilized this United Nations has become.  I filed a bill, and I still think we should bring it to the floor, that would require a complete defunding by the United States of the United Nations until such time as they withdraw the resolution of the Security Council that condemned  I mean, it is like a teacher of mine in the fifth grade after I got beat up by a bully who had been held back two grades, was about 18 inches taller. She pointed to the class and said: This is what happens when little boys try to play with the big boys.  Well, that is basically what the Obama administration had been doing. It is basically what the U.had been doing. They took the side of the mean bullies that had been devastating the Christians in the area.  Having talked to so many Christians who were living in Syria and who the mainstream press say, oh, yeah, they are big Assad fans--no, they were not big Assad fans. They knew that he could be quite brutal, but their only point that the mainstream media in the United States and most of the world was missing is that Assad prevented Christians from being the victims of a genocide; and as Assad was weakened, the assaults and the murders and the rapes of Christians increased exponentially.  I do think that the United States may still be held to account in the ledger of world history--what I would submit is God's ledger--for having the power and the moral right to stop a genocide of Christians in the Middle East and we participated in leaving them where they were, as did the U.N., so that they could be brutally murdered.  I am going back to Mr.Hayward's article.  ``2. The order''--talking about the executive order of Donald ``The order is based on security reviews conducted by President Barack Obama's deputies.''  And, Madam Speaker, for those in the mainstream media, I think it is important to repeat that line. President Trump's executive order that didn't ban Muslims but that ordered a temporary pause on people from certain countries from whom we had no information or inadequate information to vet the people that were coming in, it was based on security reviews conducted by President Barack Obama's deputies.  ``As White House counselor Kellyanne Conway pointed out on `Fox News Sunday,' the seven nations named in Trump's executive order are drawn from the Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015. The 2015 `Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015' named Iraq, Iran, Sudan, and Syria, while its 2016 update added Libya, Somalia, and  `` `These are countries that have a history of training, harboring, exporting terrorists. We can't keep pretending and look the other way,' said  ``3. The moratorium is largely temporary. Citizens of the seven countries''--and by the way, in this executive order that President Trump signed, there is no mention of the countries. It refers to what President Obama signed declaring, first, the four countries, and then the three countries.  It just refers to that that President Obama signed. He doesn't single out or name the countries; and I can't help but think, as intelligent as some of the people are that are assisting President Trump, that they showed a massive amount of naivete because it appears that they thought, if in the executive order President Trump refers to documents that President Obama signed designating these countries as countries where we didn't have adequate information, then even the mainstream media would have to go back to President Trump's and look above his signature and see that these are places that President Obama said were threats.  And then they would--having some semblance of a conscience--have to point out that actually Trump is just putting in an executive order of what basically Obama signed off on but didn't go ahead and carry out what needed to be done based on that law.  But, as I say, these folks were rather naive. And as the saying goes in Washington, no matter how cynical you get, it is never enough to catch up in this town. And so the Trump administration, the Trump advisers have a lot of growing to do to understand just how unfair the media can be. It is a valid presumption that if you don't name the countries, you make the mainstream media go back and look at what President Obama signed that they will understand, oh, this is what President Obama proclaimed that he is basing this on, so we can't be so mean to President  Well, it didn't turn out that way, and they are learning that just because it would make great sense, be common sense in most areas of the country--that is areas that are not the fringe[[Page H805]]that voted for Hillary Clinton, but most of the country would say it is common sense. It isn't common within the original 10-by-10 mile boundaries of the District of Columbia, which are no longer 10 by 10 after ceding the land west of the Potomac to Virginia back in the 1840s.  But number four in this Hayward article: ``Obama banned immigration from Iraq, and Carter banned it from  `` `Fact-checking' website PolitiFact twists itself into knots to avoid giving a `true' rating to the absolutely true fact that Jimmy Carter banned Iranian immigration in 1980, unless applicants could prove they were enemies of the Khomenei theocracy.  ``One of PolitiFact's phony talking points states that Carter `acted against Iranian nationals, not an entire religion.' As noted above, Trump's Executive Order is precisely the same--it does not act against an `entire religion,' it names seven countries.''  But, you know, I had some personal experience with I used the word earlier today, ``hack,'' ``political hack,'' in an interview, and that is what I think of They shouldn't be called They ought to be called ``PolitiHack.''                              {time}  1800  I know I was speaking here on the House floor--I think it was last year--and I made a statement based on data received by the Senate on the percentage of American citizens and the percentage of noncitizens--non-American citizens--who were in Federal prison for possession of a controlled substance. The reason I singled out possession was because President Obama has tried to make it appear that people in Federal prison have gotten such a bad rap because they really--just simple possession--they didn't deserve to be in prison so long. There is this whole intimation that, gee, there are people in Federal prison for possession of controlled substances who should have been let out a long time ago, and that is why we needed to have our laws changed.  Well, since the President had mentioned people in Federal prison for possession, I singularly pointed out that the huge majority of people in Federal prison for simple possession were not American citizens. I'm going from my memory, but, apparently, PolitiFact wanted to do as they normally do and cover for the Democrats and try to do a hatchet job on a Republican since they are not political fact, they are political hack. So my communications person gets an email from ``PolitiHack'' that uses the name PolitiFact and wanted to know the source of my information because they were going to rate my statement. She provided the facts as provided by this administration to the  Clearly what I had said was exactly true. I had quoted specifically from the data from the Obama administration, and it was 100 percent accurate. So then they come back--they thought they would catch me in not having proper information, and they come back to my communications person and said: Well, we have got information from the Bureau of Prisons that showed that if you look at all offenses that involved controlled substances, the percentage of noncitizens is not nearly that high. So why would he use just possession?  The point was because President Obama had used simple possession to try to make it look as if people in Federal prison were not there for very serious crimes, and there is certainly a smaller number of people in Federal prison for possession than for dealing drugs and other charges.  So in the end, after all the back and forth, they basically perpetuated a fraud upon the American people, PolitiFact--a bunch of political hacks--by not being willing to say that my statement was 100 percent true because they, in some contorted manner, did not want to point out that my statement was exactly true. They refer basically to, oh, that the number wasn't near that high of people involved in controlled substance. I didn't mention everybody with controlled substance.  So that is just a parenthetical in Hayward's article for me because I know personally PolitiFact is a political joke if what they were doing was not so serious in harming the American people by misrepresenting the true facts of what is going on. I hope that at some point being still remaining an entrepreneurial country for a little longer--at least we have got nearly 4 years to go that we can be assured of as an entrepreneurial country--at least in that time perhaps we will have an entrepreneurial group that will rise up and start scoring PolitiFact to show just how unfair they are, and, on occasion, when they are actually fair, show that as well so the American public can actually score the illegitimate scorers.  But going back to this article, it says: ``As for Barack Obama, he did indeed ban immigration from Iraq, for much longer than Trump's order bans it from the seven listed nations, and none of the people melting down today uttered a peep of protest. Richard Grenell summed it up perfectly in a Tweet: `Obama took 6 months to review screening for 1 country. Trump will take 3 months for 7 countries. . . . ' ''  This article goes on: ``5. Trump's refugee caps are comparable to Obama's pre-2016 practices: David French, who was touted as a spoiler candidate to keep Donald Trump out of the White House during the presidential campaign--in other words, not a big Trump fan--wrote a lengthy and clear-headed analysis of the Executive Order for National He noted that after the moratorium ends in 120 days''--and that is one section. It ends in 120 days, the other section is 90 days, another part says they will have 30 days to produce a report.  But it goes on to say: ``Trump caps refugee admissions at 50,000 per year . . . which is roughly the same as President Obama's admissions in 2011 and 2012, and not far below the 70,000 per year cap in place from 2013 to 2015.  ``Obama had fairly low caps on refugees during the worst years of the Syrian civil war. He didn't throw open the doors to mass refugee admissions until his final year in office. Depending on how Trump's review of Syrian refugee policy turns out, he's doing little more than returning admissions to normal levels after a four-month pause for security reviews.  ``6. The Executive Order is legal: Those invoking the Constitution to attack Trump's order are simply embarrassing themselves. The President has clear statutory authority to take these actions. As noted, his predecessors did so, without much controversy.  ``Most of the legal arguments against Trump's order summarized by USA Today are entirely specious, such as attacking him for `banning an entire religion,' which the order manifestly does not do. Critics of the order have a political opinion that it will in effect `ban Muslims,' but that's not what it says. Designating specific nations as trouble spots and ordering a pause is entirely within the President's authority, and there is ample precedent to prove it.  ``It should be possible to argue with the reasoning behind the order, or argue that it will have negative unintended consequences, without advancing hollow legal arguments. Of course, this is America 2017, so a wave of lawsuits will soon be sloshing through the courts.  ``7. This Executive Order is a security measure, not an arbitrary expression of supposed xenophobia. Conway stressed the need to enhance immigration security from trouble spots in her `Fox News Sunday' interview. French also addressed the subject in his post:  ``When we know our enemy is seeking to strike America and its allies through the refugee population, when we know they've succeeded in Europe, and when the administration has doubts about our ability to adequately vet the refugees we admit into this nation, a pause is again not just prudent but arguably necessary. It is important that we provide sufficient aid and protection to keep refugees safe and healthy in place, but it is not necessary to bring Syrians to the United States to fulfill our vital moral obligations.''  The article goes on. It is well written, points are well made, and I would humbly submit, Madam Speaker, that we had the statistics last year that showed that for the cost of bringing one Syrian refugee to the United States for 1 year, we could help take care of 12 Syrian refugees in place in a safe zone over near their home.[[Page H806]]  Now, I am very encouraged that even though President Obama simply would not ever agree or strive to have a safe zone in areas near the refugees' homes so we can take care of 12 times more than we can possibly bring to our country for the same cost, and he is working on that, and he has got some agreements, and it looks like that may be a possibility. We give air cover, help create safe zones in areas there in the Middle East so the refugees can live without being killed and horribly brutally murdered and abused. That makes more sense. It appears that the President has worked with or talked with the Saudi authorities and perhaps will be able to get something like that worked out.  There were people just quite emotional over the fact that Saudi Arabia was not mentioned and Egypt was not mentioned. Actually, the order did not mention any nations by name. The Trump executive order simply referred to what President Obama signed off on which included seven countries. These are seven countries where it shouldn't even be arguable among people of common sense that we do not have, have not received, and cannot get adequate information from which to determine whether people wanting to come into the United States are actually refugees or if they are part of al Qaeda, al Nusra, and ISIS, and they want to come kill Americans and end our freedoms and our way of life. That is why such an executive order was entirely appropriate.  Although I supported a different candidate for President for over a year, I applaud President Trump in caring so deeply about the American public that he would take the honorable and appropriate steps to protect Americans that the last administration would not take.  A great article in Townhall from Matt Vespa is entitled: ``Friendly Reminder: Obama Selected The List Of Seven Countries in Trump's Executive Order.'' That certainly should be noted yet again.  Another great article here by Seth Frantzman says: ``Obama's Administration Made the `Muslim Ban' Possible and the Media Won't Tell You.'' It is a good article there.  I think this article from John Hayward from January 27 on Breitbart may give us insight as to why there is so much howling by CAIR and CAIR associates because there were implications of people involved with CAIR in the Holy Land Foundation trial.                              {time}  1815  One just merely need to go look at the pleadings. Here in Congress, since Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch went through their entire terms as Attorneys General and continued to refuse to provide the discovery documents in the Holy Land Foundation trial that were provided in pretrial to the convicted terrorist supporters, it is pretty incomprehensible for some of us.  On one occasion, when Attorney General Holder pointed out that, well, there may be some classified issues involved, I pointed out to him--apparently, it went right over his head and he couldn't discern--the fact that the Justice Department gave the documents I am requesting to people that were then convicted of supporting terrorism.  If Justice could give them to the terrorists without concern about being classified, surely they could give them to Members of Although some of us may argue in such ways that it terrifies some people, we are not terrorists and we are authorized to receive classified information. We should have been authorized in Congress to receive the same documents that the Justice Department provided to the terrorist supporters who were convicted.  This article from John Hayward, January 27, points out that:  ``According to Reuters, a `factional' debate is under way within the Trump administration over adding the Muslim Brotherhood to the State Department and Treasury lists of foreign terrorist organizations.  ``This is a measure often called for by critics of the Brotherhood as Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney, who once again recommended an official terrorist designation on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News  ``A source in the Trump transition team told Reuters the effort to so designate the Muslim Brotherhood is led by National Security Adviser Michael The source was personally in agreement with  ``In Congress, a bill to add the Muslim Brotherhood to the official terrorist list was introduced this month by Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson denounced the Muslim Brotherhood as an `agent of radical Islam' during his confirmation hearings, but he has not made public statements regarding adding them to the foreign terrorist organization list.  However, other Trump advisers, and members of the intelligence and law-enforcement communities, argue the Brotherhood has `evolved peacefully in some countries,' Reuters claims.  ``They also expressed the pragmatic concern that going hard on the Muslim Brotherhood could complicate diplomatic relations with nations such as It would unquestionably, however, please such U.allies as Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, although there have been signs the Saudis might be softening on the Brotherhood as they search for allies against ISIS in  ``One official familiar with the State Department's deliberations conceded that the Muslim Brotherhood's ideology has influenced such terrorist groups as Hamas, but since it is a large, loose organization spread over several nations, it could be legally difficult to apply the terrorist designation. Allied nations such as Britain have also expressed suspicions about the Brotherhood's influence, while stopping short of a formal terrorist designation.''  So this is important to note. It is a good article. But I can't help but wonder if the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, may be getting quite concerned about the potential for designating their friends in the Muslim  There may be a mutual relationship there. There may be people that are part of both groups. No doubt, CAIR is getting quite concerned about heightened talk about naming the Muslim Brotherhood as the terrorist organization they are. It is just that they don't use terrorist tactics, as some of them have indicated before, when they are making great progress without terrorism, but knowing that eventually, after they get as far as they can with peaceful methods, they will ultimately be resorting to terrorism to bring the United States and other Western civilizations, countries into the international caliphate, wherein we are ruled by a caliph.  So it is interesting times. Here, tonight, in perhaps an hour and a half or so, our new President will name the nominee to fill the Honorable Antonin Scalia's spot on the Supreme He is still greatly missed. He was a great man. He was a great jurist. He was a great patriot and he was great for America and our freedoms. So we will look forward to hearing that.

Yes, it was part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but it was an area that really didn't have wildlife to speak of. As I understand it, there are some caribou that may walk across there from time to time, but they can't stay because there is not enough to sustain them. But President Carter, as anticarbon energy as he was, realized that is an area that we can agree ought to be drilled for the production of oil and gas, and it has been fought over and over.  Who stands to gain?  Well, actually, the American public. But since so much oil has now been found out in my friend Mike Conaway's district in west Texas, up in the Dakotas, we are not as needful of that as we were. But the people who will really benefit are the people of Alaska, and then additional beneficiaries will be the people of the United States and the people who want to get out from under the iron fist of Russia rising. We will be able to help them with that by not only becoming energy independent; but after energy independent, exporting oil and gas to other nations so they don't feel the pinch that nations like China and Russia are putting on them.

616,topic-id,429,"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her ardent work on this important cause.  However stark Americans' differences of opinion can be on the matter of abortion generally, there has been long, bipartisan agreement that Federal taxpayer funds should not be used to destroy innocent life.  The Hyde amendment, named for its chief sponsor, former House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, has prohibited the Federal funding of abortions since 1976 when it passed the House and Senate that was composed overwhelmingly of Democratic members. It has been renewed each appropriations cycle with few changes for[[Page H636]]over 40 years, supported by Congresses controlled by both parties and Presidents from both parties. It is probably the most bipartisan, pro-life proposal sustained over a longer period of time than any other. It is time the Hyde amendment was codified in the U. H.7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, sponsored by Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey, would do just that. It would codify the two core principles of the Hyde amendment throughout the operations of the Federal Government; namely, a ban on Federal funding for abortions and a ban on the use of Federal funds for health benefits coverage that includes coverage of abortion.  As hundreds of thousands of people from across the country come to Washington to express their love of unborn children at the annual March for Life and as we now have a President who supports this legislation, let's reflect on what could be accomplished if the bill we consider today were signed into law.  During the time the Hyde amendment has been in place, the most reliable estimates--and those of the Congressional Budget Office--are that millions of innocent children and their mothers have been spared the horrors of abortion. Millions of lives have been saved. And of those millions of lives saved, many more have grown up to bear their own children and to raise them in happy, loving families.  This bill is more than a proposed law. It is a celebration of the lives of those millions of Americans--boys and girls, men and women of all races--who give joy and feel love and create and contribute all because of the policies this bill contains. And even more than that, this bill is a welcome sign for millions and millions more Americans to come.  I congratulate the President for already reinstating the Mexico City policy, which prohibits the Federal funding of abortions overseas.

Forty-four years ago this week, before I was even born, the Supreme Court recognized that the government has no business coming between a woman and her doctor when it comes to making personal medical decisions. Yet now, decades later, many in Washington seem determined to turn back the clock on progress on women's health and women's rights.  The new administration recently instituted a rule that would limit the ability of women around the world to access accurate information about their bodies and make their own medical decisions. And now the House is considering a radical bill that would not only undermine a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions, but also her ability to even choose her own health insurance plan. On top of that, the bill would actually raise taxes on small businesses who provide their employees with access to comprehensive health coverage and impose unfair burdens on the women of the United States military. These are the facts.  I will always fight back against efforts to limit choice in women's health, and that is why I strongly oppose this bill. This past weekend we saw millions of women around the country and around the world, including hundreds in my own hometown of Wyckoff, New Jersey, where I was, rally against these backward and dangerous policies.

We also heard that many older Americans don't report instances of elder abuse or exploitation due toembarrassment, a refusal to acknowledge that they were victimized, or reliance on the perpetrator as their caretaker.  Sadly,these accounts of elder abuse are nothing new. What has changed is that the scams targeting seniors are becoming increasinglysophisticated. That is one of the reasons why elder financial exploitation has been dubbed ``the crime of the 21stcentury.''  I have made it a top priority to get the Federal Government to step up its efforts to fight the abuse, neglect,and financial exploitation of our Nation's seniors.  Last year, I called on the Justice Department to outline its efforts toprevent and respond to instances of elder abuse. First, I sent a letter to the Department to find out what it's doing to protectseniors from a new and particularly troubling form of exploitation: the photographing and online publication of nursing homeresidents in embarrassing and compromising situations.  I also sent a letter to inquire about the Department's efforts tofight imposter scams, in which fraudsters pose as employees of the IRS or another government agency, in order to depriveordinary Americans of millions of dollars of their hard earned money. And as tax season approaches once again, it's criticalthat folks watch out for these deceitful scams.  I also asked about the data the Department is collecting on financialexploitation, as well as how this data is being used to support Federal efforts to protect America's seniors.  In its responseto my inquiries, the Justice Department effectively admitted that it falls short in several respects. The Department said thatit ``does not collect data on the prevalence of elder financial exploitation nationwide.'' Further, the Department said that itcan't provide statistical information on the number of cases it has prosecuted for elder financial exploitation.  What allthis means is that we are not getting the full picture of elder financial exploitation.  We do know that some older Americans'trusting and polite nature, combined with their hard-earned retirement savings, make them particularly attractive targets forfraudsters. We also know that the abuse and exploitation of older Americans is on the rise and it can take manyforms.  Financial exploitation is the most widespread form of elder abuse, costing America's seniors between an estimated $2.9billion and $36 billion annually. But, sadly, its costs aren't limited to the negative effect on seniors' bank accounts. Victimssuffer all sorts of negative effects, including diminished health, loss of independence, and psychological distress.  It isestimated that up to 37 percent of seniors in the United States are affected by some form of financial exploitation in any 5-year period.  In my home State of Iowa, so-called grandparent scams are on the rise. In these scams, fraudsters presentthemselves to an older American as a grandchild in distress, hoping to convince the grandparent to send cash or give out acredit card number.  Con artists are also using sweepstakes scams to steal money from seniors. A senior is called and toldthey have won a prize or sum of money. But before they can claim the supposed prize, the victim is required to pay taxes orprocessing fees. Once the money is paid to cover the taxes and fees, however, no prize ever materializes.  Other instances ofelder financial exploitation are more personal in nature and have especially devastating effects. Some victims are pressuredinto signing over a deed, modifying a will, or giving a power of attorney. Americans have lost their farms, homes, and lifesavings to this form of fraud.  In short, elder abuse and exploitation is a serious problem, and it demands a strong response.It requires all of us to work together in a collaborative way.  So, today I am proud to introduce the Elder Abuse Preventionand Prosecution I thank my colleagues--Senators Blumenthal, Tillis, Klobuchar, and Cornyn forcollaborating with me on this comprehensive and bipartisan bill's development and for joining as original cosponsors. It takes amulti-pronged approach to combating the abuse and financial exploitation of our nation's senior citizens.  We have heard aneed for specialized prosecutors and more focused efforts to combat abuse and exploitation. That is why the bill directs theAttorney General to designate at least one federal prosecutor in each U.Attorney's Office to serve as an Elder JusticeCoordinator for that district.  To ensure that elder abuse is a priority for the Federal Trade Commission and the JusticeDepartment, the bill also calls for each agency to have an Elder Justice  We also need to send a strong messagethat efforts to target our Nation's seniors won't be tolerated. That is why the bill enhances elder victims' access torestitution and increases penalties for criminals who use telemarketing or email in their schemes to defraud seniors.  Thebill also requires that the Justice Department partner with the Department of Health and Human Services to provide training andtechnical assistance to State and local governments on the investigation, prevention, prosecution, and mitigation of elder abuseand neglect.  Finally we have heard about the need for more data on financial exploitation[[Page S362]]and the government'sresponse. Gathering accurate information about elder abuse is not only crucial to understanding the scope of the problem, but itis also essential in determining where resources should be allocated. So, the bill helps to accomplish that.  It requires thatdata be collected from federal prosecutors and law enforcement in cases where an older American was the target of abuse orexploitation.  These and other reforms included in the bill are the product of a truly bipartisan effort, as well as insightfrom key stakeholders and those who've been battling elder financial exploitation on the front lines.  This 21st century crimerequires a 21st century response. The Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act takes a strong step toward protecting ourNation's seniors, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-20-pt1-PgS361-3.txt,457,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

1291,topic-id,597,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to honor an Iowa teacher who has clearly had a major impact on his students and his community because I was contacted by a number of Iowans regarding their desire to find some way to recognize him. The following is what they told me.  A teacher of 39 years at Columbus High School in Waterloo, IA, Gary Schneiders has been awarded the[[Page S487]]McElroy Trust Gold Star Teacher of the Year in the Cedar Valley and Teacher of the Year at Columbus High  During his time at Columbus, Gary Schneiders has taught world history, applied economics, current world history and advanced placement European history. Through his world history and European history classes, Mr.Schneiders has taken it upon himself to educate his students about the many sacrifices our military men and women have endured throughout history.  This February, Gary Schneiders will be leading his 12th group of students to France and Belgium for a 12-day trip ``To Experience, To Learn, To Honor, To Remember.'' This is the theme each year for his AP Euro trip. Mr.Schneiders leads the students along World War I's Western Front starting in Verdun, His students experience the battlefields and trenches of the First World They visit some of the great museums and monuments honoring the soldiers who fought in the war. Most importantly, they go to many of the cemeteries and memorials to the many soldiers who fought for the various countries in that Great At the American memorials and cemeteries like Flanders Field and the Meuse Argonne, the largest American cemetery in Europe, the students lay flags and roses at each Iowa soldier's headstone. They also lay a wreath at the memorial itself, where Taps and the National Anthem are played. Because World War I is little remembered these days, the American cemeteries see very few visitors from the United The administrators of these memorials and cemeteries are excited to see Mr.Schneiders each year with his fresh class of students.  During the latter part of the AP Euro trip, Mr.Schneiders takes his students to the beaches of He shows the students firsthand what difficulties our soldiers had in taking the beaches. On their last day in Europe, Mr.Schnieders takes his students to Omaha Beach and the Normandy American Mr.Schneiders takes his students down to Omaha Beach so they can see the distance our soldiers had to cover while carrying heavy packs and under constant fire. The students then go up to the top of the beach where the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is located. The students again put American flags and roses at each soldier from They also take the sand they brought from Omaha Beach and wipe it over the name on each headstone so the name of the soldier and the State of Iowa becomes easily visible. The students again lay a wreath and Taps and National Anthem are played throughout the cemetery.  Two weeks after returning home, Gary Schneiders and his students put on a presentation for the local veterans and community. The students set up various multimedia exhibits to share the experiences from their trip. This has become a great event each year for local veterans and the community.  To conclude, I was told that Gary Schneiders' dedication to his school, veterans, and his students has been invaluable to his community. If Gary Schneiders has anything to do with it, his students will continue ``To Experience, To Learn, To Honor, To Remember'' our veterans. So I congratulate Gary Schneiders on his dedication to his school, students, veterans, and community.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS486-4.txt,457,RESTORE VISA IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS,2017.0,30.0,January
1307,topic-id,3578,"Mr.President, the resolution of disapproval I am introducing today via the Congressional Review Act repeals a Social Security regulation that unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities. It also violates the fundamental nature of the Second  The Second Amendment recognizes the God-given right to self-defense. In order to take away that right, the government must have a compelling interest. Furthermore, the law of regulation to achieve that compelling interest must be narrowly tailored. In other words, the government better have one heck of a good reason for going against the Second  The Justice Department, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Social Security Administration have not protected Second Amendment rights adequately under the previous administration. Our fundamental Second Amendment rights were constantly under attack.  For example, hundreds of thousands of veterans have been reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System without due process. Of course, that system amounts to a national gun ban list for those reported erroneously. Veterans were reported without first having a neutral authority find them to be a danger to self or others and thus have a legitimate right to deny them their Second Amendment rights. According to the government, the veterans needed a fiduciary to manage benefit payments. That is not a sufficient reason under the law. Needing help with your finances--simply needing that help--should not mean you have surrendered your fundamental right of self-defense, and it doesn't mean that you are a danger to the public.  On May 17, 2016, Senator Durbin and I debated my amendment that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to first find veterans to be a danger before reporting their name to the[[Page S495]]gun ban list. During the course of that debate, Senator Durbin admitted that the list was broader than it should have been. Senator Durbin said: ``Let me just concede at the outset, reporting 174,000 names goes too far, but eliminating 174,000 names goes too far.''  For the record, there were 260,381 names from the Veterans' Administration sent to the gun ban list for allegedly being in the ``mental defective'' category. Now, it just happens that this was 98.8 percent of all the names in that category. So the Veterans' Administration reported more names by far than any other agency.  Senator Durbin's staff and mine have met over these issues since that debate. I appreciate and thank Senator Durbin for that outreach, and I want to work together with him to solve these problems for the But now, the Social Security Administration is about to make the same mistake as the Veterans' Administration; that is, unless we stop them right here and right now with this resolution of disapproval. If we don't stop this, it could lead to hundreds of thousands of Social Security recipients being improperly reported to the gun ban list.  At its core, Social Security's new regulation allows the agency to report people to the gun ban list under two circumstances. First, the beneficiary needs to have someone designated to help manage benefit payments. That sounds like the VA; right?  Two, the beneficiary has an affliction based on a broad ``disorders list.'' But the process for designating someone to help a recipient manage Social Security benefits is not a process that is very objective. But the process for designating someone to help a recipient manage their Social Security benefit should be objective.  The former Social Security Administration inspector general said the following last year in testimony about this process that offends us here in the Senate and is the reason of this resolution: ``It's not a scientific decision, it's more of a personal opinion.''  This ``personal opinion'' of a bureaucrat cannot be the basis for taking away a person's fundamental Second Amendment right to bear arms.  Further, the second element--the so-called ``disorders list''--is a convoluted mess of afflictions that may or may not cause someone to be considered dangerous. Many of the listed disorders also do not impact gun safety at all. For example, some afflictions deal with anxiety disorders, fear of large crowds, or a lack of self-esteem. The list is complex, the list is long, and the list is not designed to regulate firearms. Rather, the list is designed to regulate whether a person can manage his or her beneficiary payments--in other words, can they handle money.  But here is the essential question that the Federal Government is incapable of answering. If they aren't dangerous, why does the Social Security Administration, like the VA, want to take away their guns?  The National Council on Disability, a nonpartisan and independent Federal agency, has come out against the Social Security Administration's rule and in favor of the repeal that this resolution of disapproval will accomplish. The Council has repeatedly stated its concerns about the agency failing to determine that people are dangerous before reporting their names to the gun ban list.  It has been the National Council on Disability's ``long-held position that restrictions on gun possession and ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to themselves or others.''  The Council has also stated that the rule ``unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a representative payee.''  Another organization, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, a coalition of 100 national disability groups, shares the same concerns about the regulation about which we are having this resolution of disapproval: ``The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.''  With that being said, even the ACLU wrote a letter in opposition to the agency regulation. I ask unanimous consent that these letters, as well as others, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Simply stated, the agency rule uses a massive regulatory net that captures innocent individuals who should be left alone. Just because a person is assigned a fiduciary does not make that person or those persons dangerous. Whenever the government tries to eliminate fundamental constitutional rights, it is required to narrowly tailor its regulatory action so that innocent people are not impacted. The Social Security regulation fails in that regard.  That is why both the National Council on Disability and the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities have called specifically for using the Congressional Review Act to repeal the final rule. That is what our introduction of resolution will accomplish.  Constitutional due process is wholly lacking. For example, the agency does not afford a beneficiary a formal hearing before his or her name is reported to the gun ban list.  Now, think about that. The Second Amendment, which recognizes a fundamental constitutional right, is being simply ripped away without a formal dispute process to initially challenge the action. Instead, the beneficiary must wait until their name is already on the gun ban list, and only then can the beneficiary appeal the decision by the grace of the government. This process effectively reverses what should be a burden on the government. The government should not be able to strip a fundamental constitutional right without due process and then place the burden on the citizen to try to restore it.  A hearing should be afforded before the infringement of a fundamental right, not afterward. The burden must be on the government to prove its case. That simply is the American way--our Constitution's way.  The Social Security Administration regulation falsely claims that it requires an adjudication before reporting names to the gun ban list, but there is no hearing afforded to the Social Security recipient before placing a name on the gun ban list. Of course, without a hearing, that process cannot honestly be called an adjudication. In other words, the Social Security Administration is blowing blue smoke when they say that. Without an adjudication, the process violates Federal law.  Here is the kicker. In order for beneficiaries to remove their names from the gun ban list, they have to prove they are not dangerous. Guilty until proven innocent, and the burden is on you to prove your innocence. Any way you look at it, that is totally unfair, a violation of the Constitution, but common sense ought to tell everybody it is just plain wrong.  The Federal Government, under the Obama administration, treated Social Security recipients with contempt and disregard when this rule was put out. With our resolution of disapproval, we can effectively terminate this unconstitutional government regulation, which the new Trump Administration supports. I encourage all of my colleagues to support our efforts.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Council on Disability,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate, Washington,     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,                Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: I write on      behalf of the National Council on Disability (NCD) regarding      the final rule the Social Security Administration (SSA)      released on December 19th, 2016, implementing provisions of      the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 FR 91702. In      accordance with our mandate to advise the President,      Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,      programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with      disabilities, NCD submitted comments to SSA on the proposed      rule on June 30th, 2016. In our comments, we cautioned      against implementation of the proposed rule because:       [t]here is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to      manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own,      possess or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not[[Page S496]]     only unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with      disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the      stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a      representative payee[.]       Despite our objections and that of many other individuals      and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed      rule, the final rule released in late December was largely      unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional      right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule      legitimizes, NCD recommends that Congress consider utilizing      the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this rule.       NCD is a nonpartisan, independent federal agency with no      stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control      other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun      possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual      disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to      whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to      themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.      Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction      on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only      after the individual has been afforded due process and given      an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not      able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her      disability. NCD believes that SSA's final rule falls far      short of meeting these criteria.       Additionally, as NCD also cautioned SSA in our comments on      the proposed rule, we have concerns regarding the ability of      SSA to fairly and effectively implement this rule--assuming      it would be possible to do so--given the long-standing issues      SSA already has regarding long delays in adjudication and      difficulty in providing consistent, prompt service to      beneficiaries with respect to its core mission. This rule      creates an entirely new function for an agency that has long      noted that it has not been given sufficient resources to do      the important work it is already charged with doing. With all      due respect to SSA, our federal partner, this rule is simply      a bridge too far. In fact, it is conceivable that attempts to      implement this rule may strain the already scarce      administrative resources available to the agency, further      impairing its ability to carry out its core mission.       The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory      overreach, and NCD urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In      this particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of      people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their      basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCD feels that      utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only      warranted, but necessary.           Regards,                                                   Clyde Terry,                                      ____                                           Consortium for Citizens                                            With Disabilities,                                                 January 26, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:      The Co-Chairs of the Rights Task Force of the Consortium of      Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) urge you to support a      Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the      Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)      on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule would require      the Social Security Administration to forward the names of      all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use      a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a      mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background      Check System (NICS).       The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is the      largest coalition of national organizations working together      to advocate for Federal public policy that ensures the self-     determination, independence, empowerment, integration and      inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all      aspects of society.       Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the CCD Rights      Task Force conveyed its opposition to the rule through a      letter to the Obama Administration and through the public      comment process. We--and many other members of CCD--opposed      the rule for a number of reasons, including:       The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy      change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive      assistance from representative payees in managing their      benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public      dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people      with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there      is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed      by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.       The absence of any data suggesting that there is any      connection between the need for a representative payee to      manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a      propensity toward gun violence.       The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior      to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.      Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to      transmit the names of individuals who have been      ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own      affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication      and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly      unable to manage their own affairs.       Based on similar concerns, the National Council on      Disability an independent federal agency charged with      advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies      regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the      Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.       We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to      disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it      inflicts on the disability community.       On behalf of the CCD Rights Task Force, the undersigned Co-     Chairs,     Dara Baldwin,       National Disability Rights     Samantha Crane,       Autistic Self-Advocacy     Sandy Finucane,       Epilepsy Foundation     Jennifer Mathis,       Bazelon Center for Mental     Mark Richert,       American Foundation for the                                  ____         The Judge David Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law,                                                 January 30, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:      The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law urges you to support      a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the      Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)      on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' The Center is a      national legal advocacy organization that protects and      advances the rights of adults and children with mental      disabilities.       This rule would require the Social Security Administration      to forward the names of Social Security Disability Insurance      (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit      recipients who use a representative payee to help manage      their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National      Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).       The rule is inconsistent with the statute it implements,      has no evidentiary justification, would wrongly perpetuate      inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental      disabilities as dangerous, and would divert already too-     scarce SSA resources away from efforts to address the      agency's longstanding backlog of unprocessed benefits      applications toward a mission in which the agency has little      expertise.       First, there is no statutory basis for the rule. The      National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)      statute authorizes the reporting of an individual to the NICS      database on the basis of a determination that the person      ``lacks the capacity to contract or manage his own affairs''      as a result of ``marked subnormal intelligence, or mental      illness, incompetency, condition or disease.'' The      appointment of a representative payee simply does not meet      this standard. It indicates only that the individual needs      help managing benefits received from       Second, the rule puts in place an ineffective strategy to      address gun violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis,      targeting individuals with representative payees and mental      impairments as potential perpetrators of gun violence. In      doing so, it also creates a false sense that meaningful      action has been taken to address gun violence and detracts      from potential prevention efforts targeting actual risks for      gun violence.       Third, the rule perpetuates the prevalent false association      of mental disabilities with violence and undermines important      efforts to promote community integration and employment of      people with disabilities. The rule may also dissuade people      with mental impairments from seeking appropriate treatment or      services, or from applying for financial and medical      assistance programs.       Finally, the rule creates enormous new burdens on SSA      without providing any additional resources. Implementation of      the rule will divert scarce resources away from the core work      of the SSA at a time when the agency is struggling to      overcome record backlogs and prospective beneficiaries are      waiting for months and years for determinations of their      benefits eligibility. Moreover, SSA lacks the expertise to      make the determinations about safety that it would be called      upon to make as part of the relief process established by the      rule.       Based on similar concerns, the National Council on      Disability, an independent federal agency charged with      advising the President,[[Page S497]]     Congress, and other federal agencies regarding disability      policy, has urged Congress to use the Congressional Review      Act to repeal this rule. We urge Congress to act, through the      CRA process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the      damage that it inflicts on the disability community.           Sincerely,                                                  Jennifer Mathis,     Director of Policy and Legal                                  ____                                                         AAPD,                                                 January 26, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Office of the Democratic Leader,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The      American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) urges      you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to      disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security      Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation      of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule      would require the Social Security Administration to forward      the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)      and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who      use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due      to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System (NICS).       AAPD is a national disability rights organization that      works to improve the lives of people with disabilities by      acting as a convener, connector, and catalyst for change,      increasing the economic and political power of people with      disabilities.       Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, AAPD conveyed its      opposition to the rule to the Obama We, and      many other disability rights organizations, opposed the rule      for a number of reasons, including:       The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy      change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive      assistance from representative payees in managing their      benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public      dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people      with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there      is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed      by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.       The absence of any data suggesting that there is any      connection between the need for a representative payee to      manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a      propensity toward gun violence.       The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior      to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.      Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to      transmit the names of individuals who have been      ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own      affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication      and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly      unable to manage their own affairs.       AAPD urges Congress to act, through the CRA process, to      disapprove this new rule to prevent the damage that it      inflicts on the disability community and the extraordinarily      damaging message it sends to society that people with mental      impairments could should be feared and shunned.

I am an immigrant.  The proposed roundup of millions of immigrants will not hit my house directly, but, as an American, I am standing up today to say I, too, am undocumented.  I have not fled systematic persecution, but, today, like a lot of Americans, I am speaking out and saying clearly that I, too, am a refugee.  Today, I am an 81-year-old man who was originally from Iran who traveled with a heart problem to the United States--with my American family and a green card in my hand--and was detained at O'Hare International Airport in  Today, I am a Fulbright scholar who was put on a plane back to Iran because our government did not understand what the new President was doing, how he was doing it, or what people already traveling should do.  Today, I am a citizen of the United Kingdom--I am English--with a green card, who was blocked entering at O'Hare with my U.citizen wife and my U.citizen child. That is who I am today.  Today, I am a student who is in the middle of my academic career at the University of Chicago who does not know whether I can come back to school and continue my education.  Today, I am one of more than 67,000 refugees who is already approved for travel and certified by both the United States and the U.in a painstaking process that took me years to complete, but I am stranded overseas.  Today, I am gay or Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Shia, Sunni, am from a tribe or ethnic group that is systematically targeted for persecution, or am living in a country anywhere in the world that cannot protect my basic safety, and the United States is closed to me.  Today, I am an immigrant who has a green card and who has followed all of the rules to the letter, but I cannot renew my green card or lawfully apply for citizenship here in the U.because I am from one of seven mostly Muslim countries on Trump's list where, incidentally, there are no Trump hotels, buildings, or golf courses.  By now, the entire world knows that the President of the United States screwed up bigly last week and caused an international and domestic crisis and that his staff is lying when they say it was a ``huge success.''  When the German Chancellor has to lecture your President about the Geneva Convention, you have made one hell of a bad decision.  When the Prime Minister of England is saying on one day that the U.and Britain have a special relationship but that, on the very next day, you are keeping her citizens out of your country when they are green card holders, your country has made a mistake.  When Rudy Giuliani--of all people--makes it clear that the President requested a Muslim ban and that they dressed up the policy to make it look better but still carved out exceptions to help Christians, you are probably acting in an unconstitutional manner.  That is not what one but two Federal judges thought: that there are significant enough constitutional issues that have been raised by recent executive actions to stop the President's order from being implemented.  Honestly, even at this hour, I am not sure they are fully complying with the orders or will reverse the actions of government officers at airports who coerced--intimidated--green card holders into signing away their rights and being deported.  On Sunday, the glaring bald spot of the President's executive order was combed over by the Secretary of Homeland Security, who said that keeping out travelers who already live in the U.and have green cards is not in the interests of the United States, to which the entire world said, sarcastically: Ya' think?  Today, I am an American, and I am standing up. Today, I am one of the millions of Americans who went to airports, Trump hotels, or town squares and who is marching peacefully, praying privately, and preparing personally to act as an advocate for immigrants and other families in our communities--women, Jews, gentiles, LGBT, and every one of every color and shape.  Today, they did not come for us, but we could not be quiet.

588,topic-id,278,"Madam Speaker, I am just heart sick today to hear some of my colleagues talking about how they were celebrating the 44th anniversary of Roe v. That is 60 million babies--little girls, little boys--who have been aborted and no longer have a chance to live. We could have had perhaps a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's. Who knows what the potential of those 60 million lives could have been.  So it is hard to hear my colleagues talk about a celebration of that and using the terminology that this bill deals with abortion care. Abortion isn't care and abortion isn't services. It is taking a life.  This bill does nothing to change Roe v. Wade, although I wish it could, but it simply says that taxpayers do not have to participate in it. The taxpayers all across this country who believe that every life is precious work hard and send in their money every April 15. They entrust it to us, their elected officials. We have national security issues, we have roads, we have education. They don't want to see it go to something like taking a life through abortion.  So this is what we are doing today, simply making permanent a policy that we have had to put in as an amendment to appropriations every year and fight for. This is just making sure that, here in Washington, in America, the taxpayers invest in women's health care and are not investing in abortion.  We should be about saving lives, not taking them.

1388,topic-id,472,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Washington, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of a joint resolution disapproving of a Department of the Interior regulation known as the stream protection rule.  Through this action, my Republican colleagues are now attempting to repeal a thoughtful and thoroughly vetted regulation that reflects current science, technology, and mining practices in order to better protect people and the environment from the negative impacts of mountaintop removal mining. This regulation took 7 years to develop and updates a 30-year-old coal mining regulation.  This regulation is not, as we have seen coming out of the administration of late, some fly-by-night executive order, but rather a serious attempt by serious people to make us a healthier and more environmentally conscious nation.  However, what we see here today is business as usual for the Republican majority--turning a blind eye to science in order to help wealthy polluters at the expense of the public's health and the environment. Just because my friends' unending attempts to normalize such misguided governance have become almost numbing in their effect does not make such attempts any less appalling to those of us who believe in the scientific method and a clean and safe environment.  Indeed, the paucity of care that we see here today in ridding the books of a regulation that hardworking and good people took 7 years to write with, mind you, input from all stakeholders, is starting to look like a variation of a theme when we consider the paucity of care the Republicans in the White House have exhibited over the past 10 days.  As everyone knows, last Friday, President Trump issued an executive order banning Muslims from certain countries from entering the United States and callously shutting down the refugee program. What ensued, and I predict will continue to ensue as we speak here today, was nothing short of chaos. Scores and scores of people were detained for hours, including green card holders, children, the elderly, and even Iraqi translators who had helped the United States during the insurgency.  Equally as horrifying as this Muslim ban that is the antithesis of everything we value as Americans is the ineptitude in which such a sweeping policy was implemented. Relevant agencies were not even consulted. In fact, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly, found out about the executive order on the phone while on a Coast Guard plane heading back to Secretary Mattis was also left off the list of those consulted. Had he been on it, he would have almost certainly expressed the sentiment he expressed during the campaign, mainly that the Muslim ban would cause great damage and send shock waves through the international community.

Let me be abundantly clear for people watching this debate. The question we are about to decide is: Should we even have a vote on undoing Trump's order? A ``no'' vote on the previous question will give us the opportunity to overturn this order. A ``yes'' vote means that the House will do nothing to stop Trump's executive action.  The American people watching this debate should take notice to see how their Representatives vote on this important motion, and they should hold their elected officials accountable. Did your Member of Congress turn a blind eye to Trump's unconstitutional policy by voting ``yes,'' or did your Representative reject this attack on our core American values and vote ``no?''

My feeling about what is happening--and I am speaking for myself--is they may very well drain the swamp, but if you take out the alligators and you put in crocodiles and you put in snakes, you have just made the swamp that much more dangerous to the American people.  Mr.Speaker, the cavalier nature by which my friends across the aisle approach the awesome responsibility of governing is as disturbing as it is disappointing. They all own this now. They are in charge. Although I may understand the emotive desire to turn things on their head, they all would be wise to come to the realization sooner rather than later that their actions affect real people. All they have to do is just see what transpired this past weekend.  The children, the elderly, the students who are waiting in airports across our country who are wishing to flee their oppressors or who are simply returning to their lives here at home are real people. They heard them being identified in the denied unanimous consent requests of my colleagues who came forward here. The children, the elderly, and all of the other folks who have to live in environments that are less clean and that are more likely to make them sick because of their flippant approach here today are real people. To be taken seriously, they must act seriously. Within that context, I would have to surmise that they all would be judged and found wanting.  To truly convey the devastating consequences of what has happened these past few days, I could quote from one of the Founding Fathers about the ideal of freedom from religious persecution; or I could recite for them the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, which has guided and inspired generations of immigrants and refugees as they have come here to seek better lives for themselves and their families; or I could quote from Luke 10:25 wherein Jesus tells the parable of the Good I will not.  Instead, I will leave them with the words of Amir Heydari, a bariatric surgeon and United States citizen who has lived in the United States for nearly 40 years and who was detained for questioning this past weekend:  ``I wanted to live somewhere that celebrated freedom--freedom of speech, freedom of religion, all of these kinds of things. That's what everyone in the world thinks about the USA, and unfortunately, when these types of actions are taken, the image is not the same anymore.''

451,topic-id,1182,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague Senator Wyden for leading this important discussion. I joined the Senate Intelligence Committee 4 years ago, just a few short months before the public release of thousands of classified documents forced our country to have a debate over the scope and reach of America's surveillance programs, especially as they relate to American citizens.  That debate has formed the backdrop for national security policy decisions ever since, and I am very proud of the positive steps we have made toward reclaiming our civil liberties while still giving our intelligence and law enforcement communities the tools they need and deserve to anticipate threats, track down terrorists, and keep this Nation safe. It is because of Congressman Pompeo's opposition to those important reforms that I rise today to oppose his nomination to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Congressman Pompeo has a long legislative and rhetorical history on surveillance, on torture, and on other issues that I believe we simply cannot overlook in considering his nomination.  In our conversations, in answers to written questions, and during his confirmation hearing, Congressman Pompeo has often said the right thing or tried to give answers that on their face give the impression that he has changed his positions on these issues. But we need to carefully review the Congressman's votes and public statements to be sure that he understands the importance of protecting Americans' constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties and meeting the needs of our national security at the same time.  I was proud to help lead the effort to pass the USA FREEDOM Act in 2015 to finally end the government's overreach, their dragnet collection of law-abiding Americans' personal information, and provide the intelligence community with an updated legal framework that ensures they have the tools they need to focus on the records of actual terrorists, while at the same time protecting the privacy of innocent  Although the Congressman voted to support the USA FREEDOM Act in 2015, within a year, he had backtracked, writing a column for the National Review that stated:       Those who today suggest that the USA FREEDOM Act, which      gutted the National Security Agency's (NSA) metadata program,      enables the intelligence community to better prevent and      investigate threats against the U.are lying. I use that      word intentionally.  A few weeks later, Congressman Pompeo in the Wall Street Journal wrote: ``Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information in a comprehensive, searchable database.''  I think I should read that one more time: ``Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information in a comprehensive, searchable data base.''  I think we should unpack that sentence a little bit. First, when asked by Senator Wyden and me to clarify what metadata he believes should be collected, Congressman Pompeo made clear that he was referring to a rollback of the USA FREEDOM Act and a return to the warrantless and unnecessary collection of billions of communication records for millions of innocent Americans not suspected of any crime.  Shortly after Congressman Pompeo's Wall Street Journal column was published, the NSA's general counsel wrote in a column in Lawfare: ``Largely overlooked in the debate that has ensued . . . is the fact that under the new arrangement''--meaning the USA FREEDOM Act--``our national security professionals will have access to a greater volume of call records subject to query in a way that is consistent with our regard for civil liberties.''  But, really, it is the second part of Congressman Pompeo's position that gives me far more concern. What exactly does he mean by calling for the collection of ``publicly available financial and lifestyle information'' and placing it into a ``comprehensive, searchable data base''? When asked to clarify his proposal, Congressman Pompeo declined. However, I think it is clear from the context of both his columns and his public statements that he believes the U.Government ought to be collecting dramatically more private information from innocent Americans who are not under investigation for a crime.  Let me be clear. The Federal Government has no business collecting ``lifestyle information'' on its own citizens, and innocent Americans should expect that their private financial data is just that--private. This flies in the face of the Fourth  On torture, Congressman Pompeo's record is also clear: He has supported it. Congressman Pompeo thinks it was a mistake to stop the enhanced interrogation program. He issued a very personal attack against then-Committee Chairman Feinstein when the committee released its report on the CIA detention and interrogation program. And while he acknowledges that CIA interrogation techniques are currently limited to those contained in the Army Field Manual, Congressman Pompeo said to our committee that he will ``consult with experts at the Agency and at other organizations in the U.government on whether the Army Field Manual uniform application is an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country or whether any rewrite of the Army Field Manual is needed.''  One could easily infer that the Congressman would ask the CIA officers who participated in the detention and interrogation program whether they believe the techniques contained in the Army Field Manual are sufficient. If he is told they are not, he has certainly left open the option of literally rewriting the Army Field This is problematic for a number of reasons and should be of deep concern to my colleagues.  Finally, the day before his nomination was announced, Congressman Pompeo tweeted that he was looking forward to ``rolling back'' the Iran nuclear agreement, which ended each and every pathway for Iran to develop a weaponized nuclear device, including a covert path. When I asked him about this in our hearing, Congressman Pompeo said: ``That communication was approved before I was aware that I was going to be the nominee to the Central Intelligence Agency.'' The Congressman went on to say that in his view, the Iran nuclear agreement was a ``mistake for American national security,'' but as CIA Director, he would ``work to make sure it is fully implemented and will endeavor to provide straight information'' about the progress being made in reducing Iran's nuclear capability. However, given his deep antipathy toward the Iran agreement, I have serious concerns about his ability to be objective about this issue, which is critical to the stability of the entire Middle East and to our efforts to ensure that Iran never develops a nuclear weapon.  Having said all of this, if the Congressman is confirmed, I hope he will fulfill one of the commitments he made to me: to improve the communications and relationship between the oversight committees in Congress and the Agency itself. It is my hope that a CIA Director coming from outside the Agency will give greater weight to informing the Intelligence Committee of the CIA's activities than his immediate predecessor has. Congressman Pompeo, if confirmed, will have an opportunity to recalibrate this relationship, and, if given the chance, I hope he seizes that opportunity.  Thank you. I yield the floor.[[Page S385]]    ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS369-4.txt,1937,FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION PROCESS REFORM ACT OF 2017,2017.0,23.0,January

866,topic-id,987,"Mr.President, I come here again today on what is a sad day and really a sad week for law enforcement in North Dakota, for the community of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, and certainly for the family of Colt Eugene  Colt was a deputy in the Rolette County Sheriff's Office who tragically lost his life in the line of duty last Wednesday night near Belcourt, Colt joined in a high-speed chase with several fellow officers Wednesday evening after a report and identification of a stolen vehicle. As the stolen vehicle was coming to a forced stop, shots were fired, and the call came over the radio that shakes all of North Dakota law enforcement and our entire State to the core: ``Officer down.''  Colt never got back up that evening, succumbing to his injuries not very far from the small community where he grew up. He leaves behind five beautiful young children, including a stepdaughter; his fiance, Alexandria; his grandparents, Gene and Rita Allery, who raised him; his family, his friends, and a community that will miss his constant smile and playful attitude.  He also leaves behind his fellow deputies and colleagues in the Rolette County Sheriff's I know this is an incredibly tough time right now for Rolette County Sheriff Medrud and his deputies as well. I know that the people across the State of North Dakota and I have your back during this difficult time.  This is now the second time in less than a year that I have come to the floor of the U.Senate to talk about the heroism and service of one of North Dakota's peace officers--one of those peace officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.  It is heartbreaking to have to stand here yet again to make one of these speeches in recognition of a North Dakota peace officer. In fact, during my 8 years as North Dakota's attorney general, I saw two deaths, two violent deaths of peace officers in my In less than a year, we have two.[[Page S416]]  Talking to many of my friends in law enforcement in my State, they will tell you that the business of law enforcement and the work of law enforcement in our State have become more and more dangerous and more and more challenging. As I have said many times--and I will say it again here today--North Dakota has the finest peace officers in the entire country. Colt Allery personified that dedication of our peace officers to protect and serve their communities.  Losing an officer in the line of duty is always devastating, but in States like North Dakota, where we often say we know everyone, Colt's loss is being felt in communities across the Colt and his family will know that the entire State mourns his loss and that we had his back in this life and we will have theirs as they struggle with this incredible and unimaginable loss.  Growing up in John, ND, and as an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, Colt never strayed far from home. And he made a commitment to do more than just be part of his community, he made a commitment to protect his community as a peace officer.  Colt started out as a corrections officer for Rolette After graduating from law enforcement training academy, he started work in the Rolla Police He then went to serve his fellow tribal members as a tribal police officer of Turtle Mountain before recently moving to the Rolette County Sheriff's  In North Dakota, we have a proud history of peace officers like Colt serving their State and local communities with distinction. I have had the privilege over my years in public service to work with law enforcement officials, from highway patrol, to State and local officers, to various Federal officers and our tribal police, and I will tell you again that these are some of the finest men and women I have ever worked with. These are the men and women--just like Colt--who could have chosen a different path. Instead, they chose to take the oath to protect and serve. They chose to selflessly put themselves in harm's way so they could make North Dakota a safer place for each and every person who lives there or who may by chance be passing through. They chose to put the needs of others before their own needs and, in fact, before their own families' needs. They chose a more difficult path to tread than most of us would be willing to follow.  Putting that uniform on each and every day places you in a unique and special group, a tight-knit community that very few people could understand what it takes to get the job done. All too often, it takes a tragedy like this one outside of Belcourt, ND, last week to recognize and appreciate our peace officers and the sacrifice they and their families make every day so that we can feel safe and secure in our daily lives.  I stand here this morning not only to celebrate the life of Colt Allery but to celebrate each and every peace officer working in the State of North Dakota and across the country. I know that although Senator Hoeven and I cannot be at the ceremony and at the celebration of Colt's life today, we stand today with the community and with the State in appreciation, and we stand today in mourning for the loss of Colt Allery and for the terrible sacrifice his fiancee, his children, and his family have made in service to our country and our State and their community.

I know a little something about national security, and the executive order signed by President Trump on Saturday is not only about national security, it is profoundly dangerous to the security of this country because it gives our enemies a logic to say the United States is bigoted; it is anti-Muslim; and it does not stand for its principles.  What is this executive order?  It is a travesty. It is dangerous security theater. It is a knife in the heart of the values that founded this country. What it is most assuredly not is a mechanism to keep us safer.  It opens with a preamble on 9/11--a devastating day for all of us. Yet, not one of the countries that produced the 9/11 hijackers is on the list of countries affected by this order.  How do you explain that?  All over the world right now radical Muslims are saying: We told you so.  And we are hearing this from our generals. We are hearing this from our national security experts; not one of whom has stood up and said that this is a good idea which will keep us safer.  It comes at a huge cost to our country. The costs to our values that we are a decent country are incalculable and we will be bearing them for a long time.  We are the Congress of the United We are the House of We are the people's Article I of the Constitution--now is the time to stand up against this madness. I plead with my Republican colleagues: Now is the time to stand up for national security, for safety, and for the values enshrined by the Constitution to which we all pledged an oath.  I understand I am a Democrat, so maybe I don't have that much credibility with my Republican colleagues. Let me quote to you what Eliot Cohen, noted conservative, national security strategist, former State Department official said: ``Either you stand up for your principles and for what you know is decent behavior, or you go down, if not now, then years from now, as a coward or opportunist. Your reputation will never recover, nor should it.''  History is staring us in the face right now. It doesn't happen very often, but it is staring us in the face right now. And when history stares you in the face, that is not a gaze that wavers. It stays for generations. And how you respond to that gaze and how you behave will be the stuff of the stories of your children and your grandchildren.  So now is the time for the Congress of the United States to stand up to the bigotry, to the national security theater, to the destruction of our values, with legislation that reverses this travesty of a decision that we saw this weekend.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgH706.txt,1913,1415,2017.0,30.0,January

509,topic-id,903,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday President Trump issued an executive order. He imposed a hiring freeze on the Federal workforce. It was not only a freeze, but an attack on those serving our country and a misguided action that will achieve the opposite of what is intended.  For those who are listening in the Chamber, Mr.Speaker, let me say that I am proud to represent 62,000 Federal employees. Hopefully, all of us refer to them as working people. We all say we want to be supportive of working people. Some people, however, in this body and down the avenue exempt Federal employees as working people.  They are not only working people, but they are working for the American people. Let's not forget that two-thirds of Federal employees live and work outside the Greater Washington area. It is very nice to say ``all of those bureaucrats in Washington,'' but two-thirds of our Federal employees serve in every community around our country, serve in protecting them: FBI agents; agents around the world who work for the Central Intelligence Agency--117 of whom died in service, and the President spoke in front of their memorial the other day--employees of the Centers for Disease Control keeping us healthy as communities and as a country, protecting our children and our families from diseases that would attack us; Federal employees at the National Institutes of Health studying how we prevent and cure cancer, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, autism, other afflictions that confront our country, both health care from a physical and mental standpoint; and, yes, nurses at our veterans hospitals. A freeze so that if a nurse leaves, you can't replace her or him; a doctor at a veterans hospital leaves, you can't replace that doctor, apparently; even at the IRS where we talk about making sure our tax system is fair and making sure that everybody pays their fair share, we undermine the ability to make that a reality; our Border Patrol to keep our borders safe; homeland security to keep our homeland safe--they serve the public in every State and every congressional district in the country.  This hiring freeze will not save us money or do anything to make the government more efficient. Should we do both? Will this policy do it? Its effect will be a reduction in the level of service benefiting the American people, greater difficulty in recruiting and retaining the most talented Americans to public service, and increased costs as a result of having to hire more expensive private contractors to do the work that still needs to be done.  That is something that the public doesn't understand, that, frankly, we exploded, in the early part of this century, the contracting out, which gave us less control and more cost. It is more expensive to contract out.                              {time}  1015  Already, our Federal employees have made significant sacrifices toward achieving a greater fiscal sustainability in this country. Now, let me give you the magnitude of that. Federal employees, over the last 10 years, have given up $159 billion in pay and benefits to which they would otherwise have been entitled, but we withdrew those resources from them.  Instead of continuing to vilify Federal civilian employees, as they have done for years--and when I say they, the politicians have done it, mostly on the Republican side of the aisle, but perhaps not exclusively--vilified our Federal employees. Republicans in Congress and in the White House ought to be thanking them for their hard work. I can't imagine any of us would treat our own employees, Mr.Speaker, in a fashion that said we are going to lay you off, we are going to undercut[[Page H613]]your pay, we are not going to give you the benefits which we promised you, and think that they were going to keep personnel on board with high morale and highly motivated to do the job, not only for us Members but for the American people. No employer would think that they can mistreat their employees and expect the highest performance out of them. And certainly no employer would think that if I treat my employees the way we have been treating Federal employees that we could recruit and retain the best and the brightest to serve our country.  Mr.Speaker, I urge the President to rescind his order. That is not to say that executives in all of these agencies should not look at making sure that we have the proper number of employees on board and are acting efficiently and effectively and working hard to accomplish the objectives that we as a Congress, on behalf of the American people, have given them. That is the issue.  I urge my Republican friends, in this House and in the Senate, to speak out against it. And I urge all Federal employees and their families to speak up in their communities across our country to remind their fellow Americans of the important work they do and why this hiring freeze would be so harmful to our country.

1325,topic-id,537,"Mr.Speaker, I rise out of deep concern for our country, our people, and those who serve us in uniform.  The executive order signed by President Trump on Friday has not only sown chaos and created a backlash being felt across the world, it is also endangering our people here at home and our troops overseas.  It bans refugees and is, for all intents and purposes, a ban on Muslims entering our country. It is a religious test. It plays right into the hands of ISIS, al Qaeda, and other extremist groups that mean to do us harm. It arms them. Their message in recruiting and propaganda has been that America is at war with Islam and that when we say we are tolerant and inclusive, it is a lie.  We must not let it be a lie.  Make no mistake, Mr.Speaker, this order will do nothing to make America safer from terrorism. Our enemies will use this Muslim ban to their full advantage, broadcast to all of those who, for whatever reason, may be teetering on the edge of extremism, one image, one tweet, one excuse away from radicalization. And our Muslim allies are scratching their heads in disbelief and disappointment.  CBS News reported this morning, Mr.Speaker, that a senior Iraqi general who commands the elite counterterrorism force trained by the United States military was supposed to come here next week but is now banned from doing so. He told CBS news: ``I am a four-star general. I have been fighting terrorism for 13 years and winning. Now my kids are asking me if I am a terrorist.'' That general, Talib al-Kenani, has been coming here for over a decade meeting with senior U.military leaders at CENTCOM, but now he is banned from entering the country.  This policy is dangerous, counterproductive, and extremely unfortunate.  It is important to note, Mr.Speaker, that of the seven countries included in this ban--hear me, my colleagues--of the seven countries included in this ban, no refugee or immigrant from any of those nations has committed a terrorist act in the United  The President of the United States has a responsibility--a sacred and public trust--to do everything in his power to protect our We have that same responsibility. This Congress has a sacred duty to hold the President accountable and ourselves for doing so in a way that respects our Constitution and our values. That, Mr.Speaker, is patriotism.  So I urge my colleagues on both sides: Stand against this order. Stand up for Stand up for the Stand up for our values. Stand against an act that does nothing but empower our enemies and erode faith in our highest principles in our country and around the world.  The Nation, Mr.Speaker, is watching.  The world, Mr.Speaker, is watching.  I urge us to action.  Representatives Lofgren and Conyers have introduced a bill to block this executive order. I have cosponsored it, along with 160 other Members of this This is a time when party should not be put before country. Party should not be put before patriotism. Party should not be put before principle.

I am pleased to be up here because I know we both believe that we represent and rise on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are going to come to Washington, D.C., and march here this coming Friday because we believe that giving even one more life, one more person, the right to change the world is worth it.  For the last 6 years, I have come to the well of the House with the gentleman from New Jersey and my colleagues on the bipartisan Pro-Life Caucus to celebrate life and fight for the unborn. On this seventh occasion, I rise with a renewed sense of hope and optimism for our children's future.  I commend President Trump for making one of his very first actions protecting unborn children around the world by preventing U.taxpayer dollars being used for foreign aid from being used to fund groups that promote abortion under the guise of family planning.  We can't stop here, however. That is just one step. Now is the time for action. When President Bush restored these protections in 2001, he wrote:  ``It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion, either here or abroad.''  We took step two earlier today when a bipartisan majority of us here in the House voted to extend the Hyde amendment across all government programs and to ensure that no tax dollars from hardworking Americans are used to fund abortions here in the United  Let's take additional steps to fight for the ones who don't have a voice. This Congress should protect unborn children from the violence of late-term abortion, protect medical professionals from being coerced to participate in abortions, and protect women from an industry that has put its financial interests first above women's health.  Mr.Speaker, the government does not give us our rights. In fact, the government exists to protect our God-given rights that were given to us by our Creator and to protect the next generation. All you have to do is look at those original founding documents and it is easy to see.  Well, we are here tonight for the same reason: that hundreds of thousands will march on Washington this Friday and fight for the rights of that next generation.

Most Americans oppose the use of their tax dollars to pay for abortions.

Americans also deserve to know--before they purchase it--if their healthcare plans cover elective abortion.

674,topic-id,598,"Madam Speaker, I want to give a sincere thank-you to our distinguished chairman, Mr.Smith--the chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology--for his work in this Congress and in past Congresses in bringing this bipartisan package of legislation to the floor.  I also thank my good friend and colleague Congressman Perlmutter from Colorado, who has been just an active joint member in moving this forward. I am so grateful for his efforts and his work.  Madam Speaker, the DOE Research and Innovation Act contains a number of bipartisan provisions that put in place clear research and development priorities so that Americans can maintain their leadership position on the world stage and continue attracting the best and the brightest to the only place they can do their work.  While I have the pleasure of representing Fermilab, our Nation's only dedicated high energy physics laboratory, I have also had the opportunity[[Page H656]]to visit with and to meet researchers from across the Nation who rely on our national laboratory system to do their work. More than 30,000 researchers a year visit the DOE user facilities, such as the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, just outside my district. These facilities are normally operating 24/7, with researchers blocking off time--sometimes just minutes--to use equipment that no one university or business could build and maintain on its own. This is why our national labs are truly the crown jewel in our research ecosystem.  The DOE Research and Innovation Act includes key provisions from my prior legislation of improving technology transfer and helping get research from the ``valley of death'' to a point at which the private sector can pick it up and run with it. This legislation also frees up the labs to be more nimble and work more easily with outside entities, such as with nonprofits and universities.  Another provision in this legislation should, hopefully, be a key priority for the incoming administration. Right now, China not only has the fastest computer in the world, but the two fastest computers in the world. Legislation which this body previously passed and is included in this bill would call on the DOE to carry out a program to build an exascale computer, which is close to the speed of the human brain. The United States' computing capabilities have a wide-ranging use and applications, and the DOE has led the way in developing this technology.  One of the primary missions at the DOE is the maintenance of our current nuclear stockpile. This is largely carried out through complex simulations which require these increasingly powerful machines, but the crosscutting benefits of this research may have the greatest impact.  When the NIH began its work on sequencing the human genome, it was only a moonshot mission that many thought was not yet feasible. Computing facilities at the DOE basically proved the concept and allowed this work to be completed. In the era of precision medicine and with the recent passage of the 21st Century Cures, our computing facilities must be tapped to realize the benefits of targeted treatments and cures.  Among other research priorities, this legislation also calls on the DOE to resume its low dose radiation research program. This is something I supported in the last Congress, working off recommendations from the scientific community to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the human health impacts from low dose radiation.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their bipartisan work to begin this Congress by passing pro-growth, pro-science legislation.                              {time}  1600  ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgH646-2.txt,2015,VOTER SUPPRESSION AND MUSLIM BAN,2017.0,24.0,January

906,topic-id,1975,"Mr.President, I was not preparing to come down to speak today, but I just want to make a few comments because I have been listening to what is going on in one of the other rooms out there. Everyone is zeroing in and targeting a guy named Scott Pruitt, who they don't think should be confirmed to be the Administrator of the I know Scott Pruitt very well, and he happens to be the attorney general for my State of In fact, I recruited him to run for the State legislature many years ago, and he is someone I know very well. He resides in my city of Tulsa, OK, and he is eminently qualified for this position. I would just like to make a couple of comments in response.  I chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee for some number of years, and during that timeframe, we started considering his nomination. I heard all kinds of criticism. I say to the Chair that they talk about the fact that he has sued the EPA and how can a person who has sued the EPA be qualified to serve as the Administrator of the EPA? Well, I think that is a pretty good qualification, considering what the EPA was doing during the Obama administration. Look at some of the lawsuits he has been involved with.  ``WOTUS'' is the acronym for ``waters of the United States.'' Of the many regulations they have come up with, this is one of the most onerous. In fact, I would say that probably in all States--Louisiana, Oklahoma, and the rest of them--they gave the same response as the farm girl gave when we asked the question--I asked the question: What is the worst thing that could happen or has happened to the farmers and ranchers of America--not just in Oklahoma but throughout America? And they said it is not anything that is in the Agriculture bill, it is the overregulation of the When we ask the question ``Which of all the overregulations of the EPA is the worst one?'' according to farmers, it is the WOTUS regulation, the waters of the United  For as long as I can remember, liberals have tried to get the jurisdiction of water away from the States and give it to the Federal I mean, that is the general philosophy of someone who is liberal--they want the power of the United States to be concentrated in So this is a part of that effort. As a matter of fact, it was 6 years ago that there was a House Member and a Senate Member who introduced a bill to take the word ``navigable'' out of our laws. State governments have control of all water rights except for navigable waters. If they had taken the word ``navigable'' out, the Federal Government could have taken over the entire jurisdiction. The two who were doing that were Senator Feingold from Wisconsin and Congressman Oberstar from Not only did we defeat both of those pieces of legislation 6 years ago, but they were both defeated at the polls afterward. So if this is an issue, it is an issue that has been around for a long time.  So yes, in fact, Scott Pruitt, as the attorney general of Oklahoma, from Tulsa, joined 15 other States, including the State of Louisiana, in suing to stop the rule that the Obama administration had put through in WOTUS, the water resources. To show how he was on sound ground, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has since that time said that, yes, he was right. They put a stay on it.  The next bill, the next of the regulations--I just did a TV thing where they were asking about the most onerous of regulations. It is kind of hard to answer that question because they are all so bad--they all inflict such a hardship on the business community throughout America--but the Clean Power Plan, let's go back and look at the history of that.  The Clean Power Plan all started back in about 2002, when at that time they wanted to do it when they first started talking about global warming so they were going to somehow do away with the emissions of So they tried to do it with legislation in 2002, and then again in 2004, again in 2005, and about every other year since then, and it has always been rejected by the It has been rejected by the Senate by an increased margin each time. Yet they keep saying, no, we are going to have some type of cap-and-trade legislation. We calculated what that would cost. It is between $300 billion and $400 billion a year, and frankly it wouldn't accomplish anything.  The first administrator for the EPA under Obama was Lisa I enjoyed her. I asked her the question: If[[Page S426]]we were to do away with CO2 altogether in the United States, would this have the effect of reducing it worldwide, and she said: No, because this isn't where the problem is. The problem is in China, India, and in So the more we chase our ability to generate electricity to those areas, the more--and they don't have any restrictions on CO2 emissions--then that is going to increase, not decrease.  They were not able to pass it legislatively. So along comes President Obama, and he said: Well, we can't do it through legislation, we will do it through regulation, so they had the Clean Power The Clean Power Plan was essentially the same thing as the legislation we defeated.  So Scott Pruitt, the attorney general from Oklahoma, came along, and he filed a lawsuit against the EPA, and this worked out really pretty well. It had a lot of support behind it. It wasn't the Sixth Circuit, it was the U.Supreme Court that stayed this. So what I am saying is, sure, he has had the occasion, along with some 26 other States, in the case of the Clean Power Plan, of filing a lawsuit against the EPA, but he has been successful in doing that.  Let me clarify another thing that has been misrepresented on this floor several times. They referred to a characterization I gave about 4 or 5 years ago called the hoax. The hoax is not climate change. We all know the climate is constantly changing. All the evidence is there. There is scriptural evidence, historical evidence. It has always been there. The climate has always changed. The hoax is that the world is coming to an end because of manmade gases. That is the clarification that needs to be made if we are going to be completely honest.  By the way, when they criticized Scott Pruitt for suing the EPA, I am reminding them that he also has sued several oil companies, including ConocoPhillips--he had a lawsuit against them for alleged double dipping--as well as BP and Chevron, so it is not just as if he is somehow owned by the oil companies. I always have to say, when people say the oil companies contribute to campaigns, not anything like the far left environmentalists do.  I remember Tom Tom Steyer said before the 2014 elections: I am going to put $100 million of my money to elect people who go along with all of these far-left programs. Of course, it didn't work in 2014. He actually at that time spent $75 million. This is one individual we are talking about. So those guys over there, they are the ones who are putting money into campaigns, and I understand that.  The last thing I want to correct--and I wish more people would talk about this. Frankly, I wish President Trump would say more about this because they always talk about how 97 percent of the scientists go along with the global warming thing. That isn't true at all. In fact, if you go to my Web site, you will find a piece that was in the Wall Street Journal that makes it very clear that isn't true and documents that case. The scientists who have been saying this are one group that is called the IPCC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate That is the United Nations, in case there is someone who doesn't understand that. They are the ones who have provided all the credibility in terms of the science that backs up all the statements that are made about global warming.  I had the occasion--some people are not aware that once every December, now for 21 years, the United Nations has had the biggest party of the year. It is always in some exotic place. I remember in 2009 it was in We had all the people--several friends I love dearly here in the U.Senate and in the House went over there to tell 192 countries that we were going to pass legislation that would have cap and trade. I went over as the truth squad of one person to tell them what had been represented to them was, in fact, not going to happen.  Well, right before going, Lisa Jackson was the first nominee, or the first confirmed Administrator of the I asked her the question on the record, live on TV, in the committee room, on the committee that I chaired, I said: I am going to be going over to Copenhagen to tell them the truth over there, and, in the meantime, you are going to take over jurisdiction so you can try to do this with a regulation. To do that, you have to have an endangerment finding. To have an endangerment finding, you have to have science behind that. She was smiling. She is a very honest person.  I asked her: What science are you going to use for your endangerment finding that gives you the opportunity to do what you couldn't do with legislation that you think you can do with regulation? She said: The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  As luck would have it, it was a matter of days after that that climategate came about. How many people remember climategate? They never talk about it. Let me just tell you how it was characterized. Climategate was those individuals who were at the top of the IPCC had gotten together and tried to alter the science to support their point of view, and they got caught doing it. The world responded to it. Newsweek: ``Once celebrated climate researchers feeling like the used car salesman.''  ``Some of the IPCC's most quoted data and recommendations were taken straight out of unchecked activist brochures. . . . ''  The U.scientist Philip Lloyd said: ``The result is not scientific.''  They were all talking about climategate. They were talking about how the IPCC rigged the science.  A guy that was an IPCC physicist said that ``Climategate was a fraud on a scale I've never seen.''  Clive Crook of the Financial Times said that ``the stink of intellectual corruption is overpowering.''  Christopher Booker with the UK's Telegraph--that is one of the largest in London--said it is the ``worst scientific scandal of our generation.''  They are talking about the science that is behind the accusations they have made.  So if anyone hears these claims repeated, or even if it has been repeated, saying that at least 97 percent of the scientists agree, they are not right.  My time has expired, but I just wanted to clarify that so people know--because one thing I know that is going to happen is, Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of the State of Oklahoma, will be confirmed by a good margin--I think by a party margin--to be the Administrator of the It will be a great change.

1305,topic-id,1652,"Mr.President, we are introducing today a CRA that is kind of interesting. This is something that has only been successful one time.  I think everyone knows that during the past 8 years, under the Obama administration, we have seen thousands, literally thousands of regulations that have come through that have been anti-business, many of them anti-certain businesses, such as the oil and gas industries. It is no secret, the fact that we have had a President, in President Obama, who has had a war on fossil fuels.  It is interesting to me that when I go back to my State of Oklahoma--one reason I go back all the time is because I want to be around real, rational people. Sometimes I get the feeling there really aren't any around here. They ask questions. They will say: Tell me. Explain this to me. In the United States of America, in order to generate power, 89 percent of the power we are generating is either fossil fuels, coal, oil, gas, or nuclear. If we do away with 89 percent of our generation capability, then how do we run the machine called America?  The answer is that we can't. But we don't get those types of questions here. I am sure most of us who go back find that kind of concern, and it is not confined to  I chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee during the 8 years--during the time President Obama was in office, and most of the regulations were actually associated with that committee. Many committees have regulations associated with their committees but not nearly as many as Environment and Public An example is the WOTUS regulation. Ask anyone with the American Farm Bureau or anyone who deals with farmers and ranchers, and the 1 problem they have, they will tell you, is nothing that is found on the AgNu Committee; it is the overregulation of the That is one example. The Environment and Public Works Committee is the committee that has the jurisdiction over the EPA--at least we are supposed to.  During the time when WOTUS came through--the water regulation--it has historically always been the States' jurisdiction to handle water issues, not the Federal Government, with the exception of navigable water. I think we all understand that. In fact, there were several liberal Members in the House and Senate who tried to take the word ``navigable'' out of the regulations, and we defeated them every time. The last two who tried to do that were, in fact, defeated in the polls.  We know that in the State of Oklahoma--I should say our farmers know that if you put the Federal Government in charge of water regulations in the western part of Oklahoma, which is an arid part of the State, it would end up being designated as a wetland. Anyway, that is a major concern they had.  Another example of regulation is President Obama's Clean Power We all know how that came about. Way back in 1972, I was one of the bad guys who told the truth about what they were referring to as global warming, saying the world was coming to an end. Even though a lot of the Members of this body didn't join in and agree with me, every time, without exception, they came up with a bill that would do something--such as a cap-and-trade bill, for example--we defeated the bill, and it was continually defeated by an even larger margin as time went by.  President Obama came in, and when he couldn't get the legislation he wanted passed, he tried to do it through regulation. That is what he did with the Clean Power Plan--another rule that was rejected.[[Page S493]]  I only bring up those examples because they are typical regulations that put people out of business that actually came through my committee.  I am here to introduce S.9. This did not come through my committee; it came through a provision that is in the Dodd-Frank bill. Anyone going back to their States and talking to bankers or anyone in the financial industry, when talking about the Dodd-Frank bill, it is an example of the same type of overregulation that takes place on many of the issues that come before my committee.  Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to develop a rule that requires companies to report payments made to a foreign government or the U.Federal Government relating to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, and minerals. That is a requirement which is not found in our committee, but it is found in the committee that handled the Dodd-Frank bill.  While that may not sound all that significant, it strikes at the heart of American competitiveness. It makes public the information of our very best companies on how to win oil and gas deals. It requires companies to disclose and make public highly confidential and commercially sensitive information, and this is information that foreign competitors don't have to provide. Under this regulation, we would be required to provide it. That means that American companies would have to disclose all of the background and sensitive information that companies develop in competing for contracts of some kind having to do with oil and gasoline. It could be with another country, like It could be with individuals over there who are not friendly to the United Countries that don't wish to disclose the details of their commercial deals would now have a strong incentive to go with companies in countries that don't have that burdensome requirement. That is only natural.  To make matters worse, the SEC's rule lacks an exemption for circumstances in which disclosure under 1504 would violate the laws of a country where a U.company is operating. So it leaves U.companies with a choice of complying with U.laws or the laws of foreign countries. That is an impossible position to be in and could put U.employees at risk of criminal prosecution abroad for facilitating the release of this information.  If that weren't enough, the cost of complying with this regulation is enormous. American companies would have to comply, and it could cost millions of dollars. The SEC's estimate of the total compliance cost initially would be up to $700 million. The ongoing compliance costs would be as much as $581 million annually. Those costs would be borne by U.companies, and our competition would not have to do that.  The courts already struck down this rule when it was first developed in August 2012. The DC Federal district court struck down the rule in 2013 because of two substantial errors. Specifically, the Commission had ``misread section 1504 to mandate public disclosure of the reports'' and had arbitrarily declined to provide an exemption for countries that prohibit disclosure.  The new rule, finalized in June of 2016, doesn't look any different. It is the same rule. Even though the SEC was told by the courts that the rule did not reflect congressional intent, they continued to put out a new rule that had the exact same problems as the one the court had vacated. It is the same rule. It is as if the Obama administration was rushing this rule out in hopes that there wouldn't be time or an opportunity for a court or Congress to overturn it. But here we are in the process of overturning it.  Last week President Trump issued an Executive order to reduce the regulatory impact on American businesses. With this CRA, we have an opportunity to effectively participate in that. Our focus should always be America first. As the Congress looks at the competitiveness of American companies, we should not be subjecting our own citizens to lawsuits, and that is exactly what this regulation would do.  By the way, I think we are going to get a lot of CRAs going forward, and I think it is important for people to understand what the CRA is. The CRA is the Congressional Review  There are a lot of liberal people who like to have power concentrated in Washington--like with the WOTUS rule. They would rather have the jurisdiction of the waters of the United States with the Federal Government instead of with State governments. That is human nature. That is not something up for debate. Everybody knows that.  When individuals who are trying to centralize power in Washington go home and hear complaints from people in their States about regulations and overregulation in our society, their response is, well, that is not us, that is some unelected bureaucrat. A CRA forces Members of the Senate and House of Representatives to be held accountable to the people by having to take a position so that they can't go home and say: No, the regulators are doing this. It is interesting because it puts them in a position where, if we pass a CRA--and we are going to pass S.9--this will come before this body and we will have to say yes or no. Should we do away with this rule that everyone back home is opposed to? It forces them to be honest.  I think this is one CRA that many Democrats should be sponsoring and voting for, and I wouldn't be surprised if we are able to get some cosponsors.  Let me add one last point to outline what this is about. Within the Dodd-Frank bill, section 1504 is a requirement on U.companies competing for oil and gas deals throughout the world to disclose to their competition what goes into their bid and how they are putting it together, even when the other side doesn't have to do that.  I look forward to having the opportunity to bring this to the floor as soon as we get our initial 30 signatures on here. Senators will see and have an opportunity to support this first CRA that I am very excited about.                                 ______                                       By Mr.McCONNELL (for himself, ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS491.txt,583,FIRST RESPONDER IDENTIFICATION OF EMERGENCY NEEDS IN DISASTER,2017.0,30.0,January

I have known Elaine for many decades as a dedicated civil servant and a talented negotiator and have no doubt she will again prove to be a highly effective asset to the Executive branch. Elaine Chao was born in Taiwan and, at the age of 8, came with her family to America by cargo ship where, at the age of 19, she became a U.citizen.[[Page S503]]From those humble beginnings, she went on to receive degrees from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts and Harvard Business  Elaine Chao began her executive career at the U.Department of Transportation in 1986, as Deputy Administrator of the Maritime Administration, then as Deputy Secretary from 1989 to 1991. She served as the Director of the Peace Corps, in 1991, where she brought the Peace Corp programs to the liberated countries of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania; and as president and CEO of the United Way of America where she helped restore fiscal responsibility to an organization that had been damaged by mismanagement.  In 2001, she become the 24th U.Secretary of Labor, the first Asian Pacific American woman to be appointed to the President's cabinet in American history, in President George Bush's cabinet. During her 8-year tenure at the Department of Labor Department, she proved she has the skills to manage large multifaceted organizations as well as to initiate needed reforms and new programs that help create jobs and competiveness in the workforce. Quite frankly, she was the best Secretary of Labor the United States has ever had.  During her tenure, the Department updated the white collar overtime regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which has been on the agenda of every administration since 1977. The most significant regulatory tort reform of President Bush's first term, the new regulations provided millions of low-wage vulnerable workers with strengthened overtime protection.  In 2003, under her leadership, the Department achieved the first major update of union financial disclosure regulations in more than 40 years, giving rank and file members enhanced information on how their hard-earned dues are spent. The Department set new worker protection enforcement records, including recovering record back wages for vulnerable low-wage immigrant workers. The Department also launched comprehensive reform of the Nation's publicly funded worker training programs, to better serve dislocated and unemployed workers.

Disparate impact is where you take two facts that are extraneous and put them together for an appearance of an irregularity or an impropriety without any fact being true.  The statements made about the CBO estimate were accurate in what he said but wrong in the implication. He is accurate that CBO did say it would cost money if we didn't have a replacement for ObamaCare, which is the replacement being worked on as we speak right here today. Both are facts, but when put together the way he put them together, it makes it look as though we are spending money that we are not, in fact, spending at all.  The CBO estimate also does not include the impact of legislative and administrative action to stabilize individual markets. In the absence of making that consideration, of course it is going to be more costly. Those are both extraneous facts that, when put together, make the appearance of a crime, which just isn't there.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS325-3.txt,1608,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7, NO TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABORTION",2017.0,17.0,January
42,topic-id,1190,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about my friend, Tom In a way, I am glad the minority leader brought up Representative Price and brought up specific allegations that have been made against him so I can hopefully put some light on the misperception that those allegations made and, in fact, shine some positive light on a great nominee to be Secretary of Health and Human  I have known Tom Price for 30 years of my life. He and his wife Betty are dear friends. Their son Robert is the age of one of my sons. He is a fine young man. Tom is a leader in our community, a leader in the Roswell United Methodist Church, the first-ever elected Republican majority leader of the State of Georgia Senate, the chairman of the Budget Committee of the U.House of Representatives, former president of the study committee in the House of Representatives, and an all-around terrific individual who has a litany and liturgy of recommended approvals and improvements that have made the United States of America legislatively and legally much better.  Tom is a family man. I mentioned Betty and his son He is an accomplished professional. He is an orthopedic surgeon. He and his wife Betty met during their residencies at Grady Memorial She is an anesthesiologist. Tom is an accomplished orthopedic surgeon.  Tom is one of those orthopedists who came together with a number of other orthopedists to form what is known as Resurgens Orthopaedics, the largest orthopedic practice in the Southeastern United States--one of the finest anywhere in the country.  Tom has worked tirelessly in the Republican Party, tirelessly on the Democratic-Republican bipartisan agreements that have been made, and tirelessly on behalf of his community.  He is a fine individual and is uniquely qualified to be the Secretary of Health and Human This is an agency that will spend $1 trillion of the taxpayers' money on an annual basis. You want a man who has been chairman of the Budget You want a man who understands finances. You want a former legislator who knows how to get the job done. Tom Price is that man.  In fact, I am particularly well qualified to introduce Tom to this body and recommend him as Secretary of HHS because he replaced me when I left the House when I was elected to the He has been reelected six times. He served 6\1/2\ terms in the House of Representatives, and he has an extensive legal background, an extensive legislative background, and an accomplished background of conservative leadership for the United States of Most importantly, he has done so on many issues dealing with medicine, and why not? He is an expert in medicine.  I know a little bit about real estate. I authored legislation on real estate. That is what you do when you are in a profession and know a little about something Congress is looking at. But the allegations made by Senator Schumer--and being echoed in some of the media and papers around town--are just another example of taking disparate impact.  I want to talk to you a little about what Senator Schumer was talking about. He was talking about the purchase of Zimmer Biomet stock, 26 shares, worth $2,674. That is what he was talking about. The two disparate facts that he put together to make a wrong were this: The purchase was made without Tom's knowledge because his account is managed by Smith Barney and Morgan They manage his account. They make the decisions about what to buy. Tom doesn't make them. Tom found out about it and documented it on April 4, even though the purchase was made in He didn't even know the purchase had been made on his behalf until it was disclosed, which he did as he is required to do by the STOCK  Every single fact brought up by the distinguished minority leader is a fact that is a required disclosure of the rules of the U.Senate to the Ethics Committee under the STOCK So don't make this look like some sinister thing, and let's take it at face value. If you take it at face value, it was a purchase Tom didn't make; it was made on his behalf. It was a purchase we documented that he didn't know about until the 4th of April; the purchase was made in The purchase did not work to his benefit because the decision was not made by him.  He is like every other Member of the Senate and House who makes required disclosures of their activity because of the STOCK Tom obeyed the law. Tom did what was right. What was done is right and is being made to look wrong only because of appearance but not because of fact. That is the wrong way to take on the consideration of any nominee of a President of the United States to be a Secretary of any part of the Cabinet.[[Page S326]]  I reiterate: Who else would be better to oversee $1 trillion in spending than Tom Price, chairman of the Budget Committee, former member of Ways and Means, an accomplished legislator who put together the largest orthopedic practice in Atlanta, GA, and the State of Georgia? He is well qualified and eminently qualified. This body should overwhelmingly confirm his nomination to be U.Secretary of Health and Human Services in the United States of  I am proud as his friend, I am proud as a former associate and legislator, I am proud as the person he succeeded in the U.House of Representatives, and I am proud as an American citizen to know that our President has picked someone who is eminently qualified, who has an impeccable record of success in his legislative jobs, who is a fine family man, a member of his church, a disciplined member of his political party and, most importantly, a man who loves his country and is volunteering to sacrifice his time and his knowledge to make America's Department of Health and Human Services better.  Lastly, there is a little rumor going around that he is not for extending Social That is ironic to me. Let me tell you what he and I did in November and We traveled throughout Georgia on behalf of AARP, presenting ways to save Social Day in and day out, Tom Price is on the record of the State of Georgia, fighting to preserve Social Security for those who have it and for those who will get it in the future. So don't take this disparate impact of extraneous facts someone put together to try to make a wrong out of a right.

(B) Each Member of the Congressional delegation      representing the State in which the designated facility is      located must indicate in writing such Member's support of the      proposal to name such facility after such individual. It is      the policy of the Committee that sponsoring or cosponsoring      legislation to name such facility after such individual will      not alone satisfy this requirement.

963,topic-id,538,"Mr.President, by 2020, it is estimated that 65 percent of all jobs will require at least some form of postsecondary education and training. The National Skills Coalition estimates that nearly half of all job openings between now and 2022 will be middle skill jobs that require education beyond high school, but not a four-year degree. While the number of students pursing postsecondary education is growing, the supply of skilled workers still falls short of industry demand. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 5.5 million U.jobs are currently vacant, in part, because of a shortage of qualified workers.  Our current Federal higher education policy must be improved to help solve this problem. Pell Grants, needs-based grants for low-income and working students, can only be awarded towards programs that are over 600 clock hours or at least 15 weeks in length. These grants cannot be used to support many of the short-term occupational training programs at community and technical colleges and other institutions that provide skills and credentials employers need and recognize. When it comes to higher education, Federal policies need to support the demands of the changing labor market and support career pathways that align with industry demand. According the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, shorter-term educational investments pay off--the average postsecondary certificate holder has 20 percent higher lifetime earnings than individuals with only a high school diploma.  Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague, Senator Portman, the Jumpstart Our Businesses by Supporting Students or JOBS The JOBS Act would close the ``skills gap'' by expanding Pell Grant eligibility to cover high-quality and rigorous short-term job training programs so workers can afford the skills training and credentials that are in high-demand in today's job market. Since job training programs are shorter and less costly, Pell Grant awards would be half of the current discretionary Pell amount. The legislation defines eligible job training programs as those providing career and technical education instruction at an institution that provides at least 150 clock hours of instruction time over a period of at least 8 weeks and that provides training that meets the needs of the local or regional workforce. These programs must also provide students with licenses, certifications, or credentials that meet the hiring requirements of multiple employers in the field for which the job training is offered.  The JOBS Act also ensures that students who receive Pell Grants are earning high-quality postsecondary credentials by requiring that the credentials meet the standards under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, are recognized by employers, industry, or sector partnerships, and align with the skill needs of industries in the States or local economies. In Virginia, the Virginia Community College System has identified approximately 50 programs that would benefit from the JOBS Act including in the fields of manufacturing, architecture/construction, energy, health care, information technology, transportation, and business management and administration.  The JOBS Act is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that would help workers and employers succeed in today's economy. As Congress works to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, I hope that my colleagues ensure that Pell Grants are accessible for individuals participating in high-quality, short-term occupational training programs that are leading to industry-recognized credentials and certificates.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS447.txt,2176,FIXING OUR NATION'S HEALTH CARE,2017.0,24.0,January

1708,topic-id,2479,"Madam President, I rise to speak concerning the nomination by President Trump of Rex Tillerson to be Secretary of I believe I am going[[Page S518]]to be speaking a little bit this afternoon and possibly later. This will just be part of my remarks this afternoon.  First, I am going to say some positive things about Mr.Tillerson's career and the importance of the position, but then I want to talk about the reason for my opposition, which has to do largely with my concern about whether he is capable of exercising truly independent judgment on behalf of the United States, particularly given his 41-year career with  To begin, Mr.Tillerson has an exemplary record with I was impressed by it. I have been impressed by his business acumen. I think this one would, frankly, be relatively straightforward if he had been nominated for Secretary of I think it would be relatively straightforward had he been nominated for Secretary of  That is an interesting aspect of some of these nominations. I think there are some people who are up who--if they were in other positions, they might be easier, but because of the ones they have been nominated for, it has made it a little more difficult. I put Mr.Tillerson in that category.  Secretary of State is an enormously important position. We all know that it is important, but we, even for the public, separate the Secretary of State position from others.  There are four Cabinet Secretaries who by law are not allowed to be involved in political campaigns. They can't go out on the campaign trail during election season. They are designated as ``special,'' and I think they are special for a reason--Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury, and the Attorney The reason these four positions are made separate, in my view, is they are positions that are supposed to have a special gravity, positions that are supposed to be above politics. They are also positions that are supposed to have a degree of independence.  An Attorney General needs to have a degree of independence from a President because that individual must weigh in on the legality of actions even of the administration in making decisions. I think the Secretary of State needs some independence and gravitas as well. That is why the Secretary of State position is such a special one.  I want to focus on this area of independence and the independence I wanted to see in a Secretary of State Tillerson and that I did not feel comfortable enough after the research I have done and after the hearing itself. It fits into three basic categories--issues with respect to climate, issues with respect to Russia, and issues with respect to the development policy that the United States uses in nations around the world, including very poor nations that are resource rich but often find that their oil reserves or other natural resources put them into kind of a resource-cursed position where, resources notwithstanding, they actually trend toward authoritarianism and keeping their citizens in poverty.  Let me start with climate. Climate is an enormously important issue in Virginia, as it is to all States, but to give you kind of the Virginia focus on climate issues, Virginia voters overwhelmingly believe that humans are affecting climate and that something should be done about it. We have 134 counties. The eastern part of Virginia--Hamilton Roads, near the Atlantic--is the second most threatened area in the United States to sea level rise. So if you go to Hampton Roads, VA--1.6 million people, the center of naval power in the United States and the world--what you find is sea level rise accelerating to the extent that neighborhoods where you could once sell a house, you can't sell it anymore. Flooding that was once every few years is now regular.  Even our Nation's military operations in Hampton Roads are jeopardized. There is a main road leading into the Norfolk Naval Base, which is the largest naval base in the United States--the largest naval base in the world. That road is increasingly flooded just during normal tidal conditions. We are not talking about storms; we are talking about normal tidal conditions. The inability to get road access into America's center of naval power is highly challenging, highly problematic. In the future, it is going to be very expensive for us.  So the climate change issues in Hampton Roads--whether it is affecting your ability to sell a house, the ability to conduct naval operations--and in many other areas is of deep concern to my  There are climate issues in other parts of my State, from weather patterns to warming temperatures wiping out species in the Shenandoah National Park because as the temperature warms, the species need to move higher and higher, and at some point they can't move any higher. So there are endangered species in the Shenandoah National Park because of climate issues.  The issue is not only important to my State, it is a critically important part of the job. The Secretary of State in the previous administration was involved in crafting the Paris climate accord. Nearly 200 nations agreed that climate change is a huge problem and that we have to do something about it, and each nation came forward voluntarily to craft its own plan so that the world could deal with this problem.  The U.played a critical role--Secretary Kerry and others--in forging this global coalition around the overwhelming scientific consensus. The Secretary of State in this administration, along with others--the EPA Administrator--will play a key role in determining whether we continue to take seriously climate, whether we continue to take seriously the promises we made under the climate accord, or whether we go backward. I don't want to go backward because it would hurt my State and hurt our country and hurt the world.  During my examination of Mr.Tillerson during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I was not happy with the answers with respect to climate issues. The overwhelming majority of scientists say that climate change is real and that it is caused significantly by the burning of fossil fuels and the release of This is not a controversial conclusion; it should not be partisan, either.  The first climate bill that was introduced in this body was introduced by Senator McCain in 2004. Then, in 2007, a predecessor of mine, Senator Warner of Virginia, a Republican, and Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat, introduced a bipartisan bill. Senator Warner, now retired--John Warner--still speaks regularly on the national security implications of climate change.  During the hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I examined Rex Tillerson about the role of ExxonMobil in climate research. ExxonMobil is a company that is chock-full of engineers and scientists. It is one of the most accomplished companies in the world if you just measure it by the extent of engineering and science talent that it has.  There has been a series of investigative articles in the last few years in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Review of Books, and Inside Climate News that get into the question of what ExxonMobil knew about climate science and what they told the public. I wanted to ask Mr.Tillerson about this. Some of the information that I put on the table during that examination: There was an internal letter in September of 1982 from Exxon's Theoretical and Mathematical Science This was during the time Mr.Tillerson was working for the company.  I want to read a quote from this letter which I put into the Record as I was examining Mr.Tillerson:       However, over the past several years a clear scientific      consensus has emerged regarding the expected climate effects      of increased atmospheric . . . There is      unanimous agreement in the scientific community that a      temperature increase of this magnitude would bring about      significant changes in the earth's climate. The time required      for doubling of atmospheric CO2--  Doubling of atmospheric CO2--     depends upon the future world consumption of fossil fuels.      There is potential for our research to attract the attention      of the popular news media because of the connection between      Exxon's major business and the role of fossil fuel combustion      in contributing to the increase of atmospheric      . . . [O]ur ethical responsibility is to      permit the publication of our research in the scientific      literature; indeed, to do otherwise would be a breach of      Exxon's public position and ethical credo on honesty and      integrity.  In other words, by 1982 the key scientific research organizations within[[Page S519]]ExxonMobil, which has a sterling cadre of scientists and researchers, said: Here is our view of the scientific research--and not just other scientific research, they did their own studies to replicate it. They concluded that the burning of fossil fuels was going to lead potentially to a significant increase in global temperature, with catastrophic climate effects.  There is other information as well that ExxonMobil had within it during Mr.Tillerson's tenure with the company. But by 2000, ExxonMobil in its face to the public was saying something very different. Despite the internal recognition of climate science and the potential effects on the economy and on our atmosphere and despite scientists with ExxonMobil saying we have an ethical duty to share these facts with the scientific community, by 2000, ExxonMobil was publishing, in major publications in this country, op-eds--full-page op-eds in newspapers and magazines. I am going to read a quote from one, an ExxonMobil published op-ed in 2001:       Knowing that weather forecasts are reliable for a few days      at best, we should recognize the enormous challenge facing      scientists seeking to predict climate change and its impact      over the next century.       Geological evidence indicates climate greenhouse gas levels      experience significant natural variability for reasons having      nothing to do with human activity. . . . Against this      backdrop of large, poorly understood natural invariability,      it is impossible for scientists to attribute the recent small      surface temperature increase to human causes.  So, from 1982, there were scientists at ExxonMobil who were aware of it and were saying we have a duty to share this with the public and with our fellow scientists, but by 2000, in statements to the American public--all during Rex Tillerson's tenure at ExxonMobil--the company was taking a very different position.  I summarized this material during my examination of Mr.Tillerson before the Foreign Relations Committee, and I asked him: What do you have to say about this evidence and about the numerous public reports that ExxonMobil knew about climate science but made a decision to tell the American public something different? A pretty straightforward question from a Senator whose State is experiencing climate change, a pretty important question for a nominee who will be in charge of, as Secretary of State, carrying out our obligations under agreements, such as the Paris climate agreement.  Mr.Tillerson's answer to me was a little surprising. He said: Oh, I can't answer this. You are going to have to ask somebody at  He had stepped away from ExxonMobil a few days before the hearing. I was puzzled by it. So I went back to him and I said: Well, wait a minute. I want to make sure I got this right. You were at ExxonMobil for 41 years.  That is right.  You were an executive at ExxonMobil for more than half of your tenure there; isn't that right?  That is right.  You were the CEO of ExxonMobil beginning, I believe, in 2006; am I right about that?  You are right about that.  I am not asking the company's position. You now are no longer at I am asking you, as somebody who is going to be in charge of carrying forward America's obligations under the Paris climate accord, whether the allegation that ExxonMobil knew about climate science but chose to say something different to the American public--I am going to ask you if you can answer that question.  And he came back again and said: You are going to have to ask somebody at  I then asked Mr.Tillerson a really important question. I said this: Do you lack the knowledge to answer my questions or are you refusing to answer my questions?  And he said: A little bit of both. A little bit of both.  And I said to him: You have been there 41 years. I have a hard time believing you don't know the answer to this question. I think you are refusing to answer my question, and he didn't comment on that.  I then followed up with one more question to Mr.Tillerson that I also think was important because I am a lawyer, and I just wanted to make sure I understood this. I asked him: Are you sitting here today subject to any kind of a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit you from answering the question I just posed to you? And he said no, that he was not.  I asked Mr.Tillerson these questions because I am deeply interested in climate change. It affects my State in a significant way, and it is directly relevant to his job, but I asked him for another reason as well. I am just going to talk for a minute about the reason, and I am going to yield to my colleague from Oregon and return later this evening on the other points.  The reason I was asking Mr.Tillerson about this was not just his awareness of science, I was asking him to see whether at this point, as a nominee for Secretary of State of the United States, he could set aside a 41-year loyalty to his previous employer, ExxonMobil, and instead focus solely on his obligations to this country if he were to be confirmed as Secretary of  I believe he knew the answer to the question I asked him, and he told me he was not under any legal agreement that would bar him from answering my question, but he, nevertheless, refused to answer my question. When I challenged him on it and said: You are refusing to answer my question, he basically agreed that was the case.  I think we are entitled to a Secretary of State who can set aside any other loyalty, including an understandable loyalty to an employer of 41 years, and exercise complete and independent judgment on behalf of the interests of this country. The refusal of Mr.Tillerson to answer my questions about a matter clearly within his knowledge, clearly within the job description of Secretary of State and deeply important to my Commonwealth, led me to have significant doubts about whether he could separate his previous employment from his independent obligation to this job, should he be confirmed.  I am going to have more to say on a couple of other issues related to this independence point when I return later this evening.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Kennedy).

1342,topic-id,1361,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise to place in the Record a very important story from The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. It focuses on Steve Mnuchin, President Trump's nominee to be Treasury Secretary, and it raises issues of deep concern.              [From the Columbus Dispatch, 29, 2017] Trump Treasury Pick Mnuchin Misled Senate on Foreclosures, Ohio Cases                                   Show                 (By Alan Johnson and Jill Riepenhoff)       President Donald Trump's nominee for U.treasury      secretary was untruthful with the Senate during the      confirmation process, documents uncovered by The Dispatch      show.       Steve Mnuchin, former chairman and chief executive officer      of OneWest Bank, known for its aggressive foreclosure      practices, flatly denied in testimony before the Senate      Finance Committee that OneWest used ``robo-signing'' on      mortgage documents.       But records show the bank utilized the questionable      practice in       ``The guy is just lying. There's no other way to say it,''      said Bill Faith, executive director of the Coalition on      Homelessness and Housing in       The revelation comes with the committee's vote on whether      to confirm Mnuchin's nomination, currently scheduled for      Monday night.       Barney Keller of Jamestown Associates, who represents      Mnuchin, was asked to comment for this story but did not      respond before deadline. Jamestown Associates is a Washington      political consulting and advertising firm that represented      Trump in his campaign.       ``Robo-signing'' is the informal term for when a mortgage      company employee signs hundreds of foreclosures, swearing      they have scrutinized the documents as required by law when      in fact they have not.       ``OneWest Bank did not `robo-sign' documents,'' Mnuchin      wrote in response to questions from individual senators,      ``and as the only bank to successfully complete the      Independent Foreclosure Review required by federal banking      regulators to investigate allegations of `robo-signing,' I am      proud of our institution's extremely low error rate.''       But a Dispatch analysis of nearly four dozen foreclosure      cases filed by OneWest in Franklin County in 2010 alone shows      that the company frequently used robo-signers. The vast      majority of the Columbus-area cases were signed by 11      different people in Travis County, Those employees      called themselves vice presidents, assistant vice presidents,      managers and assistant secretaries. In three local cases, a      judge dismissed OneWest foreclosure proceedings specifically      based on inaccurate robo-signings.       The Dispatch found more than 1,900 OneWest foreclosures in      the state's six largest counties from 2009 to 2015.       Carla Duncan, a social worker from Cleveland Heights, was      snared by OneWest's robo-signing machinery.       On her way out of town for a short trip in 2010, Duncan      stopped by her home to get her mail and found a note from a      field inspector for her mortgage company saying that her      house was vacant and was going to be boarded up.       ``It wasn't vacant. I was living there,'' Duncan said.      ``There were curtains on the windows. The radio was playing      and the dog was there.''       What Duncan didn't know at the time was that OneWest had      begun foreclosure proceedings on her three-bedroom home even      though she was up-to-date on her payments. OneWest refused to      accept a loan modification approved by a previous lender that      had been purchased by OneWest, and it wanted to substantially      increase Duncan's interest rate and monthly payment and add      late fees. The company also put a lock box on a separate      rental property she owned in       After hiring former Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann, waging      a five-year court battle and filing personal bankruptcy,      Duncan was finally able to get the foreclosures dismissed and      keep her home and rental property. She said the experience      was devastating.       ``It's almost like being raped, like being emotionally      violated,'' Duncan said. ``It got to the point that I was      afraid to open my own door.''       Court records show that Duncan's mortgage was robo-signed      by Erica Johnson-Seck, vice president of OneWest's department      of bankruptcy and foreclosures. From her office in Austin,      Texas, Johnson-Seck robo-signed an average of 750 foreclosure      documents a week, according to a sworn deposition she gave in      a Florida case in July 2009.       Under oath, Johnson-Seck acknowledged that she did not read      the documents she was signing, taking only about 30 seconds      to sign her name. To speed up the process, Johnson-Seck said      she shortened her first name on her signature to just an      ``E.'' She said in the deposition that OneWest's practice was      to review just 10 percent of the foreclosure documents for      accuracy.       Dann, who now specializes in representing clients who have      problems with banks and other lenders after he was forced to      resign as attorney general nearly 10 years ago, said      Mnuchin's businesses were a ``major offender'' in problem      mortgages. Dann said Mnuchin's firms were known for dual      tracking (pursuing foreclosures simultaneously as they      allegedly worked with homeowners), fabricating documents and      other tactics ``that caused unbelievable devastation in      people's lives.''       In 2010, federal laws were changed, enabling borrowers      victimized by lenders to sue them. Dann said he worries that      Mnuchin, as treasury secretary, would quietly work to repeal      reforms, collectively known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street      Reform and Consumer Protection       That appears to be the case.       ``It has been over six years since the passage of Dodd-     Frank and it seems like an appropriate time to review all of      the regulations from Dodd-Frank to understand their impact on      the market, investors, small businesses and economic      growth,'' Mnuchin said in a written answer to the       U.Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, grilled Mnuchin at his      recent hearing and in follow-up written questions.       ``Mnuchin profited off of kicking people out of their homes      and then gave false testimony about his bank's abusive      practices,'' Brown told The ``He cannot be trusted      to make decisions about policies as personal to working      Ohioans as their taxes and retirement.''       Faith, the homelessness coalition director, said      foreclosure practices by Mnuchin's companies and others like      them ``created havoc.''       ``People were bamboozled into signing these mortgages,''      Faith said. ``We watched this train wreck happen. It's been      devastating, not only to the people who got caught in this      kind of scheme, but also to people who happened to live in      the neighborhood . . . . It's scary that he's going to be      treasury secretary.''       The Dispatch analysis showed thousands of Ohio homeowners--     including 245 in Franklin County--found themselves in      OneWest's crosshairs when they defaulted on their loans, the      majority of them with high interest rates. Many mortgages had      terms that housing and financial experts view as predatory:      prepayment penalties, interest-only loans and no-money-down      loans.       In addition to OneWest, which was born in 2009 from the      collapse of subprime mortgage giant IndyMac, Mnuchin's      banking group also acquired Financial Freedom, a subsidiary      of Lehman Brothers that went bankrupt because of its toxic      mortgage portfolio. The firm specialized in loans to senior      citizens cashing in on their homes' equity.       Mnuchin was labeled by critics at the time as the      ``Foreclosure King.''       Of the nearly four dozen foreclosure cases filed by OneWest      in Franklin County in 2010 that were analyzed by The      Dispatch, a quarter were filed within three years of the      homeowner taking out the loan, typically a red flag that      there was a problem with the mortgage terms and/or vetting      the borrowers.       Thirteen of the borrowers had double-digit interest rates,      ranging from 10 percent to 17.31 percent, largely because of      adjustable-rate mortgage terms.       In the cases in which the houses were sold at an auction,      two-thirds ended up in the hands of the federal government,      which had backed those loans. Collectively, more than $4      million was due on those loans.       Only seven borrowers were able to get a loan modification,      even though former President Barack Obama's administration      had been pushing since 2009 for lenders to help Americans      keep their homes by lowering interest rates and, in some      cases, the principal balance.       Mnuchin does have supporters, including the American      Bankers Association, which sent a letter to the Senate      committee saying Mnuchin's ``public statements as well as his      career in finance bring us optimism with regard to the      outlook for public policies focused on growth and      prosperity.''       Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, released      a statement supporting Mnuchin's nomination, in part because      of his stated intention to roll back some of the Dodd-Frank      legislation: ``Mr.Mnuchin has made it clear that reforming      the Dodd-Frank Act will be his `number one priority on the      regulatory side' once he becomes secretary of the treasury.''

1343,topic-id,675,"According to The Columbus Dispatch, Mnuchin was untruthful to the Senate Finance Committee regarding his company's aggressive role in hastening thousands of home foreclosures during the 2000 financial crisis and what followed, and his misdeeds deeply impacted places like  Mr.Mnuchin was the chief executive officer of OneWest Bank, which engaged in so-called robo-signing of mortgage documents. That means you really don't--you treat people like objects; you really don't go into the details of every case.  The Columbus Dispatch said its analysis of dozens of foreclosure cases in Ohio, and subsequent action, prove otherwise.  The dastardly practice of robo-signing, prevalent throughout the mortgage industry in the aftermath of that terrible financial crisis, had certain leaders, of which Mr.Mnuchin was at the top of the heap; and their employees signed foreclosure documents en masse without properly reviewing them and forcing unjust foreclosures.[[Page H756]]  The Columbus Dispatch found more than 1,900 such cases in Ohio alone. Individual cases revealed OneWest Bank declared properties vacant, even though someone was living in them. OneWest Bank, time and again, refused to abide by agreed-upon loan modifications.  Is that the kind of person that we really want in charge of the U.Treasury Department?  Nominee Mnuchin comes with a Goldman Sachs pedigree. Well, wouldn't we know that? He was nicknamed the ``foreclosure king'' after buying up IndyMac, a subprime lender that evicted about 36,000 people during the financial crisis.  Sadly, Mr.Speaker, while President-elect Trump promised to drain the swamp, his nominee for Treasury Secretary proves he is not doing that at all. He is enlarging the swamp.  The Columbus Dispatch found more than 1,900, I repeat, OneWest Bank foreclosures in our State's six largest counties from 2009 to 2015.  In addition, Mr.Mnuchin profited personally off of kicking people out of their homes. Does such a person actually deserve confirmation as Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America?

The arbitrary and discriminatory nature of his order is odd in that he only identified seven countries to be included.  One must ask: Why were other nations excluded? Yes, excluded from the executive order are several Middle Eastern, African, and other nations where The Trump Organization has business interests, including Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, where the majority of 9/11 terrorists originated.  We know Mr.Trump has failed to divest from his company, as ethics experts have duly noted. Every American should wonder whether he designed this executive order with his own business interests, at least, partly in mind. This is the purpose of divestiture, to eliminate any possible question of doubt or possible mal intent.  Without divesting from management and ownership, President Trump's circumstance threatens the basic tenet of the rule of law that the government and all of its actors will discharge duties in the best interest of the American people, not their self-interest or the interests of their cronies or the interest of their brand.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH803-3.txt,616,DIGITAL GLOBAL ACCESS POLICY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,31.0,January

More than 40,000 jihadists fighters, many of whom came from the West, have traveled to[[Page H782]]the battlefield in Syria and With this threat environment in mind, I have introduced H.526.  Initially established at the end of 2010, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board brings together the Department of Homeland Security's top echelon counterterrorism decisionmakers to quickly respond to threats.  While my colleagues and I were conducting the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorists and Foreign Fighter Travel, we found that the Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB as it is referred to, had neither been codified nor had its charter kept pace with evolving terrorist threats.  That is why we need to pass this bill: to ensure that DHS is effectively integrating intelligence, operations, and policy to better compile and understand threat information to successfully fight terrorism.  This legislation formally establishes the CTAB in law and makes it the Department's central coordination body for counterterrorism activities.                              {time}  1500  The bill also updates the Board's charter to effectively respond to tomorrow's challenges and requires the Secretary to appoint a coordinator for counterterrorism to oversee the Board's activities.  Additionally, this legislation requires the CTAB to advise the Secretary of Homeland Security on the issuance of terrorism alerts, ensuring that top counterterrorism intelligence officials play a key role in developing these critical notices and providing them to the public.  Finally, this bill ensures continued congressional oversight by requiring DHS to report on the status and activities of the CTAB so that they can be certain it is meeting its mandate.  I thank Chairman McCaul from the Homeland Security Committee for appointing me to lead the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel last year. This task force produced 32 key findings and more than 50 recommendations, one of which serves as a basis of the legislation before us today.  I am proud to say we have now acted legislatively on more than half of the task force's findings, largely thanks to the hard work of the members of the task force and their willingness to work across the aisle in a bipartisan manner.  I also thank Mr.Thompson, my colleague in the minority, for working in a bipartisan manner on this and many other bills that we have before us today.

And in every instance, the integrity of the airport security infrastructure and the insider threat have been of serious concern.  It is critical that we scrutinize the security effectiveness of our Nation's airports and ensure that the public can have confidence that their travels will be safe and secure during the high-threat environment.  This important piece of legislation requires that the TSA's comprehensive risk assessment of perimeter and access control security is more regularly updated and that TSA conducts a sector-wide assessment of airport access control vulnerabilities and mitigation efforts, something TSA has not done across the board since 2012, despite multiple security breaches at airports across the country.

His doctor ran some tests. The next day, Wayne received an unnerving call asking him to come back in. Before he could make the next appointment, Wayne's insurance provider called his employer to inform the company that its rates would be going up because one of its employees had cancer. Wayne had been a computer technician at his company for 18 years. His boss knew he had not been feeling well, so it was not hard for him to figure out which employee was the cause since Wayne was the only one who was sick. At work the next day, Wayne's boss called him into the office and said he was laying him off because his company couldn't afford the new premium.  Thankfully, Wayne was able to purchase coverage through the insurance exchange. Wayne saw his doctor, got his official diagnosis, and began formulating a plan. Because he was able to purchase health care, even with his having preexisting conditions, Wayne got the lifesaving surgery he needed.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgH619.txt,2025,1415,2017.0,24.0,January
1520,topic-id,541,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in strong support of my legislation H.665, the Airport Perimeter and Access Control Security  Mr.Speaker, I am proud to be joined by my colleague from New York (Mr.Katko), as well as my colleagues, Ranking Member Thompson, and Members Rice, Richmond, and  Since I first was elected to Congress in 2010, I have worked to secure our Nation's airports from porous perimeters and unsecure access control points.  Last year, at my request, the Government Accountability Office released an independent report of all airports within the Transportation Security Administration's presence.  While TSA has made some progress in assessing risks at airport perimeters and access control security points, the GAO report revealed that the agency had not taken emerging threats or the unique makeup and design of individual airports into consideration.  More and more, we have seen that terrorists are targeting the soft areas in our airport perimeters and within the airport itself. Terrorists are looking for these soft targets. We have seen it in We have seen these tragedies in We have seen it in And, sadly, we have seen it here at home in Fort  Updating the risk assessment of airport secured with information that reflects the current threat ensures that TSA bases its decision on the latest information, enabling it to focus limited resources to the highest priority risks to airport security.  The TSA's efforts to access, really, our entire airport security around the country, has been, frankly, inadequate. The numbers are startling. From 2009 to 2015, TSA conducted comprehensive risk assessments at only 81 of the 437 commercial airports nationwide--or 19 percent. Some years, this really represented only 3 percent of the airports that were assessed at all.  The Airport Perimeter and Access Control Security Act will make law the recommendations from the independent report and increase safety at airports nationwide. Further, this bill incorporates the input of major airport operators--whose concerns for lack of individualized security strategy we heard from firsthand.  Last year, the Associated Press revealed that there had been at least 268 perimeter security breaches at 31 major U.airports. From 2004 to 2015, their investigation found that intruders breached airport fences, on average, every 13 days.  This figure includes a fatal incident, a tragic incident that I investigated before I came to Congress as a district attorney when Delvonte Tisdale, a teenager from North Carolina, snuck onto the tarmac at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport and stowed away undetected in a wheel well of a commercial 737 on a flight to  The figures I mentioned really don't account for the many unreported instances of perimeter breaches, including things like trespassers or people that scale the fences around the perimeter.  We are lucky that all of these individuals did not harbor nefarious intentions. But that does not mitigate the risk posed by such behavior at airports, employees and others, and the passengers and travelers who rely on TSA officers and the airport operators for their security.  As you may recall, this legislation passed the House of Representatives with the support of my colleagues last year and has been a long time coming.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr.Speaker, last Congress, the Committee on Homeland Security held several hearings to evaluate Federal, State, and local capabilities to prevent, identify, and respond to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack, a CBRN threat.  Although the State and local stakeholders we heard from were generally aware of the evolving CBRN threat, there was a consistent message from everyone who testified--from public health professionals to emergency managers, to first responders--improved information sharing would make our communities safer.  H.677 would facilitate improved CBRN information sharing by directing DHS to analyze CBRN-related terrorist threats and share relevant threat information with Federal, State, and local stakeholders. These activities will both improve situational awareness at all levels of government and help DHS grant recipients better target their limited grant dollars to address this particular threat.  The CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act passed the House overwhelmingly last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure once again.  Information sharing is at the core of our ability to prevent, thwart, and respond to threats posed by bad actors. H.677 would facilitate information sharing in the CBRN space where the threats are constantly evolving. This commonsense legislation costs next to nothing but will reap significant benefits.

I also want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr.Upton, his staff, and, of course, during his tenure as chairman of the full committee, his staff, along with the staff of Mr.Pallone and the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittees.  We have worked on this legislation for now several years. It did pass unanimously, as Chairman Upton indicated, on a bipartisan passage last year. I am grateful for his acknowledgment of that effort between our teams and that it is on the floor so early in this  Because many of my colleagues have heard me speak about this at length and patiently listened as I dove too far into the weeds about forward capacity auctions, I am hoping to keep this part short and am happy to answer any questions that anyone may have. As the chairman alluded to, New England holds an energy capacity auction to ensure that we have sufficient energy supply to meet consumer demand.  Mr.Speaker, 3 years ago, during an auction where there was a shortfall, those capacity payments tripled, skyrocketing from about $1 billion to $3 billion. That rate increase hasn't even reached our constituents yet, but this June, a significant portion of their bills will triple due to that auction.  When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reviewed that rate increase, they were down to four Commissioners, and they deadlocked 2-2. One Democratic Commissioner and one Republican Commissioner raised concerns about whether those rates were just and reasonable for consumers. Because of the deadlock, those rates took effect by operation of law without any action from With no official decision from the agency, there was no[[Page H569]]decision to appeal, leaving my constituents completely voiceless.  Mr.Speaker, in 2 weeks, our region will hold that same annual auction, once again determining rates that will be passed along to families and businesses in my district 3 years down the road. Once again, FERC is understaffed, without a full complement of Commissioners to consider the new rate filings.  Although the situation may sound complex and unique to New England, there is not a corner of this country that is immune from the unpredictability of American energy markets and the resulting burden our consumers and businesses are forced to bear as a result.

If this was a simple attempt to limit a woman's legal right to abortion or reproductive health care, that would be bad enough. But it is more than that.  Combined with yesterday's reinstatement of the global gag rule, this bill crystallizes the fact that our new GOP-led government sees women's health care as expendable, both within and far beyond our borders.

He watched his own brother burn to death in front of his eyes, and countless members of his family are still missing.  He was a musician back home, but he struggled to keep up his craft as he has fled. A doctor in that health center managed to track down a used trumpet and presented it to that man as a gift.

Additionally, I appreciate the willingness of the associations impacted by this legislation, both the CAI and the ARRL, for working with our offices last Congress in order to come to an agreement on where this legislation needs to be in order to move forward in a bipartisan and a positive manner.  The legislation before us today is the same legislative text as H.1301, which was able to gather over 100 bipartisan cosponsors and passed the House by voice vote in the 114th  The intent of this legislation is to remedy current law which prohibits the use of any antenna for amateur radio operators in certain areas with no consideration for the emergency ramifications that come about as a result. For some, this is merely a nuisance, but for others--those who use[[Page H583]]their amateur radio licenses for emergency communications--a dangerous situation has been established by limiting the ability of hams to create effective communications for those in need.  For example, during times of emergency service, such as following a hurricane or a tornado, amateur radio operators are able to use their skills and equipment to create a network of communications that are utilized by first responders when other wired or wireless networks are taken down or are otherwise unavailable. This is a vital and lifesaving function.  Additionally, there are numerous hams that take their certifications even further by purchasing expensive equipment and going through extensive training to become part of MARS, the Military Auxiliary Radio I have personally used this system as a pilot in the military. What is amazing about MARS is that it gives our military members the ability to communicate both domestically and abroad when other systems are not available or are simply not able to establish communications the way that these hams are able to do.  MARS members are able to accomplish this not only due to their extensive training and knowledge, but due to their commitment to this program. MARS members must not only have access to expensive high-frequency radio equipment, but they must also file monthly reports and participate in a minimum of 12 hours of radio activity each quarter in order to stay in compliance with the requirements of this program. This is a great service provided by these individuals, and it is my hope that we can get even more amateur radio operators involved in the future with the passage of this bill.  Again, the purpose of this bipartisan legislation is to change current regulations hampering the ability of amateur radio operators to effectively communicate in certain areas, while respecting and maintaining the rights of local communities in which many of these hams reside.

I know they have taken some steps to respond to all of the problems we have seen in every State in this Nation, but what really happened was--with the stroke of a pen--the administration excluded entire populations from seeking refuge.  I do think it is a bit forgotten that it is not just the seven or so countries that were identified by the administration.

She finally had gotten her papers to be able to come to America, get out of the refugee camp with her two children, but because she was pregnant when the papers came through, she wasn't able to apply for what would be her third child. The baby was born and she had a ``Sophie's Choice.'' Was she going to stay in the refugee camp with the two older girls or was she going to bring them to safety in America, in Minnesota, with so many friends and relatives whom she knew, and then have to leave the baby behind?  She decided to leave the baby with friends at that refugee camp, and for 4 years she worked to get that baby to She got it done, and that baby was supposed to get on a plane and come to Minnesota this week, courtesy of Lutheran Social Services in Minnesota that had worked with the family. Right now, the latest news our office has had, that is not happening. Why? This 4-year-old is not a green card holder. This 4-year-old is a refugee, a refugee who is coming to finally be with her mom and her sisters. To explain to what looked like about an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old why this is happening is really--there are no words to explain why it is happening.  I truly appreciate it that some of our Republican colleagues joined the chorus to say the vetting rule had not been vetted. Many of them pointed to the implementation problems with this rule, and others, such as Senator McCain and Senator Graham, also talked about the fact that this was simply a self-inflicted wound in our fight against terrorism. We heard much of that.  I know, from my colleagues, what this means to moderates whom we are attempting to work with in these Muslim nations as well as our allies all across the world.  I leave you with this. This is about our economy. I remind our friends, and I know--I see Senator Rubio here who understands the economic value of immigration--that over 70 of the Fortune 500 companies in America are led by immigrants, including in my State, 3M, Best Buy, Mosaic; that 25 percent of our U.Nobel laureates were born in other countries; that at one point I had the figure that 200 of our Fortune 500 companies were started by immigrants or kids of immigrants. That is our economy.  There is the moral argument, best reflected in the story I just told of those two little girls in their bright pink jackets in the middle of a Minnesota winter, but then there is also the security argument. So we plead with the administration to reverse this rule, to rescind it.  Certainly, we can work on more vetting measures. As we know, the refugee vetting already takes 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, more work with biometrics, but there is no reason to do this on the backs of people who have followed the rules, who have followed the regulations and have done what is right and simply want to be part of our country or, in most cases, are already part of our country.

Madam Speaker, H.589, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act, sets congressional priorities for basic science research and nuclear energy R& This legislation also includes text from my bill from the last Congress, H.5638, the Solar Fuels Innovation This language directs the Department of Energy to establish a basic research initiative in solar fuels. The solar fuel process, also known as artificial photosynthesis, harnesses energy from sunlight to create a range of storable chemical fuels, overcoming the biggest obstacle to maximizing the benefits of renewable technologies.  Researchers up and down the coast of California are undertaking this research from universities in southern California to the Berkeley lab in the Bay area. The research authorized in this legislation could solve this key scientific challenge and open the door for American entrepreneurs to develop the next generation of solar technology and train the next generation of researchers in chemistry, physics, and materials science.  H.589 reaffirms the Federal Government's key role in research and development. My home State of California has long been a world leader in advanced science and high tech and is home to millions of entrepreneurs who are eager to engage and take advantage of the latest breakthroughs. Today we hear a lot of enthusiasm for clean energy, but the focus is on today's technology, not on fundamentally new approaches to energy technology that we make possible through early-stage research. In Congress, it is our responsibility to take the long-term view and be patient and make smart investments in basic research that can lead to the next big discovery. H.589 establishes those long-term priorities.  This bill makes other important adjustments to the flexibility and utilization of DOE assets to give the U.S.' private sector a stronger edge, from the national laboratory partnerships with research groups to allowing the nuclear energy businesses to do their early-stage work on DOE sites, giving a huge boost to an industry that is about to take off.

Earlier this month, under President Obama, the Federal Housing Administration announced a plan to make mortgages more affordable for nearly 1 million working and middle class families who are buying their first homes. In his first hours in office, President Trump reversed President Obama's plan with an executive action that will cost Americans an average of $500 more per year to get a mortgage. Experts project that 40,000 families who would have bought homes will no longer be able to do so.  The Trump administration's order to make mortgages more expensive will not strengthen our economy; it will not create jobs; it will not make America great again--but it will make life harder for working families.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgH618-5.txt,2325,44TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V.

Caller ID spoofing occurs when a scammer calls and attempts to disguise his or her identity by manipulating the recipient caller's caller ID display. The scammer may be posing as an IRS agent, a police officer, or a representative from another governmental agency. After tricking people in picking up the line, the criminal then attempts to entice the other person to giving up personal information.  To date, hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, have been defrauded, including veterans, immigrants, and senior citizens. In Somerset County, New Jersey, a county which I represent here in the House, scammers cloned the telephone number of the county sheriff's office and impersonated the sheriff's staff in an effort to steal residents' personal information.  This problem has gotten out of control. Millions of Americans continue to get ripped off by con artists and scammers who perpetuate this despicable crime.  Since Congress passed the Truth in Caller ID Act in 2009, new technologies have enabled these criminals to scam consumers with increased ease and efficiency.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                                H.555       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Amateur Radio Parity Act of      2017''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) More than 730,000 radio amateurs in the United States      are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission in the      amateur radio services.       (2) Amateur radio, at no cost to taxpayers, provides a      fertile ground for technical self-training in modern      telecommunications, electronics technology, and emergency      communications techniques and protocols.       (3) There is a strong Federal interest in the effective      performance of amateur stations established at the residences      of licensees. Such stations have been shown to be frequently      and increasingly precluded by unreasonable private land use      restrictions, including restrictive covenants.       (4) Federal Communications Commission regulations have for      three decades prohibited the application to stations in the      amateur service of State and local regulations that preclude      or fail to reasonably accommodate amateur service      communications, or that do not constitute the minimum      practicable regulation to accomplish a legitimate State or      local purpose. Commission policy has been and is to require      States and localities to permit erection of a station antenna      structure at heights and dimensions sufficient to accommodate      amateur service communications.       (5) The Commission has sought guidance and direction from      Congress with respect to the application of the Commission's      limited preemption policy regarding amateur service      communications to private land use restrictions, including      restrictive covenants.       (6) There are aesthetic and common property considerations      that are uniquely applicable to private land use regulations      and the community associations obligated to enforce      covenants, conditions, and restrictions in deed-restricted      communities. These considerations are dissimilar to those      applicable to State law and local ordinances regulating the      same residential amateur radio facilities.       (7) In recognition of these considerations, a separate      Federal policy than exists at section 97.15(b) of title 47,      Code of Federal Regulations, is warranted concerning amateur      service communications in deed-restricted communities.       (8) Community associations should fairly administer private      land use regulations in the interest of their communities,      while nevertheless permitting the installation and      maintenance of effective outdoor amateur radio antennas.      There exist antenna designs and installations that can be      consistent with the aesthetics and physical characteristics      of land and structures in community associations while      accommodating communications in the amateur radio services.     3. APPLICATION OF PRIVATE LAND USE RESTRICTIONS TO                    AMATEUR       (a) Amendment of FCC Rules.--Not later than 120 days after      the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal      Communications Commission shall amend section 97.15 of title      47, Code of Federal Regulations, by adding a new paragraph      that prohibits the application to amateur stations of any      private land use[[Page H582]]     restriction, including a restrictive covenant, that--       (1) on its face or as applied, precludes communications in      an amateur radio service;       (2) fails to permit a licensee in an amateur radio service      to install and maintain an effective outdoor antenna on      property under the exclusive use or control of the licensee;      or       (3) does not constitute the minimum practicable restriction      on such communications to accomplish the lawful purposes of a      community association seeking to enforce such restriction.       (b) Additional Requirements.--In amending its rules as      required by subsection (a), the Commission shall--       (1) require any licensee in an amateur radio service to      notify and obtain prior approval from a community association      concerning installation of an outdoor antenna;       (2) permit a community association to prohibit installation      of any antenna or antenna support structure by a licensee in      an amateur radio service on common property not under the      exclusive use or control of the licensee; and       (3) subject to the standards specified in paragraphs (1)      and (2) of subsection (a), permit a community association to      establish reasonable written rules concerning height,      location, size, and aesthetic impact of, and installation      requirements for, outdoor antennas and support structures for      the purpose of conducting communications in the amateur radio      services.     4. AFFIRMATION OF LIMITED PREEMPTION OF STATE AND LOCAL                    LAND USE       The Federal Communications Commission may not change      section 97.15(b) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations,      which shall remain applicable to State and local land use      regulation of amateur service communications.     5.       In this Act:       (1) Community association.--The term ``community      association'' means any non-profit mandatory membership      organization composed of owners of real estate described in a      declaration of covenants or created pursuant to a covenant or      other applicable law with respect to which a person, by      virtue of the person's ownership of or interest in a unit or      parcel, is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes,      insurance premiums, maintenance, improvement, services, or      other expenses related to common elements, other units, or      any other real estate other than the unit or parcel described      in the declaration.

Mr.Speaker, amateur radio, also known as ham radio, is a fun hobby for enthusiasts who use it to communicate with people around the world while teaching themselves the basics of communications technology. But more importantly, amateur radio operators utilize their skills to provide essential communication services to first responders when the conventional networks go down in times of emergency.  In order to be eligible to operate an amateur radio station, individuals must obtain a license from the FCC and comply with the FCC's rules. One such requirement is that individuals must own and install the equipment needed to operate a station. This includes a transceiver, transmission lines, and an antenna. Currently, there are more than 730,000 amateur radio operators licensed in the United States, including a number of active clubs in New Jersey, the State I represent in the  Because communications equipment provides a societal benefit and is a critical part of our Nation's infrastructure, the FCC prohibits land use restrictions imposed by governments or homeowners' associations on certain communications equipment. However, these protections do not extend to amateur radio equipment.  Roughly 90 percent of new housing in the United States is subject to deed restrictions, homeowners' associations, and other land use limitations. This is increasingly making the installation of amateur radio equipment more challenging.  Amateur radio operators have a history and tradition of being ready, willing, and able to lend their services during times of emergencies at no cost to taxpayers. Due to the nature and structure of amateur radio, hams are able to link communications between first responders using their own networks and equipment.  The only necessity for amateur radio stations, however, is some form of outdoor antenna. For this group of unsung heroes with a long tradition of public service when it is needed most, Congress should help deter barriers to their operation. H.555 would extend the FCC protections over limitations on communications equipment to include amateur radio equipment.  Now, while I have described the critical role that amateur radio plays during times of disaster, I also understand the concerns shared by homeowners' associations that this bill will expose their neighborhoods to big towers and antennas.

313,topic-id,538,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.460, the Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act, a bill that earned unanimous support in the last  Consumers expect to be able to pick up the telephone and be connected with businesses, friends, and loved ones across the country. In today's connected world, that should not be a tall request. Unfortunately, for many constituents across the country, particularly in rural areas, call quality and reliability are just not up to par compared to their urban counterparts.  This is due, partly, because of the call routing process where long distance and wireless providers use so-called least cost routers. These inexpensive third-party intermediate providers try to complete calls for the lowest possible price, without taking measures to ensure the call actually goes through.  I am sure that most of us have experienced the annoyance of at least one failed or dropped call. You make a call to someone and it rings over and over again but no one, not even the voicemail, picks up. Or, maybe you place a call, only to hear a prerecorded message telling you that the number you dialed is not in service, even though you know you have the right number. Even in cases where you are able to connect, the sound might be distorted or delayed.  For many constituents, this is more than just an annoyance. These missed connections have significant consequences.  Folks rely on the networks for more than just staying in touch with loved ones. Our constituents count on reliable networks to run their businesses and receive messages from our community institutions. A failed call can mean a lost sale for a small rural business. Another failed call might mean that a message from your child's school or your medical provider goes undelivered. These are real and harmful impacts. This bill will address this situation through commonsense improvements.  For the most part, consumers are unaware of these intermediate providers, which has allowed them to be held unaccountable. H.460 takes measured steps to bring these intermediate providers out from the shadows and into the light so that we can hold them accountable to the consuming public.  First, the bill requires intermediate providers to register with the FCC, and it prohibits carriers from using any nonregistered provider. The bill also requires the FCC to establish a database and publish the list of registered providers on its Web site. Finally, the bill requires the FCC to establish quality standards for these intermediate providers, which will raise the bar for all of the providers who provide call routing services.  These straightforward measures are another step in our effort, on a bipartisan basis, to mitigate call completion and quality issues for the consuming public. This bill will build upon the work the FCC has done in recent years.

Mr.Speaker, this bill is an important step toward modernizing the Federal Communications The FCC has served Americans since 1934, and over the past more than 80 years, this agency has been responsible for overseeing the evolving telecommunications sector, with collecting information and analyzing the state of competition, and the impact of these changes on consumers.  As society has moved from one technology to the next, the FCC has been asked to keep up with the changing technologies, and Congress has directed the Commission with reviewing data and reporting on everything from the telegraph, as Mr.Scalise has indicated, and the AM radio to online video distributions like Hulu and This bill will eliminate reports that are no longer necessary and waste time and resources on issues that are no longer critical to consumers.  The bill also recognizes that technology continues to progress and consumers are no longer served by separate voice, data, or video networks. Rather, providers are leveraging the same IP network to provide multiple services over the same network. Providers that were solely video providers now offer voice and data. Companies that thought of themselves as telephone providers are also offering video and broadband services. The game has changed, and we believe that the FCC should change its reporting to reflect the new reality.  This bill consolidates multiple annual or biennial reports that require the agency to evaluate competition in different sectors. We will no longer require a separate mobile wireless or a separate video competition report. Rather, the bill requires the Commission to evaluate the state of competition across multiple tech industries in a single biennial report on competition in the communications marketplace. Our policymakers should be looking at the world as it is, not the world that once existed.  I thank the majority whip for his leadership in sponsoring this bill.

327,topic-id,1425,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  At our subcommittee hearing last April, we heard the very moving testimony of Mr.Hank Hank told us the story of how his daughter Kari was brutally murdered in a Texas motel bathroom in December 2013. As emotional as his story was, Hank continued with the gut wrenching details of how Kari's daughter frantically tried and failed to reach first responders.  The little girl had done as she was always taught, dial 911 for help. Tragically, as it turns out, that was her mistake. Due to the configuration of the phone installed in the motel room, she needed to dial 9 before dialing an outside number. Time after time she tried, but the call never went through. The first responders who could have attempted to save Kari's life were not reached in time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of this commonsense bill that has the ability to save lives. Unfortunately, it[[Page H589]]cost the life of Kari Hunt before the call for action was recognized.  Multiline telephone systems, like the one in that Texas motel room, are everywhere. Many businesses, including hotels, offices, and schools, use MLTS at their facilities across the country. They serve a very practical purpose and make connecting to other onsite users much easier. Unfortunately, many of these phones do not preset with the ability directly to dial 911.  It may be routine for someone who works in an office to know to dial 9 before dialing out, but would the instinct seem so natural during an emergency? Incidentally, I have telephones in offices here and in several district locations in New Jersey, and in some of those offices you dial 9 and in some you don't.  Moreover, our children should not have to be taught that sometimes they need to dial an extra number. 911 should mean 911. Those three numbers are one of the earliest things many parents teach their children. Kari's Law would require multiline telephone systems to be configured with the ability directly to dial 911 without any additional prefix.                              {time}  1730  The law would also require that multiline phone systems be configured to notify a central location within the system's facility when someone initiates a call to 911. This provision will help ensure first responders have the information needed to better locate and assist the caller.  There are some businesses, including a number of hotel chains, who have shown initiative and applied these changes in their facilities already. I commend them, but there is more work to be done. These simple fixes should be adopted and implemented nationwide. When dialing to reach emergency responders, it needs to go through, period.  I thank Hank Hunt, Kari's father, who has been a tireless advocate for this legislation. He has brought this important issue to our attention. Kari's Law passed without objection twice last Congress, and I urge all of my colleagues to support Representative Gohmert's bill once again. Representative Gohmert has certainly taken the lead on this across the United He is an angel of mercy in this regard. I hope this legislation becomes law this year and will be signed into law by our new President because I think it is critical for the safety of the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                    H.582 Kari's Law Act of 2017                  BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATTON       Multi-Line Telephone Systems (MLTS) serve multiple      telephone users at a single site, often an office building,      hotel, university campus, or similar location. One common      feature of MLTS is the configuration that permits shorter      dialing sequences within the system by requiring a user to      dial a digit or prefix to reach a number outside of the      system--that is, dial ``9'' before reaching an outside line.      Thus, on some MLTS a user may have to dial the prefix when      attempting to make an emergency call. In December 2013, Kari      Hunt was killed by her estranged husband in a motel room in      Her daughter repeatedly attempted to dial 9-1-1 from      the motel room, but was unable to reach emergency responders      because the motel's MLTS required users to dial ``9'' to      reach an outside line.       Kari's Law seeks to ensure that this situation does not      result in confusion in the heat of an emergency, preventing      others from accessing essential emergency services from an      MLTS phone. While many hotels and office buildings have begun      to make this change to their systems, this bill would make it      a universal requirement. H.582 requires that all MLTS have      a default configuration that allows users to directly dial 9-     1-1, without the need for any additional digit or prefix,      from any phone with dialing facilities. In addition, the      system must also be configured to notify a designated central      point of contact when someone initiates a call to 9-1-1 using      the system. By notifying a central point of contact,      emergency responders are better able to access, locate, and      assist a caller who initiates a 9-1-1 call within the             SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION       Section 1. Short title       Section 1 provides that the Act may be cited as the      ``Kari's Law Act of 2017.''       Section 2. Configuration of multi-line telephone systems      for direct dialing of 9-1-1       Section 2(a) adds a new Section 721 to the Communications      Act of 1934, as amended.       New Section 721(a) requires that any person manufacturing,      selling, importing, or leasing multi-line telephone systems      only do so if the system is pre-configured in a way that a      user may directly initiate a call to 9-1-1 without dialing      any additional digits or prefixes. This section applies to      any system that is sold, leased, offered, or imported for use      in the United States after the effective date. This includes      systems that have call control located outside of the U.S.,      but have terminals or end points in the U.While systems      are required to be pre-configured with the default dialing      pattern described in this section, it does not preclude the      inclusion of additional optional dialing patterns to reach 9-     1-1 (e.g. (9)9-1-1). However, if the system is configured      with these additional dialing patterns, they must be in      addition to the default pattern.       New Section 721(b) requires that any person who installs,      operates, or manages a MLTS only do so if the system is      configured such that a user may directly initiate a call to      9-1-1 without any additional digit or prefix. This section      also applies to systems installed, managed, or operated for      use in the United       New Section 721(c) requires that systems be configured to      provide a notification to either a central location at the      facility where the system is located, or to a contact person      or organization regardless of location. This section is      intended to assist first responders in their emergency      response by providing access and information needed to locate      the caller. This can be particularly important in large      buildings like hotels, hospitals, and schools, where on-site      personnel are uniquely suited to provide information about      the building and its occupants. This provision requires the      system to designate a central point of contact, but allows      the MLTS owner or operator some flexibility in determining      the most appropriate contact, whether in the building or      otherwise.       This subsection only applies to systems where the      configuration is achievable without an improvement to the      hardware or software of the system. The Committee intends      this provision to include upgrades to the core systems of a      MLTS, but not the addition of additional extensions or lines.      The Committee also intends this provision to apply to      substantial upgrades to the software, particularly those      requiring a significant purchase. Minor software upgrades      that are easily achieved or are made to improve the security      of the system would not be considered an ``improvement'' for      the purposes of this section. The legislation seeks to      balance the need for an onsite notification with the goal of      not placing an undue burden on MLTS owners or operators.       New Section 721(d) clarifies that this legislation does not      alter the authority of state or local agencies with      jurisdiction over emergency communications, as long as that      authority isn't exercised in a manner inconsistent with this      legislation.       New Section 721(e) allows for enforcement under Title V of      the Communications Act, but only to the extent that the      section allows for the imposition of a fine.       New Section 721(f) defines multi-line telephone system by      crossreferencing the definition in Section 6502 of the Middle      Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.       Section 2(b) sets an effective date for the changes at two      years after the date of enactment of the  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH588.txt,1936,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,23.0,January

1583,topic-id,1519,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong support of H.612, the United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, let me start by thanking Chairman Ratcliffe for his leadership on the subcommittee and, in particular, on the issue of cybersecurity. I have greatly enjoyed our partnership on this and many issues. I appreciate his due diligence and his hard work on many national security issues.  Let me also start by expressing my deep gratitude to Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson in acting so quickly to bring this bill to the floor. Both the chairman and ranking member led a very productive committee last Congress, and I am very pleased that their commitment to protect our national security has extended to swift action this year as well. That urgency is particularly relevant to this bill, the United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement  As Chairman Ratcliffe mentioned, last May, he and I traveled to Israel to meet with public and private cybersecurity officials. I think I can speak for my friend when I say that we were very impressed by the Israeli's efforts in this space. Israel was one of the first countries to recognize the potential threat posed by interconnected computer systems, and they have been leaders in cybersecurity now for decades.  For instance, the first stateful firewall technology was first developed by an Israeli firm. Today, these firewalls are ubiquitous across the information security landscape. In fact, despite its size, Israel is the second largest exporter of cybersecurity goods and services, behind only the United U.companies have certainly taken notice. Mr.Ratcliffe and I, as he mentioned, met with some of their representatives during our trip.  Just last week, Reuters reported that one of the components of Microsoft's $1 billion per year cybersecurity strategy is acquisition of three Israeli corporations.  Collaboration with our closest Middle East ally only makes sense from a national security perspective. Preserving Israeli security is essential to stability in the region.  We clearly have a lot to learn from each other as well, which is why I have championed government-to-government interaction on cybersecurity, such as the recent letter of intent for more information-sharing between DHS and Israel that was championed by former Deputy Secretary  Beyond our governments working together, Chairman Ratcliffe and I also believe the government can do more to encourage collaboration between our private sector and nonprofit entities on issues directly relevant to homeland security. That is why, upon our return, we worked in close collaboration to develop two bills to enhance these cooperative relationships.  I could not have asked for a better partnership in this effort. I was thrilled that our first bill, the United States-Israel Advanced Research Partnership Act, was signed into law last month. It is our second bill, which passed the House in November, but failed to make[[Page H800]]it through the Senate before Congress adjourned last year, that we are discussing today.  Specifically, this bill creates a cybersecurity grant program for joint research and development ventures between Israeli and American entities. Projects would be selected after a merit review process and would have to address requirements in cybersecurity determined by the Secretary of Homeland The grants would also be subject to a cost-sharing requirement, with at least 50 percent of project funds coming from a non-Federal source.  Importantly, H.612 leverages existing United States-Israel R&D infrastructure, specifically the Binational Industrial Research and Development, or BIRD Foundation, and the Binational Science Foundation, or Both organizations have a proven track record of encouraging joint research ventures.                              {time}  1645  BIRD, for instance, has financed R&D and commercialization projects that have led to a cumulative $8 billion in commercial sales since its founding, while BSF regularly funds collaborations between the top scientists in our respective countries as 45 Nobel laureates have received support from the  Now, using the existing infrastructure, as was done in 2007 when Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act that led to the creation of BIRD Energy, also allows us to capitalize on both foundations' robust networks of United States and Israeli entities to help seed these joint ventures. All of these factors are particularly critical in the fast-moving cybersecurity domain where offensive and defensive tactics and techniques change on a monthly or even weekly basis.  As such, advances in the discipline require a near constant reexamining of assumptions, and having people from different backgrounds and security cultures working together engenders an environment where such reexamination is encouraged. While both the U.and Israel have robust cybersecurity communities, further collaboration will spur more advances to combat the threats that we face.  Although some of these advances are technological in nature, basic cybersecurity research, such as investigations into the psychology of secure interface design and social engineering, is also supported by the bill. All told, the programs authorized in H.612 will both address urgent homeland security needs and build capacity for further transnational collaboration on cybersecurity, all while matching Federal investment with private sector dollars and funds from the Israeli  Mr.Speaker, I normally preface my remarks on cybersecurity with an explanation of the threat our country faces. I would hope that, given recent events, I don't have to remind my colleagues of the dangers that we face in this sphere which, as I see it, is one of the key national security challenges of the 21st century.  I would hope that incidents like the recent attack on the Ukrainian power grid demonstrate the power of a computer keyboard to affect our critical infrastructure. I would hope that the breach of hundreds of millions of accounts at Yahoo, which affected around 10 percent of the world's population, demonstrates how pervasive data collection is and its vulnerabilities. I would certainly hope that the Russian information warfare operations targeting the very foundations of our democracy, our elections, demonstrate the stakes that we face.  In the face of these threats, we must join together with our allies to protect a free and open internet and ensure that the amazing benefits of technology are not overshadowed by the new vulnerabilities that they open up. Mr.Speaker, H.612 is an important step to driving the innovation we need in the security space to meet these two goals.  As with any bills that make it to the floor, this bill owes much to the dedicated staff on both sides of the aisle who spent countless hours behind the scenes reviewing this legislation. I thank them for their extraordinary and exceptional work.  I am also very grateful, again, to Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Richmond for their continued leadership on cybersecurity and, in particular, Chairman Ratcliffe for his work and for their assistance in quickly actualizing the lessons that we have learned on our trip to  Finally, in closing, I owe, once again, a debt of gratitude to my friend across the aisle, Chairman Ratcliffe, who, in his first term, immediately had a substantial impact on our Nation's cybersecurity and with whom it has been a great pleasure to work. I look forward to our continued work in this Congress and beyond.  Mr.Speaker, H.612 does three things: it encourages innovative approaches to address top priorities in homeland security R&D; it strengthens ties with Israel, one of our closest allies; and it does so in a public-private partnership that matches Federal investment.  Mr.Speaker, if you indulge me for a moment, I would like to read something the Saudi Arabian Computer Emergency Response Team put out last week: ``Following a recent cyberattack which targeted several national organizations, this is an urgent call for your cybersecurity team to be on the alert for Shamoon 2 and ransomware attacks that could possibly cripple your organization's systems.''  For those of my colleagues who are not aware, the Shamoon attacks of 2012 took down tens of thousands of computers at the Saudi state oil company, Saudi The Shamoon 2 variant has been targeting Saudi Government agencies and private industry since  I bring this up, Mr.Speaker, because open source intelligence reports point to Iran as being responsible for the original Shamoon attack. I believe there is a good chance that Iranian-aligned actors are behind the recent incidents as well. Our Israeli partners live under this threat every day, and, to be frank, so do we.  Last year, the Justice Department indicted seven Iranian hackers for attacks on the U.financial sector and for probing the networks of a New York dam. The same threats that leave me unable to sleep keep my friend Matania, head of the Israel National Cyber Bureau, up at night as well.  Closing our aperture of vulnerability will be difficult, Mr.Speaker, but it is possible if we work together to bring our countries' unique perspectives to bear on the problem. I know my colleagues in the Senate share these sentiments, and I hope they will move quickly to take this bill up and start fostering further collaboration as soon as possible.  Let me again thank Chairman Ratcliffe for his leadership and his outstanding work on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.612.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

He gets this information. He understands the constitutional implications. He is also a top graduate of West Point, serving in the Army as well. He knows what it means to be able to defend this country. He is one of the most qualified people out there to possibly serve in this role, understanding the legal implications, having 6 years of service on the House Intelligence Committee, understanding the background, what it means to seek real oversight and to be able to struggle through these issues.  He is a person of great integrity, and he is a person who will passionately help protect the He is a person who holds tremendous respect for the people serving in our intelligence community--people who most of us will never, ever meet but work every single day to be able to keep our Nation secure. These are individuals who are also passionate about not only keeping our Nation secure but also maintaining the constitutional protections we have always had as a nation.  I heard a lot of the debate today, and I have been astounded at some of the conversations coming out. Let me just recap a couple of these things that I have heard because it was surprising to me. On the issue of advice and consent from the Senate, it seems that some people have not actually read the written testimony and the questions for the record that Mike Pompeo has put out there or listened to his actual testimony or maybe seen his voting record when he was in the House of For instance, there is this conversation sitting out there about torture--that he is going to somehow promote torture. He has stated over and over again that he would abide by the law and the Army Field That is what every candidate would say on that. That is the actual law. He has been very clear on that; he doesn't promote torture. I don't know what else he would have to say. Yet it continues to come up that somehow the head of the CIA is going to promote torture.  I have also heard that he wants to keep Gitmo open. Well, I would stand in line with him on that one. For those of us who have actually been to Guantanamo Bay and have seen it, it is a modern prison facility. It is not some dog cage out there that is holding people out in the weather. Neither is it a place that is doing torture. Guantanamo Bay is a place where the worst of the worst terrorists are being detained and held for trial. The issue of the past 8 years wasn't just that the Obama administration was working as hard as they could to release as many terrorists as they could from there; it is that they weren't taking them to trial. That is the right action--not to do indefinite detention but to actually work toward trial for these individuals. But in the meantime, they should be held at Guantanamo Bay, which is a modern prison facility, and it is the appropriate spot to be able to hold terrorists offshore.  Then there are all of these conversations about collecting data, as if Mike Pompeo wants to scan through all of our Facebook pages. May I remind everyone that the Central Intelligence Agency is focused on foreign intelligence gathering--outward facing. The FBI is focused on the United States, on what is happening with U.persons. The CIA has strict prohibitions from gathering data on U.persons. The comments he made about gathering any kind of information on social networks and about gathering from what is publicly available is something all of us, I think, should support. If anyone outside the United States--whether they be in Pakistan, whether they be in Syria, or wherever they may be--is on social networks talking about the destruction of the United States, I would assume someone is tracking that, and that someone would be the We would hold the head of the CIA to account, saying: Weren't you tracking this terrorist's Facebook page, at least? Weren't you tracking their Twitter account? So for him to make a public statement that we should gather information on social media, I think all of us would agree, hopefully, that, yes, on foreign terrorists we should gather as much as we can possibly gather from the publicly available information, whatever it may be. Comments about his wanting to expand data collection fly in the face of reality when he voted as a Member of the House of Representatives to limit data collection.  I have no issue supporting Mike He is very experienced, he is very well educated, he is well prepared for the task, and he is passionate about keeping our Nation safe within the bounds of the law. That is what we[[Page S384]]want a CIA Director to do: to passionately go to work to honor our civil liberties. We want to make sure he is standing up for us every single day. In the moments when our Nation is asleep, we want to know the great folks of the CIA are awake and watching because the threats that we face internationally are very real.  I am glad Mike Pompeo is going to be at the watch. I look forward to voting for him in a very few minutes.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

925,topic-id,2497,"Mr.President, in 2010, when I ran for Congress, all the questions circled around the Affordable Care Every townhall meeting, every conversation, everyone who caught me in the grocery store, everywhere I went there was a conversation about the Affordable Care What is going to happen? Where are things going to go? And there was a lot of concern about it.  The President promised at the time that if you liked your insurance, your doctor, and your hospital, you would keep it, and it would just get better. Prices would go down; options for insurance would go up. There would be marketplaces where more and more companies would rush in, and that would drive the prices down.  Now, 7 years later, the greatest fears of a lot of the Oklahomans I am around all the time have come true. Here is the crisis in Oklahoma dealing with health care: We have the highest rate increase in the entire Last year, our rates went up in Oklahoma 76 percent; the year before that, they went up 35 percent. That is an 111-percent rate increase in 2 years in my Over the course of the last 3 years, insurance companies have left my All 77 counties of Oklahoma now have one insurance carrier left. I met with that insurance carrier before, and they are seriously looking at how they stay functional in Oklahoma in the days ahead, which is a concern to me. There is a possibility that we may have zero on our marketplace in some counties and in some locations in  With a 76-percent increase, I have had some folks who caught me and said: Well, your State didn't expand That is the problem. If you had expanded Medicaid, then it wouldn't have been an issue. Well, I will tell you that a study from HHS has now come back, and they have confirmed that it is true. If our State would have expanded Medicaid, it would have reduced our costs by 7 percent. That means instead of having a 76-percent increase, as we had, we would have had only a 69-percent increase of health care costs in our[[Page S431]]Zero competition, dramatically higher deductibles, dramatically higher premiums--every hospital in my State, rural and urban, has more charity care now and more bad debt now than they had 7 years ago.  Insure Oklahoma, a program we set up a decade ago to take care of people who did not have access to insurance, continues to falter because my State is playing ``Mother May I?'' every year with the Federal Government on whether we can maintain a program that our State had and was growing. Small risk pools are not allowed. People still don't know the price of their health care. Electronic health records still can't talk to each other. There is still a rise in the cost of prescription drugs. We still have overlapping administrative costs on dual eligibles, Medicare and Medicaid, for senior adults. Compliance costs for our doctors, clinics, and hospitals have skyrocketed. Physician-owned hospitals, which we have quite a few of in Oklahoma, have been cut off and limited since 2010 and are slowly struggling just to be able to stay afloat. Fewer doctors are taking Medicare and Medicaid patients.  On the horizon, it gets even worse because most people don't realize that the Affordable Care Act was backloaded and that the worst of the worst of it wouldn't be for several years out. Well, guess what. It is now several years out.  Union households in my State are about to take a major hit with the Cadillac tax that is coming because union households in my State have insurance that is too good, and those individuals will face a tax increase.  The insurance company tax is coming, which is a massive tax increase on insurance companies. They will pass that cost directly down to consumers, so it will go up again. We continue to fight off the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a board specifically set up to be able to cut options for patients if they cost too much. That is still out there on the horizon, not to mention the tax penalties that go up even more next year.  People ask me: Why are you still focused on repealing ObamaCare? Why is this such a big deal? It is because the people in my State are struggling under the negative effects of this, and it has to be dealt with. Let me just give you a couple of real life stories.  An Oklahoman from Altus, OK, in the southwest part of my State wrote me and he said:       Senator Lankford, I came home tonight . . . having finished      cotton harvest and looking forward to celebrating with my      wife and kids. I was greeted at the supper table with somber      news about our health care premiums from my distraught wife.      Our premium is going from $960 a month to $1,755 per month!      That's with a deductible of $6,000. I can't even process how      to handle this. I think I'm through. Done with any hope of a      bright future for my family.  An Oklahoman from Poteau, OK, wrote me and said:       My husband and I have had Healthcare Marketplace health      insurance for the past 3 years. The first year my monthly      premium was over $1,200.00, this year I pay $1,923.84      monthly. Now I get a letter from [my health insurance      carrier] that my monthly premium will [go up next year to]      $3,540.07. That is an increase of approx. 84%. . . . How is      this possible? Why can't anything be done about this?  When individuals ask me about ObamaCare, they say: You are just arguing about something because of disdain for the No, this is what we have disdain for; this is what people are frustrated about: People who work, people who pay for their health care insurance cannot pay their mortgage and their health insurance anymore because they are literally priced out of it. This is what Bill Clinton meant in October of last year when he made this statement:       So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25      million more people have health care and then the people who      are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up      with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.      It's the craziest thing in the world.  I could not agree with Bill Clinton more on that because that is exactly what is happening in  But now, here is what is happening because for years Americans and Oklahomans have said: We have to do something to stop this. It is choking out my family.  We are finally at a point we are going to do something about it, but I have colleagues who are now spreading fear all over the country that suddenly everyone is going to be thrown off their insurance and we are going to have people living out on the streets without coverage.  I have heard on the floor of this Senate that 30 million people could die if we repeal I have heard 20 million people will lose their insurance. I have heard there is no replacement plan, and people will get sick because their coverage will be gone.  Well, let me just go through a couple of those because there are people calling my office and writing me who are very concerned. They are cancer patients, they are diabetics, they are people with long-term blood diseases, they are people who have difficulty getting insurance, and they are being told: All those mean Republicans up there don't like you and don't care about you, and all they want to do is throw you out on the street. When people say that, it couldn't be further from the truth. It may make for good politics, but it is using people who are in a very vulnerable spot in a negative way.  First, let me get a couple of facts straight. This ``30 million'' number that is being thrown around--even past President Obama doesn't agree with that. It is not 30 million; in fact, it is not 20 million. It is 14 million people who gained access to health care coverage, if you count the people who have actually gained coverage and paid for their premiums through the course of the year or have been a part of the expansion of Of those 14 million people, 11.8 million gained additional coverage from Medicaid, not from the exchanges, and, of that, almost 12 million people got expanded coverage from Jonathan Gruber, as one of the architects of ObamaCare, made the statement that from their own studies, the vast majority of those people who were added to Medicaid weren't added to Medicaid because of expanded coverage; they were added to Medicaid because of promotions through advertising. They were already eligible for  So we are talking about 6 million people or so that have been added to it. I am not belittling those 6 million people; that is a lot of people. But it is not 20 million, and it is not 30 million.  So now what? As people address this to me, they ask about what just happened on January 6 when the Senate and later when the House voted to start the legislative process to repeal What happened was we just actually started the process. It wasn't a total repeal. No one has been thrown out. It starts a legislative process.  As we start that legislative process of what is called reconciliation and as we work through that process, it is a very simple process. It starts the opening conversation to work through committees, to work through debate on the floor so that in the days ahead we will bring a full repeal of ObamaCare and a replacement. But that replacement is not going to be a 2,700-page bill to replace the previous 2,700-page bill. It will be a series of solutions, and it will deal with things on a long-term basis.  There was no vote to suddenly end people's health care in one day. This begins a transition point to make sure that we are watching out for those individuals, such as those cancer patients, diabetics, and individuals who are in very vulnerable situations and over the next couple of years will be able to transition to other care. We are watching to make sure this is not some sudden shift for those individuals. There are very vulnerable people who are in health care options right now and need to know that there is still that safety net there for them and that moving forward, we will continue to be able to watch for them.  We want to be able to move a lot of those decisions back to the Quite frankly, that is where those decisions were before. And we want to be able to allow those individuals who are in very vulnerable situations to seek out the doctor they want, to get the options for health care coverage they want, and to have greater access to health insurance, not less.  The people in my State who had been added and who received those subsidies are grateful to be able to have health care, but there are also individuals in my State who can now literally no longer afford to have health care because they have been priced out of the[[Page S432]]market, and they are stuck. ObamaCare moved the system from one uninsured group of people to now another uninsured group of people.  Let me read a statement coming from a person from Oklahoma who said:       My wife and I will be going without health insurance next      year! I do not resent anyone who is able to afford      healthcare, I just resent a government system that causes      [us] to be priced out of the reach of working people.  Why is it we can argue about ObamaCare and people can say those individuals got coverage and people are not paying attention to a whole new group of Americans who no longer have coverage because they literally have been priced out of the market?  Why is it that for the sake of 6 million people, we have affected the cost of health care for millions and millions of other Americans?  We can do this transition. We will do this transition. It will take a couple of years. It is not going to be rapid, and there will be a large debate that will happen nationally in the process. That is appropriate, but allow us to be able to walk through this process together.  One quick illustration and then I will be done. I have a friend who discovered last year that she had mold in her house. Initially, there were some treatments that were done. She had been very sick for a while and didn't know why. They did treatments to the house and such and thought that would settle it. It didn't. Eventually, she had to move out of her own home.  Now they have had to actually strip out the walls and take out all the sheetrock. They are literally replacing studs and everything in the house. It will be a long-term issue to be able to get it all right.  I tell that simple story to say that anyone who says replacing health care is going to be some simple ``spray everything down and that will fix it'' strategy just doesn't understand the difficulties of the American health care system. This will be much like my friend who is having to do a pretty radical transition that is going to take a long time, but that will actually get her house whole and healthy again.  If we want to have a healthy nation again with people who have access to health care, regardless of what class they are in, it is going to take a while to make this transition, and it will be difficult in the process. But I can assure my colleagues that this Congress is watching out for all people, of all ethnicities, of all neighborhoods, of all diseases, to make sure that we are paying attention to this one simple thing: When ObamaCare was put into place, it punished people. We should encourage people to be able to get health care, and we should be able to walk through it with people in their most vulnerable moments and make sure they are able to make personal decisions, have access to their own doctors, have access to hospitals that can afford to stay afloat, and to provide the ability for people to choose their own health care. Why is that so radical? It used to not be.  There are things that need to be fixed, but it begins with giving the power of the decision back to the patient and back to people, where it needs to be.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan).

He even quoted the Bible, saying: ``. . . how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.''  But pledges and promises fall flat when tweets, speeches, and now actions are followed by reckless executive orders, thoughtless nominations for our Nation's leaders, and attacks on the American healthcare system.  The American people were let down when President Trump nominated unqualified and out-of-touch candidates such as Senator Jeff Sessions, Betsy DeVos, and Tom  How can you pledge allegiance to all Americans while threatening to leave so many without options and access to healthcare coverage? This is not unity. It is hypocrisy. We need to focus on facts and not ``alternative facts.''  I have a question: Do we have a replacement for the Affordable Care Act? Is it a fact that a repeal without a replacement will leave over 30 million people uninsured? Yes, that is a fact.  Is it a fact that Betsy DeVos, if confirmed, will be the first Secretary of Education without any prior experience in public schools, including early childhood education and higher education?  Is it a fact that Jeff Sessions has been nominated as the Attorney General but was denied Federal judgeship over accusations of racism?  I support efforts that will bring more jobs to the American people. I fully support efforts to improve our country's transportation and infrastructure.

In this fast growing and ever changing world, the gap between those who have and have not will be made even more dramatic for those without internet access. Internet access is a valuable commodity that helps millions of lives, and everyone should have access to it.  In the 21st century, one thing is crystal clear: Access to the internet is critical. 4.2 billion people worldwide don't have access to the internet. This includes children starting school, young women starting businesses, and communities looking for ways to compete in the global market.  Women are particularly impacted and left behind, something that shouldn't go unnoticed by this body. UNICEF reports that nearly 90% of the income women bring in is reinvested into their family, more than double what men reinvest. Women build up their communities, and we must do whatever we can to ensure they have the resources necessary to succeed.  Not only will this bill reach those women who live in the dark without web services, it will promote the rights and values that make America exceptional. The freedoms of expression and assembly are fundamental rights, and the Internet can be a critical medium for promoting democracy. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute put it best when it said ``The Internet has fundamentally empowered the consumer [. . .] It saves the consumer time and gives customers access to products.'' In this great body, I hope we continue to stand for democracy, its values, and support those who wish to stand up for their rights.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

699,topic-id,370,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.601. As a parent who was very involved in my children's education and served as President of the Southfield Public Schools Board of Education, I firmly believe the importance of promoting education to all regions of the world. Education is a universal human right that should be obtained by every young mind of the world.  Access to basic education is a human right that must be guaranteed to all children. In my role as the Vice Chair of the Bipartisan Congressional Women's Caucus during the 115th Congress, I will work with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to highlight barriers to basic education, specifically focusing on girls' education in the developing world. Providing girls with an education helps break the cycle of poverty. Educated women are less likely to get married, more likely to have healthy babies, and are more likely to understand the value of education.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation would ensure that aid is prioritized for the most vulnerable populations, particularly those living in conflict zones. We must take the necessary steps to see that these children are provided with the rights to develop their full potential in order to be contributing members of their societies.  The enforcement of this bill will help bridge the gap with some global issues that we still see today with marginalized groups seeking education. Young children, regardless of gender have the right to gain a quality education.[[Page H666]]Children with disabilities or illnesses should not be shunned away from trying to learn because they are considered different.

154,topic-id,2034,"Mr.President, today I will vote for James Mattis to bethe next Secretary of General Mattis stands out as a top practitioner in his field. He has earned--and rightlydeserves--near-universal respect. While I opposed the hurried waiving of a carefully considered statutory cooling off period formembers of the military before they can become eligible for this civilian position, I made clear then, and restate now, that myopposition to this waiver was never about General Mattis himself.  I was grateful when General Mattis said in his confirmationhearing that, even from his first days as a marine, he has observed that, in the photographs on the walls of Department ofDefense establishments, the civilians in suits were above those of the men and women in uniforms. I was pleased that he vowed touphold that meaningful tradition. I am confident that, as the President's top adviser on matters of defense, as Secretary,General Mattis will carefully provide considered defense advice, maximizing the wisdom of not only the Active, Reserve, andNational Guard, but the whole of the Department of Defense, including Department civilians.  Donald Trump will sorely needthat experience and advice. Last weekend, President Trump again denigrated our NATO allies, a partnership that President Kennedyvery much had in mind when he vowed at his own inauguration to ``pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support anyfriend, and oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty.'' General Mattis clearly understands the value of ourNATO alliance. His condemnation of Russia's efforts to ``break'' NATO stands in stark contrast to the position of the man whohas nominated him and, to me, demonstrates the sound, experienced reasoning that will provide a necessary balance to  I do harbor reservations about General Mattis's past statements as a private citizen related to equality within theranks of our servicemembers. I would have much preferred to hear General Mattis renounced those past statements, but I doappreciate that, in his confirmation hearings, he said that there is nothing innate about gender or orientation that makessomeone a better soldier than another. I believe the results of the progress made under President Obama will show clearly thatthe Nation succeeds when it has the best individuals serving to their fullest potential in the position that best matches his orher abilities.  The Secretary of Defense is, of course, a critically important position. There are countless difficult choicesGeneral Mattis will have to make in steering the Department in a direction that more effectively utilizes its budget to respondto today's rapidly evolving challenges. And whether it is the persistent, shockingly high rates of sexual assault within theArmed Forces and of suicide among young veterans, or the need for far more rigorous oversight of Defense resources to reducewaste, fraud, and abuse, the next Secretary will need to demonstrate that the Department is capable of effectively addressingits own internal problems, in addition to defending the  In these unsettling times, General Mattis will provide avoice of experience and reason to what, by all accounts, looks to be an undisciplined, impulsive, and inexperienced Commander inOn the Appropriations Committee and in other ways, I look[[Page S352]]forward to working closely with General Mattis in thisnew role.  Mr.President, the Senate today considers the nomination of JohnKelly to be the Secretary of Homeland A retired marine, General Kelly is no stranger to security efforts. Over morethan four decades of service in the Marines, General Kelly distinguished himself through multiple commands and tours of duty. Heis well respected by elected officials, military officers, the Marines under his command, and the law enforcement andintelligence communities. I have no reason to doubt that he is a man of integrity.  But General Kelly is nominated to a fardifferent post than those he occupied during his distinguished military career. The Department of Homeland Security--a civilianagency within our government--is charged with a far-reaching mission. From protecting national security to implementingimmigration policies, from our emergency response to domestic crises, to assisting in the unending fight against drugs in ourcommunities that today features opioids and heroin as its most prevalent threat, the Department of Homeland Security faceschallenges as unique as they are numerous. While I am confident that General Kelly is well equipped to exert leadership on manyof these challenges, his nomination has also raised concerns.  As we look ahead to the policies and practices this newadministration will seek to implement, we cannot forget the work left unfinished in the Obama administration due to theobstruction of congressional In 2013, after a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate, truly comprehensive immigrationreform legislation was sent to the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders there refused to even bring it to a vote.That legislation addressed a litany of issues facing our broken immigration system, from securing our borders to reforming visaprograms, from bringing the undocumented out of the shadows to reuniting families.  After House Republicans failed to bringthat bill to a vote, President Obama took executive action to expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, andestablish the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, DAPA, programs. These actions would haveoffered a reprieve for young people and parents so that they could remain in the country, with their families, and without fearof deportation. It is fundamentally unfair for the new administration to revoke a policy designed to bring vulnerable immigrantsout of the shadows and then to use information gained from that policy to punish them.  I was disheartened when a Federalcourt issued an injunction preventing implementation of these policies. I was more disheartened when the Supreme Court wasunable to resolve this court challenge, again, due to obstruction from congressional Republicans in the consideration ofPresident Obama's nominee to the Supreme Now, this new administration is poised to withdraw these executiveorders.  General Kelly is no stranger to the problems we face along the southern border. As the commander of U.SouthernCommand, he is familiar not only with immigration challenges, but with drug trafficking. While I am grateful that he has notsubscribed to the singular approach that President Trump has thus far proposed with respect to constructing a wall along oursouthern border, I am deeply concerned that he has admonished so-called sanctuary cities and has testified that accelerating thedeportation of undocumented immigrants will provide the solution to our broken immigration system. These views are not supportedby the facts, and they are contrary to the work undertaken by the Senate just 4 years ago to comprehensively address theseproblems. I am also concerned about his tenure as the military officer in charge of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay,given reports that he opposed its closure and limited press access to the facility.  Vermonters know that the explosion ofheroin and opioid abuse across the country can, in many ways, be attributed to the cross-border trafficking of illegal drugs.General Kelly has been a strong defender of a U.counternarcotics strategy which, in my view and the view of many others, hasbeen a costly failure. Since President Reagan's first Andean Counter Drug Program, the interrelated problems of drugs,corruption, and violence that have plagued countries in South and Central America, and spilled over into our own country, havegotten progressively worse.  I do not doubt that General Kelly will be confirmed to this post. Knowing that, I do want to workwith him to build on successful policies such as preclearance operations, TSA Precheck, and the visa waiver program. I lookforward to partnering with him to ensure the continuation of efforts to keep our northern border secure, while remaining open tothe trade and commerce we conduct with Canada, our largest trading partner. I look forward to working with General Kelly toensure that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is fully supported and able to respond to domestic disasters. And I lookforward to working with General Kelly to address vulnerabilities in our cyber infrastructure.  There are many challengesahead. The Department of Homeland Security was hastily created in the wake of the September 11 attacks and, in my view, hasbecome an unwieldly bureaucracy that suffers from inadequate transparency and accountability. This has resulted in adverse,sometimes severe consequences for many vulnerable people and their families who deserved better from this country. TheDepartment needs significant reform in order to effectively confront these challenges, and I urge General Kelly to seek theinput of a wide range of experts, as well as Congress, in identifying and implementing long overdue reforms. And above all, Ihope General Kelly, as the Secretary of Homeland Security, will provide a thoughtful and reasoned balance to the extremeproposals thus far put forward by President  Mr.Mr.President, I rise to speak on the nomination of John Kelly to be Secretary of Homeland This is atremendously important position, especially in these dangerous and uncertain times, and it requires a highly qualified nomineewho will be able to handle one of the most complex positions here in Washington, After his impressive career and nominationhearing, few would question that he has the knowledge and the skill to lead the agency.  He has years of experience workingwith our neighbors in Latin America as former commander of U.Southern Command, where he saw firsthand the drivers of theunaccompanied minors crisis. In his testimony, he outlined what he saw as the root causes of migration, including people fleeingviolence and seeking asylum within the United  Yet the position requires more than experience, it requires a trueunderstanding of the issues and how they affect the men and women we are all sworn to serve. It is in this aspect that I havelingering concerns.  Anyone running DHS must be able to prioritize their resources in the apprehension, detention, and removalof undocumented immigrants. On November 20, 2014, the Department of Homeland Security outlined how scarce Federal resourceswould be allocated in enforcing our Nation's immigration laws. The memo focused resources on threats to national security,threats to national safety, and threats to border security, while deemphasizing law-abiding immigrants who have integratedthemselves into society. I have been generally supportive of this prioritization, as I believe that Federal resources shouldbe spent on enforcement actions against serious criminals.  On day one as Secretary of Homeland Security, General Kelly willhave to address this. I hope he will recognize the wisdom of keeping families together, protecting children and the DeferredAction for Childhood Arrivals DACA Program and focus on deporting serious criminals and those who truly pose a threat to ournational security. This focus isn't about being liberal or conservative but is a smart and humane approach to enforcement of ourimmigration laws.  General Kelly will have to grapple with the realities of our immigration system. As Secretary of HomelandSecurity, General Kelly will be tasked with the critical duty of maintaining our southwest borders. We have heard[[Page S353]]promisesby the President-elect to build a wall that would cost taxpayers $25 billion; yet a wall will not secure the border or stop theflow of illegal drugs into the country. General Kelly himself noted that a wall alone is not enough. I hope that General Kellywill recognize that $25 billion is better spent trying to reduce factors that drive people to the United  Afterspeaking to General Kelly and listening to his testimony, I am cautiously optimistic that this is a nominee who understands theissues that will be in front of a Homeland Security Ultimately, to truly understand the issues, General Kelly willneed an ongoing dialog with those such as myself who care deeply about fixing our immigration system. As my colleagues areaware, my record of standing up for immigrants is clear from years of work on comprehensive immigration reform. General Kellyshould hear the stories about those with loved ones who have been torn from their homes and sent back to a country they nolonger have a connection with. He should talk to those young immigrants who are American in every way except for a piece ofpaper who have come out of the shadows, registered with the government, and applied for DACA and fear being deported under thisnew administration. He should hear from parents who have U.citizen children and have lived in this country for over a decadeand live with the constant threat of being separated from their children.  I will support the nomination of General Kelly tobe the Secretary of Homeland However, I plan on using every procedural and legislative tool to push back against anydeportation force or policies that indiscriminately separate families, targets DREAMers, and generate fear in our immigrantcommunities.

We had thousands more who marched in my State capital, Let me put this in perspective. Our State capital--I was born there, and I know it very well--is home to only 8,500 people, but 15,000 Vermonters stood on our statehouse lawn to show the President that they are paying attention, they want their voices to be heard, and the American people will hold him accountable.  I got some of the most enthusiastic emails and tweets. My 14-year-old granddaughter, Francesca, told me how thrilled she was to be there. One Vermonter who took part in the enormous Women's March in Montpelier told a member of my staff, ``This is the first time I have been able to smile since Election Day.''  In Washington, Marcelle and I were proud to march with our daughter, Alicia, and 12-year-old granddaughter, I was proud to see this 12-year-old holding her head high, knowing the respect that was being shown to her and her mother, as well as to Marcelle and me. She knew that respect went to her in a way that reflected everybody--Black, White, no matter what you might be. People cared.  We have heard disrespectful, offensive and dangerous comments seep into[[Page S419]]our national discourse. The millions of men and women who participated in marches across the country this weekend offered a powerful statement that they will not tolerate policies that restrict the rights of women or treat women like second-class citizens. They will not treat my wife as one, they will not treat my daughter as one, they will not treat my three wonderful granddaughters as one, and all five of our grandchildren will be treated the same.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration ignored the voices of millions of Americans and is already undermining the rights of women. Two of the President's first Executive Orders targeted women. His first Executive Order attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which throws into limbo the health insurance arrangements of millions of American women who have been guaranteed maternity coverage as part of their health care plans, who have been able to have affordable birth control for the first time, who have been able to tell insurance companies that no, pregnancy is not a preexisting condition. In other words, women can be treated the same as men when they seek insurance.  President Trump also reinstated the so-called Mexico City policy, a policy that would be illegal and unconstitutional in this country--that will only result in more abortions and more pregnancy related deaths in developing countries. A former Republican Senator whom I respected highly, when he was chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee--he was strongly against abortion, but he said this kind of a policy is only going to result in more abortions and more pregnancy-related deaths in developing countries, and he is right. He is right. Affordable health care, affordable birth control, and the availability of these services would bring down abortion and pregnancy-related deaths, whether in the United States or the countries we help.  Mr.President, Americans are watching. From what I heard and saw from Vermonters on Saturday, I could tell you that they are fired up and ready to go. We need a President who is committed to equality and opportunity for all people, no matter their sex, gender, or race. We will not stand for policies that turn back the clock on so much progress we have made. To paraphrase Martin Luther King, we have to accept finite disappointment, but we must not give up infinite hope. Only light can crowd out the darkness.  I was proud to see so many Vermonters speaking up. They are not going away, and, as I pledged to them on Saturday, I am not going away. I am going to speak. I am going to speak the same way I did when Marcelle and I walked with our daughter and our granddaughter in the million women march. I will continue to speak up, as the people in my office in Vermont did, in I will speak up for all five of our grandchildren, for Francesca and Sophia and Fiona, but also for Patrick and I will speak up for all I will speak up for all They expect nothing less and they deserve nothing less.  With that, I yield the floor.

912,topic-id,1661,"Mr.President, it has become fashionable, particularly among supporters of the Trump administration, to accuse the United Nations of just about everything. This is, however, nothing new. The U.N has been an easy target, especially for some Republicans, for a long time, because like any unwieldy international organization comprised of member states with very different priorities and interests it will probably never be as efficient or effective as we would like.  But there is simply no question that the U.serves many vital functions that are fully consistent with key U.interests and values. For that reason, it is essential that the U.continues to play a leadership role in the U.N., which we were instrumental in creating seven decades ago, in a manner that strengthens the institution.  At times, I have expressed my own frustrations with the U.It wastes inordinate amounts of time debating and adopting redundant resolutions that accomplish next to nothing. It has suffered from personnel policies that make it difficult if not impossible to fire underperforming employees. It pays its officials at rates that dwarf what many could earn in their own countries. It has been too slow to implement procedures to ensure transparency and accountability, including for whistleblowers who have suffered retaliation for exposing corruption and other misconduct.  So there is no dispute that the U.needs to do better. The new Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, knows this as well as anyone and he has made clear that he is going to do his best to put the institution on a road to real reform.  But, of course, he cannot do that by himself. He is empowered only to the extent that the U.member states, and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, support him.  Attempts by past the Secretary Generals to implement reforms have been partly stymied by resistance from governments that prefer the status quo. While I believe the prospects for U.N.reform have never been better, that will not be possible without the active leadership and skillful diplomacy of the United  And that is where our U.Ambassador comes in.  I have known many of them, although I was only 7 years old in 1947 when Warren Austin of Vermont, nominated by President Truman, became our third U. The position of U.Ambassador to the U.has also been held by such accomplished people as Henry Cabot Lodge, Adlai Stevenson, George H.Bush, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Thomas Pickering, and Madeleine Each was recognized and widely admired across the political spectrum for his or her depth of foreign policy experience and wisdom.  Today we are considering the nomination of Nikki Haley to be the next U.Governor Haley's record as Governor of South Carolina was decidedly mixed, and I will not take time today to discuss that record. What is most relevant here, however, is her dearth of experience for the job she has been selected for. That is not so much a criticism of Governor Haley as it is of President Trump, as there are certainly well qualified, seasoned diplomats in the Republican Party who would be well received by members of both parties.  Instead, we are asked to support a nominee who will no doubt be confirmed but will be starting from square one. If there ever were a case of having to learn on the job, this will be it. That might not concern me if it were not for the indispensable role of the United Nations in an increasingly dangerous and polarized world, the importance of this position, and the complex challenges the next U.Ambassador will face on her first day on the job.  It was painfully apparent during her confirmation hearing that virtually everything Governor Haley said in her opening remarks and in her responses to questions of Senators, she had learned in the previous 2 months since she was chosen for the job. Her answers largely parroted popular Republican talking points with little substance to back up her response and revealed only an elementary understanding of how the U.functions. Her stated interest in U.reform is well placed, but it did not appear that she grasps what U.reform entails or what it takes to build the necessary support for reform.  Again, I do not blame her for that. Her career has focused entirely on issues relevant to the State of South But that does not make her qualified to be our Ambassador to the U. As Governor, she jumped on the politically expedient bandwagon and opposed the resettlement of any Syrian refugees in her State over ``security concerns,'' although it being a Federal decision some Syrians have been resettled there. In other words, she supported a blanket prohibition against an entire nationality of people--men, women, and children--regardless of the merits of their individual status as refugees fleeing war.  She stated, in spite of the fact that all of our major European allies supported the nuclear agreement with Iran, that Russia's and China's support was a ``red flag,'' without acknowledging the reality that without their support it would be impossible to achieve an agreement to halt Iran's nuclear weapons program or any of our other key objectives at the U. She condemned the U.abstention on U.Security Council Resolution[[Page S428]]2334 regarding Israeli settlements and incorrectly implied that it is inconsistent with longstanding U.policy and interests. In fact, she insisted that the resolution, not settlements themselves, makes peace negotiations more difficult--a view with which I disagree. She seemed to acknowledge that the U.does not support settlement construction, but stated that the U.should have vetoed the resolution anyway.  She mischaracterized U.law regarding our share of dues in support of U.peacekeeping missions that the U.S.--Republican and Democratic administrations--voted for, failing to acknowledge that we have a treaty obligation to pay 28.5 percent of U.peacekeeping costs. She made little mention of and gave little if any credit to the troop-contributing countries themselves, other than to highlight incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse. This is a critical issue that I and others here have been working with the U.Mission to the U.to address, and progress is being made in developing meaningful accountability procedures.  She stated that the cut-off of U.funding for UNESCO as a result of the vote of a majority of its members to accept Palestine as a member state, which led to our loss of influence, is a ``good thing'' and that she would continue to support the cut-off of funding. She and I disagree about that and what it could mean for the future. I think even the Israeli Government has come to recognize that it is better for the U.to be at the table, using our influence to deflect attempts to unfairly target Israel, than on the sidelines.  Governor Haley suggested that the U.may want to reconsider participation in and funding for the U.Human Rights Council, despite overwhelming evidence that our role serves to protect our interests and has reduced substantially the council's disproportionate and wasteful focus on At no time did she acknowledge the many council resolutions that are fully consistent with U.interests or that the influence lost by the U.is simply ceded to the very governments she opposes having a say in the council.  On the other hand, Governor Haley did repeatedly reject what she described as ``slash and burn'' tactics when it comes to budget cutting, and on that, I fully agree with her.  She said she supports moving our embassy to Jerusalem, although there is no compelling need to do so, it is strongly opposed by our ally Jordan, would likely incite a violent reaction in Arab countries, and could do more to drive a nail in the coffin of what little remains of the Middle East peace process than anything else.  In responses to written questions she betrayed a serious lack of understanding about Cuba, its economy, and the failures of the 55-year-old U.embargo. Indeed, if she were to apply her answers regarding Cuba to other countries with repressive governments, we would have to close dozens of U.Embassies, end diplomatic relations, and impose ineffective, unilateral sanctions against each of them.  I urge Governor Haley, as our U.Ambassador, to listen to the overwhelming majority of Americans and Cubans, including many Republican Members of Congress, who support a policy of engagement. I urge her to travel to Cuba and see and hear for herself, unlike those who continue to favor a Cold War embargo that has been exploited by the Cuban Government to justify its repressive policies and that has hurt the Cuban people.  I have been a congressional delegate to the United Nations three times, after being nominated by Presidents of both Republican and Democratic parties. I appreciated that opportunity because I have long believed that it is in the strong interest of the United States to play an active, leadership role in the U. That is only possible if we, by far the world's wealthiest country, meet our financial commitments. And it is only possible if we build coalitions through skillful diplomacy and refrain from the tactics that some critics of the U.advocate, such as bullying and ultimatums, which are often self-defeating.  I recognize that Governor Haley will be confirmed, and I wish her the best. I hope she becomes a great U.I urge her to seek out and listens to a wide range of views, particularly on controversial issues like the Middle East, Iran, and how the U.can best help make the U.work better for everyone.  I will do everything I can to support Secretary General Guterres, the budget of the U.Mission to the U.N., and funding for U.agencies like the World Food Program, the U.Development Program, UNICEF, the U.Environment Program, the U.Population Fund, U.Women, the U.Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and so many others that carry out lifesaving humanitarian and development programs around the world.  And if there are other ways that I can help soon-to-be Ambassador Haley to defend the values and effectively advance the interests of the United States at the U.and to bring about needed reforms I will gladly do so.

928,topic-id,793,"Mr.President, I want to take a moment to recognize two exceptional members of the Smithsonian Institution's board of regents: John McCarter, who has served as chair of the board, and Shirley Ann Jackson, who has served as the vice chair. I have had the honor of serving with both of them and believe that their dedication and leadership have greatly benefitted the Both are stepping down from their roles, and while John will continue to serve on the board, Shirley will be moving on to dedicate her considerable talents to other initiatives.  John McCarter, Jr., of Illinois has had a long and distinguished career. He was first appointed as a regent in 2009 and was elected chair in 2013. In addition, John has lent his expertise and wisdom to a number of the regents' other committees.  During his tenure, John has overseen a number of important strategic initiatives, including the search for the Smithsonian's 13th secretary; the development of the Institution's relationship with the Victoria & Albert Museum in London; the reopening of the Arts and Industries Building to the American public; and most recently, the opening of the National Museum of African American History and These opportunities will help to ensure the Smithsonian's continued success.  John also led the charge in reopening the historic Arts and Industries Building on the National Mall to the public. The building, shuttered since 2004, was reopened to the public for the secretary's installation ceremony in October 2015 and was the site of a very successful pop-up cultural exhibition over Memorial Day weekend in May 2016. John's vision and leadership have made this national treasure available to the American people once more.  A tireless advocate for the Smithsonian in his home State of Illinois, John has raised the institution's profile across the Nation and around the world. Thanks to his recruitment efforts, the Smithsonian advisory boards are more diverse, more dynamic, and more engaged than ever before. Through all of these initiatives, John has pushed the Smithsonian to be more ambitious and to renew its commitment to ``the increase and diffusion of knowledge.''  I want to thank John for his exceptional leadership as chairman of the board of regents, and I look forward to working with him through the remainder of his term as a regent.  Shirley Ann Jackson of New York is the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic She was appointed as a regent in 2005 and has served as board and executive committee vice chair since 2013.  Shirley was the regents' representative for the successful events that opened the Smithsonian's 19th museum, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, in September 2016. Alongside other notable guests, Shirley helped inaugurate the newest Smithsonian museum by delivering remarks at the museum's dedication ceremony. As she noted during her speech, the museum furthers ``the Smithsonian's founding mission, to promote `the increase and diffusion of knowledge,' by opening a museum dedicated to the African-American experience in the United States, and its crucial place in the American experience.''  Shirley has a remarkable life story: She was the first African-American woman to earn a doctorate from MIT, and since 1999, she has served as the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute--marking the first time an African-American woman has led a top research university. She was also the first woman and the first African-American to serve as chair of the U.Nuclear Regulatory Shirley is emblematic of everything the Museum was founded to celebrate about the African-American experience, and we were proud to have her serve as the board's representative at all of the opening ceremonies.  The Smithsonian has also benefitted from Shirley's demonstrated commitment to the sciences. As a trained physicist, she is particularly passionate about inspiring the next generation of scientists and conservationists. As vice chair, she has been a staunch advocate for the Smithsonian's scientific researchers, trumpeting their successes and inviting them to speak at She has made a point of going beyond the brick and mortar of the Smithsonian museums to visit the Smithsonian's many research centers, including the Smithsonian Tropical Research Center in  This past year, Secretary David Skorton tapped into Shirley's extensive leadership and management experience, asking her to cochair the institution's initiative to create a new strategic plan for 2017-2022. Shirley has[[Page S433]]rolled up her sleeves, asking tough questions and meeting with a variety of stakeholders regarding the institution's priorities for the next 5 years. As a chief architect of this plan, Shirley will be instrumental in charting the future of the institution long after she has left the board of regents.  As a member of the board of regents, it has been my honor to serve alongside I believe her contributions to the Smithsonian community will be witnessed and appreciated by generations to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS432-2.txt,1383,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,24.0,January
1260,topic-id,753,"Madam President, Trump's Executive order banning Muslims from seven countries, none of which was a source of terrorists who have carried out attacks in this country, was un-American, arbitrary, inhumane, and it will likely spur an increase in violence targeting I will have plenty more to say about it and other reckless actions by this White House in the days and weeks ahead.  In the meantime, I want to say a few words about the bizarre back and forth between the Trump administration and the news media regarding attendance at the inauguration and who is telling the truth and who is not.  One might think that with all that is happening in the country and the world and the rush by the President to sign Executive orders that would dramatically affect the rights, and the priorities, of millions of Americans, the question of how many people were at the inauguration would not generate such controversy. But it turns out that this is about much more than that, as it goes to the heart of the role of a free press in this country and whether the American people can have confidence that the President is telling the truth.  We already knew that candidate and now President Trump is prone to bragging and making wildly unrealistic promises and inaccurate claims, many of which he later disavows. He frequently ignores or misstates basic facts and refuses to correct those falsehoods. So it was no surprise when he predicted that the crowd at his inauguration would be ``an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout.''  It was also no surprise, as usually happens at inaugurations and large public demonstrations, that high-elevation photographs were used to estimate the number of participants. To anyone who attended both the Obama and Trump inaugurations, it was obvious that the number of people at President Obama's inauguration was far larger than at President Trump's inauguration, as photographs clearly showed.  President Trump, however, insisted the photographs were fabricated. The morning after the inauguration, he said he could see from the stage on the West Front of the Capitol that there were ``a million'' or ``a million and a half'' people on the  When reports clearly showed only a fraction of that, he accused news organizations of lying, calling them ``among the most dishonest human beings on Earth,'' and warned that they would regret it.  Later that day, the President's spokesman, Sean Spicer, also accused the press of lying. He said the photographs were deceptive, and he insisted that President Trump's inauguration was ``the most watched ever.'' That, of course, was a clever distortion of what the President actually said.[[Page S467]]  President Trump was unmistakably talking about the number of people who were actually present on the Mall when he was sworn in, which seems to matter more to him than it does to anyone else.  Mr.Spicer expanded that number by an indeterminable amount to include anyone who had watched anywhere in the world on a cell phone, television, or other electronic device.  A day later, Mr.Spicer berated the press for being unfair by reporting on this. Perhaps he had forgotten that it was President Trump who initiated the whole thing by publicly promising something that did not happen and then falsely accusing the press of lying, as did Mr.Spicer, after being proven wrong.  Mr.Spicer also may have forgotten that, shortly after President Obama was inaugurated, the Senate majority leader announced that the Republicans' 1 priority was to prevent him from being elected to a second term. Failing that, they spent 8 years trying to obstruct, sabotage, and discredit everything President Obama tried to do.  During much of that time, Donald Trump carried on an utterly false campaign accusing President Obama of lying about his birthplace.  Two days later and without citing any evidence--because no evidence exists--President Trump resurrected his false claim that that he lost the popular vote because 3 to 5 million ``illegal immigrants'' voted. Mr.Spicer echoed this same claim, citing unnamed ``studies.''  This, of course, is patently false and absurd, but one can assume that it will be repeated by Republicans to justify more onerous, discriminatory voter suppression voting requirements which have been a crusade of theirs, particularly in areas with large minority populations that traditionally vote  To add insult to injury, Kellyanne Conway, the President's counselor, announced that President Trump will not be releasing his tax returns. This after candidate Trump repeatedly promised to do so once a routine audit is completed, and he even said he looked forward to doing that.

1730,topic-id,1760,"Mr.President, today the Senate is considering the nomination of Rex Tillerson to be Secretary of Mr.Tillerson is an intelligent, hard-working, and successful businessman. He is also, in my view, the wrong choice to be our Nation's top diplomat.  To effectively confront the many challenges our country faces in an increasingly globalized and volatile world, we need a Secretary of State who, with credibility and conviction, can clearly and effectively articulate our interests and values and who has experience advocating for them abroad.  We need someone who will work with the international community to combat climate change, bring to justice war criminals like Bashar al-Assad, and stand up to corrupt, abusive regimes that violate international humanitarian law and territorial integrity as Russia has done in Syria and  We need someone who will advocate for fundamental human rights and democratic values when they are threatened by friend or foe.  I am unconvinced that Mr.Tillerson is that person.  As an accomplished businessman, Mr.Tillerson's lone qualification for Secretary of State seems to be his success in tirelessly circumnavigating the globe to negotiate oil deals. There is no doubt he has helped ExxonMobil expand its business and made a lot of money doing so. But contrary to the view being promoted by the Trump administration, running a for-profit business is fundamentally different from running a large Federal agency.  As the CEO of ExxonMobil, Mr.Tillerson worked closely with corrupt autocrats like Vladimir Putin who were actively undermining U.interests and acting in ways that were counter to our values. In doing so, Mr.Tillerson served his shareholders, but he disregarded the national interests of the United  Unlike some in this body, I believe we should have relations with governments we disagree with. But I also believe that, in doing so, we must act in accordance with our principles and values. And I don't believe that being the CEO of one of this country's wealthiest companies entitles you to ignore those values for the sake of making money.  Mr.Tillerson's confirmation hearing provided him the opportunity to reconcile his track record of a lifetime in the oil business with the responsibilities he would have as Secretary of  In his testimony, he stated that ``American leadership requires moral clarity.'' I agree. But he was challenged by Senators Rubio, Murphy, and others who observed that despite this statement, Mr.Tillerson was unwilling to label the relentless bombardment and destruction of Aleppo by Russian forces as a war crime or the extrajudicial killings of thousands of civilians in the Philippines as a blatant violation of human rights, to cite only two examples of well-documented cases of atrocities he refused to recognize as such.  I worry that Mr.Tillerson will too often be inclined to subjugate fundamental human rights to what he perceives as overriding economic or security concerns. There is nothing in the record to suggest that he recognizes that the protection of human rights is itself a national security imperative or that he would differ from the President on these issues that have become even more important since January 20.  We also have no idea what Mr.Tillerson thinks about the President's misguided, discriminatory, and probably illegal decision to ban entry to the United States of all citizens of Syria and half a dozen other Muslim countries because he has been conspicuously silent, even though the State Department will have a key role in enforcing it. Our diplomats posted overseas will bear the brunt of the retaliatory actions by outraged governments in countries targeted by this arbitrary and self-defeating Executive order.  Nor do we know what he thinks of the President's draft Executive order that signals a drastic reduction in our support for and influence in the United Will the President consult with Mr.Tillerson before issuing that order? Does Mr.Tillerson think it is a smart way to protect our interests and reassure our allies? We don't know.  ExxonMobil, while Mr.Tillerson was CEO, lobbied to overturn section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank legislation which is designed to stop the illicit flow of revenues from oil and gas extraction to corrupt governments. Senator Lugar, who played a key role in that bipartisan legislation, said at the time that stopping such corruption is a national security and economic priority for the United Does Mr.Tillerson think that shrouding in secrecy corruption involving hundreds of billions of dollars by governments who steal from their own impoverished people is in our national interest? We don't know because he doesn't say.  My other abiding concern with this nominee is that we are being asked to confirm the head of the world's largest oil company to be the country's top diplomat, at a time when I believe the most challenging issue we and the world face is climate change resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels.  Uniting the world to combat climate change will not be possible without unprecedented U.leadership. Leadership requires credibility, and on this issue, Mr.Tillerson has next to none. He has devoted his professional career--and become a billionaire in the process--to extracting and selling as much oil as possible. If, at his confirmation hearing, Mr.Tillerson had said that he recognizes the causal connection between burning fossil fuels and climate change, that he understands the grave threat it poses, and that he is determined to use the position of Secretary of State to build on the record of the Obama administration to combat climate change, I might feel differently. But he said nothing remotely like that.  To the contrary, when asked at his confirmation hearing if ExxonMobil concealed what it knew about climate change while funding outside groups that raised doubts about the science, Mr.Tillerson said he was ``in no position to speak'' for the company, even though he had been the CEO until only a few days before. When asked whether he lacked the knowledge to answer or was refusing to do so, he replied ``A little of both.'' That should concern each of us.  Based on his professional record and his responses at the hearing, I do not believe Mr.Tillerson is the right person to be representing the United States in negotiations to reduce carbon emissions, one of the defining issues of our time.  I was also disappointed by Mr.Tillerson's responses to a number of other questions submitted for the record, including regarding U.policy toward Cuba and the right of Americans to travel there. By simply repeating the Republican talking points that he would act consistent with the Helms-Burton Act, he appeared to embrace a law that has failed to achieve any of its objectives and has prevented Americans from traveling freely to Cuba or U.companies from doing business there.  Does Mr.Tillerson believe that Cuba, an impoverished island of 11 million people who overwhelmingly have a positive opinion of the United States, should remain the country with the most U.sanctions of any in the world? He didn't say.[[Page S537]]  I hope that, if confirmed, Mr.Tillerson will evaluate our policy toward Cuba objectively and in a manner that favors diplomatic engagement--as the overwhelming majority of Cubans and Americans want--over isolation.  I understand that nominees are often unwilling to take hard positions or unable to discuss in detail at this early stage all of the issues they will be required to manage in their new job. But we should expect a nominee for Secretary of State to be willing and able to recognize and condemn horrific violations of human rights and to speak out against actions by foreign governments and our own that are obviously inconsistent with our interests and values.  President Obama did not achieve every foreign policy goal he set out to achieve, nor did I always agree with President Obama's or Secretary of State Kerry's priorities. But we worked together, and with our international partners, we made notable progress over the past 8 years on human rights, climate change, reducing poverty, and many other issues--progress we must continue to build on. With nationalism and isolationism on the rise and democracy and fundamental freedoms under threat, we need a Secretary of State who has demonstrated a track record and commitment to more than economic enrichment.  If Mr.Tillerson is confirmed, which I expect he will be, I will continue my longstanding support for the funding to enable the State Department to carry out its vital mission to protect and promote U.interests and values abroad. When he and I agree, I will support him. When we disagree, I will be vocal in my opposition as I was during the Obama administration.  I hope Mr.Tillerson will also be a strong advocate for the State Department's budget and personnel, including by protecting the integrity of the Dissent Channel to ensure that alternative views on important policy decisions can be expressed and considered without fear of retribution. Even the best policies in the world are worth little more than the paper they are printed on without the funds and the people to implement them.  We should always remember that the face of the United States is its people. Leadership is possible only through the hard work of the diplomats serving around the world to promote our values, defend our interests, and engage constructively with friends and adversaries. Their service, dedication, and expertise are the reason we are able to effectively confront an increasingly dangerous world. Our success at home is inextricably linked to their success abroad. That is why, just as we support the men and women of our military, so should we recognize and support the diplomats at the Department of  The State Department's indispensable role, made possible by its outstanding workforce, is recognized by the many widely respected senior U.Armed Forces officials, current and retired, who have repeatedly called for increased funding for diplomacy and development. They know better than anyone that preventing wars is far less costly than fighting them and that wars rarely if ever turn out the way one predicts, as the past 50 years painfully illustrate.  Regardless of whatever differences of opinion we may have, I hope Mr.Tillerson will consult regularly with Republicans and Democrats, as has been the custom with past successful Secretaries of State of both parties. I have been here a long time, and I would be the first to say that we have had outstanding top diplomats from both parties. I put James Baker in that category, and I sincerely hope that Mr.Tillerson proves me wrong and joins their ranks. We all want what is best for the American people and the Nation, and we are stronger when we work together and with other nations to find a common way forward.

Yes, we have much more work to do to ensure equal justice under the law and to address the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. But this means public investments in housing, education, jobs, not budget cuts and corporate tax breaks that just do the opposite and also dismantle the safety net.  Within hours of taking office, the President already began to unravel the progress of the last 8 years. With the stroke of a pen, the President stuck a dagger in the heart of the Affordable Care Act that will take away health care for millions and pull the rug out from under low-income families seeking to buy homes.  These destructive policies are an attack on the most vulnerable in our society. It is clear that these executive orders will disproportionately harm communities of color, the African American community, and the poor.  Repealing the Affordable Care Act is just the tip of the iceberg. We have seen the Trump administration planning a full scale attack on the most marginalized community in our society.  Last year, after continually insulting the African American community, Trump's so-called new deal for Black America really did just add insult to injury. Rather than helping struggling families, this agenda would gut Social Security, repeal the Affordable Care Act, and abolish the safety net. We know that these cuts now will just lead to more poverty. This approach is dead wrong.  Instead of stepping on the most vulnerable to benefit special interests, President Trump should follow the CBC's lead by supporting a national strategy to eliminate poverty and extend economic opportunity to all  He can start by supporting our Half in Ten Act, which would reduce poverty in half over 10 years. And if the Trump administration really wants a new deal to benefit African Americans, they should look to our assistant leader Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 antipoverty plan, which would direct at least 10 percent of funds in designated accounts to spent in communities experiencing persistent poverty--those with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent over the last 30 years.  These are just a few of the proposals that we have to address poverty and lift up our communities. What we won't do is allow President Trump to roll back progress or push more families over the edge into poverty.  We should be identifying the root causes of poverty and developing policies to lift Americans up. Instead, President Trump has shown he would rather line the pockets of billionaires and advance those failed trickle-down economics.  In President Trump's new deal for African Americans let me just read you very quickly what he said with regard to illegal immigration. He said: ``We will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration.''  Our response is that the CBC will not buy into the divisive rhetoric that blames immigration for the social and economic problems in African American communities. Our members support comprehensive immigration reform. President Trump will not roll back the clock on our progress or doom another generation to the crippling effects of poverty.  Let me be clear: this 10-point plan really is a slap in the face to African Americans everywhere. As co-chair of the CBC's Working Group on Poverty and the Economy, along with Congressman Cleaver and chair of the Democratic Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality and Opportunity, we will continue to work to make sure that the vital resources for low-income Americans, African Americans, and those struggling to make ends meet are there.  We will make sure that the country understands that the Congressional Black Caucus continues to fight for a real deal for the African American community, for our entire Nation, and that means lifting people out of poverty, creating good-paying jobs, and moving forward on the progress that has been made.

Also to Congresswoman Plaskett, I thank the gentlewoman for continuing to speak out, to organize us, and for her stellar representation of her district.  Mr.Speaker, in his first week as President, Donald Trump advanced dangerous conspiracy theories and enacted a Muslim ban that undermines our Nation's standing in the world. These actions show that President Trump will peddle his alternative facts no matter the consequences.                              {time}  2015  Now, let me be clear. This approach to governance threatens our democracy and our national security. We must resist it. For starters, we cannot allow President Trump to erode our right to vote. Access to the ballot box is the cornerstone of American democracy, yet he spent his first week in office peddling the baseless myth that 3 to 5 million voted illegally in our election.  Mr.Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. Both Republicans and Democrats have dismissed this myth as unsubstantiated, but the President continues to insist that millions of fraudulent voters cost him the popular vote.  Let's call this what it is. This is a campaign by our highest elected official to fabricate reasons why he lost the majority of popular votes. He will use these blatant falsehoods to further undermine access to the voting booth.  Mr.Speaker, this investigation that is being proposed really is a sham. The real attack on America's elections come from Republicans who make it harder for people of color, young people, and low-income people to vote.  I include in the Record an editorial from The New York Times, ``The Voter Fraud Fantasy.''                [From The New York Times, 27, 2017]                        The Voter Fraud Fantasy                            (By Lilli Carre)       There are varying degrees of absurdity in the fallacies      President Trump peddled during his first week in the Oval      Perhaps the most damaging was his insistence that      millions of Americans voted illegally in the election he      narrowly won.       Mr.Trump first made that false claim in late November,      tweeting that he would have won the popular vote ``if you      deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.'' On      Wednesday, he announced that he intended to launch a ``major      investigation'' into voting fraud and suggested the outcome      may justify tightening voting rules.       What once seemed like another harebrained claim by a      president with little regard for the truth must now be      recognized as a real threat to American democracy. Mr.Trump      is telegraphing his administration's intent to provide cover      for longstanding efforts by Republicans to suppress minority      voters by purging voting rolls, imposing onerous      identification requirements and curtailing early voting.       ``This is another attempt to undermine our democracy,''      said Representative Barbara Lee of California, one of the      states where Mr.Trump falsely claimed results were tainted      by large-scale fraud. ``It's about not honoring and      recognizing demographic change.''       The apparent source of Mr.Trump's original claim of mass      voter fraud was Gregg Phillips, a Texas man with a penchant      for making wild allegations about voting fraud. Days before      Mr.Trump's tweet, Mr.Phillips claimed on Twitter that he      had ``verified more than three million votes cast by non-     citizens.'' State election officials across the political      spectrum promptly rejected that assertion, noting that ballot      box fraud in the United States is exceedingly rare.       On Friday, Mr.Trump tweeted that he was looking forward to      seeing the results of an analysis of illegal votes, as      promised by Mr.Republican officials know the voter      fraud claim is an indefensible lie. But few are challenging      Mr.Trump or raising alarms about how severely this hurts our      election system.       Voter suppression initiatives have grown increasingly      common since the Supreme[[Page H729]]     Court invalidated a central provision of the Voting Rights      Act in 2013, making it easier for local authorities to tweak      election rules in a manner that disenfranchises particular      groups of people.       Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department      aggressively fought these efforts. Lawsuits filed by civil      rights advocates and the Justice Department led a federal      appeals court in 2013 to strike down a North Carolina voter      ID law that justices concluded had been designed to target      African-American voters with ``surgical precision.''      Litigation in a similar Texas case is now on hold, pending      guidance from the new attorney general.       If Mr.Trump's attorney general nominee, Senator Jeff      Sessions, is confirmed, the Justice Department will be likely      to all but abandon enforcement of the Voting Rights ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgH723-2.txt,1501,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,30.0,January

Last year alone, hundreds of thousands of minority voters were disenfranchised before and on election day.  Instead of lodging investigations based on alternative facts, President Trump should be investigating the widespread efforts to disenfranchise voters, including the use of outdated voting machines, the mishandling of provisional ballots, the improper purging of voting rolls, and the widely reporting incidents of intimidation and misinformation at the polls.  These are the truth threats to our democracy. If these threats are not enough to occupy President Trump's attention, he should turn to the widespread evidence of Russian interference in our elections. The facts are available and in need of bipartisan investigation, but President Trump has no interest in evaluating facts. He would rather focus on falsehoods.  But the President's attacks on our democracy aren't restricted to alternative facts. This weekend we witnessed the erosion of another American value: our proud tradition as a refuge for immigrants of every religion. The President issued an executive order banning immigrants and refugees from the United States on the basis of religion.  This outrageous executive order to shut people out from several Muslim nations runs counter to our fundamental values that we cherish as It is morally reprehensible and will only make the United States less safe.

1395,topic-id,623,"Mr.Speaker, the President's executive order of Friday violates the law, it violates the Constitution, and it violates good sense.  How does it violate the law? Section 202(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act specifically prohibits nationality-based discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas and other visas. That is what this order did.  Now, the law is clear that individuals who pose a threat to the United States can--and I should add, should be--barred from the United States; but you can't just legally make a blanket objection based on nationality and, I would add, based on religion. That is what the President's order does. It suspends refugee admission completely for months.  Who are these refugees? Most of the refugees admitted last year were from Burma and the Congo, not from They are people who have been vetted for years, many of whom are fleeing for their lives and will continue to live in fear.  It does something else. It suspends admission even of legal permanent residents from seven countries, violating their rights to equal protection and to due process.  People want to keep the country safe--we all do; of course, I do--but how does this order keep us safe? Let me just give an example.  General Talib al-Kenani from Iraq commands the elite American-trained counterterrorism forces that have been leading the fight against ISIS for 2 years. His family relocated to the U.for safety. He can't visit them anymore. He said this:       I have been fighting terrorism for 13 years and winning.      Now my kids are asking: Am I a terrorist? I am a four-star      general, and I am banned from entering the United  I ask you: How does this advance our safety by barring our allies who are fighting ISIS? It doesn't.  I have got to correct something else. People have said that President Obama had an order in 2011 barring immigrants from That is false. We did additional vetting in 2011 because we wanted to make sure that anyone coming in was thoroughly examined. That slowed things down a little bit because there were new procedures, but there was never a halt to admission from those who are our allies in Iraq, those fighting ISIS with us.

Five days later, Union General Oliver Howard used the Wallis House as his headquarters and communications center during the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, one of the bloodiest 1-day battles of the entire war. This was also the last major battle before Atlanta fell to Union forces.  While the assault by General Sherman was a tactical failure costing the lives of over 3,000 of his men, the battle also inflicted heavy losses on the Having lost another 1,000 men, the Confederate Army could not stop General Sherman on his march to  Adjacent to the Wallis House is 8 acres of land known as Harriston This property offers a sweeping view of the valley leading to the Confederate line on top of Kennesaw Mountain and was used by the Union as signaling positions during the battle.

In addition to being critical sites in Civil War history, the Wallis House and Harriston Hill are two of the few original locations remaining from the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain associated with the Union Most of the park's current attractions correspond with Confederate history, and these additions will prove to be major historical acquisitions that will enhance the value of the park and provide insight into the Union's side of the story.

H.601, the Reinforcing Education Accountability in Development--READ--Act, which I introduced with my colleague, Representative David Reichert, would elevate the importance of education while improving USAID's efforts and ensuring that taxpayer dollars are well spent.  The challenge is clear. Nearly 60 million primary school-age children and 65 million adolescents are out of school around the world. Millions more are expected to never enroll. Women and girls are disproportionately out of school. The United States has a clear moral, economic, and security interest in promoting universal basic education as a fundamental human right.  The bill before us today enhances Congress' oversight of USAID's work with foreign governments, NGOs, and multilateral organizations to help nations develop and implement quality programs, address key barriers to school attendance, and increase completion rates for the poorest and most vulnerable children worldwide. It calls on USAID to develop a comprehensive strategy and appoint a senior coordinator tasked with ensuring that our programs expand access to millions of children who are not in school and improve the quality of education for millions who are.

So we are here again.  This is a promise that was made since 1946. These are men who have worked hard. They paid through the hard work they have accomplished through their own sweat, and we are trying to make sure they have their permanent fix to their health care and to their pensions. This is something that has a pay-for. It is back up again. It should have been done last year. We had an extension at the end until April is going to come and go again, and then we are going to start playing politics with this. If we get this done now and get it done quickly, it is something that we can move on, and we can take care of the other problems we have.  Again, this is the Miners Protection Act, which our miners have worked for, earned, and deserved. Their widows and families are expecting this. They need this in order to live any type of a quality life.  I thank you, again. I thank all of my colleagues--my Republican friends for signing onto this piece of legislation and all of my Democratic caucus, which unanimously signed onto it. It is something that should be done and done quickly.                                 ______                                       By Mr.McCONNELL:  176.

SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Ensure Long-Term      Protection for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017'' or the      ``HELP for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Over the 8 years preceding the date of the introduction      of this Act, the coal industry and the communities supported      by that industry have struggled, in large part due to      overregulation.       (2) Excessive regulation has, in large part, made coal more      expensive to mine and use and has put it at an unfair      disadvantage in the marketplace.       (3) Because of these struggles--       (A) the coal mining industry has lost over 30,000 jobs      since President Obama's inauguration;       (B) over 600 coal mines have shuttered since President      Obama's inauguration;       (C) more than 25 coal mining companies have filed for      bankruptcy since President Obama's inauguration;       (D) Kentucky alone has lost over 10,000 coal mining jobs      since President Obama's inauguration; and       (E) the total number of operating coal mines has hit its      lowest point on record.       (4) Because of the health risks often associated with      mining, robust health benefits are vital to coal miner      retirees; however, coal company bankruptcies, job cuts, and      closures have exhausted the ability of many coal companies to      continue providing health benefits to retirees and their      dependents.       (5) Congress has stepped in twice before, in 1992 and in      2006, to assist retired miners and to secure their health      benefits. When thousands more were at risk of losing their      benefits at the end of 2016, Congress intervened again to      provide a 4-month extension in health benefits for orphaned      retired miners and their dependents.       (6) While this extension helped prevent the loss of health      benefits for thousands of miners, it did not provide a long-     term solution.[[Page S344]]       (7) It is necessary to provide a permanent extension of      health care benefits for the orphaned retirees who are at      risk of losing their retirement health benefits at the end of      April 2017.     3.

Eventually he was assigned as an Army combat historian and rose to the rank ofcolonel. He was one of five people assigned to interview leaders of Nazi Germany after the war.  His experience as a warhistorian led to his joining the Truman administration as an adviser on local issues during his tours across the Heremained on Truman's administration throughout the remainder of his tenure and briefly into the administration of Dwight D. He was the author of ``The Bridge at Remagen,'' which detailed the Army's crossing of the Rhine River duringWorld War This publication helped make him a household name.  Ken later joined the American Political ScienceAssociation, with one of his jobs requiring him to find political science professors for colleges. His legacy in West Virginiabegan in 1957 when he got a request to teach political science at Marshall College, now Marshall Following one termat Marshall, he ran for Congress and won. He served nine terms in the U.House of Representatives from 1957 to 1977.  Hesaw West Virginia for the welcoming place it is. Once you have visited our little State, it never really leaves you. Mostimportantly, Ken recognized quickly the issues that matter in West Virginia--mostly concerning the coal industry and protectionof our miners. In the wake of the explosion at the Consol 9 mine in my hometown of Farmington, Ken played a key role in thepromotion of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. I personally lost many individuals who I knew well, including my dearUncle John and several classmates, in that explosion. The implementation of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act set thegroundwork for everything we have accomplished for our miners since then. I will always be grateful for Ken's contributions.  Among his many history-making legacies, Ken joined the march to Selma with the Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1965. Hewas the only active Member of Congress to participate.  After a successful tenure in Congress, Ken served as West Virginia'sSecretary of He moved his desk out front so he could interact with visitors passing through. He loved to visit with allWest He fought for transparency in our campaign finance system, was passionate about protecting our democraticprocess, and fought to ensure that West Virginians had access to cast their ballots.  Ken never gave up his commitment topublic service and continued to be active on the issues that matter to the public. At the age of 85, he walked 530 miles withGranny D to show his unwavering commitment to campaign finance reform, shortly after the McCain-Feingold Act passed Congress.Put simply, Ken was never one to back down from a challenge. The man was fearless and fought tirelessly for causes he believedin.  What is most important is that he lived a full life, surrounded by dear friends and family. It is my hope that Ken'sloved ones are able to find peace, strength, and support in one another. This is a time to celebrate his life and vastaccomplishments, as well as the countless lives he touched, and to honor his memory in our thoughts and prayers.  Again, Iextend my most sincere condolences to his loving wife, Carol, and the entire Hechler family and dear friends. I am honored tojoin the people of West Virginia and beyond in recognizing his memory, as well as the unwavering love he had for his loved onesand our great His legacy of service will live on forever.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-20-pt1-PgS358.txt,1983,TRANSIT SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY ACT,2017.0,20.0,January
1095,topic-id,358,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.560, my bill to reauthorize limited commercial vehicle traffic along Route 209 through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Tomorrow marks 16 months during which uncertainty has reigned over this 21-mile stretch of road running through my district.  Over 30 years ago, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania transferred Route 209, then a State road, to the National Park As commercial vehicle traffic is banned on roads within our national parks, it would ultimately be restricted on this stretch of Route 209. But at that time, a 10-year exemption was made to support the local freight transport industry and because acceptable alternative routes were unavailable.  After multiple extensions, the most recent commercial vehicle authorization expired at the end of September 2015. To address the problem, county and township officials from the surrounding areas met with the National Park Service and my staff to negotiate a new plan. They recognized a continuing need to allow some commercial vehicles access and settled on the carefully crafted language we are considering today.  The work to produce this extension acknowledges the continued need of the employers, businesses, and homeowners in Pike and Monroe Unfortunately, although the House passed identical language in the 114th Congress and the Senate moved it to the floor, this important legislation failed to become law. The resulting uncertainty created hardship for families and businesses in the communities neighboring the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation  The lack of access to this stretch of road has cast a cloud on a wide range of local businesses from heating fuel and package delivery to plumbers and electricians. Homeowners cannot access the services they need and countless jobs are in jeopardy. This is a critical piece of legislation for my constituents. We must pass it today and urge the Senate to act just as quickly.  I want to thank Chairman Bishop and Federal Lands Subcommittee Chairman McClintock, and I want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their support and work with my staff to bring this bill to the floor as quickly as possible.  I urge my colleagues to support it.  ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgH717-2.txt,2053,FIRST RESPONDER ACCESS TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES ACT,2017.0,30.0,January

1714,topic-id,1398,"Mr.President, the Senate's advise and consent role is one of our most important duties as Senators, and the Secretary of State is one of the most important nominations we will consider. The Secretary of State is America's chief diplomat, and he should project America's values to the world.  Yesterday, I joined Senator Schumer in calling for a delay on Mr.Tillerson's vote on the Senate floor until we hear from him about President Trump's Muslim ban.  Turning away refugees based on their nationality and religion is un-American, it is illegal, and it is immoral. This Muslim ban is propaganda for It is a recruiting gift to terrorist groups around the world and in our own country. It will increase the risk of harm to Americans everywhere, including here at home. Donald Trump is sending a message to Muslims around the world that they are all suspects. This has profound implications for our ability to work with governments in the Middle East in the fight against terrorism. One of the countries named in this Executive order is Iraq, our closest ally in the fight against Conflict and war is forcing millions around the world from their homeland. Donald Trump's Muslim ban directly undermines our historic commitment to international cooperation and international refugee aid. That is why world leaders have joined the chorus of millions of Americans who do not support the Muslim ban.  America has always been a beacon to those fleeing persecution and violence. We are a refuge for those seeking a better life. The poetic inscription at the base of the Statue of Liberty does not say: Send back ``your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'' As our top diplomat, Mr.Tillerson will be in a position to work directly with the nations named in this Executive order, and we need to hear how he believes it will impact our standing around the world.  With respect to Mr.Tillerson's nomination, I have very serious concerns. Rex Tillerson could have enjoyed his retirement after spending more than 40 years at Instead, he answered the call to enter public service, and I commend him for that. His record at ExxonMobil is one that clearly has received accolades. He did a good job for He is highly respected in the oil industry. But public service requires the public's trust, and Mr.Tillerson will not have that trust unless he agrees to recuse himself from participating in decisions that would affect ExxonMobil for the entirety of his term. So far, he has refused to do so.  Our laws require Federal officials to recuse themselves when a reasonable person could question their impartiality. Before President Trump nominated him to be Secretary of State, Mr.Tillerson worked for one company--ExxonMobil--for virtually his entire adult life. As he rose to become a senior manager and then CEO, Mr.Tillerson was personally involved in getting lucrative oil deals in a number of countries, including In fact, during Mr.Tillerson's time as CEO of ExxonMobil, the company expanded its drilling rights in Russia to 63 million acres. That is an area the size of Wyoming and nearly five times the size of Exxon's holdings in the United  But Mr.Tillerson didn't just deepen the relationship between his company and He also tried to protect that relationship by speaking out against sanctions on As a reward for personally cementing Exxon's relationship with Russia, President Vladimir Putin awarded Mr.Tillerson the Russian Order of  The stakes with U.S.-Russia relations could not be higher. Russia has invaded the Ukraine, annexed Crimea, bombed innocent civilians in Aleppo, and attacked our elections with cyber weapons. Our next Secretary of State will be negotiating with Russia on[[Page S525]]some of the most critical foreign policy issues facing the world.  Mr.Tillerson's decades-long history at ExxonMobil and Exxon's vast holdings in Russia clearly create a conflict of interest. How can the American people be sure Mr.Tillerson will be objective when he participates in matters relating to sanctions on Russia or in any matters that could affect Exxon in the dozens of other countries in the world where Exxon operates?  As the top ethics lawyers for Presidents Bush and Obama have said, these conflicts could require Mr.Tillerson to recuse himself from any matters affecting ExxonMobil, irrespective of his financial divestitures. When I asked Mr.Tillerson during his confirmation hearing whether he would commit to recuse himself without waiver or exception from matters affecting Exxon for the duration of his tenure as Secretary of State, he refused. That is unacceptable. The American people and the national security of the United States demand a Secretary of State whose impartiality is unambiguous.  Make no mistake, the stockholders of ExxonMobil would have serious questions about hiring the leader of the Sierra Club to be the new CEO of We, too, should have questions about hiring ExxonMobil's former CEO to be America's chief diplomat.  If he agreed to recuse himself, Mr.Tillerson would be following a tradition that is longstanding and bipartisan. Secretary of State James Baker recused himself from participating in any matter that could affect the price of oil and gas. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson promised not to participate in any matter where Goldman Sachs was a party. And all of President Obama's appointees recused themselves from any matters related to their former employers or clients. Mr.Tillerson's refusal to follow their example will call into question his impartiality, and it could undermine his effectiveness as  During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Tillerson displayed an alarming lack of understanding of oil's role in geopolitics--clearly a consequence of having worked solely at Exxon--that disqualifies him from being Secretary of  When I questioned him, Mr.Tillerson told me that he never had supported U.energy independence. He told me that he didn't agree that reducing America's demand for oil and our reliance on foreign oil imported from the Middle East would strengthen our negotiating position with oil-producing nations.  We as a nation still import 5 million barrels of oil every single day into the United Three million of those barrels a day come from OPEC members, such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and ExxonMobil has energy interests in each one of those countries. And we are still exporting our own young men and women in uniform overseas to defend those energy interests every single day.  Mr.Tillerson is looking at the world through oil-coated glasses. He may have gotten rid of Exxon's stock, but he hasn't gotten rid of Exxon's mindset.  Mr.Tillerson's answers to questions about climate change--the global generational challenge of our time--are a cause for extreme concern. Although he recognized that climate change is real and human activities influenced it, he would not commit to continuing action on it as a foreign policy priority. Throughout his hearing, Mr.Tillerson would only say that he wanted to keep a seat at the table of climate negotiations. The United States needs to have more than a seat at the table; we need to be at the head of the table.  In December 2015, 150 heads of state gathered in support of finalizing the Paris climate accord. It represents a global solution to the problem of global warming in which all countries commit to doing their fair share. Instead of strengthening this historic accord, Mr.Tillerson indicated that all treaties and agreements to which the United States is a party would be up for review by President  America needs a Secretary of State who will lead the world to fully realize the clean energy revolution that will help us avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change while creating millions of jobs. To abandon the Paris climate accord would be to abandon our clean energy future. We cannot roll back years of progress cutting dangerous carbon emissions or deploying clean energy solutions.  For 41 years, Rex Tillerson's world view has been to advance the interests of one place and one place only--Confirming Mr.Tillerson as Secretary of State would be turning over the keys of U.foreign policy to Big Big Oil's interests are not America's interest. If Mr.Tillerson were to negotiate with Russia and President Putin, whose interests will he represent--those of Big Oil or those of the American people? I still do not have satisfactory answers to that critical question. For those reasons, I cannot vote for his confirmation.  I thank you for allowing me to speak at this time on the Senate floor.

289,topic-id,324,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support of my bill, H.423, the Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017.  I am honored to have authored this bill with Congressman Barton and Congressman Lance once again, and I thank Amy Murphy and Ryan Farrell of their respective staffs for working so closely with mine. I also thank the COMET Civic Association from my district for first bringing this problem to my attention.  This legislation seeks to combat spoofing, which is when phone call recipients are tricked into answering the phone due to inaccurate caller ID information. Criminals have used this technique to scam thousands of Americans and steal millions of dollars. Recent spoofing attempts have included scam artists pretending to be sheriff's offices, hospitals, and even the The bill before us this afternoon expands spoofing protections to calls that originate outside of the country as well as text messages.  It is often stated that a measure of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable. Almost every day, I receive new reports of spoofing that harm the most vulnerable in my district, including immigrants, seniors, veterans, and those in need of help from law enforcement. That is why this legislation is endorsed by senior citizens, law enforcement, and consumer protection groups.  The Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017 is a bipartisan bill. It passed the House in both the 113th and 114th Congresses under suspension of the rules, and it is my sincere hope that this bill will continue to be noncontroversial and that we will do everything in our power to combat telephone scams against our constituents.  In closing, I thank Representatives Blackburn and Doyle for their support this afternoon, as well as Energy and Commerce Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Without their support, this legislation would not be on the floor.  I urge the Senate to quickly take up this legislation.  I urge all of my colleagues in this Chamber to support it once again.

1276,topic-id,1540,"Mr.President, citizens across the country are very concerned. In fact, they are more than concerned; they are terrified that our President is degrading the fundamental values on which our Nation was founded: religious tolerance, freedom of religion, the ability to worship as you please, and a fundamental principle that we would be welcoming to refugees, that we would be a nation that embraces immigrants.  Tonight Lady Liberty is crying. She said, ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,'' but our President has slammed the door on the tired and the poor and the huddled masses. It is an action the citizens in my home State have come out to protest. They have gone to the airport in Portland en masse 2 days in a row to say that we are welcoming to the world, that we are not going to slam the door shut on refugees, that we are not going to single out Muslim nations and say: We do not want you here.  Indeed, I held two townhalls over the weekend. The first was in a gymnasium about this size. There were 600 people jammed into it. They are very upset and angry that our fundamental values are being disregarded by the President of the United Then I went to my second townhall. I thought 600 was a lot; there were 3,700 Oregonians who came out to my second townhall. Every one of them is wanting to send a message to President Trump: You are taking us on the wrong road--a road that hurts people around the world, a road that hurts our fundamental values, and a road that decreases our security.  This Executive order, this Executive action from the President has had an[[Page S472]]immediate and painful impact--hundreds of people en route to our country detained at airports although they were legally traveling here. Many of them have been vetted on extended periods, some of them going through several years of vetting, and finally they have in their hand that visa that says, yes, I am going to have a country, and it is going to be the United States of And the President crushed that hope.  Chaos and confusion abounded. Lawyers and protesters and advocates descended on airports everywhere across this country to tell the administration that there is no mandate, no public will for this path that is so destructive to our values. They came out to say: Mr.President, when you tear down women in America, we stand with the women of Mr.President, when you tear down the disabled, we stand with the disabled of Mr.President, when you tear down African Americans and Hispanics, we stand with African Americans and And, Mr.President, when you tear down Muslims, we stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters because this is the United States of America, where we value religious freedom, where we value religious tolerance. This is a nation of immigrants. If you are not 100 percent Native American, then you are either an immigrant yourself or you are the child or the grandchild or the great-grandchild of an immigrant. Most of us can track members of our family who came from the ravages of war or the ravages of drought or the ravages of oppression to come here to this soil, this land of freedom. James Madison remarked: ``America was indebted to immigration for her settlement and for her prosperity.'' This remains just as true today as it was in Madison's day.  Here we stand, but the President of the United States has denied access to our Nation to a group of people based on nothing more than religious beliefs, betraying our values of religious tolerance and shutting the doors on refugees. The President has said this is not a ban on those of the Muslim faith, but of course it is a ban on those of Muslim faith because it is a ban on seven nations that are Muslim nations, with an exception made for individuals who are Christians so it is nothing more than a ban on  The President says this is about protecting our citizens, but let us be very clear about that. Numerous refugees have come to our land, numerous immigrants, and there have been zero fatal terror attacks carried out by the immigrants from the seven countries listed in the order. We have been attacked by individuals from other countries which are not listed in the order, from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Those nations aren't listed on this order. What we do know is that this ban does not make our Nation safer. National security experts recognize that it does exactly the opposite. By signing this Executive order, the President has betrayed our most fundamental values and principles, antagonizing 1.6 billion citizens of the world, and given our enemies ammunition for their false narrative that America is at war with Islam because that is exactly what they have used to recruit. That is exactly what they have used to increase and pour fuel on the fire to persuade people to attack The President has basically handed them this argument--this false narrative--and put our Nation at risk.  Former CIA Director Michael Hayden said to National Public Radio this morning, ``In fact, what we're doing now has probably made us less safe today than we were Friday morning before this happened, because we are now living the worst jihadist narrative possible, that there is undying enmity between Islam and the West.''  I share the value of Daniel Benjamin, the former Coordinator for Counterterrorism at the State Department, who said this: ``It sends an unmistakable message to the American Muslim community that they are facing discrimination and isolation,'' and that message, he said, will ``feed the jihadist narrative that the United States is at war with Islam, potentially encouraging a few more Muslims to plot violence.''  This is the wrong move in every possible way. It is ill-considered, it is hasty, it is dangerous, it is wrongheaded, it puts American citizens at risk, and it helps our enemies. Benjamin Franklin once said: ``Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.'' In this case, President Trump's Executive order has degraded both our liberty and our security--both our liberty and our safety.  We have turned our backs on friends and allies who are helping us in the war against The President has made it clear that he wants to take on ISIS as we had been, but he wants to amplify it, and he has sabotaged that effort with this Executive order.  There are individuals like Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who worked for more than a decade for the United States as an interpreter in Our interpreters place their lives at risk to assist our soldiers. They place the lives of their families at risk to assist the United States of This man risked his life for more than 10 years for us, and how is he greeted when he arrives here in our country? He is greeted with handcuffs. Muslim Iraqi interpreters like Mr.Darweesh have earned the right to come to They risked their lives and their family's lives. They assisted us in multitudinous ways.  What about this ban on refugees? Refugees are the most thoroughly vetted of all those who come to the United If a terrorist wants to come to the United States, a terrorist wouldn't attempt to come as a refugee. It would be 1 to 2 years of waiting in miserable conditions in a refugee camp, with all kinds of vetting, and they might never get permission to come. If you want intense vetting, then look to how we vet refugees. Blocking women and children and interpreters from coming to our country who have been the most thoroughly vetted of all potential immigrants is simply wrong. In fact, the model for vetting refugees is intense. Women and orphans are just searching for a safe haven, but we have turned our back and we have slammed the door.  America is better than this. For centuries we have been a beacon of hope to the world. We have been a beacon of justice, a beacon of compassion, and we must restore our Nation as a beacon of hope, justice, liberty, and compassion.  Millions of Americans are coming out in the snow and the rain and in some places in good weather. They are coming out in any possible conditions to speak out and say: This is not This is not us. Change paths. Tear down this ban. Tear down this ban that has slammed the door on refugees. Tear down this ban which has placed our Nation at risk.  Let us together put our Nation back on track. Let us together fight for the values that made America great for the last two centuries. Let us together fight for the richness of our culture and our community, the strength of our society that comes from being a nation of immigrants. We need to act and act urgently.

1709,topic-id,2046,"Mr.President, I appreciate my colleague's contributions and his insights, representing Virginia and representing the United  I must say that all of us were quite frustrated by the hearing we held with Rex We know that America needs a strong and capable Secretary of We have many great power issues to wrestle with--certainly with Russia, certainly with We know we have many emerging powers around the globe that will raise issues relevant to the security of the United States and the economy of the United We know the Secretary of State plays a key role in shaping our policy toward impoverished nations and how we might facilitate their growth and enhance our Nation's relationship with them. Nuclear strategy is always an extremely important role.  This position is perhaps the most important position in the administration, second to the Presidency, and it is for that reason that we are weighing with such intense attention.  Already we have challenges that have been raised by the conduct of our President over the last 12 days. We have, in 12 days, seen actions by President Trump that have diminished our Nation's standing in the world, that have offended many of our international neighbors and allies, that have weakened the security of our country. So we need a capable Secretary of We need that person soon.  Certainly one piece of the pattern we have seen is a new low in the relationship with the leadership of Mexico on our southern border, but we also have seen actions that have offended over a billion people in the world through the Friday night Executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations along with an order affecting refugees fleeing the ravages and devastation of war in many places, but Syria is specifically singled out for a longer period of time.  The President said, well, this is not, in fact, a Muslim ban and that it is about the security of the United States of America, but he is certainly wrong on both counts. All the nations singled out are Muslim-majority countries. Not a single immigrant from any of those countries has killed an American in a terrorist attack, and the President[[Page S520]]made a very specific point, saying there would be exceptions for Christians, meaning there would not be exceptions for  One of his advisers, Rudy Giuliani, even said explicitly that the President had wanted to do a Muslim ban and asked him how to do it legally. So the intent is crystal clear that this is a ban founded in religious discrimination, and a policy based on religious discrimination has no place in our It is completely incompatible with our traditions and our principles of religious liberty.  We are a nation built by immigrants, founded by men and women seeking safety from religious persecution, adding to the sense that this position is wrong and abhorrent. It goes against the fundamental building blocks of our Nation and everything we stand for.  If our history and our fundamental values aren't enough, then we need to consider the danger this ban represents for our national security. Much of our efforts in the Middle East involve close partnership, close teamwork with the leaders of Muslim nations.  Taking on ISIS involves close coordination and close teamwork with the leadership of Muslim nations. In fact, we should be very aware that ISIS uses as its recruiting tool that the United States is conducting a war on Islam, and the President's actions feed directly in and serve the ISIS recruiting strategy.  The world has reacted with furor. Over the weekend, more than 4,000 Oregonians attended a pair of my townhall meetings. The first meeting was in a room about this size, and I was astounded to see 600 people just jammed in, just crowding it. It was the largest townhall I had ever had. I do 36 townhalls a year, open forum. People can come and ask anything they want.  Then I went to my second townhall, and it wasn't 600 folks. It was 3,700 people who turned out just because they heard that a Senator was holding a townhall, and they wanted to make their voices heard about how wrong they thought it was, the direction that President Trump is headed. A key piece of that was certainly his ban on Muslims entering our  Protests erupted at airports all across our country. I went out on Sunday to the Portland It had been informally organized, the protest at 2 o'clock, and I got out there about 2:15. People were pouring in. There may have been somewhere around 1,000 people by the time I could get out onto the upper level deck of the two levels of the airport--the level at which people are arriving for their flights--to be able to speak to people.  The condemnation and opposition didn't just come from the grassroots across It didn't just come from the spontaneous voices of American citizens who value religious liberty, value our traditions, value their understanding of our Constitution and wanting to send a message to President Trump that he was violating each and every one of those things, that opposition came loud and clear from international leaders as well.  Our Canadian neighbors made sure the world knew they welcomed the immigrants and refugees that America had slammed the door on.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the President to remind him of our Nation's responsibilities, as signatories to the Geneva Convention, to take in refugees. It is quite embarrassing that a European leader has to call an American President to educate him about the Geneva  France's President Francois Hollande has called for a firm European response to this ban; the United Kingdom, whose Prime Minister Theresa May just met with President Trump last week, came out against the order; and more than a million Britons signed a petition to have the British Government rescind its invitation to President Trump to travel to London for a state visit.  Iraq, Iran, Brussels, Scotland, Norway, nation after nation have come out to protest this terrible, dangerous policy.  It is going to be up to our next Secretary of State to repair and rebuild these relationships and the reputation of the United States of So much damage has been done in just 12 days.  My colleagues Senator McCain and Senator Graham said in a statement this weekend: ``This Executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,'' and indeed it does.  So is Rex Tillerson the right individual to set our Nation back on a firm and steady course? Is he the right person to guide us through this volatile international landscape, where we need to rebuild alliances and restore leadership?  In short, the answer is that Rex Tillerson is not the right man to do it.  Forty years in the oil and gas market, 40 years in an oil company are good preparations for leading an oil company but not good preparation for leading the United States of America in international relations, not good preparation for serving as our top diplomat, putting out fires, calming fears, communicating our policies to the world in this volatile moment in history.  During the hearing, there were a series of questions really related to one's moral compass in leading the foreign policy of the United States of One of the questions I asked about was Exxon's effort to set up a subsidiary to evade American sanctions on Iran and what did he feel about that as a leader of He responded by saying: I don't have any memory of this. Really? The top management of Exxon decides to set up a subsidiary to circumvent American sanctions on Iran with a great deal of national security at stake, and he has no memory? Well, that was certainly a disappointing comment and an unbelievable statement.  How about when we asked him about Exxon lobbying against U.sanctions on Russia because of its annexation of Crimea and the holding of territory in the eastern part of Ukraine? He said: Oh, Exxon didn't lobby on this. Yet the lobbying reports were right there. We have transparency on this. Millions of dollars were spent lobbying on this issue, and they certainly weren't lobbying for U.sanctions. This was a second extraordinary statement by the nominee.  I then asked the nominee about Exxon's pattern of working with dictators to take the royalties for oil and funnel them to the dictator's family rather than to the treasury. This is particularly true in Equatorial Guinea where President Obiang has declared himself President for life. His response was simply: But Senator, we weren't successfully prosecuted for violating the law. That is not a statement related to moral compass and understanding. Certainly, when a company takes a nation's treasure and diverts it into the pockets of a dictator, you are affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Certainly, the people of Equatorial Guinea are a poor people who could use those resources for health care, for transportation systems. The President of Equatorial Guinea is famous for filling a plane with fancy sports cars from Europe and flying them to Equatorial And how does he do that? Because Exxon steered the royalties for that nation's oil into the pockets of the dictator, but we didn't get any sense that there was any concern about the impact that it had on the people of that nation.  Members of the committee asked him about the extrajudicial killings by police officers in the Philippines--the extrajudicial killings ordered by President Young men were shot down in the street. I think at last count an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 young men were assassinated in the street, and he simply said: I need to get more information. This is not something that has been hidden on the back pages of the newspaper; this is something fundamentally contrary to the principles of due process and justice that our Nation stands for. Couldn't the nominee have expressed that this is completely in violation of our core principles? But he had no ability to do so.  We come then to global warming, an impact that is occurring right now on the ground in my The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas, causing an accumulation of carbon dioxide and an accumulation of methane, is resulting in the acidification of the ocean. That is causing oysters to have difficulty reproducing because it affects the formation of their shells at the beginning of their life. The higher acidity makes it harder to form shells.  We see global warming in Oregon in terms of a longer fire season with more[[Page S521]]intense fires. It is burning more forest there than ever before. We see it in terms of a lower average snowpack on the Cascades that is causing significant drought and smaller and warmer trout streams. This isn't some strange phenomenon that we imagine might happen in the future; it is happening at this moment. We have high tides that are now covering the sidewalks of cities on sunny days. We have moose dying of ticks because it is not cold enough to kill the ticks in the winter. We have lobsters off Maine traveling further into Canada while they start to get fish from the It is everywhere we look. It impacts the economy of our country, particularly our rural economy of fishing, forestry, and farming. His response was simply: We need to keep talking to people about it. He says it is an issue, not particularly urgent, not necessitating American leadership, but just something we should be at the table for--not at the table to urge others, just be at the table. That certainly misses the size of this challenge to our planet.  Here we are, 12 days into the Presidency with major international problems occurring, and we have a nominee who, on issue after issue after issue, lacked a moral compass or insight about the complexity of issues, about the principles of our So for these reasons, I am voting against the nominee.

A majority of Americans believe abortion is wrong, and they do not wish to see their tax dollars pay for this gruesome procedure that ends the life of another human being. This legislation permanently puts into law a longstanding policy that has been renewed by Congress every year. It will reassure Americans that the hard-earned money they pay to the government will never be used to fund abortions.  This is necessary because the Affordable Care Act, a law that has been unaffordable for so many Americans, actually paid subsidies for healthcare plans that include abortion. This is unacceptable.

I hate to date him. He has been a member of the prestigious appropriations committee. So, therefore, he was tasked with taking Federal funds and making those appropriations and those decisions at the State level.

I am feeling a little confused and perplexed as to how this would work. I fear that this is part of kind of the double speak or alternative facts about the roots of and the solutions to poverty.  As the gentleman now serves on the Committee on Small Business here in the House, and he has been an appropriator, I am wondering, number one, if converting funds from, say, the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Act, which is comprised of mostly poor women and children or Social Security disability insurance, which is set aside for those folks with significant disabilities, or perhaps SNAP and food stamps, those people who are temporarily out of the workforce waiting to go back, find another job, but need to sort of eat that month--I am wondering how, in his experience, converting programs set aside for poor people would a poor person use a microloan.  I have two questions. I want the gentleman to sort of respond to what poor people would do. Presumably they would create their own jobs with these microloans. How big, perhaps, would these microloans have to be in order for them to establish their own businesses so that they would be off welfare?  In fact, on any given day, there are 3 million children who live in extreme poverty, off of less than $3 a day. So I guess I would wonder how converting those funds--what those children who are not capable and eligible to work would do with such a proposal.

He says he wants to get them off of welfare. Would they sell fruit on the street? How would that work in Detroit or Milwaukee?  We are not talking about women who live in countries where microloans may work very well in those limited economies.                              {time}  2100  I am also wondering how those people who are structurally unemployed would benefit from these microloans.  What this does, Madam Chairperson of this initiative, is that what this really is saying is that this is really perpetuating the persistent myth of people who are poor as the shiftless, lazy welfare queens of poverty pimps, and that the solution is to take away the safety net and force them to do some kind of work, whether that work is sustainable enough for them.  And so I would say, as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, that we ought to have welfare reform that really honors our commitment as Americans to make sure that we provide some kind of safety net for the majority of the poor who are, in fact, children. There are, in fact, people who are not capable, or should not be responsible, for providing for themselves through our very sophisticated economy.  I would say, Mr.Speaker, that if we really want to help get people off welfare, we should not start the debate by taking away reproductive freedom from women. One of the major reasons that women fall into poverty is the lack of access to birth control, health care, that would enable them to plan their families, plan their pregnancies. And to say that you are going to help people get off welfare and to snatch away funds from Planned Parenthood or their ability to control their reproduction is a nonstarter in truly helping the truly poor.  I think that President Trump's quest to help those who are truly poor will only come if the President and his team will actually listen to the voices of the poor, actually listen to solutions that have been tried and tested, like providing educational opportunity and upward mobility to poor people; by respecting women's reproductive rights to choose; by really creating a sense of Congress that any goal of welfare reform ought to be to protect children; that any welfare reform ought to make sure that women are free from domestic violence, sex trafficking, and human trafficking, and that they be protected; and that during these periods they not be cut off from public support.

The goal is to be in the Nation's Capital in the hope that we can make better things happen for I have had the privilege of being surrounded by many dedicated individuals--most of them Kansans--over the period of time that I have served in the Congress of the United States of I know that my ability to work on behalf of Kansans and on behalf of the citizens of our Nation is greatly altered and improved by the fact that people who care about America, who care about our home State, are there by my side. One of those most important to me has been my chief of staff.  Todd was an elected official in his own right. He was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives and served there with distinction. Twelve years ago, back in the days when I was a Member of the U.House of Representatives, I asked him to uproot his family and move to Washington, DC, and assume the task of managing our office and helping accomplish the things that we all wanted to accomplish. He has done it with great style and with grace and with friendship. He has been the person who has motivated us to do better and has always done it in a way in which we felt good about what we were doing, in a management style that made us feel good about ourselves, bringing us together, not taking us apart, making certain we knew that the outcome was important, but how we got there--matters that are important to us as individuals, as human beings with integrity, doing things right, telling the truth--those things were always honored and achieved because of his leadership.  People are hard to replace, and Todd is especially difficult to replace. I spend almost every week in the Nation's Capital, away from my own family. Like many people here in the Senate, those who work in our offices become part of our family. That is certainly true with the people who work in my office today. I feel that, although when I came to Congress I was more their age, now there is a significantly wider gap in the age of our staff and me. But my wife and I believe that I am surrounded by people who are part of our family, and Todd is certainly that. In fact, his family grew while he was my chief of staff. His two children, Grace and Will, were born during the days of his time as an employee in our office. Again, as a reminder about how to put things in perspective, he was always taking care of his kids. He was always there for their school activities, part of the school board, involved in their athletic and musical activities. That is a good thing for a chief of staff to know because if it is important to him, he will make certain that his commitment is permitted, honored, and encouraged by those who work in the office.  So tonight, I just want to say thank you to Todd Novascone from Hanover, KS, who decided to devote 12 years of his life here in the Nation's Capital, trying to make things better, trying to make our office work well, and trying to achieve the things all of us want to achieve for our So, Todd Novascone, thank you for a job well done, thank you for being my friend, and thank you for the way you have conducted yourself on my behalf.

America needs a CIA Director who will uphold American values by resolutely condemning torture and mass surveillance. Mr.Pompeo's last-minute attempt to walk back his opposition to torture is very disturbing and suggests the Trump administration is readying to abandon our commitment to international human rights.  Second, Mr.Pompeo's enthusiasm for bringing back programs that sweep up massive amounts of Americans' private information is deeply troubling. I have no confidence that Donald Trump would sufficiently protect the private emails of Americans if he had access to them, and Mr.Pompeo's support for large-scale data collection programs is inconsistent with the bipartisan reforms of the PATRIOT Act that passed in the last  Third, I am very worried that Mr.Pompeo, as CIA Director, will continue the trend of covert agencies usurping the power of the State Department and the Defense Mr.Pompeo, under questioning, refused to acknowledge the longstanding precedent of diplomatic embassies having primary authority for final signoff on overseas operations.

1283,topic-id,3948,"Mr.President, there is a French farmer by the name of Hector John de He immigrated to the United States from Normandy, France, in 1759, and he settled in the Hudson He married an American woman. The astounding diversity of those who settled around him, his fellow farmers, was shocking to him. He said: It is ``a mixture of English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Germans, and Swedes.''  There was one family he knew who had an English grandfather, a Dutch grandmother, an Anglo-Saxon son who had a French wife, whose four sons all married women who were from different places of different nationalities. Hector said: ``From this promiscuous breed, that race now called Americans has arisen.''  He asked: ``What then is the American, this new man?''  This farmer who came to America from Normandy in 1759 wrote this:       He is an American, who leaving behind him all his ancient      prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode      of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the      new rank he holds. The American is the new man who acts upon      new principles. . . . Here individuals of all nations are      melted into a new race of men.  George Washington told us that the bosom of America is open to the oppressed and the persecuted of all nations and religions.  That great American philosopher, Alexis de Tocqueville, that observer of American life, said in a letter:       Imagine, my dear friend, if you can, a society formed of      all the nations of the world . . . people having different      languages, beliefs, opinions: in a word, a society without      roots, without memories, without prejudices, without      routines, without common ideas, without a national character,      yet a hundred times happier than our own.  I am not sure if any of those are completely accurate descriptions of what an American was or is or whether those are commensurate with our understanding as to the foundations of this country, but they speak to this founding ideal of America, this place where you could come from any part of the world with any set of beliefs, with any religion, with any skin color, and become something that is uniquely new.  There were people here before those who traveled from far-off lands, but to be an American is in many ways an invention--an invention of the amalgamation of faiths of peoples from all over the world.  Both Hector and de Tocqueville talk about the leaving behind of prejudices when you come to this new country. Inherent in that idea is this belief of new Americans that the discrimination they faced in other places could be washed away upon coming to a country, a land at that time in which everyone was equal, everyone started from the same place. Of course, that has to be true because this country was founded by individuals who were fleeing religious persecution, who thought that America was a place in which they could practice their religion freely. They could be who they knew themselves to be.  The reason why you hear such anxiety and anger and sadness from many in this Chamber and from many people we represent is because what happened on Friday is an abandonment of American originalism. It is a walking back of the faith that we have held since the days in which Scotch and Irish and French and Dutch and German and Swede came to this country believing that they could leave behind prejudices. It feels as if we are shrinking as a country before our eyes.  A young woman from Stamford, CT, wrote me this beautiful letter, and I want to read some of it to you. She encapsulates in modern language what Crevecoeur, Washington, and de Tocqueville were saying centuries ago. She said:       I am the proud descendant of Syrian immigrants. My great-     grandparent's sacrifices to resettle in Rhode Island have      shaped my entire life. I've grown up very close to my      grandfather, the first generation of his family born in      America, and I know what my ancestors did to be here and      how far we've come from them being persecuted and      subjected to religious violence in I was able to      grow up around Syrian culture and appreciate how great-     grandparents made it possible for my entire family to be      where they are now.       To give you an idea, my grandfather went on to receive a      master's degree and was a high school teacher and guidance      counselor. He is also heavily involved in the Roman Catholic      church and quietly serves communion in hospitals each      My father, second generation, also received a master's,      serves on hospital boards, and has had a successful career in      human resources. With their encouragement, I have begun a      career as a journalist, one I have dreamed of since I was in      high school.       In 2012, on the 100-year anniversary of my family's arrival      in the United States, I was the third generation in my family      to graduate from high school and enroll in college. . . . I      tell you this because this moves me every day when I go to      work. How amazing it is that my family has gone from being      persecuted for their religion to being able to hold jobs      protected by the First Amendment? Surely, this is something      my great-grandparents never could've dreamed of when they      came here, and I embrace my career with the intention to      honor their sacrifices. . . . Recently, my heart broke at the      executive order to suspend the entry of refugees,      specifically from I have looked into this extensively      and recently worked on a story about the vetting process. . .      . Trump's order is nothing but xenophobic and racist. I was      preparing to report on a family that was supposed to be      coming to a community near me, but it seems that family won't      be coming now. How truly American it would've been for the      descendant of Syrian immigrants to welcome a new generation      of Syrians into this country.  This is for many cataclysmic because everything they thought about this country seems to be disappearing in front of us. I understand that President Trump tries to sell this as something less than it is; that it isn't a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, it is just a ban on Muslims from a select set of countries. But these are countries that encapsulate over 230 million That is almost two-thirds of the population of the United States of America, including some of the most populous Muslim nations in the world, and it is directly targeted at people of Muslim faith.  It is simply not credible to say that this isn't a ban on members of one religion from entering the United States because it selects countries that are majority Muslim and then includes a caveat that if you are not of the majority religion, if you are of any religion that is not the majority religion, you can get around the ban and will be given priority to come to the United  This is a Muslim ban--a Muslim ban that applies to over 200 million Muslims around the world. It makes us smaller and weaker and less great as a nation. It also makes us weaker from a national security standpoint as well.  Let's step back for a second and understand the context here. This country does face a threat, a serious threat. There are religious extremists around the world who have perverted the religion of Islam and tried to turn it into[[Page S484]]a doctrine of violence. They are attempting today to do great violence in the Middle East and in other parts of the world, and they are trying to recruit attackers here on U.soil. But you are not likely to be killed in an act of terrorism in this country. In fact, on average, there have been about three Americans killed every year by terrorism.  I am not trying to underplay the threat. People feel fearful. As a body, we need to respond to that fear. They see these awful things happening on TV, and they want us to make sure it will not happen to them. You are more likely to be killed in this country by lightning or by an elevator malfunction than you are by terrorism.  If you really want to talk about securing this Nation, about protecting Americans, then the conversation has to be bigger than just banning individuals from one country but recognizing the real threats that are posed.  Let me guarantee you this: If this ban goes into effect, if President Trump is successful, with the support from the Republican Congress, in sending a message to the world that America is at war with Islam, then that number of three Americans killed by terrorism every year will jump, it will skyrocket. More Americans will be killed by terrorism. Why? Because today ISIS is on its heels. It is in retreat. It has substantially less territory than it ever has before, and that has robbed from it one of its primary rationales for existence, one of its primary arguments to those it is trying to recruit into its fold--the idea that ISIS is forming a caliphate, an area of geographic control in the Middle  That argument doesn't work any longer because the supposed caliphate is shrinking. The amount of territory they control is getting smaller and smaller. Most folks can see the writing on the wall, that it is just a matter of time before the Islamic State as a state is gone. But they have this second rationale for existence, this second argument that they proffer to would-be recruits, and that is that there is a war between East and West, that this is really about a long-term struggle between Islam and You need to sign up with us because they--the West, America, the Christian world--are coming for us.  We know that is not true, and we have watched Presidents of both parties make it very clear to the world that this is not the fight that we seek to engage in. Famously, immediately following the 9/11 attacks, President Bush said:       The face of terror is not the true faith of  He said:       That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace.  Yet the message that is being sent with this ban on Muslims from these seven countries entering the United States is clear. The message is that the United States is at war with this religion, that we are at war with people of the Muslim faith.  As we speak, these recruitment bulletin boards are lighting up with arguments being made as to the true nature of America's intent against the Islamic people. One posting on one of these message boards said that Trump's actions ``clearly revealed the truth and harsh reality behind the American government and their hatred toward Muslims.'' Another posting on one of these extremist Web sites hailed Trump as the ``best caller to Islam.'' Another message said that the leader of ISIS, ``Al Baghdadi[,] has the right to come out and inform Trump that banning Muslims from entering America is a blessed ban.'' That is a phrase with very meaningful connotations. To the extent that these messaging boards are calling this ban on Muslims entering from seven countries a ``blessed ban,'' it is rooted in a different phrase, something called the ``blessed invasion.''  The U.invasion of Iraq in 2003 became the starting point for the very insurgency that we are fighting today. It was that invasion that was called by Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda in Iraq, and the affiliated extremist groups that were drawn into the fight the ``blessed invasion.'' Today on extremist Web sites, the ban on Muslims entering the United States is being called the ``blessed ban.''  This order is making this country less safe hour by hour. It is giving a pathway to rebirth for the very terrorist organizations that we had made such progress in pushing back and fighting back. In Iran specifically, it will lead to this country and our allies in the Middle East losing the fight against hardliners who pose a threat to the United States, to stability in the Middle East, and to our sacred ally of In Iran, there is a contest between moderates--and that is a relative term within the Iranian political space--and hardliners who chant ``Death to Israel'' who don't fear a world war or a conflict with the United  With the signing of the Iran nuclear agreement and the lifting of a handful of sanctions on Iran, the moderates won a victory. The population of that country--which is surprisingly pro-American and supported that nuclear agreement--was ascended, potentially foreshadowing a day in which that country would no longer be a provocateur in the region and instead could join in conversations about how to bring stability to the Middle Now the hardliners have been handed a gift, a gift which proves that America is an enemy, not just of the Iranian state but of the Iranian people.  Remember, when we think of actions that we take against governments that we don't like, we first try to start with actions that specifically identify individuals in the government, so that we make it clear that it is not about the people of that country but about their leaders. If that isn't strong enough, then we go to sanctions against commercial interests, against the economy writ large. Yes, those sanctions do filter down and hurt real people, but the sanctions are levied at the economy or against commercial actors.  When you enact a specific ban on the people of a country being able to travel to the United States, you are levying that punishment directly on those individuals, who, by and large, bear no ill will toward the United You are telling them that it is their fault, and the Iranian people will turn against the United States, will turn toward the hardliners based upon this action.  This ban makes us less safe. It will allow for terrorist groups to rebound. That is not just me saying it. Senators McCain and Graham have said the same thing. National security experts of both stripes have testified as such. Tonight I think back to the moment in which I first heard that Candidate Donald Trump was proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the United I remember the universal bipartisan derision that met that announcement. It was almost laughable at that point in time during the campaign. If you remember, Candidate Trump was flailing. He was weak. He needed to reassert himself. He needed to make news, and so he grabbed for the most controversial, most outlandish proposal he could make. Republicans and Democrats here in Congress condemned it.  Speaker Ryan tweeted this:       A religious test for entering our country is not reflective      of America's fundamental values. I reject it.  Governor Mike Pence said:       Calls to ban Muslims from entering the United States are      offensive and unconstitutional.       A religious test for entering this country is not      reflective of America's fundamental values. I reject it.       Calls to ban Muslims from entering the United States are      offensive and unconstitutional.  I give credit to a small handful of Republicans here in the Senate and a small handful of Republicans in the House who have raised serious concerns about this ban with respect to what it says about American values or what it says about American national security. But there is utter silence from Republican leadership. Republican leadership--who only months ago claimed that if there were a religious test for entering our country, they would reject it--today are quiet. The idea that individuals could come to this country without regard to their religion or their national origin or their set of beliefs has never been a partisan issue. Of all the things that divide us, that idea has been one that unifies us.  My hope is that there is still a chance that both parties can come together and recapture the essence of American originalism, can put this country on firmer national security footing, and can continue the relentless drive against extremist groups like ISIS that now find themselves at a point of potential rebirth.[[Page S485]]  You have heard a lot of stories on the floor of the Senate today. It is interesting. We have these incredibly compelling stories from real people who are caught today in the middle of this reckless ill-thought-out ban. There are 67,000 refugees who are currently in the pipeline to come to this country right now. This isn't about 100, 200, 300, or 400. This is about tens of thousands of refugees who are fleeing persecution, terror, and torture. This is about the 230 million Muslims who live in those seven countries, who have been told that they are lesser. Frankly, every other Muslim in the world believes the message is being sent to them as well.  These stories that we tell you are--the tip of the iceberg isn't even accurate. This is a pinprick. Fadi Kassar and his family--here are his two girls. They left Syria in 2011 due to the epic levels of violence that Fadi was sure would kill his two little girls if he didn't leave. His family went to the UAE, or the United Arab But the way in which the UAE works is that if you have a job, you can stay, but if you don't have a job, you leave. When he lost his job, they were kicked out and that began an epic journey for Fadi and his family.  These girls actually were born in the UAE, as I understand. He was fleeing Syria to protect his family and his future children, yet they were kicked out of the country they went to. Fadi then began a journey to try to find a home for him and his family. He tried to get to Europe via Tunisia, but he was detained and sent back to He eventually flew to He made his way to the United States by crossing the border with Upon entry, he was detained. He was transferred to He was released and eventually found his way to He applied for asylum that was granted in December of 2015.  Fadi's relatives in Syria were tortured and had been detained by the regime. His neighborhood was dangerous and deadly. Fadi and his family were exactly the kind of people whom this country historically has been able to rescue from war-torn countries, from terror, and from torture. His family had experienced torture. His children were later returned to Syria and would face potential death.  He went through all of the processes that we asked him to go through. He didn't go into the shadows. He didn't hide. He applied for asylum status. It was granted in 2015. He filed forms that would allow for his wife and two daughters to follow. Those visas were issued last Tuesday, on January 24.  Originally, they had a flight that was scheduled to bring his wife and these two little girls to the United States today, but last week, when Fadi learned of the potential for this Executive order, he paid $1,000 to move their flight up to His two little girls and his wife got on a flight from Jordan to Kiev, Ukraine, and eventually to the United But once in Kiev, their passports and their visas were taken from them. They were sent to Their visas were rejected, and they were returned to  These two little girls are back in their old apartment, but they got rid of all their furniture. They got rid of all their clothes. Their neighbors have temporarily given them mattresses to sleep on. They don't even know where their suitcases are. Their father, who is ready to greet them at the airport here in the United States, may never see them.  They are scared to death. I have two little boys who are the exact same age. I have an 8-year-old. I have a 5-year-old. I think about what these two little girls went through, getting ready to finally go see their dad who had gone through an epic struggle to try to find someplace in this world where his two little girls could be safe. He found it. He found it in He found it in my State of  He found it, just like hundreds of thousands of other people who fled war-ravaged Europe, who fled the bombing in Vietnam, who left Albania and Kosovo to come live a better life just like they found. He was ready to go to the airport to welcome his two little girls, and they were told that they are not leaving. You are not going to see your dad. You are going to go back to Jordan and, potentially, eventually back to  Imagine what those little girls went through. Imagine millions of other little boys and girls like them who had in their mind this place called America, a place that would welcome them, who would rescue them from the disaster that had become their lives.  Imagine that dream that was literally hours away for these two little girls extinguishing, and extinguishing for millions of others like them all around this planet. It is up to us whether that light which flickered off on Friday relights. It is up to us as to whether we rekindle the American dream, that idea of America from our founding. This is not irreversible. These two little girls, you could bring them here. We could choose to bring them here. It is up to us.  There is legislation on the floor of the Senate right now as we speak that would rescind this order. It is our decision, right? There are 100 of us. There are only 435 down the hall. There are only 535 of us. It is our decision whether these two little girls come to the United States or they go back to their war-ravaged home that their father left. It is up to us. It is not up to the President of the United States alone. He does not get to make these decisions by himself.  Democracy allows for us to make a different decision. It is up to us. I believe we can do it. I believe we can bring these girls here. I believe we can undo the damage that has been done to this country's security. I believe we can get back on a path such that ISIS remains on its heels. I believe we can recapture that idea of that farmer who came to this country from a far-off land who looked in amazement at the amalgam of cultures and peoples and religions that was  I know this sounds like hyperbole. I know there are a lot of people out there who say: Wait a second. This is only temporary. It is only for a few months. It is only for a few countries. But people are listening and watching. Which direction are we heading? Do we really care about the things we have always cared about? Millions upon millions of people, all cross this country and all across this world are watching. What do we do?  Is this a partisan issue or can we commit ourselves together to stand up for those basic ideas of America's founding? There are two little girls who are watching most closely, who are watching to see if we can rise above partisanship and deliver to them the promise that has been made real for millions and millions of Americans who call this place home.

1715,topic-id,2081,"Mr.President, since assuming office on January 20, which is just 11 days ago--I don't know, it kind of feels to me like it was 11 months ago; this is going on in a horrible, nightmarish slow motion--the Trump administration has assumed responsibility for our Nation's national security. There are a lot of jobs the President has, this new administration has, but that is at the top of the list--guaranteeing this country's security and, frankly, being the guarantor of global security.  Leaving aside some of the broader systemic challenges that we face in the world, let's just look at what has happened since the inauguration.  Yesterday, Iran reportedly conducted another ballistic missile test. President Trump criticized President Obama on Iran for being too soft. Now it is his turn to get China and Russia to agree to a Security Council resolution condemning this test and taking punitive action.  On Sunday, extremist groups all around the world celebrated the Trump administration's ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. Comments that were posted to pro-Islamic State's social media accounts predicted that the Executive order would serve as a recruiting tool for One posting said that Trump's actions ``clearly revealed the truth and harsh reality behind the American government's hatred towards Muslims.'' Another posting hailed Trump as ``the best caller to Islam.'' Another one talked about the ban being a blessed ban, which is a reference to what militant leaders called the invasion of Iraq, which was hailed then as the blessed invasion, becoming the cause celebre, as the intelligence community called it, for the global jihadist movement.  Immediately following the first phone conversation between Trump and Putin, the conflict in Ukraine flared up. Likely not coincidentally, 8 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 26 were wounded just since  In the Balkans, where Russia has been just recently again steadily increasing in influence, as Europe is pulling up the doors on its new perspective members, Serbia sent a train emblazoned with the motto ``Kosovo is Serbia'' up to the border of It turned around, but as a result, troops and security forces reportedly scrambled to the border from both sides.  I am not suggesting that all of these bad things happened because Donald Trump was inaugurated. I listened to my colleagues explain all of the world's troubles for 8 years through the lens of responsibility to the Obama administration. But this is all an advertisement for a very simple idea--that this is probably the absolute worst time to have the first American President with no government experience and no diplomatic experience pick the first Secretary of State with no government experience and no diplomatic experience. This is not the moment for on-the-job learning. Yet that is what we have so far.  Granted Mr.Tillerson is not in place, but President Trump's foreign policy up to this point has been tragically amateurish. Witness the invitation for the Mexican leader to come to the White House, worked out in painstaking detail, an opportunity to show, despite the furor and rhetoric of the campaign, solidarity between the American and Mexican people, and then Donald Trump sends out a tweet daring the Mexican leader to cancel the meeting, which he promptly does, erupting threats of a trade war.[[Page S526]]  Witness Friday's Muslim ban, which now has Muslim nations all around the world rethinking their relationship with the United States, sending this dangerous message to people all around the world that you have no home in the United States if you practice one particular faith.  It begs the question as to whether Mr.Tillerson is going to be able to right this ship, having no experience working on almost every single one of these issues that confront us around the world. It is not the same thing to run a global business and run the State  Frankly, I would argue that Mr.Tillerson's experience--even if you believe he did a good job for Exxon, it doesn't advertise him as a good candidate for Secretary of In fact, we have reason to fear that Mr.Tillerson would run the State Department like he ran Exxon, where he repeatedly worked against U.national interests.  Mr.Tillerson opposed sanctions levied against Russia in the wake of their invasion of He tried to pull one over on the committee, telling the committee this ridiculous story of first not lobbying Congress on sanctions, then not knowing if Exxon was lobbying for or against sanctions. That just doesn't pass the smell test. He called the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to express his misgivings about sanctions. He personally lobbied Congress against the sanctions. His company spent millions of dollars lobbying against the sanctions.  When asked by President Obama and his administration to refrain from attending a major economic development conference hosted by Vladimir Putin in the middle of the Ukraine crisis, Tillerson thumbed his nose at He intentionally embarrassed his own country and our allies by sending his top deputy to that conference--and it gets worse--and standing next to Russian officials to announce major new contracts with Think about that. We begged Exxon to stay away from that conference. Not only did they go, but Tillerson had his 2 guy announce new contracts in the middle of the sanctions, in the middle of the worst of the crisis with It is not surprising that he was awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin 3 years ago.  Just an aside, I have listened to my colleagues castigate President Obama for being weak on Russia for years. Frankly, the only thing that has been consistent about Candidate Trump and President Trump's foreign policy has been a marshmallow-like softness on At every turn, Trump has previewed for you that he is going to be easy on Vladimir Tillerson's testimony cemented that. He was asked over and over whether he would commit to holding the line on existing sanctions, whether he would commit to imposing new sanctions based on Russian interference in the U.elections. He was asked by the Presiding Officer if he would, at the very least, commit to holding in place the sanctions on the individuals who were named as those interfering with the U.election. He wouldn't commit to any of it, and so it is hard for me to understand how all of the Republicans who have been eviscerating President Obama for 8 years for being soft on Russia are now supporting the nomination of Rex Tillerson, who has basically advertised that they are going to withdraw the line the Obama administration had taken and enter into a new relationship with Russia, in which they likely get everything they want. I hope that is not true, but we have asked over and over again for this nominee to give us some signal that they are going to at least maintain the policies we have today, and we have gotten no satisfactory answer.  Lastly, maybe most concerning about this nominee, is the potential for him to carry with him from Exxon a total lack of concern for ethics. I understand business ethics. That sounds really harsh, right? I understand there is a difference between business ethics and government ethics, and human rights is not something you are going to care about in a business to the extent that we care about it as those who run and advocate for American foreign policy. But I asked Mr.Tillerson if there was any country in the world he wasn't willing to do business with as the leader of He danced around the answer a little bit, but the simple response was no, and that is plain as day. We can look at the countries they did business with, including Syria through subsidiaries, including There was no human rights record that was bad enough for Exxon to say: Hey, no. This isn't something we want to touch.  We have been told by those who are supporting his nomination that we really shouldn't pay attention to everything he did at Exxon because he is going to be a new man when he comes to I guess you can understand that. Plenty of people take on new priorities when they come into new jobs. Plenty of people argue for something they argued against once they have a new boss, but he had a chance before the Foreign Relations Committee to tell us how serious he was about human rights. He got asked over and over again what he thought about human rights violations by some of the worst offenders around the world. His answers to those questions were, boy, they were disturbing and troubling. He wouldn't name Saudi Arabia as a human rights violator. Saudi Arabia is locking up political dissidents left and right. They don't allow women to drive. I understand they are an ally, but they are also a human rights violator. Everybody knows that. He wouldn't commit that President Duterte in the Philippines, who has been openly bragging about murdering thousands of civilians with no due process--wouldn't name him as a human rights violator, wouldn't say that what Russia has done in Aleppo is a war crime. I understand that maybe you don't know all the facts when you are just coming through the process, but you just have to pick up a newspaper to figure out what is going on in Manila or what is happening in It doesn't take a lot of research to know that Saudi Arabia is violating people's human rights. He knows that country very well.  It suggests that this lack of concern for ethics and human rights is going to carry over to the State Department, and of course he is working for a President who is never going to tell him to care about human rights. The President has openly talked about his affection for torture; how he thinks that strong leaders are the ones who kill journalists who oppose them.  So it looks as if we are seeing a preview of an abdication of America's historic role in promoting and pushing human rights around the world. We have a President who has openly mocked human rights, who has supported vicious dictators, and a Secretary of State who has made a career of doing business with some of the worst human rights violators in the world and who couldn't name human rights violators when he appeared before the committee.  Senator Markey is right. Mr.Tillerson is an accomplished businessman. He is smart. He is savvy. I don't say any of this to impugn his character. He had a job to do at Exxon, and he did it well on behalf of those shareholders. Frankly, he didn't have to take this job. He didn't have to subject himself to this spotlight, to the constant second-guessing that awaits him as the next American Secretary of So I give him credit for making this decision to step up to the plate and do this job. I think his motives are pure. I guess I can't assume anything else. I know there are people who question those motives, but I am going to assume that he is doing this because he wants to help his country, and I look forward to working with him.  He needs to be an advocate for the State He needs to be an advocate for the nonmilitary tools that have not historically been available to the We have had a ``military first'' mentality as a country. We think every problem in the world can be solved through military intervention. Even under President Obama, there was a bent toward military solutions. A Secretary of State can be the chief spokesman here for the ways in which you solve problems that don't involve attacking and invading, but I don't think somebody who has done one thing with one set of priorities and values for 40 years just suddenly does an about-face, and adopts a totally different set of priorities and values for his career's capstone job. If that were the case, he could have previewed that for us in the committee hearing. Yet[[Page S527]]over and over again, when we asked for evidence that his priorities and his values were changed, his answers didn't measure up.  As I said, in addition to those concerns, this is just not the time for a Secretary of State with no diplomatic experience whatsoever. It is not a time for our new Secretary of State to learn on the job.  I will oppose his nomination and I hope others will join me.  I yield the floor.

852,topic-id,531,"Mr.President, having said that, I am on the floor today with a number of my colleagues who will be joining me throughout the time here today in the Senate to stand up and to be a voice for women.  I was so proud to march this weekend with millions of women and men in a[[Page S411]]clear rejection of the hate and division that President Trump campaigned on and in strong support of every woman's rights.  This past weekend, we also recognized the anniversary of the historic ruling in Roe v. Wade, a decision that has empowered women and expanded economic opportunity and security for families for more than four decades.  I have heard story after story from Washington State and across the country about what Roe v. Wade means for women. It means being able to plan your family, to be able to pursue your dreams and give back to your community. But perhaps most importantly, the decision in Roe v. Wade sent a clear message that access to abortion--a woman's right to make the most personal of all decisions herself--is fundamental to her freedom and her ability to chart her own path.  Now we have already seen extreme politicians in State after State do everything they can to undermine access to abortion. But, today, the constitutionally protected rights these women have had now for 44 years are, unfortunately, more at risk than ever as a result of President Trump's extreme and deeply harmful agenda.  He has promised to pick Supreme Court nominees whose beliefs about women's reproductive rights simply could not be more backwards or damaging. Unfortunately, in what looks like a sign of things to come, the President yesterday signed an Executive order limiting access to safe abortion and other family planning services on women worldwide by reinstituting the global gag rule.  I want to be very clear. If the President continues down this path, women will be hurt. Their lives will be put at risk, and the same goes for women around the world. So I am very concerned, and I am angry.  But if Saturday's march proved anything, it proved that women and men across this country are more motivated than ever, and, frankly, so am  Now, I can understand why President Trump may not have wanted to hear from the hundreds of thousands of marchers who completely filled the National Mall on Saturday or the millions more who marched nationwide in every State--coast to coast--and on every continent. But if he didn't get the message, this is just the beginning.  The millions of women and people who care about women's rights and their access to health care are going to keep standing up, and we in the Senate are going to continue to stand with them and fight back every step of the way and do everything in our power to make sure that our country does not go backwards.

1718,topic-id,585,"Mr.President, I would like to address some of the very serious concerns posed by the nomination of Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, along with several of President Trump's Cabinet nominees. But first I do want to briefly address what unfolded this weekend at airports across the country following President Trump's appalling and un-American ban on Muslims and refugees from entering the country.  With the stroke of a pen, the Trump administration caused chaos and heartbreak for hundreds of families, many of whom are our friends, our neighbors, and our coworkers. On Saturday night, Members of this Congress, including myself, were denied answers to even the most basic questions from border enforcement officers, questions that affect the people whom we represent.  While I am glad that a Federal judge quickly issued a stay and that the Department of Homeland Security has since provided further guidance on the Executive orders, many questions remain and too many lives hang in the balance.  I am going to keep fighting as hard as I can, and I encourage everyone who is listening and watching right now to continue making their voices heard because President Trump is already governing the way he campaigned, by dividing our country and pushing extreme policies that hurt families across the country. Again, we saw this so clearly in the Executive orders he signed this past week.  But it is also something we have seen in the Cabinet nominees he has put forward since his election. As we all remember, President Trump said that he was going to drain the swamp, but he seems to think the way to do that is by filling it with even bigger swamp creatures. He said he was going to stand with the working class and fight Wall Street and Big But he nominated a Cabinet full of Wall Street bankers and billionaires and millionaires and friends and insiders and campaign contributors.  As many of my colleagues have discussed today, one clear example of President Trump's broken promise to drain the swamp is the nomination of Rex Tillerson, CEO of ExxonMobil for Secretary of This is a nominee who is not only a known friend and business partner to Russia, but someone who publicly spoke against sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine and  People in my home State of Washington have significant concerns about who he plans to work for, and so do I--concerns that Mr.Tillerson failed to adequately address in his hearing. I have said before that reports of Russia meddling in our election should disturb and outrage every American, Democrat, Republican, or Independent who believes that the integrity of our elections is fundamental to the strength of this democracy. That is why it is so critical we have a Secretary of State who will stand up to protect those values.        Nominations of Betsy DeVos, Tom Price, and Andrew Puzder  Mr.President, along with Rex Tillerson, I have serious concerns with the nominees that are going through our Senate HELP Committee, as well as the vetting process that has taken place.  My Republican colleagues rushed us into a hearing on President Trump's nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, for example. When we started the hearing, the Republican Chairman, the senior Senator from Tennessee, preemptively declared he would be limiting questions to just 5 minutes per Member, a shocking and disappointing breach of committee tradition, clearly intended to limit public scrutiny.  When the questions began, it quickly became clear why Republicans felt the need to protect her. ",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgS504.txt,1409,FISCAL YEAR 2017 ENFORCEMENT FILING,2017.0,31.0,January
657,topic-id,776,"Madam Speaker, there is obviously a difference of opinion in this country on the morality of abortion. I am appalled by the moral arrogance of the Republicans who would use political power to impose their views on the millions of women who disagree with them and want to make their own decisions.  Though the Supreme Court has determined that neither Congress nor a State may place an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy, the Hyde amendment makes abortion access virtually impossible for low-income women.  As unjust and despicable as the Hyde amendment is, this bill goes beyond it. For the first time, Republicans are attempting to restrict the right of women to use their own money to pay for abortions by denying normal tax deductions for medical expenses if those medical expenses include an abortion, by denying normal tax credits for health insurance if that insurance covers abortion, and by denying use of tax-free money from an FSA or an HSA for an abortion.  The intent of this bill is obvious: to end insurance coverage for all abortions, thereby making it nearly impossible for women to exercise their constitutional rights.  Republicans should pay heed to the millions of women who marched to protect their rights this weekend and are watching how we vote today.  Madam Speaker, there is obviously a difference of opinion in this country on the morality of abortion. I am appalled at the moral arrogance of the Republicans who would use political power to impose their views on the millions of women who disagree with them and want to make their own decisions.  If Saturday's protests are any indication, the women of America and the world are watching us. They are not going to stand silently by while Republicans in Congress and the White House take away their rights, their health care, their families, and their livelihoods. They sent this message loud and clear, but it seems my Republican colleagues have not heard it. Yesterday morning, President Trump signed an executive order reinstating the Global Gag Rule, which will deny thousands of women around the world access to reproductive health care, which will lead to a dramatic decline in maternal and infant health around the world.  Today, Republicans are bringing up a bill that will deny women the right to access comprehensive reproductive health care, a right protected by the  The right of a woman to decide whether to become pregnant, to decide to continue her pregnancy, or to make the decision to terminate her pregnancy is protected by the The Supreme Court has determined that neither Congress nor a state may place an ``undue burden'' on that right. Denial of Medicaid or other government funding that would be available for other medical procedures should be considered an ``undue burden.'' For decades, Congress has imposed the Hyde Amendment on every appropriations bill. This language disproportionately impacts poor women and women of color, effectively denying them their constitutional right to access abortion. Yet today, Republicans want to make that language permanent.  As unjust and despicable as the Hyde Amendment is, this bill goes beyond it. For the first time, Republicans are restricting the right of women to use their own money to pay for abortions. This bill will deny normal tax deductions for medical expenses if those expenses include abortion, normal tax credits for health insurance if that insurance includes abortion, and denying the ability to use tax-free money from an FSA or HSA for an abortion.  The bill does include an exception in cases of rape, incest, or the life of the mother. You may ask, how the IRS will know a woman's reason for getting an abortion. Well, under this bill, women will have to prove they are a victim of rape or incest or will have to provide detailed medical records to determine just how at risk their life was. Women will not only have to suffer the trauma of a sexual assault or the loss of a pregnancy because of life-threatening complications, they will now also have to face an IRS inquisition to get their own money back. So much for Republicans' pledge to get ``big government'' out of people's lives.  The intent of this bill is obvious: to end insurance coverage for all abortions thereby making it nearly impossible for women to exercise their constitutional rights. Republicans are clearly out of step with the millions of women who marched to protect their rights this weekend. Those women, and the millions more who stand with them, are watching and ready to fight back. I am proud to vote against this bill and to join their fight.

1669,topic-id,510,"Mr.President, I would echo what our chairman, Senator Thune, has said about Elaine She certainly has the qualifications to be our next Secretary of Clearly, she is a part of the Senate family; as the spouse of the majority leader, we know her well--and her government experience as the previous Secretary of Labor and Deputy Secretary of The Office of Government Ethics, which is the independent agency that vets the nominees, has certified that she is in compliance with all the laws and regulations governing conflicts of interest.  This Senator intends to vote for her confirmation, as I did in the committee.  Since the Senator from Arkansas, in his objection to the unanimous consent request of the Democratic leader, made note of the absence of Democratic members from the Finance Committee markup of a couple of the Cabinet nominees, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues that indeed, there was new information that came to light overnight in a publication in the Wall Street Journal of additional information about the nominee for the Department of HHS, which needs to be cleared up before the committee proceeds. So I wanted to put that on the record and make clear one of the reasons that the Finance Committee members objected to proceeding.  I think it interesting also that this Senator, as the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, had some additional questions for Secretary Chao--not questions in any kind of defensive or offensive way but additional information. Those questions were proffered Sunday night or early Monday morning. This Senator, not having heard all day from Secretary Chao, called Secretary She promptly returned the call last evening, and, lo and behold, the transition team for the Secretary of Transportation had not even given her the questions.  One of the questions that this Senator had for Secretary Chao was this: Given the chaos in the airports over the weekend, was she as Secretary of Transportation concerned about the orderly administration of those airports when such an unusual order had come down? In addition, what about the lost tickets on getting refunds for passengers and what about the changing of flight crews that might cause extra expenses? These are all items that a Secretary of Transportation would be concerned with going forward. What I found out in conversation was that the nominee to be Secretary of Transportation had not been consulted by the White House--not in advance, during, or after the implementation of those orders having to do with the entry into the United States of refugees and other immigrants.  I think we need Secretary Chao as someone who has the experience, who has common sense, and will be in a position to offer level-headed, good, experienced-based advice to the government going forward.

Our own intelligence community has told us that the Russian President personally ordered a campaign to influence the 2016 Presidential election[[Page S530]]right here in the United That campaign--a mix of covert Russian operations, cyber attacks, cyber operations, and propaganda--was only the latest in a series of efforts to undermine American leadership and democracies around the world and what is coming next for the elections in Europe in the next few months.  Russia is testing us, and I am concerned that Mr.Tillerson cannot stand up to the Russian President who, I am afraid, thinks of himself as the next Russian czar.  In Mr.Tillerson's past, as Exxon's CEO, he lobbied against sanctions on Russia for invading and seizing Crimea--the very sanctions that we and our allies have put on Russia for taking over sovereign territory of another independent country. And now it is not clear, as our Nation's top diplomat, that Mr.Tillerson would fight to keep the sanctions in place, even as President Trump is now considering lifting them, despite the clear evidence of Russia's continued aggression.  During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Tillerson refused to condemn the Russian and Syrian bombings in Aleppo as war crimes, a question that was proffered to him by the Senator, my colleague from Florida, who happens to sit in the Chair right now.  I also have serious concerns that Mr.Tillerson doesn't understand the urgent need to combat climate change. You don't have to remind us about climate change in South Florida is ground zero for climate change. Miami Beach is awash at the seasonal high tides as the water flows over the curbs and over the streets, causing Miami Beach to spend hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars to install pump stations, raise the roads, and address all kinds of flooding and saltwater intrusion. Other South Florida communities have had to move their water well locations farther west because of the intrusion of South Florida into the freshwater aquifer.  Climate change is not a problem that we are going to face some day in the future; it is a daily struggle for communities along our coasts all over The U.State Department is responsible for engaging with other countries to confront both the cause of climate change and the devastating impact of drought, sea level rise, and severe weather.  By the way, speaking of sea level rise, this Senator convened a meeting of the Senate Commerce Committee in Miami Beach a couple of years ago. We had testimony from a NASA scientist that measurements--not forecasts, not projections, but measurements--in the last 40 years of sea level rise in South Florida were 5 to 8 inches higher. That is sea level rise. That is why even the Department of Defense is concerned. Climate change has the potential to destabilize nations. How about Bangladesh? It has the potential to drastically reduce potable water supplies and result in crop loss and food shortage and to create climate refugees.  We simply cannot play fast and loose with the science that will help save our planet. The top diplomat of our country has to confront the reality of climate change today and to work on it immediately. Mr.Tillerson has not adequately laid out a plan to address that global climate crisis.  For all the reasons I have outlined, including many more, I will vote no.  I yield the floor.

1387,topic-id,931,"Mr.Speaker, on Monday, just yesterday, the House Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 70, providing for the consideration of H.38, legislation utilizing the Congressional Review Act to overturn the final stream protection rule promulgated by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, or the OSMRE, which is at the Department of the The rule provides for consideration of the joint resolution under a closed rule, as is customary with these CRA measures.  Mr.Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of a critical measure that will help protect American businesses and families from the Obama administration's rampant regulatory overreach. H.38 disapproves of the final stream protection rule which was released by the Department of the Interior on December 19, 2016, representing yet another last-minute, midnight regulation from the previous administration.  This burdensome rule seeks to govern the interaction between surface mining operations and streams by establishing a buffer-zone rule that blocks mining within 100 feet of those streams. This was done, despite the Department of the Interior's own reports, which shows that virtually all coal mines in this country have no offsite impacts, they are being operated safely, and that lands are being restored successfully under existing Federal and State regulation.  During the rulemaking process, OSMRE and the Department of the Interior ignored existing regulatory success at the Federal and the State level and shut out the cooperating agencies, the States who are responsible for enforcing Federal mining regulations.  In 2015, 9 of the 10 cooperating States withdrew as cooperating agencies in the rulemaking and development process, due to OSMRE's exclusionary tactics, failure to provide for meaningful participation, and continual limiting of the States' involvement over the past several years.  The National Environmental Policy Act or, as we know it as, NEPA, requires OSMRE, as the lead rulemaking agency, to involve States in the drafting of the regulation and requires them to involve These failures, and the restrictive tactics that were employed by OSMRE, led the House Natural Resources Committee chairman, Mr.Rob Bishop of Utah, to send a letter in 2015 to the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, requesting a review of OSMRE's compliance with NEPA in the agencies' development and drafting of the proposed stream protection rule. Ample evidence exists that OSMRE excluded these States from the NEPA process, in contradiction of both NEPA regulations and the memoranda of understanding between OSMRE and the  Mr.Speaker, the stream protection rule unilaterally rewrites over 400 existing rules and regulations. It threatens over one-third of the Nation's coal mining workforce and will send repercussions throughout the broader U.economy. The final rule is the definition of a one-size-fits-all solution due to OSMRE's failure to conduct the 7-year rewrite in a transparent process consistent with their statutory requirements to engage State and local stakeholders.  An economic analysis conducted by the National Mining Association found that the total number of jobs at risk of loss is somewhere between 112,000 and 280,000 people, approximately 30 to 75 percent of the current industry employment levels.  Further, the misguided regulation would jeopardize 40,000 to 77,000 jobs in both surface and underground mining operations, industries that are still reeling from 8 years of overregulation from the previous administration.  And while the Obama administration never seemed to mind the consequences of its actions on hardworking Americans, I can assure you that the new, unified Republican government is opposed to ineffective regulations like this one which unnecessarily put people out of work, raise energy costs on consumers, and do nothing to improve the environment.  By passing this rule, we have the opportunity to consider a resolution that will prevent this regulation from removing over one-half of the total U.coal reserves available for extraction, while also reducing oppressive barriers to responsible coal production.  The Congressional Review Act of 1996 was enacted to be a powerful tool to[[Page H762]]allow Congress to overturn last-minute regulations from the previous administration, under an expedited legislative process. If Congress passes a joint resolution disapproving the rule, and the resolution becomes a law, the rule cannot take effect or continue. CRAs are designed to address and invalidate problematic rules from the previous administration, and the stream protection rule clearly fits the bill.  Furthermore, this CRA provides certainty to State regulatory bodies tasked with regulating 97 percent of the coal mines in the United States and enforcing Federal mining regulations by strengthening the State primacy framework provided in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation  Blocking the final stream protection rule will restore an important stream of State and Federal tax revenue associated with coal extraction across the country that is benefiting hardworking American taxpayers.  Mr.Speaker, every Member of this body wants to protect the environment, ensure clean water and clean air for our citizens, and encourage innovative and responsible ways to produce energy. However, these goals are not mutually exclusive, as some opponents of this legislation will argue.  It is past time that we embrace commonsense, practical Federal rules and regulations that protect the environment and the countless Americans working in the industries that support our economy and provide for greater domestic energy independence.  The rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of a bill that is critically important to the future economic growth and job growth of our country. By passing this CRA, we can take a badly needed step toward protecting American families and businesses from the rampant executive overreach that will be the defining achievement of the past administration.  I urge my colleagues to support this rule, as well as the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1245  ",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH761-2.txt,2275,1415,2017.0,31.0,January
1389,topic-id,263,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, getting back to the issue at hand and the stream protection rule, there are many points that my friend from Florida brought up. One occurred to me as well: Is this really a midnight rule; or could something that was started in 2008 really be considered as something that was shoved through at the last minute?  I did ask that question, and the answer is a resounding ``yes.''  During the process in 2011, some of the reports came out that were leaked that the Department did not see as favorable as it related to jobs and the economy and the negative impact that it would have on that, so they stopped the process, shutting out the States violating the memorandum of understanding that they are required to work with the States on the rulemaking process leaving those States with no recourse but to withdraw from the process.  In 2015, this Congress told them to reengage with the States, which they did to some degree, making it necessary for States to actually pay for the scientific evidence that was necessary for them to be engaged. So there are several problems that cause this to be an issue that we need to address today, and certainly making it a midnight rule, the last thing done as the administration walks out the door, qualifies this as something that we should be considering for many reasons and on many levels.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in favor of the rule and the underlying legislation.  Since the beginning of this Congress, we have devoted ourselves most prominently to a single goal: making Washington work for the people again.  There is one thing here in Washington that consistently stands against our people, our economy, and our Constitution: the Federal bureaucracy.  These agencies, bureaus, and departments--so numerous that nobody even knows how many there are--spend their lives thinking up new rules, and the rules they produce weigh down businesses, destroy jobs, and limit Americans' rights. Career bureaucrats who can't be voted out of office wield punishing authority with little to no accountability. They are agents of the status quo, and the revolving door of Federal employees moving to lobbying arms and consulting firms breed thousands of regulations that enrich the connected and powerful, sometimes at the great expense of the average This is the swamp. This is what opposes the people, and we are draining it.  In recent weeks, this House has already started its two-part plan to strip the bureaucracy of its power. We started to change the structure in Washington by passing the REINS Act and the Regulatory Accountability This week, we begin part two: targeting specific rules and stripping them from the books.  There has been no industry in America that has been more regulated than energy. We are going to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal the stream protection rule that could destroy tens of thousands of mining jobs and put up to 64 percent of our country's coal reserves off limits.  Then we will take on President Obama's 11th hour BLM methane emissions requirement. The oil and gas industry in America has already drastically reduced methane emissions even while increasing output, and the EPA already has the authority to regulate air emissions. Instead of helping the environment, this rule could cost America's energy industry up to $1 billion by 2025 and force smaller operations, especially out West, to shut down and lay off employees. So, this Friday, the House will get rid of it.  We will also take the ax to the SEC disclosure rule, which--now, if you can believe it--targets publicly traded American energy companies with even more regulatory compliance while it lets foreign companies off the hook. Washington should put American companies first, not put them at a disadvantage to their foreign competitors.  Mr.Speaker, it is not just energy, which would be bad enough; but under President Obama, the bureaucracy has even threatened our basic constitutional rights. A new rule from the Social Security Administration would increase scrutiny on up to 4.2 million disabled Americans if they attempt to purchase firearms. For the completely unrelated circumstance of having someone help manage your finances, Social Security recipients could be kept from exercising their Second Amendment rights. In an affront to due process, the bureaucracy has even attempted to blacklist from Federal contracts any business that is accused of violating labor laws, and that could be before the company has a chance to defend itself in court.  Every single one of these will be gone. With a vote in the House, a vote in the Senate, and President Trump's signature, we will get rid of every one of these job-killing and destructive regulations. The House is always at the service of the people. Now we are making the bureaucracy serve the people, too.

1491,topic-id,567,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I would just like to take a minute to remind the American people and my friends across the aisle that we are here today, as the minority leader said, to begin the process of unwinding the burdensome regulations that are truly stifling job creation and hurting our friends and our families in each and every one of our neighborhoods across the country.  Many from the other side have tried to distract with unrelated issues. I just want to be clear that the rule today does not address immigration in any way and that none of their requests went through the regular and bipartisan process to clear such requests.  So let's focus on why we are here. We are here because we must take a firm stand against the overly burdensome and restrictive regulations that have been issued in the waning days of the previous administration. By passing this CRA, we can rescind the final stream protection rule, which the OSM produced without input from the States--responsible for enforcing mining regulations--and which disregards[[Page H770]]existing regulations on both the State and the Federal levels that have proven to be effective.  This regulation will have devastating effects on mining communities across the country and will lead to significant job losses and higher electricity costs--all while weakening U.energy security for decades. The stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access to coal and our ability to develop new clean coal technologies, which will result in reduced domestic energy protection and in tens of thousands of lost jobs in coal-producing States as well as in industries across the country that are reliant on this energy. If we fail to pass the underlying bill, the rule's devastating impacts will be felt far and wide in our great land as approximately 78,000 mining jobs will be lost, which is in addition to the tens of thousands of mining jobs that have already been lost in the last 8 years.  Mr.Speaker, coal is essential to the U.economy. It provides affordable energy that accounts for almost 40 percent of the Nation's electricity supply--almost 20 percent in the gentleman's home State of Because of its abundance, reliability, and affordability, electricity generated from coal is generally 30 percent cheaper than other alternative energy sources. Additionally, at current consumption rates, our country has more than 250 years of remaining coal reserves, ensuring that we will have energy security here at home for generations to come.  Passing H.38 will protect American jobs and families from yet another burdensome regulation that has failed to follow the basic tenets of transparency, inclusivity, and cooperation with stakeholders, cooperating States, and, most importantly, the American people.  Now is the time for Congress to overturn this unparalleled executive overreach and implement policies that protect communities that have been long forgotten by the former administration. The CRA was designed for this exact purpose, and we now have a unique opportunity to pass this legislation through both Chambers and see it signed into law.  Mr.Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the consideration of an important resolution that will ensure that mining communities and hardworking families are not pressed by another crippling Federal regulation. I believe this rule and the underlying legislation are strong measures that are important to our country's future.

661,topic-id,383,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.7--another radical attempt by House Republicans to attack women's health and limit women's access to comprehensive care.  The real purpose of this bill is to effectively eliminate insurance coverage for abortion services, not only for federally funded coverage, but also for private health insurance by raising taxes on women, their families, and small businesses.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this bill just codifies the Hyde Amendment, which already prohibits federal funding for abortion except in limited cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, and it is already enacted each year in appropriations.  But in reality, this bill goes much further than that. Instead of just limiting the Hyde Amendment's reach to federal funds, this bill would place sweeping restrictions on how women with private insurance can spend their own private dollars when obtaining insurance coverage.  Women and their families who have insurance through the health insurance marketplaces would no longer be entitled to premium tax credits if the plan in which they are enrolled includes abortion coverage. Small business employers would be prohibited from receiving small business tax credits if the insurance provided to employees includes abortion services.  This would mean that women would likely forgo comprehensive coverage in order to retain the premium tax credits they need, and small businesses may limit coverage to ensure they receive small business tax credits. But this is the true goal for proponents of this bill: to effectively eliminate insurance coverage for abortion.  As we speak, Republicans are actively working to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, to restrict access to contraception, and to defund the life-saving health care services provided by Planned It seems that this bill is another page in their playbook to attack women's health. Let me be clear: this bill isn't about ensuring federal finds are not used for abortion--this bill is about denying women access to coverage Republicans disagree with.  Bringing this bill to the floor only days after millions of women throughout the country marched on behalf of issues like reproductive rights just shows how tone-deaf House Republicans continue to be.

1391,topic-id,396,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose H.38, which would disapprove the Department of the Interior's stream protection rule.  When the Obama administration announced the final stream protection rule, it was a victory for those who live in coal country. The rule prioritizes the health of our fellow Americans by establishing clear requirements for responsible surface coal mining, especially dangerous mountaintop removal mining.  If this Obama rule were fully enforced, it would protect or restore 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests over the next two decades. At the time the rule was finalized, I called for stronger stream buffer zone protections, but the announced regulation was undoubtedly a win for human health, clean water, and our environment.  I want to be very clear about what the stream protection rule does. This rule requires that mining companies avoid practices that permanently pollute streams and sources of drinking water, damage forests, and increase flood risks. The rule requires, for the first time, that streams around mining sites be monitored and tested for the presence of toxic chemicals, like lead and arsenic. This rule also requires mining companies to restore polluted streams and replant mined areas with native trees and vegetation.[[Page H764]]  These provisions ensure that mining companies take responsibility for their actions and act to ensure that coal country communities do not suffer because of destructive mining practices. Now we are debating an ill-conceived resolution which would negate these important advances.  If this rule were to be overturned, American families living near impacted streams and rivers will not be protected from toxic chemicals getting into their water. What is even more appalling is that, because the Congressional Review Act prevents substantially similar regulations from being developed in the future, this joint resolution means that these affected communities might never be protected from the impacts of mining waste in their water.  Protecting our rivers and streams from the damaging impacts of mountaintop removal has been a priority for me, and it is why in past Congresses I have introduced the Clean Water Protection Act, which would end the dumping of mining waste into our country's rivers and streams. I will be reintroducing that legislation this session.  It is unfathomable that congressional Republicans would pass this joint resolution and doom generations of children and families to irreparable harm.

1151,topic-id,381,"Mr.Speaker, first let me thank the gentleman from Fort Worth and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for heading these Special Order hours. It is an honor that I had prior to them, and I am sure that they see the importance of being able to spearhead topics that are important for today.  Mr.Speaker, President Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud are unsubstantiated. Officials in both parties have said that there is no evidence of large-scale voter fraud. A comprehensive investigation found only 31 possible cases of impersonation fraud out of 1 billion votes cast in all elections between 2000 and 2014. President Trump lost the popular vote by 2.8 million, and it looks like he is looking for an excuse.  What is worse is that President Trump's unfounded claims will encourage Republicans to double down on their assault on voting rights. There is no significant evidence of fraud, but President Trump's claims will be used as cover to suppress the vote. He is already talking about launching a major investigation into nonexistent voter fraud. The only thing that would come from such an investigation would be further restrictions on voting rights.  If President Trump wants to investigate anything, he should investigate the real voter fraud talking place--the Republican-led attempts to suppress minority votes.  The strategy of Republican legislatures in some States has been to suppress votes by instituting voter ID laws, reducing hours for early voting, and closing polling places. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, in 2016, 14 States had new voting restrictions in place for the first time in a Presidential election. This Presidential election was the first in 50 years without the full protections of the Voting Rights  As a country, we should make it as easy as possible for people to exercise the right to vote. Election officials should not erode our democratic principles. They should make sure that every American citizen has an equal voice in the democratic process.  Protecting every person's right to vote is essential to a fully functioning democracy. The countless men and women who have risked their lives to defend that right knew our system of government only works when it is inclusive and fair, when it enables all voices to have a say in the future of our country.

1543,topic-id,271,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.549, the Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility  As the threats to our homeland continue to evolve, transit systems, domestically and abroad, have become a leading target for terrorists. Last year, the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee for Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held field hearings in New Jersey to assess how transit owners and operators and local first responders were coordinating efforts to secure domestic mass transit and to determine what the Federal Government could do to assist those efforts.  At the hearing, transit operators repeatedly praised the transit security grant program, although they raised serious concerns about funding, which has decreased dramatically since its peak in 2009. Witnesses also testified that the period of the performance for the transit safety grant program was too short to support infrastructure-hardening projects.  Under H.549, the period of performance for security-hardening projects would be extended from 36 months to 55[[Page H792]]months in order to make it possible for transit agencies to complete projects that may take longer than the time period allowed under current law.  This bipartisan bill was passed in the House last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to again support this measure.  It is very important that we give transit professionals the flexibility that they need to keep our transit systems safe and secure. H.549 will allow transit security grant program grantees to use the funds designated for security-hardening projects more efficiently and within a more reasonable timeframe.

1549,topic-id,518,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.687, the First Responder Access to Innovative Technologies  Mr.Speaker, in my time serving as ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I have come to learn a great deal about the very important, very challenging job of first responders. These brave men and women run toward danger with our safety as their number one priority.  Since the September 11 attacks, the private sector has redoubled its efforts to develop innovative technologies for first responders to use and to carry out their vital missions.  Yet, through our subcommittee's oversight, we have seen where, in some instances, industry standards have[[Page H793]]failed to keep the pace with breakthroughs in technology. As a result, we have found that first responders cannot always access the most up-to-date equipment because they cannot use Homeland Security grant funds to purchase equipment and technology that does not meet or exceed voluntary industry standards.  H.687 would require FEMA to develop a transparent process for reviewing requests to use grant funds to purchase technologies that do not meet or exceed voluntary industry standards and/or that are not on the authorized equipment list.  The bill has the support of the Security Industry Association and unanimously passed the House last Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Security Industry                                Security Industry Association,                              Silver Spring, MD, January 27, 2017.

SIA is a      non-profit international trade association representing      nearly 700 global security and life safety solutions      providers, and our members develop, manufacture and integrate      equipment that is vital to carrying out a variety of homeland      security missions.       Under current law, equipment purchased with homeland      security grants must meet or exceed ``national voluntary      consensus standards,'' unless an explanation as to why an      exception is necessary is provided to, reviewed and approved      by the For some products, including first      responder equipment, technology innovations have outpaced the      process of developing voluntary consensus standards, and no      such standards may yet exist. Among other provisions, H.     687 directs FEMA to develop a more consistent and transparent      process for reviewing these requests, which would expedite      consideration and provide more certainty to stakeholders.       Like you, we believe that first responders must be able to      choose the most appropriate and advanced equipment to meet      urgent and changing needs as they work to protect the public.

1556,topic-id,393,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.584, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, since I became ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications 4 years ago, States have repeatedly expressed concern about the ability to confront the cyber threat and have rated cybersecurity among the core capabilities in which they had the least confidence.  Last Congress, the subcommittee held a hearing on State and local efforts to counter the cyber threat where State emergency managers and chief information officers testified about activities they were undertaking to secure their networks and infrastructure.  For example, my home State of New Jersey has begun developing its own cyber information-sharing capability, similar to DHS' National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration  Since the subcommittee held its hearing last year, the Federal Government has made significant progress in providing cybersecurity guidance to Federal, State, and local stakeholders.  In December of 2016, the Department of Homeland Security issued its national Cyber Incident Response Plan, which describes roles and responsibilities among stakeholders with respect to preventing, disrupting, and responding to a cyber event.  Additionally, the plan also provides guidance on information sharing related to cyber threats.  H.584 would help facilitate implementation of the National Cyber Incident Response Plan by promoting the sharing of cyber threat indicators and information, as well as cybersecurity's best practices, with State and major urban area fusion centers.  The bill also designates ``cybersecurity'' as an allowable use of State Homeland Security grants and Urban Area Security Initiative funds, which would help other States replicate the cyber threat information-sharing capabilities developed in New  This is commonsense legislation, passed by the House last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure once again.  Mr.Speaker, last fall, the range of cyber threats we faced came into focus when a foreign government attempted to interfere and undermine the integrity of our Presidential election by hacking into the campaign and political party databases.  H.584 includes language to address this threat by directing DHS to share cyber threat information regarding election equipment and technology with fusion centers.  H.584 seems to secure our critical cyber networks by improving cyber information sharing with fusion centers on the full spectrum of cyber threats.

It has been a long time in coming.  I rise in support of H.589, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation This bill would authorize important research and development at the Department of Energy to push the frontiers of science and find new ways to innovate and power our economy.[[Page H655]]  This bill would authorize comprehensive policy guidance for the DOE's Office of Science for the first time in its history. The Office of Science manages a portfolio, including research in supercomputing, materials science, nuclear physics, advanced biofuels, fusion energy, climate modeling, high energy physics, and a number of other areas across the spectrum of fundamental and applied research.  Additionally, the Office of Science is home to world-class user facilities used by private industry to collaborate with our national laboratories and provide our scientists with access to tools and resources to test the most pressing research questions in a variety of fields. The neutron sources, particle accelerators, and light sources, among many other Office of Science user facilities, are home to some of the most important scientific work conducted in America and represent some of the best partnerships our labs have with private industry. These activities and capabilities have never been given the proper statutory authority by this Congress, so this bill represents a landmark bipartisan effort.  H.589 also includes the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which I cosponsored again this year. By providing the tools and resources to nuclear scientists and engineers, this bill lays the groundwork for a future where reliable, clean nuclear energy is a major source of our electricity generation. This research could lead to advanced and safer nuclear reactors with the potential to use less nuclear fuel and produce far less waste.  H.589 is not only bipartisan, but, as the chairman said, it represents a bicameral agreement that was reached last year during conference negotiations with the Senate on the comprehensive energy package. Given the urgent challenge of climate change and the growing competition around the world in many of these key research areas, we must keep working together with the Senate to get this bill signed into law this year.

74,topic-id,874,"Mr.President, today I rise to talk about a critically important position in the Trump administration Cabinet: The Administrator of the Environmental Protection The EPA is charged with making sure that all Americans are safeguarded from major environmental threats to human health, where they live, where they learn, and where they work.  Originally proposed by a Republican administration, the EPA's mission has been supported by Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike. Clean air to breathe and clean water to drink are basic human needs that we all must work to protect. Disagreements involving the EPA usually stem from how to best preserve our vital resources, and we certainly welcome those debates in the  Oftentimes, the role of the Environmental Protection Agency is to provide a check and balance to activities that pollute our air, dirty our waterways, and contaminate our land. This is why I am so troubled by the nomination of Scott Pruitt as EPA Mr.Pruitt's track record on environmental issues as Oklahoma's attorney general is, in a word, dismal.  I am particularly concerned about the influence of the fossil fuel industry over Mr.Pruitt's decisions and actions. As Oklahoma's attorney general, he filed 148 lawsuits against the EPA to undermine their efforts. In 13 of those cases, companies that gave political donations to Mr.Pruitt also joined in that suit. As ranking member of the Science Subcommittee, I am worried that scientific data of the Environmental Protection Agency will be minimized, suppressed, or politicalized. Mr.Pruitt has tried to instill doubt in the strong consensus of global climate change scientists, claiming that the debate on fundamental scientific principles is far from settled.  If his confirmation goes through, I am concerned that the work of EPA scientists may be edited, twisted, or buried to protect special interests and prevent necessary action. Many Michiganders are rightfully afraid that Mr.Pruitt will not enforce our bedrock environmental laws like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air We have seen him fight against these very laws from his current position.  All across the Nation, communities are dealing with contamination and environmental catastrophes. Rural and urban communities alike depend on the strength of these laws as well as EPA's resources and their expertise. For example, the people of Flint, MI, are still suffering through devastating effects of a catastrophic drinking water crisis. The Environmental Protection Agency is heavily involved to make sure the drinking water in Flint will be safe and the National Safe Drinking Water Act rules will be updated. I am very concerned that the EPA will ignore the lessons learned after the Flint water crisis under Administrator Pruitt, and Flint is not the only community facing a water quality crisis. For example, Monroe County--which gets its water from Lake Erie--has seen its drinking water affected because of toxins in western Lake  Algae blooms--a result of runoff pollution--have made their way into drinking water intakes. Harmful algal blooms are a problem that scientists say will only get worse as we see higher temperatures and more precipitation in the future.  In addition to providing safe drinking water, I am concerned that enforcement of clean air policies would be weakened. Keeping our air clean isn't just about climate change. It is about keeping pollutants out of the lungs of our children. People in places like Southwest Detroit and Clair County all too often suffer the harmful impacts from poor air quality. Detroit has some of the highest child asthma rates in the entire country. Children can't learn if they are too sick to be in school.[[Page S337]]  Mr.Pruitt has a record we can look at, and it is very extreme. He has attacked measures that reduced interstate smog pollution, including protections against arson and mercury. If Mr.Pruitt has sought to weaken these protections around the country that protect us from poisons like arsenic and mercury, I think we have to ask the question, If he is confirmed, will he be protecting American families or will he be protecting the bottom line of multinational corporations?  To those who welcome Mr.Pruitt's approach of attacking the EPA, I would say strengthening our economy and our environment are not mutually exclusive. In fact, each effort depends on the success of the other. We must protect our natural resources so future generations will be able to sustainably use them.  Businesses can only attract top talent and jobs to the United States if we have clean places to live and to work and if we have a healthy workforce. Sick days brought on by environmental toxins hurt small businesses, and environmental catastrophes can decimate a lifetime's worth of equity built up by homeowners.  Smart, effective protections can be good, not just for our physical health but for our economic health as well. Previous EPA nominees from both parties have understood these basic principles. What separates Mr.Pruitt from past EPA nominees is his contempt for the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency and his disregard for the science that provides the very foundation for the Agency's actions.  Just as I would not vote to confirm a fox to guard a henhouse, I will not vote to confirm Mr.Pruitt to safeguard our Nation's environment.  I urge my colleagues to join me to oppose Mr.Pruitt's nomination.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS335-2.txt,2113,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

The chamber was founded in 1906 by a group of businessowners and entrepreneurs in Port Huron who volunteered their time and financial resources to the growth of the greater Port Huron-Marysville community.  Within its first year, the chamber had accomplished its goal of encouraging economic growth with the addition of new factories and the establishment of an industrial enterprise fund. Its work attracted new business from around Michigan, Illinois, and By the time the chamber was officially incorporated in 1917, it had grown to 905 members. This expansion allowed the chamber to begin to improve the well-being of the Port Huron community, a tradition that continues to this day.  Throughout its history, the Blue Water Area Chamber of Commerce has been more than just a way to connect businesses in the Port Huron area. It continually advocates for the community. Over the past few years, the chamber has led initiatives that have addressed housing shortages, advocated for improved conditions in our schools through finance reform and millage campaigns, and supported campaigns to improve our regional infrastructure. It has fought, time and time again, not just for better business, but for the prosperity of the entire Blue Water region.  Today the Blue Water Area Chamber of Commerce continues its great tradition of fostering economic prosperity and community improvement. The guiding force throughout the last century has been the chamber's five core values: integrity, relationships, freedom, excellence, and happiness. By adhering to these values, they have grown and continued to succeed. In 2007, the Blue Water Area Chamber of Commerce was awarded the Chamber of the Year Award from the Michigan Association of Chamber It received this great honor again in 2010, for its continued and outstanding work in advocacy, education, and assistance programs to its community, a true testament to the membership and leadership.

Since 2000, at least 34 journalists have been murdered in Russia, many by government or military officials.

Russia has conducted a cyber attack against Estonia, seized territory in Georgia, kidnapped an Estonian border guard, and illegally annexed Russian military patrols have approached NATO member territory and have come recklessly close to U.military vessels.

What should be most disturbing to any American is that last year Russia interfered with our election to undermine public faith in our democratic process. The intelligence community reported that Vladimir Putin himself ordered the interference--a significant escalation of Russian attempts to sow chaos in the  I recognize the President's right to choose his appointments to the Cabinet, but, as the Senate provides its advice and consent, there are still too many unanswered questions for me to support this nomination. We still have not seen President Trump's tax returns, breaking a 40-year tradition adhered to by nominees of both parties. This lack of transparency means that we don't know about the Trump family's possible past and current business ties to What message do we send to our allies if the Secretary of State and potentially even the President have a history of significant business dealings with a corrupt regime? How will this impact our moral authority as a country to take action against corruption worldwide?  The Secretary of State is the U.Ambassador to the world. It is essential that the Secretary is someone who can provide unquestioned leadership and represent American values. There must be no question that the Secretary of State is acting in the best interest of the United States and is willing to take strong action to advance our interests. He must put the American people first and not his former shareholders and friends in the Exxon boardroom.  I am concerned that Mr.Tillerson will prematurely lift the sanctions that have been put in place against Sanctions are not meant to be permanent, but they should never be removed until they have achieved their purpose.  When our Secretary of State looks at a map of the Baltic region, we need a statesman who sees allies that contribute to NATO, not a new opportunity for offshore drilling.  The Senate must ensure that we are a moderating voice and are approving moderating voices in the Trump administration.  I supported the nominations of Secretary Mattis to lead the Department of Defense, Secretary Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security, and Ambassador Haley to serve as U.Ambassador to the United Nations, and I supported these individuals because I believe they will serve as a positive influence against the worst instincts and erratic tendencies of President Trump and his political advisers.  America must stand by its allies and serve as a shining example of democracy. I cannot support a Secretary of State nominee if there is any doubt as to whether they will be a strong, independent voice within the Trump administration. The events of the past week have made the need for such leadership abundantly clear. That is why I will vote against the nomination of Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr.Speaker, we are here tonight as Representatives of America's minority communities to respond directly to President Trump's inaugural address, and specifically to his new deal for African  During President Trump's campaign, he promised to address issues confronting African Americans, and he gave a 10-point plan outlining that. We have studiously reviewed the issues outlined in the plan and have concrete suggestions for him in accomplishing those goals.  While I acknowledge President Trump's willingness to confront these issues, I find the points in his new deal do not go far enough in substance to adequately address the needs of African American communities and rely heavily on assumptions that African American communities are primarily in the inner cities.

African Americans live in the Rust They live in rural areas across this country, in suburbs, and they live in territories.

Mr.Speaker, we are here tonight to speak to those two very important issues that go to the fabric of our founding: our ability to grow, diversify as a Nation, by bringing in the tired and the poor, the innovators, the ones who bring new changes to this country, and continue its dynamic growth, as well as voting rights.  Last week, President Trump--among a number of other things--expressed unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 Presidential election. The remarks that we heard would appear to be inaccurate, reckless, and dangerous to our democracy in some of our opinions.  Mr.Speaker, my colleagues and I are here this evening to highlight the real voter fraud in this country, and that is the continued attempts to suppress minority voting rights across many States as well as the outright denial of the right to vote for millions of Americans living in the territories.  I want to underscore that the fight for equal voting rights for minorities in this country did not end with the passage of the Voting Rights  In fact, today, more than 50 years after our esteemed colleague John Lewis and others courageously marched on Selma, we have seen the United States Supreme Court strike down one of its most important protections.  Within hours of that decision, States were already moving forward with restrictive voter ID laws, which had already been rejected as discriminatory under the Voting Rights  Six of the 16 States that passed voter ID laws since 2010 have a documented history of discriminating against minority voters.  The State of Alabama, in 2014, began enforcing a controversial voter ID law that required voters to show a State-issued ID in order to vote, and then announced plans to close 31 driver's license offices--most of them, ironically, in rural, impoverished, majority Black counties--making it even harder for residents to get the most common form of ID used to vote.  In addition to the Supreme Court's action, a Federal Court in a 2015 ruling used a racist, century-old opinion of the Supreme Court to uphold the denial of voting rights to American citizens in my home district of the United States Virgin Islands, and the citizens and residents of America's island territories.  They are called the insular cases, and the opinion was authored, ironically, by the same justice who wrote Plessy v.  March marks 100 years that my district has been a part of this country, but our service dates back to its very founding through the Virgin Islander and Founding Father Alexander He would be, I think, very upset to find out that people from the island in which he came could not vote for their President and Commander in Chief, even though the Virgin Islands and the territories have the highest rates of military service in the United States and have exponentially higher rates of casualties per capita in the wars in Afghanistan and We believe we have earned the right to take part in this democracy.  In another example, last year, a Federal appeals court decisively struck down a North Carolina voter identification law and noted its provisions deliberately ``target African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' That is a quote of the court in an effort to depress Black turnout at the polls. That, to me, sounds like voter fraud and voter suppression.  Mr.Speaker, these are just a few examples of the real voter fraud happening across this country.  The members of this caucus continue to work to ensure that all American citizens, regardless of their race, income or location, can participate in this great democracy; and we implore the President to direct his efforts to investigate voter fraud at these and other issues.  We want to, as the Congressional Black Caucus, address another issue, because we don't just represent African Americans or minorities here in this country. We want to address an issue that is of great concern to me and members of this caucus--and as demonstrated by massive protests this weekend and right across the street here this evening at the Supreme Court--the concern of a large majority of America, and that is the President's executive order to ban refugees entering into this country.  Banning entry to people fleeing persecution is perhaps as diametrically opposed to the foundational fabric of this country as you can get.  Mr.Speaker, not only is the President's refugee ban mean-spirited and misguided, it undermines our democracy, undermines our efforts to thwart terrorism, and is an affront to all who have sacrificed to defend it.  Viewing all refugees fleeing as suspects shows an extremely myopic understanding of the real threats and plays to extremist propaganda.  The refugee ban will not make us safe. It would have done nothing to prevent the 9/11 terrorist attacks, nor the others that followed. The terrorists of those attacks were American citizens, some of whom were even on the terrorist watch list and still allowed to legally purchase deadly weapons used to carry out their terrorist plot.  If this President and Congress want to protect the American people from terrorism, they should pass the no fly, no buy legislation that House Democrats stood to support.  Mr.Speaker, there are many of my colleagues here this evening who would love to speak on this issue.

1582,topic-id,484,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.612, the United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017.  I was grateful for the opportunity to work closely with my colleague, Mr.Langevin from Rhode Island, on this vitally important legislation that will build upon the existing collaboration between the United States and the State of Israel on critical cybersecurity issues.  Following our successful congressional delegation to Israel in May of last year to discuss homeland security and cybersecurity issues, Mr.Langevin and I worked closely to champion two important pieces of legislation.  Last year, I introduced H.5877, the United States-Israeli Advanced Partnership Act of 2016, which was signed into law on December 16 with Mr.Langevin's help and support. That legislation expanded a current cooperative research program between the two countries by adding cybersecurity to a program that had previously focused only on border security, explosives detection, and emergency services.  Today, Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to have H.612, the United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017 come before the This bill would expand the memorandum of agreement already in place between our Department of Homeland Security and the State of Israel by authorizing the Secretary to carry out a grant program at DHS to support cybersecurity research and development as well as the demonstration and commercialization of cybersecurity technologies.  During our congressional delegation, Mr.Langevin and I were able to meet with top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to discuss how the United States and Israel can better cooperate in these vital areas. We also had the opportunity to meet with many of Israel's cybersecurity companies and technology startups.  Over the past several years, Israel has become a leader in cybersecurity and has developed a deep and talented cyber workforce, something we need greater focus on here in the United To that end, much of our discussion with Israeli officials and private companies revolved around how the United States and Israel can work more closely together and learn from each other as we combat growing cybersecurity threats. This legislation is a product of those successful discussions.  Mr.Speaker, the United States and Israel are both under constant threat from nation-state and other actors that wish to do our countries harm, so it is vitally important that the United States and Israel work hand-in-hand to build our cyber defenses to combat these cyber threats together.  Mr.Speaker, it is also vital that in the House both parties work hand-in-hand on America's national security vulnerabilities. Given the current political environment, I would like to commend and thank my colleague, Mr.Langevin, for his willingness to do just that, as demonstrated by his partnership on this issue.

1685,topic-id,1089,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss why I intend to oppose the nomination of Rex Tillerson as the Secretary of This is not a decision that I make lightly. I have no doubt that Mr.Tillerson has been a successful businessman, managing one of America's largest corporations at Many have attested to his being a man of character who has given back to his community and, particularly, through his work with the Boy Scouts of  I have no reason to doubt that he does have the character and decency that we would applaud in any person. However, when the United States faces some of the most complex global challenges in a generation, this is not the time to appoint as our Nation's top diplomat someone who has no demonstrated experience articulating and advocating for America's interests, values, and commitment to our allies and partners.  As the events of this past week make clear, we need a Secretary of State who will speak up and candidly tell the truth to the President when he acts contrary to who we are as a nation and harms our relations with our partners and our standing in the world. Without an effective voice at the State Department for America's best interests, both within the executive branch and outside our borders, we will continue to see this administration, I fear, take steps that undermine cooperation with our closest allies and neighbors, violate our values, and ultimately make our troops and citizens less safe. I am concerned that Mr.Tillerson will not be such a voice for the American people.  Throughout the confirmation process, Mr.Tillerson has repeatedly demonstrated either his lack of preparation or his unwillingness, perhaps, to specifically declare himself on key issues. In particular, I am concerned about his views on Russia, climate change, and immigration, and how he will influence a White House that already seems determined to pursue campaign promises regardless of the impact on American foreign policy.  On Russia, Mr.Tillerson has demonstrated a familiarity with Putin and the Russian Government that is deeply concerning. Mr.Tillerson has spent his professional life advancing the interests of ExxonMobil--indeed, almost to the exclusivity of any other purpose. That is of concern, and should be of concern to all of us.  Even as the United States was reevaluating its relationship with Russia in recent years, Mr.Tillerson has deepened his personal relationship with Putin, to the point that the Russian President awarded Mr.Tillerson the Russian Order of Friendship in 2013, supposedly a very high honor for a non-It appears that Mr.Tillerson opposed U.sanctions against Russia after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 because his multinational corporation stood to lose very lucrative oil contracts if sanctions were put in place.  International sanctions against Russia, imposed by the United States and the European Union, have sent a clear and effective message to Russia that their invasion of Ukraine is unacceptable. These sanctions are absolutely critical to multilateral efforts to hold Russia to its commitments to end the violence in Ukraine and restore its sovereignty, consistent with the Minsk agreements. The Russians claimed that these are separatists, that these are Ukrainians rising up, but the truth is that this is Russian-inspired, Russian-directed, and at the behest of  Mr.Tillerson's wavering on Russian sanctions, however, could weaken the resolve of our European allies in maintaining these sanctions. It could encourage Putin in his efforts to cut a[[Page S505]]deal for sanctions relief and cause our allies in the Baltics and elsewhere to question the U.and NATO commitment to their security. This ultimately will make us less safe.  On climate change, Mr.Tillerson's career up to this point has been marked by a disregard for the environment. Strong environmental policies, including coordinating global efforts to address climate change, are in the best interest of the American people and help fulfill our moral responsibility as stewards of the Earth for the next generation. That is why I have consistently supported limits on oil and gas exploration, bans on drilling in pristine areas, eliminating oil and gas tax subsidies and giveaways, increases in research into new sustainable energy technologies, and the negotiation of international climate treaties. Mr.Tillerson's time at ExxonMobil stands in stark contrast to these policy goals and makes me doubt whether, if approved, he would effectively protect our environment and work with our partners around the world to uphold our commitments as Secretary of  On immigration, I am concerned about whether Mr.Tillerson can be an effective advocate for policies that keep the American people safe while preserving our ties with key partners and upholding our values internationally.  President Trump's Executive order blocking immigrants from certain Muslim-majority nations is, in my view, unconstitutional, un-American, cruel to those fleeing danger and injustice, and ultimately makes us less secure. It ignores the horrific circumstances refugees are fleeing in numerous war-torn regions. It suggests the insertion of arbitrary religious and ethnic considerations and fails to account for the strict vetting procedures already in place for refugees, particularly from Syria and areas of conflict. It is also contrary to our history as a nation that, from its birth, has benefited from the contributions of hard-working and successful immigrants.  In particular, this Executive order is a betrayal of our commitment to those who risk their lives to serve as translators for our troops fighting in Through the Special Immigrant Visa Program, we promised these brave Iraqis the opportunity to resettle in the United States in recognition of their invaluable contributions to our wartime missions. Yet this administration has effectively blocked these SIV Program recipients without a second thought.  In addition, the President's actions on immigration are making America less safe by undermining key relationships with allies and partners. The President's Executive order on immigration hands ISIS a self-inflicted propaganda victory that reinforces their claim that the United States is at war with all of It damages our diplomatic relationships with Muslim-majority nations, whether on the list or not, by undermining their willingness and ability to cooperate with U.law enforcement and intelligence agencies in sharing information on potential terrorist attackers. It may also compel these countries to reciprocate by prohibiting Americans from entering their borders.  Just this morning in the Armed Services Committee, we heard from an eminent expert.

Again, had this order been in effect, those pilots would not have been allowed in for the training that not only helps them but helps the thousands of American military personnel in Iraq, shoulder to shoulder, fighting together, depending on not just the presence but the confidence of the Iraqi military in the United States and that reciprocal mutual relationship.

We are creating huge problems, and, again, I haven't heard the nominee speak out decisively and clearly about the problems this policy is engendering, and that is incumbent upon the individual.

In his first remarks as President, Donald Trump claimed to champion this cause in his remarks, which proved to be petty and beneath the Office of President of the United On day one, in his first official acts in the office, one of his first official acts was to remove from the whitehouse.gov Web site a page detailing a broad set of civil rights commitments and accomplishments under President  It is fitting that President Trump, as one of his very first actions in office, would take down the public pledge to defend the civil rights of all This is a continuation of the divisiveness that defined his campaign where he proposed a Muslim ban, mass deportation, and a nationwide stop-and-frisk program. This is consistent with a President who would nominate Jeff Sessions, a man unanimously opposed by the civil rights community, as Attorney  President Trump didn't stop with changing the Web site. It has been reported that the Department of Justice is seeking to delay a hearing meant to focus on the relief required for Texas' discriminatory voter identification law. The U.Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled last year that the law had a discriminatory effect and that provisions must be made to allow those who lack the specific ID that the law requires be able to cast a vote. Every judge who has considered the Texas law found it discriminatory, but it still has been used in elections there.  Unfortunately, President Trump has given no indication that he is willing to stand up to protect the voting rights of all Since being elected, he has ignored proven instances of intentional voter suppression and chosen instead to spread alternative facts about voter fraud.  As one of its first substantive acts, the Trump administration suspended a mortgage insurance rate cut put in place by the Obama administration to give relief to homeowners. According to the Federal Housing Administration, the cut would have saved the average homeowner $500 this year. This reversal will make it more difficult for middle class Americans trying to purchase a home and eliminate relief for homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments.  According to the National Association of Realtors, this will prevent 30,000 to 40,000 new home buyers from purchasing homes in 2017. This move will disproportionately affect African American homeowners who are more likely than White homeowners to rely on FHA mortgage insurance.  Mr.Speaker, we know exactly who Donald Trump is and have an inkling about what he intends to do, but what we plan on doing is educating the President about the needs of underserved communities. So I will just take a moment to address a few of his points in his new deal for the African American community, which is truly a bad deal in terms of economic equality. It is a raw deal in terms of public education, and it is a hollow deal in terms of voting and civil rights.  On behalf of the caucus, the CBC, the Congressional Black Caucus, I would like to inform him that 39 percent of African Americans actually live in suburbs compared to 36 percent who live in inner cities. The remaining 25 percent live in small metropolitan areas or rural communities.  For more than 45 years, the Congressional Black Caucus has worked to improve conditions for African Americans from all walks of life. Collectively, our members represent 78 million Americans, 17 million of whom are African Our districts are rural as well as urban. Some of our members represent majority minority districts, while others do not.  Mr.Speaker, tonight you will hear from several members of the Congressional Black Caucus who will point to specific pieces of legislation that we have championed and that we have authored that would address many of the issues facing inner-city communities, facing poor communities, and facing communities all across this country no matter the race or makeup of those communities.  What I would like to reiterate and stress is the fact that we don't just talk about a problem, but we offer solutions. We have sent to you, Mr.[[Page H600]]President, a letter outlining all of the 10 points in your new deal with concrete solutions and legislation that we have authored that we think will go further and is a more comprehensive way of approaching the problems in those communities.  We also sent you another document that details more than your 10 issues, but highlights issues that are faced by American families all across this country and our policy proposals that will solve them. We would just encourage you to step out of the White House and to listen to people who have done this for a long time and who live in those communities and who have offered viable solutions.  So I would just say that we don't need more talk or more rhetoric. What we need is action, and we need action from 1600 We need action from the White House, and we would urge you to look at the proposals that we have that offer a better solution.

I will just talk about the two most egregious things from this past week, which are the allegations of voter fraud and his nomination of a person to run the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and his unconstitutional ban on  Since 2010, 20 States have restricted voting rights by enacting discriminatory voter ID and proof of citizenship laws, illegally purging thousands of proper voters from the rolls, cutting back early voting, limiting voter registration, and engaging in other suppressive tactics. These laws were put in place to combat the notion of voter fraud despite the fact that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United  More than a dozen recent investigations and studies all show voter fraud to be virtually nonexistent. A 2014 Washington Post investigation found 31 incidents of voter fraud in the more than 1 billion ballots that were cast in elections at all levels of government from 2000 to 2014. Of the more than 137 million ballots cast in the 2016 election, election and law enforcement officials in all 50 States have yet to report any indications of widespread voter fraud.  But, if there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, what reason could anyone have, including the President, for this claim? The truth is that Republicans have used the voter fraud lie to restrict voting rights for years. Voter ID laws have been sponsored by Republicans and have been passed overwhelmingly by Republican legislatures.  Richard Posner, a conservative U.circuit court judge appointed by President Reagan, has called the concerns about voter fraud a mere fig leaf that is intended to justify laws that appear to be aimed at limiting voting by minorities, especially In July 2016, a U.circuit court struck down North Carolina's law, calling it the most restrictive voting law North Carolina has seen since the era of Jim The judges charged that Republican lawmakers had targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.  Let me just turn very briefly to the President's ill-advised, unconstitutional executive order that purportedly promotes national security. Keeping America safe is a top priority for all of us, but this order is wrong. It is wrong because it makes us less safe, and it is wrong because it goes against our American values. This is the latest in President Trump's series of actions that shows that his number one priority is short-term shows of intolerance instead of the long-term security of the American people.  Actions by the Oval Office directly affect people's lives. When the President is making policy up on the fly, it has real harmful consequences in the lives of everyday The fact that the Secretary of Homeland Security--a committee in Congress on which I serve--was not included in discussions about implementing the executive order, even though this Department is in charge of its implementation, is clear evidence of a broken system. Shutting out the mothers, children, fathers, and families who are fleeing the same violence that we fight against is exactly what ISIS and similar groups want us to do, and it only strengthens their hands. This haphazard order does nothing to keep Americans safe. In fact, it hurts our efforts to fight against terrorism.  Let me just say, Mr.Speaker, to my colleague from Texas that the President of the United States, when addressing Liberty University, cited ``2 Corinthians,'' while most church-going people in the country would say ``Second Corinthians.'' He cited 2 Corinthians 2:17, which reads, wherever the Lord is, there is liberty and freedom, but there can't be liberty and freedom without meaningful access to the voting polls. He didn't need to get to chapter 3. He really could have just stopped at the first few paragraphs of the Second Corinthians, which read: ``Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . . . who comforts us in our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble.''  The question becomes: Why go to Liberty University and offer your Christian values?  It always talks about the least of these in the Bible and what we are doing to help others and to do unto others as you would have them do unto you so that, as soon as mothers and children and families are fleeing persecution and certain death, we put a wall up around our country, shut down our airports, and say: We don't care what trouble you are in. You just can't come here.  That goes against everything that this country was founded on.

So it is my privilege, alongside my colleagues, to speak on behalf of those who are not here today to speak for themselves. No taxpayer dollars should ever go to fund abortions. This is a commonsense truth that even the most ardent pro-abortion activists have a hard time arguing.  I am unapologetically pro-life, and it is no secret that I believe in stronger protections for unborn children under the law, but I also believe that we must assign greater respect for life within our society. That is why it is so important for Congress to make a statement, once and for all, that there is no place in the Federal budget for abortion funding.  As an appropriator, I can tell you that the Hyde amendment has been indispensable to stopping funding for abortion throughout our government healthcare agencies. Now it is time to apply the same longstanding provision across the entire Federal  Madam Speaker, for my pro-life colleagues and me, fighting on behalf of the unborn has been an uphill battle these last several years. The abortion industry's fierce allies in the Senate and the Obama administration have made sure that many worthy pro-life measures were defeated. However, with a unified Republican government, our hope is that our prospects have changed for the better. On just the second day of his Presidency, President Trump issued an executive order blocking Federal funding for international groups to provide or promote abortions. For the pro-life community, this long-overdue action was a welcome sign that the Trump administration will be a powerful ally in the fight for life.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, how do you dismiss 2 million people? How do you dismiss 2 million people, over 60,000 people every year?  If you can imagine what it would be like if someone came in here and with certainty, absolute confidence, said unambiguously, if you pass this law you are going to save 2 million lives, we would line up. We would be voting on that over and over and over again.

The Hyde amendment has saved over 2 million unborn children since 1976, including 100,000 lives in  For decades, this annual restriction on taxpayer funding of abortion has been referred to as the Hyde amendment because it was the late Congressman Henry Hyde from Illinois who sought to protect as many unborn children as he could during his service in Recollecting his own work, Congressman Hyde offered this poignant reflection:  ``When the time comes as it surely will, when we face that awesome moment, the final judgment, I've often thought, as Fulton Sheen wrote, that it is a terrible moment of loneliness. You have no advocates, you are there alone standing before God--and a terror will rip through your soul like nothing you can imagine. But I really think that those in the pro-life movement will not be alone. I think there will be a chorus of voices that have never been heard in this world but are heard beautifully and clearly in the next world--and they will plead for everyone who has been in this movement. They will say to God, `Spare him because he loved us'. . . . ''  Henry Hyde is not forgotten, and this work goes on.  Despite former-President Obama's promise that no abortion would be covered by his healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act authorized and appropriated funds for healthcare plans with abortion coverage. This must stop.  We must remember, abortion is not health care, and in no way should the government fund or subsidize the violent destruction of unborn children.  It is the overwhelming opinion of Americans, including those who identify as pro-choice, that taxpayer dollars should not be used for abortion.

Mr.Speaker, the gentleman from New Jersey, for more than three decades, has raised these issues in this very Chamber, speaking for those who are defenseless and voiceless. He speaks because he speaks truth and is motivated by his conscience to discuss these truths.  Every year since 1973, we have had a March for Life here in This year, we have the 44th anniversary of Roe v. It is one of the gravest examples of judicial activism in our Nation's history. Seven black-robed Justices decided that the lives of unborn children are not protected under the Constitution in what Justice White referred to as an exercise in raw judicial power.

Everyone in the Senate knows how they are going to vote on this confirmation. Quite frankly, the President deserves the right to have someone at the CIA whom he trusts and is going to do a good job at a very critical agency. This is a critical component of our national security apparatus. It is unfortunate that the first weekend as President he had to have that position vacant.

As I said earlier, we could have voted on this last Friday, as the Senate Democratic leader had promised the chairman of the Intelligence That word was not kept. Nevertheless, we are here today, and we are going to move forward.  Our new Commander in Chief deserves and needs the Director of the CIA in this job as soon as possible because we face a complex number of dangerous threats, perhaps more than at any time in our recent memory. These include the threat of radical Islamic terrorism--in Iraq, Syria, Southeast Asia, North Africa, even here at home; Russian aggression toward our friends and allies in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. We face the savage Assad regime in Syria, which continues to slaughter innocent men, women, and children, targeting civilians in Aleppo and other places. We, of course, face an increasingly unstable dictator in North Korea who continues to develop long-range missiles, soon capable of reaching the west coast of the United States--at least according to his claims. We face an emboldened China which, in pursuing their illegitimate territorial claims in the South China Sea, threatens to destabilize the region. We face Iranian leaders--an Iranian leader who still leads the chant of ``Death to America'' every week as they cheat on the lax requirements of President Obama's flawed nuclear deal. We face illicit trafficking in the Western Hemisphere, right here in our own backyard, that destabilizes governments in the region and floods the streets of our country with narcotics.[[Page S381]]  Quite frankly, Congressman Pompeo's national security experience makes supporting his nomination one of the easiest nomination decisions I have faced in the 6 years and 1 month that I have had the honor of serving the people of Florida in the U.

There is so much uncertainty and debate about our role in the world these days. A lot of our allies have questions. Our adversaries are obviously watching very closely.  I hope that all of us--and I mean the Executive Branch to the Congress--recognize that as people around the world are watching what is happening on television, they see an America that is deeply divided and fractured right now. I think this needs to be a moment of restraint, both in action and in words. As we work through our differences, these vibrant debates are important to our system of government.  It is one of the reasons that led me to ultimately support the nomination of Mr.I believe that despite some of the concerns that I had and have about his answers to some of my questions, it is vitally important for this country to have a Secretary of State in place at this moment.

I have had some concerns about his answers to some very important questions, at least important questions to me, and what I hope will be important questions for a lot of That is what I wanted to come to the floor and speak about in conjunction with this nomination, and that is the issue of human rights.  To me, human rights is critical both to our national identity, but it is also important to our national In America today, we have, as we have done now for the past few centuries, contentious debates all the time about policies and about what kind of country we want to be. If you have watched the proceedings on the Senate floor or in committee over the last few days, you have seen a lot of that.  Even as we debate these things among ourselves, and even as the American political rhetoric has become so incredibly heated--and we will have more to say about that in the weeks to come--I don't know of any other time where we have gotten to the point that when we disagree with people, we don't just disagree with them, we question their motives and their character.  In fact, it is almost automatic today in American political discourse. You don't just disagree with someone; you immediately jump to why they are a bad person. In the months and weeks to come, I will have examples about why that is a bad idea. But as we are having those contentious debates, I hope that we never take for granted, sometimes as I think we do, that we live in a place where losing an election, losing a vote, losing on an issue, does not mean you end up in jail or disappear or are executed because that is the kind of stuff that happens in other places all over the world, even now, in the 17th year of the 21st century.  As we have seen in recent weeks, this political dissent is part of our way of life. It has come to define our country. We protect it in our It has made us an example to the rest of the world. I was reminded of this just a couple of months ago, right here in Washington, After our most recent election, I had to a chance to visit with my opponent, Congressman Patrick Murphy of  When I was finished with that meeting, I walked into another meeting. That other meeting was with a Cuban dissident. He is an opponent of the Castro regime, an individual who risks his life in the pursuit of freedom, an individual who does not just get bad blog posts or a bad article or a bad editorial or a nasty campaign ad run against him. No, this is an individual who routinely gets thrown into jail, and he has the scars to prove the beatings he has taken from the Cuban state police over the last few years.  I was a little bit late to this meeting. I apologized to him. I explained that I had just been in a meeting with my opposing candidate, the man I had just ran against in the election. I could see the look on his face. It kind of struck him. He immediately, I believe, appreciated what that represented. He said--and I am paraphrasing: That is what we want for our country too.  This is the essence of what has been America's example to the world, the essence of how our principles and our values have inspired others to seek their own God-given rights and how we have a moral duty to support--in our words, in our foreign policy, and in our actions--those aspirations of people all over the world.  In a way, dictators and tyrants have never had it worse than they do today because we live in this high-tech information age. We often get to see the images of repression within minutes of it happening, if not in real time. We can monitor it; we can catalog the status of human rights in every city, in every country, on every continent.  But as Americans, we are called to do much more than observe and record these atrocities for history. With this knowledge, it is our duty to act and to do what we can to support the people demanding their rights. We must hold those who are violating their rights accountable. I believe this is more important than ever because of the totalitarian resurgence underway in many parts of the world as democracy in every continent is under attack.[[Page S535]]  Even as I stand here now before you, there are political prisoners on this planet. They languish in Chinese prisons. Political dissidents and journalists are being silenced and targeted for murder in Those who seek democracy in Syria are being massacred. The United States has a unique responsibility to highlight, to expose, and to combat these grave human rights abuses around the world.  Historically, we have been a compassionate country that has welcomed people seeking refuge from repression and atrocities. That is why I understand. I understand the concerns about refugees from certain failed states or governments who sponsor terror, places where very often it is difficult if not impossible to verify the identities of people seeking to come to the United  I say this to people all the time. When you talk about changes in policies, there is a legitimate argument and a credible argument to be made that there are people we cannot allow into the United States, not because we don't have compassion for their plight but because we have no way of knowing who they are. You can't just call 1-800-Syria and get background information about the individuals who are trying to enter the United We know for a fact that there are terrorist groups around the world that have commandeered passport-making machinery and are producing passports that are real in every way, except for the identity of the person in the picture.  So I do believe that we need to have very careful and rigorous screening, more than ever before, of all people entering the United States but especially those who are coming from areas that we know do not have reliable background information available to us.  But at the same time, I cannot help, and I think we should not help, but to be worried about the impact of a 120-day moratorium on every single refugee from anywhere on the planet, refugees from places like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ukraine, Colombia, El Salvador, Vietnam, Burma, and, of course, Cuba, just to name a few places. These are among the most vulnerable people on the planet, living often in the most difficult and dangerous circumstances imaginable.  I remind everyone: This is a moratorium; it is not a permanent policy. I understand that there are provisions available for waivers, and I find that to be promising.  But I also want to everyone to understand that 120 days, for someone who is trying to get out of a place where they might be killed, may be 1 day too many for some of them. I hope that that does not turn out to be the case. That is why I urge the administration, that is why I urge soon-to-be Secretary Tillerson, to exercise great caution in making sure that dissidents and others are not being turned away.  By the way, I am pleased to see that the administration is heeding some of these calls already, early this week. We must understand that when tyrants and dictators oppress their people, we are all paying a price. It is happening all over the world. Vladimir Putin continues to institute Draconian laws targeting the freedom of expression and assembly.  Earlier this year, my office and I highlighted the case of human rights activist Ildar Dadin, who was the first person imprisoned under Russia's new criminal provision that bars any form of public dissent.  In China, rights lawyers are tortured. Labor activists are arrested. Tibetan Buddhist nuns are expelled from their homes, and churches are being demolished. Just earlier today, I met the wives of two Chinese rights advocates, who both pleaded for the United States to champion their husbands' cases in the hope that they can see their husbands again.  In Iran, dissent, freedom of expression, and freedom of press is nonexistent, heavily restricted. Many continue to be jailed for simply exercising their fundamental human rights. The Government of Iran targets religious minorities, often jailing Christian pastors and those who gather to worship together in private homes. In Syria, one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in modern history, the Assad regime, with the assistance of Vladimir Putin and the Iranian Government and military, is committing war crimes against innocent women, children, men, and civilians in Aleppo and beyond.  In Iraq, we have seen ancient Christian and Yezidi communities on the verge of extinction, all because of  In Venezuela, the Maduro regime continues to imprison political opponents while the country descends further and further into economic chaos and has now become on the verge of a total humanitarian catastrophe in the Western In one of the richest countries on the planet, we are at the point of people literally starving to death.  Saudi Arabia is an ally of the United States on many key geopolitical issues, and we will have to continue working with them on those shared causes. But they also remain one of the most censored countries in the world. The government has intensified its repression of activists and journalists. In Saudi Arabia, women remain under the male guardianship system. They are banned from even driving.  Globally, assaults against press freedom around the world are a major problem because, ultimately, the cause and champions of human rights need information to expose abuses and call for reforms. Without independent journalists, without information, tyrants and dictatorships can get away with so much more.  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, in 2016, 48 journalists were killed and 259 journalists were jailed worldwide. In 2016, Turkey, a NATO member, again, an important geopolitical alliance of the United States, but, sadly, they became the leading jailer of journalists on the planet, following a widespread crackdown on the press.  The abuses and threats to human rights around the world are many. We could be here all night trying to break Senator Strom Thurmond's filibuster record, going country by country, case by case, and it still would not be enough time to do justice to all of the heroic figures around the world. But it is my hope that more of my colleagues will join me in doing so over time because it is important. Our voices here in the Senate give people all over the world confidence and motivation to stay the course.  As famed Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky has said of himself and fellow prisoners of conscience in the Soviet Union: ``We never could survive even one day in the Soviet Union if our struggle was not the struggle of the free world.''  In essence, what he is saying is that these tyrants and these dictators, when they jail these people, the first thing they tell them is that no one even remembers you anymore. No one talks about you anymore. You have been abandoned.  Today, I want to highlight one particular human rights case as part of the weekly social media campaign my office has been doing for the last couple of years called Expression NOT  Here you see a picture of a gentleman named Eduardo Cardet of He is a medical doctor and the national coordinator of the Christian Liberation Movement, a group which advocates for democracy and freedom.  Cardet assumed the role of national coordinator after the suspicious death of Castro critic Oswaldo Paya After allegedly stating in an interview that Fidel Castro was hated by the Cuban people--that is what he said--he was savagely beaten in front of his two young children and wife by Cuban state security on November 30 of last year. He has been in jail ever since.  He has been charged--get this. He has been charged with challenging authority. He faces a 3- to 5-year prison sentence. Let me repeat that. He is officially charged with challenging authority. That is a crime in His father has written to Pope Francis begging for his intervention. By the way, this is a reminder that even though Fidel Castro is dead, his authoritarian system still lives on.  Cardet's persecution and the overall increase in repression in Cuba over the past 2 years is a reminder that the policy of rewarding the Castro regime, under the guise of engagement, with cash and concessions has not worked and must be strategically reversed here in the coming months.  So I come here today in the hope that our President and our State Department and especially Mr.Tillerson,[[Page S536]]in whom I am entrusting my vote for confirmation, and all Members of Congress, for that matter, will add their voices in solidarity with Cardet, with all the Cuban people yearning to be free, and with those around the world who look to our Nation--to America--for leadership and often for nothing more than for us to lend our voice to their cause.  As we move forward here with our Nation's work, we must continue to highlight these cases and to raise awareness of them. We must never forget that there are people all over the world who are challenging authority because they want a better life for themselves and their families. They should be able to challenge authority peacefully and then go home to their families, not be thrown in jail, tortured, or killed.  Today I ask all to pray for those who are victims of their own government. I pray for the release of prisoners of conscience and their families, and I pray that our own country at this moment of extraordinary division on so many key issues can reaffirm its founding principles in calling for the sacred right of every man, woman, and child to be free.

1075,topic-id,1217,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.[[Page H711]]  Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Rob Bishop for allowing my bill to come to the floor again.  We passed the same bill in the House on December 6, but the Senate adjourned 3 days later without acting, and the problem has not gone away.  The economy of the Northern Mariana Islands grew 3.5 percent last year, the fourth straight year of growth for my district.  This strong economic expansion is good news for the people I represent. We desperately want this growth to continue because our economy is still smaller than it was in 2000.  The Northern Mariana Islands Economic Expansion Act addresses that problem and is broadly supported back home.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from Governor Ralph Deleon Guerrero Torres of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; from the Commonwealth's Strategic Economic Development Council; the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation; the Hotel Association of the Northern Mariana Islands; and from the Saipan Chamber of                                           CNMI Strategic Economic                                          Development Council,                                                 December 1, 2016.

The U.Bureau of Economic Analysis indicates the      Commonwealth economy grew for the fourth consecutive year, a      recent high of 3.5 percent. This is attributable to increased      private investment and tourism now threatened by the lack of      available qualified workers on the island.       The modest one-year increase in Commonwealth-Only      Transitional Workers (CW) proposed under H.6401, will      provide the business community with the necessary human      resources to continue to operate and propel an expanding      economy.       It is imperative that we do not stymie our plan for fixture      economic growth, now beginning to come to frutition, with a      labor shortage in critical areas.

This critical legislation would provide an increase in the      FY 2017 limit on Commonwealth-only Transitional Workers (CW)      and allow the CHCC to petition for renewal of 39 essential      healthcare workers impacted when the CW cap was reached just      two weeks into the Fiscal       Our Commonwealth Health Center (CHC) is the only hospital      in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, providing      inpatient and outpatient acute, chronic, and emergency health      care services to the people of the We also maintain      community health centers on the populated islands of Saipan,      Tinian, and       Our ability to continue to provide these essential on-     island health care services, and maintain quality patient      care and safety as well as maintain overall public health,      depends on being able to maintain current staffing levels and      specialized expertise.

Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Sablan: I write to support H.6401,      critical legislation that will provide short-term relief from      the labor shortage facing the Commonwealth that threatens our      growing economy and public health.       The latest report from Bureau of Economic Analysis      indicates the Commonwealth economy grew for the fourth      consecutive year. A growing economy needs a qualified      workforce. And while there are now more U.workers than      foreign workers in the Northern Marianas for the first time      in decades, there are still not enough to meet the labor      demand. The temporary increase in the number of Commonwealth-     Only Transitional (CW) workers provided in your bill will      particularly help small businesses retain the workers needed      to maintain operations.       Most importantly, the Commonwealth's only hospital, stand      to lose critical staff including 34 staff nurses, two      infection control nurses, a clinical laboratory scientist and      specialists in mammography, ultrasonography without the      relief provided in H.6401.       Building a qualified U.workforce in the Northern      Marianas is a priority for my administration. The CW worker      fee increase in the legislation will provide additional      funding for efforts to recruit, educate, and train these      workers and establish a permanent pool of workers to fill      local jobs.       H.6401 is critical to continued economic growth in the      Northern The bill has my full support.

This shared      belief has been the foundation of ourcountry for over 200      years. And for centuries, media has been a major outlet for      people to exercise this freedom because itallows them to      share their opinions with the masses. The idea of free speech      took on a different meaning with the development ofthe      internet in the late 80s. Since then, this liberty has grown      exponentially. Now people have the ability to share      theirthoughts with a much larger audience. It is possible to      do this anonymously and without fear of consequence. The      internet is anincredible asset which has helped with      globalization and the spread of information. However, this      form of media does have itsdrawbacks. The leading issue is      that it enables the spread of false information. So, while      the internet embodies our nation'score value of freedom, it      can also be detrimental to another vital aspect of our      society: educated and well informedcitizens.

The 2016 presidential      campaign was a dramatic affair, and just the opening act to      one ofthe most high-stakes elections in our country's      history. The actions and rhetoric of the president-elect have      inspired a greatpolitical shift, as well as a burgeoning      sense of xenophobia and hatred throughout the country. During      times such as these, itis important to focus on what we can      do to create a better future. Much of the hate directed      towards certain groups of people isdue to ignorance and can      be traced back to stereotypes perpetrated by unreliable media      sources. Forcing media sites todrastically increase their      censorship would rightfully anger their users, on the grounds      that it restricts their constitutionalright to free speech.      Therefore, the most plausible and effective solution to the      problem of misinformation is to educatepeople.       As of this year, 78% of the United States population has a      social media profile (Statista). Facebook and Twitter      havebillions of users across the world. It is imperative that      we use such sites with care. The recent controversies over      fake newshave made the influence of the media on politics      increasingly apparent. The rumor now known as ``Pizzagate''      is a prime exampleof a fake news story with tremendous      influence. Millions of people believed that Hillary Clinton      was involved in a child-prostitution ring run out of a pizza      parlor. This is because, for a vast number of people, social      media and biased news sourcesare their only ways of acquiring      information. In fact, it is estimated that 62% of American      adults use social media at leastoccasionally as a news source      (Pew Research Center). However, many blindly make the      assumption that it is accurate. Whenhundreds of thousands of      people are susceptible to hate-driven fake news, it can have      a huge impact on our democracy.       This iswhy I propose the incorporation of media literacy as      a core subject in all public schools. Public schools educate      the majorityof our nation's children. Which is why, by      teaching America's youth how to approach sources impartially      and critically, we canfix this problem of misinformation.      Integrating media literacy as a required course at elementary      and high-school levels is aninvestment in our future      generations.        musa mayange, winooski high school senior (secondplace)       Twelve years and still no change.

Racism exists in Surveys reveal that whites apply      stereotypical thinkingabout blacks, considering them lazy and      unintelligent. What are we going to do about these attitudes      towards persons ofcolor?       The American National Election Studies asked voters to rank      blacks and whites from hardworking to lazy, fromintelligent      to unintelligent. In 2012, 62 percent of whites gave blacks a      lower score in at least one area. In 2008, 45 percentof      whites expressed negative feelings about black stereotypes.      (Milbank, Washington Post)       For a while, we thought that theissue of racism was over      and that our nation was going to move forward and ``leave the      past in the past.'' It almost had mefooled because we live in      Vermont and we sometimes can be isolated from world issues.      But racism is still here. When everyonethought that it was no      longer ``relevant,'' it's still alive.       As a young African-American immigrant, how can I wrap my      headaround this? As Vermonters how can we annihilate racism      and get our community to be accepting of all races, cultures,      and ethnicbackgrounds?       Ta-Nehisi Coates addresses the disadvantages of living with      black skin in Between the World And Coates says``. . .      today, when 8% of the world's prisoners are black men, our      race has been refinanced to the Dream of being white.      Blacklife is cheap, but in America, black bodies are a      natural resource of incomparable value.'' Black people are      born with adisadvantage. We are more likely to go jail than      white people. The Center for American Progress says, ``In the      United States,black people account for 60 percent of those      imprisoned. The prison population grew by 700 percent from      1970 to 2005, a ratethat is outpacing crime and population      rates.       Black people make up 17% of the United States population      yet more of us are injail. A black man is twice as likely to      go to jail than a white man, even if they did the same crime.       Racism was born whenhumans identified skin color as a      positive or negative factor. If each of us could accept that      we are all humans, we come fromdifferent places, and have      different interests, we could accept racial differences, but      not let them divide us. We will nevermove forward if we don't      work together side by side and knock down obstacles.        aj defelice,hartford high school freshman (third place)       The United States is one of the greatest countries onEarth,      prized for its natural beauty, economic opportunities, and      democratic principles. However, many challenges face      ournation. Among the most pressing issues are climate change,      immigration, and income inequality.       Perhaps the most dauntingproblem we face is climate change,      and the crucial role our country plays in it. Although      President Obama recently signed theParis Agreement to limit      greenhouse gas emissions, much must still be done to combat      this issue. We can begin by puttingunemployed or low-income      Americans to work--manufacturing, transporting, and      installing renewable energy products--such as solarpanels,      wind turbines, and more. This would produce a similar effect      as the New Deal put into place by President Franklin      D.Roosevelt to combat the negative effects of the Great      Additionally, a carbon tax should be established      nationally,to lower emissions, and encourage the usage of      renewable energy. A carbon tax would also allow for tax      reductions in otherareas, and combined with employing      Americans to transition to widespread renewable energy, would      create economic growth, whilesimultaneously reducing our      carbon footprint.       Another controversial issue which troubles our nation is      immigration. TheUnited States is a country built on the backs      of immigrants, and to deny a path to citizenship to millions      who long only for ahigher quality of life is unpatriotic. We      must stop dehumanizing these people and see them only for who      they are--people.Immigrants strengthen our economy, whether      it be as producers, consumers, or developers. To deny them      access to citizenship inour nation would be depriving      ourselves of economic growth and cultural diversity. Economic      and cultural change that would onlystrengthen American      society.       Income inequality is another issue which plagues our nation      today. According to countless yearsof research, income      inequality has a direct correlation on social and health      issues. A study conducted by the University ofWisconsin found      that people who reside in more financially unequal      communities are more likely to die before the age of 75.      Asnational income inequality decreases, so do social and      health problems. This decline can be seen in Scandinavian      countries,where having a more equal gross domestic product      per capita results in a higher quality of life. To make this      possible for theUnited States, corporations must be regulated      and held accountable by lawmakers to be sure that the      American people arereceiving the representation they deserve.      As citizens, we must be responsible in electing officials who      will place the needs ofthe greater population[[Page S360]]     above the interests of wealthy corporate executives.       Our nation is at a turning point in itshistory, and the      choices we make today will have lasting effects on future      generations.       The United States of America willremain a strong,      respected, and prosperous nation if we are able to look past      our disagreements and focus on making progressthrough      compromise. We must act wisely, and keep our eyes on what is      most important--the liberty we treasure as our      nation'scrowning promise.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-20-pt1-PgS359.txt,1010,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,20.0,January

448,topic-id,1170,"Mr.President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be the Director of the Central Intelligence At a time when we are facing massive attacks against privacy rights thanks to the explosion of technology, we should be greatly troubled by giving power to a person who has stated flat-out that he wants to expand the surveillance state, not rein it in.  Here is the kind of world we are now living in, a world that should be of concern to every freedom-loving American, whether you are Democrat or Republican or Independent, conservative or progressive. We are living in a world where government and the private sector often know where you are at any time. They know where you are. They know where you are traveling. They know what books you are reading, what Web sites you are visiting, and maybe the emails you are sending out or reading.  I hear a whole lot of discussion on the floor of the Senate about freedom, about our desire to live and defend a free society. I would ask my colleagues and the American people--when we talk about freedom, one of the attributes of a free society is the right to live our lives the way we want to live our lives, without Big brother knowing everything there is to know about us. You want to do what you want to, it is your business; I want to do what I want to do, it is my business--if we are not harming other people. I believe that is a basic American right and a basic constitutional right, and I want to see people at the CIA, at the NSA, at other intelligence agencies who, yes, will be vigorous about defending us from terrorism but will do it in a way that is constitutional, that protects the civil liberties and the civil rights of the American people.  According to the Pew Internet Project, today 95 percent of American adults own a cell phone. More than three-quarters of American adults own a smartphone. Eighty-eight percent of American adults use the These advancements obviously have enormous advantages. Everybody knows all of the extraordinary things we can do on the Internet and all the information we can gain. It is almost unthinkable that we were living not so many years ago without the advantages of the All of these advantages, all of these conveniences come with a price.  If you have a Google account and the GPS enabled on your phone, Google creates a map for you of every single place you go in a given day. Facebook amasses a massive amount of data on you to better target commercials and advertisements to you. Credit card companies track your spending habits. Even innocuous things like a loyalty program in which you gain benefits by buying at a certain store give the private sector and the government eventually access to a massive amount of information about you.  When you go to the grocery store and scan your card, it is very convenient, moves things faster, and you can get a discount, but the store gets to track everything you purchase. Is that really what want? Do you want the whole world to have knowledge of everything you purchase? For just one rather famous example, Target--a huge chain in America--could tell if a woman was pregnant based on what she was purchasing at the store. Do we really feel comfortable about that kind of information getting out into the private sector or the government sector?[[Page S383]]  If you are wearing a tracking device today to count your steps, to count your heart rate and your sleep patterns, you may see it as a way to become healthier. Your employer or health insurance company, however, may see it as a way to charge you more if you don't meet certain employee wellness targets. Are we really comfortable about corporations knowing all about our health? If you are dealing with a serious illness, maybe it is something you and your family want to keep within the bosom of your family and not spread to the whole world.  That companies are collecting this much information on their own is very troubling to me, but Mr.Pompeo apparently wants to go even further. Last January, he published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in which he wrote:       Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all      metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial      and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable      database. Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance      should be removed.  What we are talking about is the U.Government having, in many ways, more information about us than we may even understand about our own lives. In many ways, it sounds to me that we are moving toward an Orwellian society where, between the government and the private sector, there is very little about ourselves that is not known by somebody else. I am very, very uncomfortable about that.  I want at the head of the CIA somebody who understands thoroughly the Constitution of the United States and privacy rights and understands that we can fight terrorism effectively within the Constitution and the privacy rights guaranteed to the people of our country.  Since June of 2013, here is what we have already learned that the NSA collects: phone call metadata, including the numbers of both parties--my number and the number of the person I call--the location, time, and duration of that telephone call. NSA has access to text messages, email chat, and Internet browsing history, smartphone app data, including map data, which can pinpoint a person's location to within a few yards. They have maps of people's social networks and bank and credit card transactions. That is a lot of information held by the government and/or the private sector on the personal lives of the American people.  As I have mentioned, there is nobody in this Congress who does not understand the threat of terrorism and does not want to see our government be as strong and vigorous as possible in fighting terrorism and getting all the information we need to effectively combat terrorism, to make sure that if somebody is a suspect in terrorist activities, that we go after that person as strongly and as effectively as we can. I believe from the bottom of my heart that we can do that without invading the privacy rights of the American people.  It is not acceptable for Senator after Senator to come here and say we are defending freedom, we live in a free society, and then vote to allow the government or the private sector to have an unbelievable amount of knowledge about each and every one of our personal lives.  Now more than ever, it is vital to have a head of the CIA who will stand up for our Constitution, stand up for privacy rights. Unfortunately, in my view, Mr.Pompeo is not that individual.

474,topic-id,1986,"Mr.President, I ask to have printed in the Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont high school students as part of the seventh annual State of the Union essay contest conducted by my office.  The material follows:   FINN ABBEY, MOUNT MANSFIELD UNION HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN (FINALIST)       Our country has faced many issues in the past, but today we      face one of our greatest challenges. We have      forgotten to care for each other; forgotten that we are only      strong with each other. We are growing too uncompassionate,      too distrustful of each other. We can and must remember that      we are not enriched by the success of one person, but rather      the success of many. We prosper not with the defeat of      others, but with their success. And keeping with the      philosophy that we must succeed together, we must work      together on smaller challenges.       Our country needs a system that not only doesn't punish the      poor for their very existence, but offers every person the      chance to better themselves. The hope that your children will      have a better life than you has long been a staple of the      American dream. To accomplish this, we need to create a      liveable wage of $15, and create a progressive tax system      that leaves the poor with more and takes fairly from those      who can afford it. We cannot be satisfied in the splendor of      ourselves and people like us when our fellow Americans are      living in the streets.       We must also institute universal health care. This will      involve higher taxes, of course, but, combined with strict      laws about pharmaceutical pricing and a fair tax system, will      ensure that our country is healthy and our middle class stays      strong. No one should ever have to choose between food and      medicine. We need change.       We also must guarantee everyone the right to vote, and that      their votes count. Time and time again voter ID laws have      suppressed the African-American vote. We cannot say we are      equal when we pass laws with the purpose of lowering voter      turnout.       We also have to remove another recent mistake in election      law: Citizens We cannot accept catering to special      interests as a side effect of democracy; we must recognize it      as a barrier to a fairer system. We must put the redrawing of      congressional districts in the hands of independent      commissions to prevent gerrymandering. Anything[[Page S394]]     less is a conflict of interest and a mockery of democracy. We      need to replace first past the post with ranked choice      voting, allowing for a greater variety of candidates. This      will serve as another booth in the marketplace of ideas.       To many these goals are mountains too tall to climb. But in      America, we don't know how to give up. It's what makes us      great. The idea that if we want change, we'll fight until we      reach it. It's what got African-Americans equality under the      law. It's what got women the right to vote. It's what has      brought equal love to our entire nation. And it's what led to      independence for the plucky colonists who took on the world      because they thought it could be better. Throughout our      history, all we've needed is an idea, an ideal, and each      other. After all, out of many, we are one.       EMILY BALLOU, SOUTH ROYALTON HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       It is both a privilege and an honor to live in a nation      where I have the right to speak my mind without the fear of      failure or retribution, where liberty of expression is      celebrated, and diverging views, though challenged, are      entitled to develop according to their merit.       The greatest problem we have is that the people of our      country lack compassion. We lack empathy. We need to      integrate our passions instead of separating them. Love      should trump hate, but it seems as of late that that is      reversed. We must renew our nation, and to do so, we must      stop the ignorance of the public. We must end the bigoted,      chauvinistic, and discriminatory ideologies and mindsets of      our people.       What we have in common is more important than the      differences used to divide us. Groups of like-minded people      acting in a similar fashion are not a new phenomenon, but the      engagement of these groups has become dedicated to excluding      the expression of other views.       What makes a country great is not how rich the monetary      funds of the upper class is, but how well its most vulnerable      citizens are treated. This is why we must start early and      teach the next generation to kindness and to love.       When someone of power misuses his or her status to bully      those more vulnerable, their actions are desensitized. This      disrespect incites more discord which invites both fear and      hatred into the minds of all ages. The very young feel no      hatred. Currently, not all adolescents are being taught the      importance of tolerance and empathy in their homes, schools,      or in public. These lessons must begin in their earliest      years of schooling before they acquire biases from around      them and their beliefs are negatively impacted.       The vernacular must include words of kindness, not      derogatory terms or racially-charged slurs. No matter what an      individual's values are, they should not value the      discrimination and hatred associated with these words.      Silence is compliance. The cycle of history will continue to      repeat itself unless people begin to empathize with all. If      one wishes to ``Make America Great Again,'' hate should not      be the weapon of choice. We must be more inclusive and      accepting of the diversity in which this nation has prided      and built itself on, for change begins with ourselves.       Love does trump hate. Although we adhere to the flaws in      society, we must not. We must instill hope into those of the      coming generations. There is hope that our world will see      peace. There is hope that our world will be preserved. There      is hope for change. We are ``a nation of the people, by the      people, for the people that shall not perish from the      Earth,'' where people, no matter their race, religion, sexual      orientation, or gender, should take comfort in. We are the      great United States of America, and the day we forget that,      we will cease to exist, because despite current      circumstances, the world is not entirely lost if everyone      resists, together.         BILLY BENDER, HANOVER HIGH SCHOOL SOPHOMORE (FINALIST)       Mr Speaker, Mr Vice President, Members of the 115th      Congress and Distinguished Guests,       As Americans we face many difficulties, but two are of      particular concern: one is a challenge to our world, the      other to our republic. We can and must do more to stop global      warming, and we can and must get big money out of politics.       Climate Change is real. The scientific debate is over. We      have already begun to see its effects in the United      Large sections of the country have experienced severe      droughts and wildfires, hurricanes have been more violent,      and our summers are becoming dangerously hot in the south.      Internationally, long-term droughts are causing malnutrition,      threatening coastal cities, and creating climate refugees.      This is real, it is urgent, it is a direct result of the      actions of humans, and its impact will be felt      disproportionately by the most vulnerable peoples on our      planet. We caused it, and we can stop it. We have a      responsibility toward our children, our grandchildren, and      all of the future inhabitants of our planet.       Our government needs to invest heavily in large scale clean      energy infrastructure projects. We need to renew and add to      the existing subsidies on renewable energy to make solar or      wind a viable financial option for homeowners and businesses.      We need to invest heavily in clean energy research and stop      subsidizing fossil fuels. When renewables like solar, wind      and hydro power are cheaper than oil, then the massive oil      companies will have no choice but to become energy companies      instead of oil companies and build dams, wind farms and solar      fields. We will no longer have to tolerate the risks of      nuclear energy.       However, to achieve the goal of powering our nation with      renewable energy, we need to take the influence of huge,      anonymous donors out of American politics. Citizens United      has allowed huge corporations to funnel millions of dollars      into electing politicians who regard them favorably. The      fossil fuel industry is hugely profitable, and the      millionaires and billionaires who control them want to delay      and diminish the impact of renewables on their bottom line.      Their huge sums of money give them a massively      disproportionate voice in elections, allowing them to create      Super PACs which will ensure the continued existence of      dangerous, damaging practices like fracking.       Climate change is a critical problem facing our nation and      our world, but it will be difficult to take the bold steps      necessary to mitigate its effects without first eliminating      the advantage that billionaires have in our elections. It is      time to take large scale legislative and judicial steps to      eliminate the out sized voice of the extremely wealthy and      save our planet for all who come after us.     SIMON BUPP-CHICKERING, BELLOWS FALLS UNION HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR                                (FINALIST)        ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice      everywhere.''--Martin Luther King       A nation that neglects to confront and eliminate injustice      is no true defender of its people's rights. Due to the death      penalty's inherent inability to be more than state sponsored      revenge, its exorbitant cost, and the lack of statistical      evidence showing it does anything to stop murder, the death      penalty is an antiquated and medieval punishment that has no      place in a modern democracy.       One of the most common arguments brought up by proponents      of the death penalty is the idea that enforcing the death      penalty acts as a deterrent for other criminals. However,      this argument fails to account for the fact that the vast      majority of murderers aren't executed, less than one percent.      In addition, 88 percent of criminologists, experts who study      crime for a living, refute the idea that the death penalty      works as a deterrent. Furthermore, as the South accounts for      80 percent of all executions in the United States, if the      death penalty did act as deterrence, then those states would      have the lowest rates of murder. However, the South holds the      country's highest murder rate, and the North, which accounts      for less than 1 percent of the country's executions, has the      lowest murder rate.       The death penalty as it is practiced today is simply a tool      for revenge, misguidedly used in an attempt to help grieving      families. The finality of the punishment destroys any hope of      reflection, apology, or forgiveness, thus eliminating any      chance of true healing. Additionally, revenge is an emotional      response to tragedy, and the judicial system in America      should be about providing just and emotionally unbiased      decisions. Instead of perpetuating a cycle of violence, the      United States government should promote restorative justice,      which promotes rehabilitation and the improvement and      bettering society rather than resort to base human emotions      in response to tragedy.       In order to prevent this outdated and pointless practice of      state-funded murder from damaging our justice system any      further, the death penalty must be abolished nationwide, and      those on death role should have their sentences commuted to      life in prison without parole. In a modern, civilized      society, there is no place for such a horrific punishment.      Most other enlightened nations around the world have removed      the death penalty from their judicial systems. Instead of      remaining among the questionable company of nations such as      North Korea, America must prove that it understands the      egregious error in killing as punishment for killing.       Ultimately, the fact that the United States still uses the      death penalty reveals a fundamental lack of ethical maturity      in our nation, and is a mark of shame to Americans who want      to believe that the country they live in has evolved from the      barbaric practices of antiquity along with the rest of the      civilized world.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS393-2.txt,1010,"CARTER, JR., AND SHIRLEY ANN JACKSON",2017.0,23.0,January

Home to world-leading companies in technology, consumer      goods, pharmaceutical, and financial industries, the U.has      a gross domestic product of 18.56 trillion dollars. And yet,      poverty impacts people in both rural and urban areas who are      working for minimum wage, elderly people who must live on a      fixed income, and those who have lost their jobs. For a      country as rich and resourceful as ours, we have the ability      to solve the complex situation of poverty if we work together      as a nation to find a solution.[[Page S439]]       Despite all of our wealth, we still have nearly 15% of      people living below the poverty line. In 2016, the poverty      threshold for a family of four is $24,036 per year. These      individuals are forced to make difficult choices between      paying for food, medicine, heat, gas, or rent. Today we are      seeing increase in the loss of manufacturing jobs, causing      many additional people to become unemployed and drop below      the poverty line. We are losing these jobs due to      technological advances that have replaced a lot of workers,      while other jobs have been moved to lower-cost countries      because the labor to perform those jobs is much cheaper.      Another cause of long term poverty is the lack of access to      high-quality early education. In addition, children of      families in poverty do not consistently receive a college      education, and therefore, lack the skills and opportunities      to acquire a well-paying job in today's economy.       Poverty in America needs to be solved for every individual      to receive opportunities to live a quality life. There are      several political debates as to how we can most effectively      reduce poverty, and as a result, very little gets      accomplished toward achieving this goal and poverty continues      to be on the rise. The first step toward helping to lower      poverty rates is to create more jobs in The majority      of companies in the U.are small businesses. If the      government can help small businesses thrive, it can create      more jobs for those in poverty. By pulling families out of      poverty, it gives their children better opportunities to      receive a quality education, making it easier for them to get      jobs to support their future families. This can help to break      the vicious cycle of children being born into poverty without      any control over it. In addition, we need to make a basic      college education available and affordable to any citizen who      is willing to obtain one. Without addressing the fundamental      needs of education and jobs, the cycle of poverty in America      will not be resolved.       Our politicians need to recognize that poverty is a serious      problem, and must work together on common goals towards      defeating it. There are many solutions and sometimes there      will need to be compromises as to what the best solution may      be. If we do not solve this poverty problem, our nation will      continue to decline and overall living conditions will become      worse for a lot more people.    MASON CHARLEBOIS, VERGENNES UNION HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)       We do not live in a democracy anymore. We live in an      oligarchy obscured by the word democracy. For too long our      country, a nation established upon ideals of impeccable      freedoms and liberties, has discarded the will and      determination of the American people. The rich get richer      while the poor grow poorer and there seems to exist no hope,      no persistence, and no optimism in the people, but instead      there resides feelings of despair and anguish. Why would I      blame them? Today in our nation's capital, almost every bill      that is made, every law that is passed, every donation given      proclaims in a final respect, a refusal to aid the poor and      middle class of the United The loyalties, affairs,      and interests of our government no longer lie with the      American populace, but with immense multinational      corporations and the wealthy who value profit over people.       If you don't believe me, allow me to introduce some      daunting numbers. According to Inequality.org, ``Income      disparities have become so pronounced that America's top 10      percent now average nearly nine times as much income as the      bottom 90 percent.'' But wait, there's more. They also      mention ``Americans in the top I percent tower stunningly      higher. They average over 38 times more income than the      bottom 90 percent.'' Citizens of the United States, this is      the most critical issue of the century and possibly the      history of This is not something that can be      disregarded as irrelevant because this not only hurts you, it      hurts every aspect that makes this country for the people.       So, what can we, the American people, do to vanquish this      unjust society that we find ourselves giving in? First, we      start by establishing a tax on institutions that make more      than $1,000,000 a year. For years, these monarchs of trade      and commerce have sneaked through loopholes in legislation      and haven't been paying their taxes. This is unacceptable in      the country this great nation of Secondly, we      dissolve major institutions or establishments that are taking      advantage of Americans every single day. Wells Fargo, Capital      One and Citigroup are just some of the financial institutions      paying their fair share. Finally, it is vital for Americans      to be educated on these issues in the first place. That is      why I support a universal childcare schooling program where      no one will be denied access to education based on their      annual income. When we have an informed public, we will be      one step closer to ``the people's'' victory: your victory.       To close, I would like to introduce a quote from the late      Thomas Jefferson who said ``Experience demands that man is      the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply      no milder term to the general prey of the rich on the poor.''      Change never takes place from the top down. It takes place      when people, just like you and me, rise up in peaceful      protest and say we want a different We want change.          RAINBOW CHEN, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       The ``American Dream'' states that every American has the      opportunity to become successful if they work hard. In      reality, the American Dream is a blatant lie that falsely      guides citizens on an idealistic path. If our country truly      wants to make the American Dream a reality, we must provide      citizens with the opportunity to best change their lives: a      new education system. Education will help us give the poor      what they need, help vulnerable children from birth to five,      and create a meaningful life for our citizens.       Right now, a poor citizen has a slim chance of rising to      middle or upper-middle class. A study from the Pew Charitable      Trust says that 70% of lower income households stay in the      lower income bracket; only 30% rise to middle class or high-     income status. In 2015, nearly 48% of Americans live in low-     income and impoverished situations, including my own family.      Vermont may only have a 12% poverty rate, but disadvantages      in resources, opportunities, and financial support have      prevented me from reaching the same level of achievement and      opportunity as my middle class peers. We need to readjust      food stamp and welfare programs to support low-income      families. Educational opportunities for the poor must become      equitable so that low-income students can perform as well as      their middle-class peers. If education becomes equitable, we      may see more people working and fewer children suffering.       A study from Concordia University showed that ``. . . high-     quality education early in a child's life leads to continued      success later in school, at work . . . spending resources      toward education earlier in life is much more fiscally      responsible than paying later to help a struggling child      catch up.'' Our country tends to take early childhood for      granted, ignoring the benefits of early education. If we      increased paid maternity/paternity leave, children could      engage with their families for a longer part of their      childhood, helping them become the strong leaders of the      future throughout early education and their futures.       A flaw in the education system consistently prevents all      students from achieving their potential. Schools need to push      away from what a Purdue University study calls the      ``superchicken'' model, which studies the ``best chickens of      the coop''. This study showed that after separating the      superchickens from the normal chickens, the superchickens      pecked each other to death while the regular chickens proved      successful regardless of productivity rates. In our      educational system, we cannot place the ``smartest kids'' in      one system, as it will damage all children's education.       Overall, education must be changed. Everyone needs access      to learning opportunities, an equitable education for the      poor and the average, and revitalize public school funding to      ensure that all schools receive a fair share of distributed      money. Fixing education will allow America to fix poverty,      improve early childhood development, and allow more citizens      to reach the American As the best country in the      world, we need to create a possible dream, which means fixing      the broken rungs in society's ``ladder of success''.          JESSICA DAIGLE, OXBOW HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)       My fellow Americans, I have one question for you. How do      we, the United States of America, have the best economy in      the world, yet can't afford to give our people basic      necessities? We're one of the richest countries in the world,      but we can't feed our population, or give them healthcare?      Why are so many people living without a roof over their head?      We can't run from these problems; we must face them and find      a solution.       First and foremost, we must address our food problem. In      2015 alone, 42.2 million Americans lived in food insecure      households; 13.1 million were children. How are we supposed      to build a strong future if we can't feed our children? In      fact, one in five children are at risk of hunger. In Latino      and African American societies, it's one in three. This is an      urgent problem we must fix. We must stop throwing away edible      food and find a way to give it to those without. Every year      in the US, 40% of food is thrown away. This equates to $165      billion's worth. All of this uneaten food could feed 25      million In order to feed those in need, we must      stop wasting resources. We cannot keep throwing away      perfectly edible food.       Healthcare is another demanding issue. In 2014, 29 million      Americans didn't have health insurance; that's ten percent of      our population. And, in that 29 million, 4.5 million were      children. Those statistics are unacceptable. We must find a      solution. In 2010, President Obama tried with the Affordable      Care Act- commonly known as This worked well, as      20 million people were able to get insurance. Yet,      Presidential Elect Donald Trump wants to repeal it. If he      does, he must instate a new and more affordable healthcare      system. We cannot go without it. What would those 29 million      people do? They're relying on Obamacare, and can't afford to      be without it.       Homelessness is defined as a social crisis in the United      States today, as it should be, considering this fact: on any      given night, about half a million Americans experience      homelessness. Out of those people, 15% have been homeless for      over a year, 50% are over the age of fifty, and 8% are      veterans. Not to mention the 1.14 million veterans who are at      risk of homelessness. Again, we're one of the richest      countries in the world, yet we can't afford to house our      population? We can't house those who fought for our country,      for[[Page S440]]     our freedom? We must do something. We must create more safe      havens or emergency shelters. We can't allow so many      Americans to be living in such horrible conditions.       Clearly, these tasks will be difficult to take on. If we      want to boast about our prestigious economy and wealth, we      must first fix our problems with poverty in the lower class.      We cannot be considered an esteemed country until every last      one of us has food, healthcare, and a roof over our      heads.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS438-4.txt,1010,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,24.0,January
1294,topic-id,2455,"Mr.President, I ask to have printed in the Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont high school students as part of the seventh annual State of the Union essay contest conducted by my office.  The material follows:          KEELAN DURHAM, OXBOW HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN (FINALIST)       Climate change is the most important issue facing our      nation and the biggest challenge our world has ever faced. It      threatens us at the most immediate level--the very land,      water and air that we have called home for thousands of      years. Addressing climate change will require tremendous      policy shifts and changing massive amounts of infrastructure      that we have spent many years and billions of dollars making.      And it will require people and governments to collaborate at      a worldwide level. The United States is the richest most      powerful country in the world. We have achieved this position      in world politics by being a leading force in creating      prosperity and democracy around the world. However, by      achieving this, we have wreaked havoc on the environment at      the expense of the greater world. Now, we have a moral      obligation to to lead the world in implementing strong      policies toward a renewable future. If we fail to address      climate change, both our nation and nations around the globe      will suffer tremendous consequences. According to the      environmental protection agency's (EPA) ``Climate Impacts on      Coastal Areas'', Rising seas alone will cause the United      States to lose a projected 28,800 square miles of land. This      would submerge large parts of fourteen US cities, displace 25      million people, and destroy billions of dollars worth of real      estate. Rising seas would claim beautiful areas all along the      coast such as the beaches of Culebra the multimillion dollar      condos of Malibu or of the beautiful coast of      Outside the United States, small island countries that have      done very little to cause global warming could be wiped of      the face of the planet.       As the richest most powerful country with the oldest, and      arguably the strongest, democracy ever we need to take bold      action and implement strong policies to stop global warming.      There are many things the United States can do to address      climate change. We could put a price on carbon pollution;      this would create a disincentive to use oil and possibly hurt      oil companies profits. We could create strong incentives and      grants for renewable energy; this would make it easier and      cheaper for individuals and businesses to instal renewable      energy like solar or wind. A huge step forward would be to      ban coal mining and oil extractions from public lands--just      this would keep millions of tons of CO2 out of the      atmosphere and greatly help the environment. Merely stopping      all new gas and oil infrastructure in its tracks would be a      huge step in the fight against climate change. There is more      we can do but this would be a start.       Currently the United States has been doing very little to      combat global warming. The Paris Agreements were a step in      the right direction but oil companies still have many members      of congress working for them and with Donald Trump as      president progress will likely will be lost and not made.      This is why we must fight for this issue, and all issues that      we know are important. If we do this, we show the oil      companies and corrupt politicians that this government is for      ``we the people of the United States'' and not ``we the super      huge and super rich corporations of the United States''.      Together we can make huge progress towards a renewable energy      future and towards protecting our environment for future      generations.          MORGEN EDWARDS, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       My fellow Americans, our country spends more on training      men and women to go to war than what it does on training our      family members and our neighbors to come home. We spend more      money on the military as whole, than what we do our veterans.      Our veterans deserve more benefits through an increased      budget of ten percent, we must reform the VA, and help to put      an end to the 22 veterans who commit suicide a day. To help      put an end to veteran suicide rates, there should be funding      to create a separate organization to solely focus on the      mental health of our veterans, readjusting them to civilian      life, and acting as a twenty-four hour hotline to help      prevent veteran suicide. This should be comprised of experts,      and people who can adequately represent them when it comes to      congress and budgeting.       In order to save our veterans, we first must provide the VA      with a better budget, in order for the VA to provide veterans      with access to benefits. The projected budget for the      president to spend on the VA as of 2017 is 182.3 billion      dollars, and according to the VA this is a ``4.9% increase      over the 2016 enacted level.'' If we increase the budget by      ten percent to start out, than the VA could have more money      to provide our veterans with better benefits, thus helping to      cut down on wait times by employing more qualified      individuals, while helping to provide more options for care      and help to the men and women who need it. According to      Military times ``The average wait time across the system as      of May 15 was 6.89 days for primary care, 10.15 days for      specialty care and 4.4 days for mental health appointments,      according to the report.'' Wait times should be no more than      three to four days, and if at all possible we should try      cutting that down even more, to ensure the safety of our      veterans.       We must train our veterans on how to readjust to civilian      life, help them to find and maintain jobs, help them find      housing and teach them about PTSD and mental health      awareness. We must train them to not be afraid to speak out      about their mental health. Most importantly, we must not send      them away when they seek help, telling them to ``just forget      about it.'' If we have the means to train them to go to war,      than we must take those same means but apply it to training      them to come home. No longer should we send of veterans home      to fend for themselves. If we have the resources to send them      to boot camp to go to war than we have the resources to send      them to boot camp to come home. We should try and expand the      Wounded Warriors Project, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of      America, and American Veterans and their efforts to provide      transition programs.[[Page S488]]         REBECCA GREEN, JOHNSBURY ACADEMY SOPHOMORE (FINALIST)       I believe that one of the most pressing issues that is      facing our nation today is the conservative movement to      remove federal funding from Planned I think that      this is very important, because Planned Parenthood clinics      are key providers not only of family planning services, but      also preventative care, and other important health care      services for low income women and families, and therefore,      defunding this organization would negatively impact access to      healthcare in these vulnerable socioeconomic groups.       The movement to defund Planned Parenthood is centered      primarily on ideological and political reasons surrounding      the pro-life movement and their argument that tax dollars      should not be allowed to support organizations that provide      abortions. Yet, Planned Parenthood data demonstrated that      only 3% of their budget goes to fund abortion, with the rest      of their funds going to contraceptive services (31%), testing      and treatment of STD's (45%), other women's health care      services (14%), and screening and prevention of cancer (7%).      According to a report from the Guttmacher Institute, in 2014,      Planned Parenthood prevented 2.2 million unintended      pregnancies and averted many cases of sexual transmitted      diseases, and cervical and breast cancer through screening      PAP smears and mammograms and HPV tests and vaccinations,      resulting in a net public savings of $13.6 billion, or $7.09      for every public dollar spent. Defunding Planned Parenthood      clinics could therefore have a significant negative impact on      both these health benefits and the health care savings that      come from their services.       An example of the effects of this movement to defund      Planned Parenthood can be seen in the case of Texas, where      cutting federal funding to this organization led to closure      of more than 80 clinics and deprived thousands of low-income      women of highly effective contraceptive methods, resulting in      a drastic increase in the rate of births covered by       In conclusion, Planned Parenthood has created a nationwide      network of clinics that provide a wide breadth of services to      low income women and families who often fall in the gap      between Medicaid and insurance coverage. Efforts to defund      this organization would deprive this vulnerable socio-     economic group from important health care services, and cause      profound negative impact, not just on preventative care and      overall women's health, but on state and national health care      spending.          ABIGAIL HALNON, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       My fellow Americans, I am humbled and thrilled to be your      president. I believe that the American people are generous,      insightful, and accepting. Our nation gains its power,      strength, and beauty from its diversity. We strive, as a      nation, to be an international leader in perpetuating ideals      of freedom and equality. It is my concern that there are many      acts in this country that violate these fundamental beliefs.       It is important that the United States is a country      recognized as a pioneer of social justice on a worldwide      stage. It is our moral duty to uphold the highest standards      of equality and acceptance. We have made great steps towards      this in recent years. The landmark Supreme Court decision in      2015 of Obergefell v. Hodges upheld the fundamental right to      marry, regardless of sex. We must further prove our nation's      belief in freedom and opportunity by the legislation that we      pass. There is progress yet to be made.       Currently, practicing conversion therapy on gay and      bisexual Americans is widely permitted across the U.This      is a process under which non-heterosexual people are      subjected to various means to reverse their sexual      orientation. Conversion therapy, based on a scientifically      discredited premise, must see an immediate ban. It permits      the means to punish and abuse innocent The vast      majority of these victims are minors. This practice      perpetuates a false and violent belief system that      homosexuality is a mental disease and that a cure must be      sought. It is an obscene violation of the basic human rights      of gay, lesbian, and bisexual It should not be      permitted by law.       Although it receives little public support, only 5 states      have banned conversion therapy on minors. These acts of hate      and misinformation must be outlawed nationwide. It is an      injustice and a crime to subject torture on Americans, most      often minors, who have committed no offense. An immediate      country-wide ban must take place.       We must work to defy all accounts of prejudice based on      sexual orientation and gender identity. The freedom and      mobility of transgender and nonbinary Americans is severely      limited. Their rights and protection are being eroded by      current legislation. A recent law in North Carolina known as      the ``bathroom bill'' allows regulation of bathroom access      for transgender individuals. Legislation that regulates      bathroom use by transgender Americans is an act of hate and      tragic misinformation. Rates of violence or misconduct by      transgender individuals in bathrooms are so unprecedented      that there are virtually no statistics on it. There is no      need for regulation. These laws must immediately be struck      down. These are basic and necessary rights and they must not      be infringed upon. Discriminatory acts based on sexuality and      gender identity have implications outside of their specific      goals. The use of U.law to marginalize any group      perpetuates dangerous and violent beliefs. Our      misunderstanding cannot become rejection. Our fear cannot      manifest into anger.       Americans will not stand for the perpetuation of hate,      fear, and misinformation. We will not reject our neighbors      and our friends. Our country must make these necessary steps      towards true equality.   KARLEY ZIER, MISSISQUOI VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)       Raising the price of minimum wage would benefit everyone      differently, but all in a commendable way. This would give      people on government assistance more of an incentive to      secure a job. It would keep the average family of four from      drowning in debt just to buy groceries for the week.      According to Sherrod Brown, Senator of Ohio, ``Anyone who's      tried to pay a heating bill, fill a prescription, or simply      buy groceries knows all too well that the current minimum      wage does not cut the mustard.'' Sherrod explains exactly how      tough it is to try and survive off from the ongoing minimum      wage price.       Minimum wage in Vermont should be raised for a multitude of      reasons. One way the state could benefit from this would be      the amount of people withdrawing from welfare and other      government funded programs. The state could benefit from this      act because unemployed rates would go down with more people      applying for jobs. Families living off of minimum wage have      barely enough money to meet their basic needs per week or per      month. Someone making minimum wage at $9.60 an hour for eight      hours a day and five days a week will earn $384. Therefore,      one will make $1,536 per month without any taxes being taken      out. According to USA Today, the average cost of groceries      per week for a family of four is $150-$200. The average cost      of rent in Vermont is $900 per month. Being left with $436,      which would be non-existent due to taxes, leaves no room to      pay for other needs or necessities. People wouldn't have      money to pay for phone bills, transportation expenses, or      daycare because one would be working. Someone would not be      able to pay for any of these necessities because of the fact      they wouldn't be able to afford them living off of minimum      wage.       People who are using government assistance programs could      benefit from this because there would be a reason for them to      want to work. If people make the same amount off of welfare      as they are making while working a forty hour job each week,      of course they are going to choose welfare, or other      government assistance programs. There is no incentive for the      people on welfare to want to get a job with the minimum wage      being so low and having to pay for expenses they wouldn't      need to pay for while being unemployed. The other people in      the state could benefit from this by the amount of people      withdrawing from the welfare program. The more people who      withdraw from the system, the less tax money that one say to      pay to fund these types of programs. Overall, those are the      reasons why the minimum wage in Vermont should be      raised.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS487.txt,1010,A RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS AND NEW DEAL FOR,2017.0,30.0,January
1733,topic-id,2460,"Mr.President, I ask to have printed in the Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont high school students as part of the seventh annual State of the Union essay contest conducted by my office.  The material follows:   ZOE HOULIHAN, NORTH COUNTRY UNION HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN (FINALIST)       When you think of America, do you think of McDonald's, big      cities, high-tech phones and computers, or do you think about      violence, fear, and hatred amongst people? Although America      seems like a great place full of opportunities and freedom,      it is quite the opposite if you are not a white, straight,      cisgendered male. There are many problems in America that      need to be fixed.       Racism has been ongoing for hundreds of years. Blacks,      Hispanics and many other[[Page S538]]     non-white groups have faced discrimination and hatred because      of the color of their skin. Blacks are thought as more      violent and lazy than whites. African Americans now      constitute 1 million of the 2.3 million imprisoned      population. They are also incarcerated at six times the rate      of whites. NAACP says that 5 times as many whites are using      drugs as Blacks, but they are being sent to prison at 10      times the rate of whites. Moreover, Blacks are getting shot      at higher rate than whites. Although more whites are getting      shot, there are about 160 million more white people than      there are black people. While Whites make up 49% of those      fatally shot by police officers, Blacks make up 24%, despite      only being 13% of the US population. More than 250 blacks      were killed in 2016. Furthermore, 47% of hate crimes have to      do with race. Racism is such a big problem in America it's      hard to say what an effective solution would be. One solution      to this could be to get media stars that are POC to talk      about racism. This could cause their fan base (which can be      quite large) to change their ideas about African      Another solution is to educate people on racism. Teaching      young children in school about how racism started could      lessen the number of people in each generation that feel      negatively about people of color. Lastly, the government      should make the policies about racism in schools and      workplaces stricter. Telling kids ``That is not appropriate''      when they make a racist comment isn't doing anything. People      need to be punished for making these comments because if they      aren't it makes it seem like it isn't a big deal.       Another problem in America is sexism and sexual assault.      Sexism makes it harder for women to get jobs and be well-off      in life. According to the Huffington Post, well-off white men      are three times more likely than women to be offered a job      interview. Moreover, women that work 41-44 hours per week      earn 84.6% of what a man working that same time would earn.      Women that work more than 60 hours a week earn only 78.3% of      what a man would earn. Similarly, in the House of      Representatives only 19.3% are women, and in the Senate only      20% are women. In addition, when a woman claims to have been      sexually assaulted, men usually blame the women. They ask      what they were wearing, how ``revealing'' it was, and if they      were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. One in four      women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime. Also,      683,000 adult women are forcibly raped each year. This is      equal to 56,916 per month, 1,871 per day and 78 per hour. One      solution to women not getting payed as much as men could be      to make a policy that both women and men are to be paid      equally. Furthermore, a solution to sexual assault is to      teach kids about consent and to give longer sentences to      people that have committed sexual assault. Another solution      to sexism is to have more women representation in media and      politics. This could help eliminate the thought that women      are only made to have children, clean and cook. It would also      give young girls more role models to look up to.       Finally, the last issue that needs to be fixed is hate and      discrimination against the LGBT+ community. According to an      analysis of data collected by the FBI, lesbian, gay,      bisexual, and transgender people are the most likely targets      of hate crimes. An example of a hate crime against the LGBT+      community is the Orlando nightclub shooting. 49 were killed      and at least 53 were injured. This shooting is considered the      worst mass shooting in the United States and the nation's      worst terrorist attack since 9/11. Additionally, LGBT+ people      experience discrimination in the workforce. They actually      have a higher unemployment rate than African Americans (15%      versus 12%). People of color that are also apart of the LGBT+      community face the most discrimination. A solution to this      problem could be to educate young children about the      different sexualities and explain that it's okay to feel      attracted to whomever. Another solution is to create policies      that would help protect people in the LGBT+ community.      Lastly, there should be stricter rules about when a teacher      hears a homophobic comment. Many kids say ``That's so gay''      when something that they don't like happens and i could make      other kids feel unsafe.       In conclusion, America has many issues with equal rights      that need to be fixed. One of the main solutions to every      problem is education. When people are educated, they can use      their knowledge to base their opinions off instead of going      with what the popular opinion is or what they are hearing      around them.        GRAHAM JANSON, MONTPELIER HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)       Whenever you ask someone the question, ``What is the most      pressing issue facing our nation today?'' you will most      likely get a different answer every time. An environmentalist      might say, ``Carbon emissions and global warming.'' A      conservative activist might say, ``The increasing national      debt.'' There are many answers to this question. But there is      only one answer that addresses an issue that lies at the      center of our nation's existence. That answer is that the      fundamental democratic principles on which the United States      is based are being eroded by voter suppression and      gerrymandering.       Efforts to suppress voting rights for many people have been      around since the Constitution was adopted as the supreme law      of the land, when only property-owning white men could vote.      We have come a long way since then, with African Americans,      Native Americans, and American women gaining the right to      vote, but we still have a long way to go. Similar to during      Reconstruction, when literacy tests were used to deny African      Americans the right to vote, a now-overturned North Carolina      voter ID law was in effect that, according to the federal      appeals court that dealt with the case, deliberately      ``target[ed] African-Americans'' in an attempt to suppress      their voter turnout. Other states, such as Ohio, Kansas, and      North Carolina, have had voter ID laws that have been      overturned after being ruled discriminatory by a federal      appeals court. The overturning of these laws is already a      step in the right direction. A way to address voter-     suppression efforts is to require a federal court review for      every voter ID law to make sure that there is no      discrimination or infringement of American rights. Another      way is to restore the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of      1965.       Additionally, the repeal of some of the key aspects of the      Voting Rights Act in 2013, which allowed nine states to alter      their election laws without the approval of the federal      government, demonstrates how gerrymandered elections can      serve to undermine basic democratic principles.      Gerrymandering involves altering the areas of electoral      districts to favor one party or another, and both Democratic      and Republican politicians have engaged in gerrymandering in      the past. There have been many cases in which a political      candidate has won an election because of gerrymandering. This      clearly undermines our nation's democratic principles because      now a candidate can carry the minority of an electorate and      win an election, and it needs to change now. Furthermore,      because these same elected officials appoint and confirm      federal judges, voter suppression and gerrymandering can also      undermine the judiciary's vital role in protecting democratic      voting rights.       In conclusion, the restoration of equal voting rights and      the elimination of gerrymandering would allow the United      States to remain a true democracy. Indeed, the other pressing      issues that face our nation today, such as global warming,      economic development, immigration, healthcare, and      gender equity, cannot be fairly addressed while our nation      continues to utilize this flawed system that does not      reflect democratic values.   IRA RICHARDSON, BELLOWS FALLS UNION HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       When George Washington delivered his farewell address, he      stated that ``The alternate domination of one faction over      another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party      dissension . . . is itself a frightful despotism.'' Our first      and only president who was not a member of a political party      attempted to warn us of the threats they can pose to      democracy. Today, however, the Democratic and Republican      parties have become so powerful that one can hardly imagine      the American democratic system without them. In a sense, this      is one of the sources of their overbearing power: many      Americans see them as an intrinsic part of our democracy      rather than two organizations that were created long after      the union to organize like-minded voters. Political parties      are not inherently bad, but a system which creates a forced      dichotomy by only giving voters two realistic choices for any      given position has unquestionable negative effects on our      nation. Firstly, it forces citizens who care deeply about      specific issues to routinely vote for candidates whom they      may not agree with in any other capacity so as to not violate      their personal moral code. This, in turn, allows parties to      cynically align themselves with these single-issue voters to      win their votes without truly sharing their values.      Additionally, two diametrically opposed political parties      give rise to an us-versus-them mentality among citizens,      eroding the mutual trust that is intrinsic in the formation      of a nation.       To reduce the near-hegemonic power that the parties      currently hold, it is imperative to make it more clear to the      American public that both parties are private organizations,      operating within their own processes and promoting goals that      are not necessarily those of their constituents. The      intention is not to cause Americans to stop supporting the      party they belong to, but rather not to follow any party      blindly, and to understand their complex histories and role      in American democracy. Another step towards a system in which      people could more consistently vote for politicians they      truly support would be the implementation of an instant run-     off (aka alternate or ranked) voting system. In such a      system, a voter does not select a single candidate to receive      a position, but rather ranks the order in which they support      each candidate. If no candidate has over fifty percent of the      vote, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and      every citizen who selected them has their votes moved to      their next choice, and the votes are tallied again. This      process is repeated until a candidate has a majority. This      alternative would allow people to vote their conscience      without fear of handing the election to a candidate on the      opposite side of the political spectrum. It would not destroy      the existing political parties (which would be destabilizing)      but rather allow third-party and independent candidates to      speak for portions of the population who cannot identify with      either existing party. By reducing the power of the two major      parties, the environment necessary to address the many      problems facing America could be created.[[Page S539]]       JULIA STERGAS, BELLOWS FREE ACADEMY FAIRFAX SENIOR (FINALIST)       Nearly 260 years ago our country endured a war over the      rights of our states and the rights of its peoples. From this      war came the first legislation to protect African Americans      living in the United One-hundred years later, our      country faced another revolution, resulting in new      legislation that enhanced the ability for African Americans      to participate in political and social life. Since then, many      Americans have believed that racial equality has been      achieved.       But here we are, fifty years later, struggling through yet      another conflict over the divide between black and white.      Tensions are high between African Americans and white      authority figures in the United Distrust and anxiety      separates black Americans from their government and onlooking      citizens. In 2014, Michael Brown was shot and killed by a      police officer in Ferguson, That same year, a      barrage of negative media emerged from an originally peaceful      protest in Baltimore, Maryland, depicting unlawful rioters      who looted and set fire to business, injuring six police      officers. Now, we continue to watch video clips on nightly      news highlighting the struggle between black and white.      Through this our attention has been distracted from the true      cause of continued racial conflict: the lack of recent      successful intervention.       White authority figures are perpetually distrusted by the      black community, and groups such as Black Lives Matter still      believe inherent biases against African Americans are      abundant in society. We must rebuild this connection. To      achieve comprehensive change we must redirect our nation's      path. The first step toward action is awareness. This issue      must be introduced into schools, universities, and community      centers. If we can enlighten young adults they will share      their knowledge and work to obtain equality nationwide.       Educators would lead discussions on current and historic      racial tensions in a non-partisan, open environment. Focusing      on historic and current events and their social and political      ramifications, these open debates would promote civic      engagement and thoughtful problem solving. Prompts regarding      the government's involvement and the responsibilities it      should assume, the action we as the nation's youth should      assume, and opportunities to develop individual solutions      would be considered during discussion. Our young population      is critical to the future of our nation, so it is necessary      that we provide them with opportunities to immerse themselves      in their political and social world.       Today's generation and the ones to follow will be our      leaders and our visionaries. Incorporating awareness into      education programs would introduce these leaders to the      nuances of the world they will come to inspire, and allow      them to develop an understanding of their political efficacy.      Raising consciousness of this racial strain would encourage      young leaders to take charge of their futures, and ours, and      incite change. It is critical to the well being of our nation      that we cultivate a generation of educated young adults who      possess the skills to maneuver themselves in their political      and social world. Addressing our nation's imperfection and      coaching our youth will only be the start to a nationwide      revolution of change and acceptance.

1601,topic-id,1566,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for the way that, on a nightly basis, he comes down to the well and helps inform people. Jefferson, in the writings of our Founding Fathers, talked about how important it was to have an informed electorate.  I just really appreciate the way the gentleman gives people clarity and information that they can then digest and make their decisions with. That process of informing is, I think, a vital part of the politic. He does it on the daily basis, and I appreciate it. His doing so matters to me and to the people that I represent.  I appreciate so much the gentleman's yielding because I want to talk just a couple of minutes about a bill that I introduced today entitled the REAL ID Privacy Protection  It is a bipartisan bill. It is supported from the Republican side by people like Mark It is supported on the Democratic side by Democrats like Chellie Pingree from I think they do so because it is a commonsense bill that gets at some of the deficiencies that one can find in REAL  Quite specifically, what it does is eliminate the requirement that your personal documentation and documents be held and archived, in essence,[[Page H807]]in warehouses for 10 years. It will not require your stuff to be out in government databases for 10 years. Secondly, it eliminates the requirement that the DMV databases be co-linked. Thirdly, it creates uniformity with regard to the way in which extensions are granted.  So the bottom line is your driver's license could still be used to get you in the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort or it could be used to go into Joint Base Charleston or a whole host of other facilities around this country. More significantly, for the average flying public, you could still use your driver's license next year to be able to get on a plane in the United States of  Why is all this important?  It is important because individual privacy matters. It is important because equal treatment under the law matters. It is important because the 10th Amendment really matters. States have a role in which the Founding Fathers intended the Federal Government to fit with the State government, to fit with local government, and to fit with individual prerogative.  Now let's examine each one of those couple of things. One, if you look at South Carolina driver's licenses, just as an example, they are secure. We have holograms. We have barcodes. We have a whole host of different things that create security.  Yet, in the wake of 9/11, what the Federal Government, Homeland Security, and others decided at that time was that, in essence, what they wanted was a de facto national ID card and for the Federal Government to, in essence, federalize what had previously been a State function, with State's issuing driver's licenses.  There is not a Federal driver's license. Texas has driver's licenses, South Carolina has driver's licenses, Florida has driver's licenses. Each State may have a little bit different way of doing so, but it was a state prerogative.  In the wake of that Federal requirement--I was wearing a different hat at the time; I was wearing a Governor's hat--I joined with, for instance, Governor Schweitzer from Montana in saying: Wait, this doesn't make sense. The States still have a vital role here. This role does not need to be federalized. We pushed back and, long story short, we were successful with many others in that effort. Yet, what is happening is many of those deadline requirements are now reemerging and approaching.  The question we have to ask ourselves in Congress is: What are we going to do about it? Are we going to push back again? Or are we going to try and slow this again? Or are we just going to let the Federal Government come in and steamroll what has been a State function?  I think it is important that we act, and that is why we introduced this bill. It, again, gets at three important things. One, privacy matters. Quite simply, if government doesn't need your stuff, they don't get your stuff. I think that is a simple premise. Again, let me say it again. If government really doesn't need your stuff, it shouldn't get your stuff.  What do I mean by that?  What I mean is, if the requirement, as is now the case, is that the Federal Government take your personal information and they archive it for the next 10 years, do you really feel that you are more secure?  I would argue that is not at all the case. I would argue that it is much better to have a system that, when you take your birth certificate, you take your marriage license, you take your divorce papers, you take your citizenship papers, whatever it is that you have, take it all, let folks at the government level decide whether you are who you are or whether you are not who you are, and then give your stuff back to you. They don't need to house it for the next 10 years.  That is all this bill does. If you house it for the next 10 years, in fact, there is a considerable cost. The unfunded mandate to States is $17 billion.  So what we are saying is make the determination. Take, again, all your stuff, look at it, but then give it back, rather than requiring States to archive this stuff for the next 10 years.  It also matters because, again, of individual human privacy. Whether it is a divorce decree, whether it is a marriage license, whether it is citizenship papers, whatever it is, we have been in hearings over the last couple of weeks where it was proven that the Russians were quite involved in hacking of American databases.  Why do we want to open that up to Chinese hackers, Russian hackers, to whoever it is, if it isn't required and necessary from the standpoint of security?  Two, this bill simply gets at the notion that States matter. The 10th Amendment matters. Patton was once attributed with saying that, if you tell a soldier to take a hill, tell them to take the hill. Don't tell them how to attack the hill.  The same is true of the Federal Government as it relates to Give us a secured requirement, but then allow Texas to go about their way of taking the hill and South Carolina to come with its way of attacking the hill, as long as we take the hill, which is the necessary security requirement.  I think it is also important from the standpoint of security that one thing we have learned over time is that centralization of data does not make data more secure. We have a host of different breaches that have occurred at the Federal level that prove this point.  I think that one of the things that is interesting about Pearl Harbor is that the boats were in one spot and it was one-stop shopping for the So, in fact, what we have seen in terms of military strategy going forward is people spread assets out. They don't want them congregated all in one spot so that an attacker would be able to take down a multitude of different assets with one particular raid. I think the same is true in the information age, as it relates to databases.  Finally, this bill is about equal treatment under the law. I think that what many States--South Carolina would be among them--are concerned about is: Is this too subjective? If you happen to be a blue State versus a red State, does that have some degree of determination in the way in which you get an extension or you don't get an extension?                              {time}  1830  Eighteen States and territories have been granted extensions. Seven States have been granted very limited extensions. All this bill does is say, Let's make that process transparent so that States can look one to the other and say, How was it that you got an extension but I didn't? I think that that level of uniformity would make sure that nobody suspects this system of being arbitrary or capricious by nature.  That is in simple form what the bill does. Again, it is about your privacy. We have had a long debate over the course of our country on security versus freedom, and what we don't want to do is give up certain, in essence, soul conditions, if you will, for freedom, including this notion of federalism, in our efforts to be secure. It is about recognizing that States are not wards of the Federal government, that a $7 billion unfunded liability really does matter to the taxpayers of different Finally, it is about equal treatment under the law.  Again, the bill is called the REAL ID Privacy Protection I would ask Members to join us on that bill. I would ask folks out there listening to talk to their House Member about that bill because I think it is one that makes a whole lot of sense.  I would say, again, how much I appreciate the gentleman from Texas yielding. Most of all, I thank him for the way he comes down to the well on such a regular basis to inform the American public.

66,topic-id,2087,"Mr.President, in just a few minutes we are going to vote on a bill that probably will not get a lot of attention in No cable news shows are going to give it breaking alerts, headlines. Roundtables of pundits will not be gathering to scream about it, and partisans are not going to score the bill.  It is a straightforward bill with a straightforward purpose--to ensure that the Government Accountability Office can tap into the data at the Department of Health and Human But in this case, looks can be deceiving. The GAO Oversight and Access Act of 2017, which I introduced together with Senator Tester 1 year ago, represents a significant victory for taxpayers.  Its impact won't be felt tomorrow in Washington, but over many years to come, taxpayers from Nebraska and across the country will see how passing this legislation played a role in forcing Congress to address some of the biggest problems that our government faces. Let's step back for a moment and understand why. What is the problem?  The Federal Government has a very serious budget problem. This isn't news to anyone who has been paying attention. It is not even something about which Democrats and Republicans disagree. We may not often agree on solutions, but we can and should agree to clearly identify the problems that the government and, therefore, our people face. Some of the problems are very big--so big, in fact, that it is hard to even wrap our minds around how large the numbers are, like the fact that last year this government spent $587 billion more than all it collected in taxes. Consider how big $587 billion is.  National defense is the first and fundamental reason that the Federal Government exists. Last year we spent $595 billion on all of our national security or in the entire defense budget. When Ronald Reagan was sworn into office, the entire Federal budget was $590 billion. Now that is what we are borrowing annually.  Or look at it this way. Historically, the amount we borrowed last year was bigger than every Federal budget for the first 160 years of the Nation--combined. That is, if you added up every dollar that the government spent from 1789 through 1950, it would still be less than the $587 billion that we overspent and therefore borrowed just last year. The former number got us through the Civil War, two world wars, and the Great  Some of our problems are actually relatively small, but they ultimately add up to something big. Just look at some of the stuff Senator Flake dug up in this year's ``Wastebook'' report or what Senator Lankford put in his report this year entitled ``Federal Fumbles.'' The Commerce Department gave $1.7 million to the National Comedy Museum to resurrect dead comedians using holograms. Also, $70,000 of our taxpayers' money went to a Minnesota theater to put together an opera of Steven King's ``The Shining.'' And $17,000 was spent for people to wear fat suits to learn sensitivity to those with weight problems. These things are tiny individually, but when you put them together, they add up to a lot of our budget.  Expert after expert testifies before our committees that this is unsustainable. We all know this cannot go on forever. At some point, the government's borrowing and overspending ways will catch up with us and we will have a Greek-style debt crisis.  Congress needs to begin acting now to fix the government's structural problems--chiefly in the entitlement programs, for those are the spending categories whose trajectories dwarf all others.  All of this gets to the central problem that the bill we are considering this afternoon was designed to solve--namely, that Congress is flying blind when it comes to overseeing huge portions of our budget, and therefore we don't have the information we need to fix these problems.  The portion in particular I have in mind is the means-tested entitlement programs and the tax credits program. These include Medicaid; the earned-income tax credit, or EITC; the Supplemental Security Income--or disability--Program; food stamps; and Pell grants. All of these were designed to assist our low-income friends and neighbors. All of them together absorb a significant part of today's Federal budget.  As of right now, $1 in every $6 we spend is on only 10 means-tested programs and tax credits like the ones just listed, according to the CBO, but because of an anomaly in the law, Congress has been blocked from getting the best information that is available about how these programs are actually working or not working. What do I mean by that? For years, the Government Accountability Office--the GAO, the agency that is supposed to be the taxpayers' watchdog because it is supposed to hunt down waste and expose[[Page S334]]abuses--has been trying to gain access to a database at the Department of Health and Human Services called the National Directory of New The new hires database was created in 1996 to help enforce child support payments, and in order to do that, it collected some basic information--basically, who has a job, where they work, whom they work for, and how much they make.  The GAO's interest in this data should be pretty obvious. If it could compare the information in the database to the information in the means-tested programs, it could easily spot fraud, waste, and mismanagement. For instance, if a program's rules say that to qualify for benefits, a person needs to earn less than a certain amount of income annually, GAO would be able to use the database to see if the program is actually operating as designed and then issue reports to This is exactly the kind of thing that the GAO does across all other Federal programs and that Congress routinely uses the GAO for--to take their recommendations to figure out how we should reform programs that are failing. Only in this case, HHS has blocked the GAO from accessing the database.  Again, these are the biggest categories of Federal spending. The place the GAO has not been able to do its work is in the places where we are spending the most money. It is classic Washington--bureaucracy blocking oversight for taxpayers. It is not always malicious, but this is definitely wrong.  HHS has argued that when Congress created the new hires database, it didn't expressly give the GAO permission to look at this data, and so its hands are tied. GAO countered that Congress had previously given blanket permission to the GAO to access all Federal records many years prior.  Many in Congress believed that the law was clear and that GAO is entitled to this entitlement data under the law, but HHS has refused to budge, and the argument stalemated. The result has been the status quo, with GAO repeatedly requesting data and HHS steadfastly refusing to grant them access to the data, which means they have refused to grant us access to the data.  The GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017 was introduced to settle this legal dispute between GAO and HHS once and for all in GAO's favor or, better, in the taxpayers' favor. In short, today's bill ensures that the GAO will have full access to the data in the national directory. By doing so, it will ensure for the first time that GAO has a key tool it needs to oversee some of the government's largest spending categories.  This bill does two additional things as well. 1, it clarifies that GAO does have standing in court to fight for Federal records the next time a Federal agency tries to deny the GAO--and therefore us--access to that data; and 2, it requires the GAO to let all relevant congressional committees know when it issues reports in their jurisdiction.  We are now on the doorstep of hopefully passing this legislation today, which has rightly gotten a lot of support in When it passes the Senate tonight, it will head straight to the President's desk for figure. Last year, it passed the House by a vote of 403 to 0, and the only reason it failed to pass the Senate was because of an anonymous hold.  In response, the House of Representatives took up this legislation as one of its first pieces of business and sent it over to the Senate 2 weeks ago, on January 4, moving just as quickly. It is a pleasure that the Presiding Officer today happens to be the chairman of the relevant committee that moved so quickly. Chairman Johnson and his new ranking member, Claire McCaskill, immediately took up this legislation and moved it through the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, for both the chairman--the Presiding Officer today--and Senator McCaskill, the champions of oversight of the I thank the Presiding Officer, the chairman of the committee, for his leadership.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill tonight. It is appropriate that one of the first bills of this new Congress will be one to strengthen the authority of the GAO because by strengthening the powers of the GAO, what we are really doing is strengthening the  There has been lots of talk around here on both sides of the aisle about the needs to reclaim Congress's article I power. Across the 240 years of this Nation--or 226 years since the Constitution; 227 as I do the math here in my head--the Congress is at a fairly weak point in history, and we should be strengthening the article I branch of the  One obvious important way to strengthen the powers of the Congress and therefore the accountability that we all have to the American people is by doing better oversight. Conducting hard-hitting but fair oversight of the executive branch agencies is how we protect the separation of powers, and it is how we guard the taxpayers' funds, how we guard the wallet of the people. It is the Congress's job to write the laws and to control the purse strings, and it is the President's job to faithfully execute the laws. Good oversight gives the Congress the information we need to do our job and to ensure that the executive agencies are doing theirs. There is no better friend of the Congress in this regard than the Government Accountability GAO is not simply another agency of a big government; the GAO is a part of the legislative branch, and it works hard to give Congress world-class insights into the operations of the other two branches. GAO is thorough, independent, and respected for its judgments by people of either party and no party at all.  I am deeply proud to see that Senator Tester has joined us on the floor, for he and I were the original sponsors of this bill. It is a pleasure that tonight we will be giving the GAO the tools it needs for oversight and therefore for our oversight.  It would only be natural, at the start of a new administration and a change of party in the executive branch, for Democrats to become more interested in oversight and Republicans to become less so. May that not be the case. I am hopeful that oversight will remain a top priority for Members on both sides of the aisle. None of us came here to be partisan cheerleaders. We came here to exercise the functions of this office on behalf of the people in our States and across this It is therefore encouraging tonight, even as a new administration is about to begin in 3 days, that Congress will be asserting its constitutional right to oversight with a big bipartisan vote.  I want to thank my partner on the bill, Jon Tester of Montana, who will speak next. When we first heard about this issue together during briefings and committee hearings, we immediately realized that something was wrong, that the GAO had been handcuffed and not able to access this data, and we committed to each other to make sure something was done about it.

322,topic-id,655,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding and for managing the time here.  I bring forward this FCC Consolidated Reporting Act because this is a bill that focuses on streamlining government. It focuses on really establishing and identifying areas where we need to improve competition in the telecommunications marketplace and make recommendations to Congress that can help us make better policy for the country. At the same time, we are eliminating a lot of unnecessary reports that are currently burdening not only the people who are out there creating jobs but also the FCC by having eight different reports that are required annually to be filed and to be evaluated by the FCC at disparate times throughout the year, to consolidate all that into one report, one report that focuses on the entire telecommunications marketplace on a biennial basis. That report would come in at the end of the 2-year period so that each new Congress would be presented with very relevant and much more timely information that would help each Congress evaluate if changes and reforms need to be made to the law.  What laws am I talking about, Mr.Speaker? I am talking about in the current marketplace some of these various disparate reports where you might have throughout the year a requirement where a report has to look just at the satellite industry or a report looks just at the cable industry or a report looks just at the landline industry. Mr.Speaker, as we know, all of these industries now compete against each other, and whether you are getting your telecommunications data at home, through a cable, through fiber, through satellite, on your mobile device, it is all ultimately the same content that people are consuming, and all of these companies are competing against each other.  It is not like in the old days where you just had telephone lines and the telephone companies would compete against each other, and then cable companies would compete against each other. Now it is a consolidated marketplace, and it is time that we get all these disparate reports that are outdated and bring them all into one place.  When you look at what this means, they say time is money, and so when all of these reports are required by Federal law, where all of these different entities have to put together reports and a lot of times create documents, paperwork that is unnecessary, that is outdated, that doesn't really reflect what is happening in the marketplace, that is time that they can better spend creating jobs, Mr.It is time they can better spend reinvesting so that we can have better broadband as consumers, families across the country that use all of this great telecommunications infrastructure. Let's focus more on competing and creating a better marketplace.  Something else this bill does is get rid of some outdated laws, Mr.Do you know there is still a requirement in Federal law, that we get rid of in this bill, that there is a requirement every year that there has to be a telegraph report that studies competition in the telegraph industry. Mr.Speaker, this might have been useful back in 1934 when Congress mandated it. You can go back to the 1830s when Samuel Morse invented the telegraph, but we don't really need to be spending time and legal requirements that there be a report filed annually on competition in the telegraph industry. We get rid of that in this bill.  So often we hear from people around the country, when Congress is contemplating new laws, when are they going to get rid of some of the old laws that are unnecessary on the books? We actually do that in this bill. This has bipartisan support. It is a commonsense piece of legislation that actually streamlines government and focuses on helping increase competition for families across this country.  I urge adoption of this piece of legislation.  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH586.txt,1892,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 38, DISAPPROVING A RULE",2017.0,23.0,January

665,topic-id,576,"Madam Speaker, I rise to offer the motion to recommit on H.7, the so-called No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure  The motion to recommit is very simple. It would amend H.7 to say that nothing in this legislation would allow an insurance company to charge women higher premiums than men just because they are women.  In the first few days of the Trump Presidency, we have seen one action after another to discriminate against women, restrict access to health services, and make their care more expensive. We also know that Republicans are determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would, once again, allow insurance companies to discriminate against women.  Repealing the ACA would be a triple whammy for women. Not only would they have to pay more for their insurance, but their insurance would be less likely to cover the services they need. And these higher costs will take a bigger chunk out of their budget.  Before the ACA, insurers were able to exclude services critical to women's health. And we are not just talking about preexisting conditions, which, by the way, often included having a baby or being the victim of domestic violence.  The benefit package itself left out medical care critical to women. Only 12 percent of plans in the individual market offered maternity coverage. And some insurance plans that offered that coverage imposed waiting periods of a year or charges of up to $10,000 just for maternity care. And even when maternity care was excluded from any insurance plan, insurers still used gender rating to discriminate against women, charging women more just because they were women, regardless of their benefits. Being a woman was a preexisting condition.  Thankfully, the ACA prohibits gender rating. Before the ACA, women were forced to pay between 10 to 57 percent more than men for essentially the same insurance. In my home State of Illinois, women were charged 55 percent more than men for the same coverage. In fact, a 2012 National Women's Law Center study found that 92 percent of best-selling insurance plans were gender rated.  A 25-year-old woman in Arkansas was charged 81 percent more than a man for similar coverage. A 40-year-old woman in South Dakota was charged over $1,200 more a year than a 40-year-old man for the same coverage. In Kentucky, women were charged 57 percent more than men for the same coverage. In Texas, they were charged 56 percent more. In Indiana, they were charged 54 percent more. And the list goes on.  This study even found that over half of all insurance plans charged women who didn't smoke significantly higher premiums than men of the same age who did smoke. Overall, gender rating cost American women about $1 billion a year. It also harmed businesses with predominantly female employees who were routinely charged more for their insurance coverage.  Finally, charging women more for health care is even more devastating when you take into account that women still make only 77 cents to the dollar compared to men. We cannot go back to the days when insurance companies were free to discriminate against women. But that is exactly what Republicans want to do. They want women to pay more for insurance coverage that doesn't include the services they need.  So I am asking my colleagues to support the motion to recommit and protect women from discrimination by insurance companies.  I yield back the balance of my time.

73,topic-id,1482,"Mr.President, having Scott Pruitt in charge of the EPA is bad for the air we breathe and the water we drink, and it is bad for American leadership on climate. It is not just that I have a different view from Mr.Pruitt on the Environmental Protection Agency, it is that he has made a career out of undermining the Clean Air and Clean Water It is not just that he is a Republican or that he doesn't share my views about clean energy.  Look, I understand that when a Republican administration comes in, their EPA nominee is going to have a different view of what the Agency ought to be doing. I am not suggesting that we are going to get Henry Waxman or Jeff Merkley to run the That is not what is going on here. Here is what it is, and I want people to listen carefully.  Scott Pruitt is a professional climate denier. That is his job. He has made his political bones trying to shred the EPA's ability to enforce the laws that protect clean air and clean water. The core mission of the EPA is to safeguard public health by enforcing the laws on the books, and the cornerstones of the EPA's authorities are the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water These laws were passed over 40 years ago with huge bipartisan majorities, and they have been extremely successful.  It is especially important for the dozens of young people watching C-SPAN right now to understand that the state of the environment in the late 1960s was catastrophic, like out of a science fiction movie. Even for those of us who were around, it is a good reminder of what the EPA has accomplished over the decades.  The Cuyahoga River in Ohio was so polluted that it caught on fire. Lake Erie was so polluted that almost nothing could live in it. Bacteria levels in the Hudson River were 170 times above levels that could be considered safe. Raw sewage was directly discharged into rivers and streams where children swam. The FDA found that 87 percent of U.swordfish contained so much mercury that they were unfit for human consumption. Then the Clean Water Act was passed. We made incredible progress in the last 44 years. We still have a long way to go, as about one-third of our waterways are not yet fishable and swimmable, as the law requires.  Scott Pruitt's opposition to the Clean Water Act and EPA makes me terrified that we could go back to the bad old days of water pollution. EPA's enforcement of the Clean Air Act is an even bigger success story. This law has saved millions of lives and improved the health of millions of others. EPA's enforcement of the law has reduced air pollution by 70 percent since 1970. Smog levels in L.have fallen two-thirds since their peak. Lead in the air is down 98 percent, carbon monoxide down 85 percent, sulfur dioxide down 80 percent. Acid rain is down over 50 percent and at a fraction of the anticipated cost. But this progress is in real jeopardy.  As the Oklahoma attorney general and as the head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, he dismantled the unit in his office charged with enforcing Federal environmental laws and stood up a unit to undermine Federal environmental law. He led the opposition to the Clean Power He sued the Federal Government over a dozen times to prevent the implementation of rules that would protect our health and our environment. What he does is fight the That is his thing.  As Oklahoma attorney general, he literally--I am not making this up--he literally copied and pasted a letter from a major oil company onto his official State attorney general letterhead and then sent it to the EPA as though it were his own.  I have never met Mr.Pruitt--and I assume he is personally a good guy--so I will say it like this: A person who works so closely with industries that[[Page S336]]pollute our air and water is an unusually bad fit to run the Never before in the history of the EPA has a President nominated someone so opposed to the EPA to run it, and on the most significant environmental challenge of our generation, he is aggressively wrong. He has said that the climate debate is ``far from settled'' and that ``scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connections to the actions of mankind.'' This, of course, is nuts. The climate debate is settled and has been for some time. More than 97 percent of climate scientists agree that the climate is changing and that humans are responsible. Ask a scientist, ask a farmer, ask a fisherman, ask a skier or snowboarder. If you don't believe 97 percent of scientists, will you at least believe your own eyes?  His position even puts him at odds with the Department of Defense, which has called climate change a ``threat multiplier.'' Here is the good news. We are actually making a lot of progress in clean energy, almost all of it in the private sector. The cost of solar power has dropped by 60 percent in the last 10 years and more new solar capacity was added in 2016 than any other energy source. Wind power was by far the largest source added to the grid in 2015. Clean energy generation grew by about 20 percent in the last year, and the long-term extensions of the renewable energy tax credits give us hope to think that kind of trajectory can be sustained. This comes at a time when public concern about climate change is at an alltime high, and with three-quarters of Americans, including half of Republicans, supporting Federal efforts to reduce carbon pollution.  This progress is fragile, and confirming Scott Pruitt can undermine our momentum. Again, here is Mr.Pruitt in his own words about the Clean Power Plan: ``The EPA does not possess the authority under the Clean Air Act to accomplish what it proposes in the unlawful Clean Power Plant.'' This is flat wrong.  Let me quickly explain a lawsuit called Massachusetts v. The Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to regulate air pollution and carbon pollution as a pollutant so it is not only that the EPA may regulate greenhouse gas emissions, under the Clean Air Act they are actually required to do so. Mr.Pruitt has bragged that he ``led the charge with repeated notices and subsequent lawsuits against the U.Environmental Protection Agency.''  On climate change, he has said:       Is it truly manmade or is it just simply another period of      time when the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? Is it      just typical, natural type of occurrences as opposed [to]      what the administration says?  I cannot think of a person more ill-suited to run this  On clean energy, the Chinese are leading. Mexico is leading. Europe is leading, Germany, The question isn't whether the clean energy revolution will occur, the question is whether we will lead it or get left in the dust.  This is where we are. A nominee who does not understand the vital role of clean air, clean water, and protecting the environment has been nominated to lead the EPA, who denies decades of scientific research.  To my Republican colleagues, I have had many encouraging, rational conversations about climate with you but almost exclusively in private. I say this. This vote is the litmus test, the one your grandkids will ask you about. I know being in the Senate is about making choices--and lots of times it is great--but this issue, this vote is absolutely simple: Don't vote for a climate denier. You cannot dabble in conservation or energy efficiency or vote for a budget amendment recognizing the scientific consensus on climate change and then vote yes on this nominee. If you say you are not a climate denier, this is the point in your career when you get to prove it. If we find another nominee, even one who hates the Clean Power Plan, who shares your view on federalism, who shares your view about the United Nations, about President Obama, that is fair, that is fine, but this nominee is out of bounds.  Please, consult your voters, your university experts, talk to your kids. It is their planet. It is their future--or consult with your own conscience.  I know sometimes politics is complicated and the right thing to do is not that easy to determine in the fog of the battle. This is not one of those times. For future generations, for the planet, for the future of the Republican Party, you have to get this one right.

985,topic-id,605,"Mr.President, more than 50 years ago, when Medicaid was[[Page S457]]created, Congress made a smart decision. Lawmakers designed a program so that if health care costs rise, if the economy starts to struggle, Medicaid would be there for the American people, no matter what.  A couple of days ago, the counselor to the President said that, as part of the replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid will be converted to block grants. Let's be clear about what this means.  People like grants, and they like Maybe they are not sure about whether they like block grants. Whether intentional or not, this kind of technocratic, bureaucratic language can trick people. It sounds fine. Maybe it is even the smart thing to do.  Let me be totally explicit about what block granting Medicaid actually means. It means cutting It means less money for It means less health care for people. It is a euphemism. It is not quite a lie, but it is a way of describing something so that you don't know exactly what it is. They are calling it a block grant because they don't want to say that they are cutting  These cuts are going to hurt millions of people. They will hurt working families who rely on Medicaid to pay for nursing home care for their families. We have to be pretty out of touch to not know anyone who at some point in their life will rely on nursing home subsidies from It is happening in my extended family right now.  It is important to remember that Medicaid certainly helps children. Medicaid certainly helps people who are economically disadvantaged. It helps poor people. But it also helps middle-class families, because at the end of a family member's life, who can pay for nursing home care out-of-pocket? You may have saved all of your life, but, for instance, in Hawaii a nursing home costs around $10,000 a month. So it is a rare family who can pay $10,000 a month for a grandmother or a great-grandmother or a father or a mother. Nobody can do that. This is going to harm middle-class families.  It is also going to hurt women in particular. Women need Medicaid for maternal health services and for family planning. These cuts are going to hurt seniors and people with disabilities. These people have nowhere else to turn. That is the point of Medicaid is their only option.  Now, I have heard some people say: Well, this is going to expand local control. That is preposterous. The truth is that block granting Medicaid, which is the same thing as cutting Medicaid and giving a fixed amount to the States, gives States less control, not more control. They force States to choose between seniors and kids, between people with disabilities and women, or between health care and education.  Look, it does not matter whom you voted for. American voters--left, right, and center--have this sense that what we do in Washington is that we run for office saying one thing and then we get in office and we do exactly the opposite. Frankly, the Congress has earned that reputation. This is another instance where a party has promised to not cut Medicaid, but here we are--week 1, day 5--debating cuts on this important program.  This is a deal breaker for me and many of my colleagues, and it will be a disaster for millions of  I call on everyone on both sides of the aisle to stand up for seniors, to stand up for women, to stand up for children, and to fight any cuts to  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS456-7.txt,2173,1415,2017.0,24.0,January

First, zero people from the countries on the ban list have been involved in terrorist attacks in Zero people from the countries on the ban list have been involved in terrorist attacks on It is almost as though the criteria for picking the countries is something other than the threat of terrorism.  Second, this ban has the potential to strengthen violent extremist groups by playing right into their hands. It encourages everyone to be afraid of people we don't know from other places. That is not America, and it will not work.  When President Gerald Ford repealed the Executive order interning Japanese Americans, he asked citizens across the country to make a pledge. He said: ``I call upon the American people to affirm with me this American promise--that we have learned from the tragedy of that long-ago experience forever to treasure liberty and justice for each individual American, and resolve that this kind of action shall never again be repeated.''  That promise is being broken. It is broken for the American who came to this country as a lost boy from Sudan and who now cannot see his family. It is broken for the American married to an Iranian, whom the government is splitting from her husband. It is broken for the millions of Americans, the majority of us, who want us always to have the moral high ground.  The world is watching. History is watching. We have to ask ourselves: What do they see? Do they see Lady Liberty or do they see something darker? The choice is ours. We can fix this.  We start by following the wise words of Fred Korematsu, an outspoken voice against Japanese internment and an American hero who was born 98 years ago today.  He said: ``Protest, but not with violence, and don't be afraid to speak up.''  Today I call on every Member of the Senate to follow Mr.Korematsu's advice.

Secretary Henry Kissinger laid the groundwork for peace between Egypt and And forgive me for using such a recent example, but Secretary John Kerry helped to bring the international community together to tackle climate change.  As our Nation's top diplomat, the Secretary of State is the highest ranking cabinet member and the President's top adviser on U.foreign policy.  The Secretary balances relationships with some 180 countries and is responsible for tens of thousands of Americans working at more than 250 posts around the world.  In other words, it takes a remarkable knowledge base and skill set to be Secretary of State, particularly as the United States takes on a complex and complicated set of issues. At the top of the list is climate change. The global changes we have seen in the climate are affecting almost every part of the world, from droughts in Sub-Saharan Africa to rising sea levels in parts of  We have also not seen this level of refugees and migrants since after World War The Rohingya, Syrians, Afghans, Guatemalans, and many others are fleeing war, violence, persecution, and instability. Globalization and technology have disrupted economies, leaving governments, companies, and workers trying to figure out how to keep up with the times without being left behind. Terrorism and violent extremism haunt parts of the globe, from the Middle East to Europe, and to our own borders.  The Secretary of State has to take on all of these challenges and do it in a way that advances U.interests and values. After reviewing his record and his testimony before the Senate, I am not satisfied that Rex Tillerson is the right person to lead the State On each of these criteria--views, knowledge base, and skills--I have concerns about his nomination at this point in the process.  First, I am not satisfied with Mr.Tillerson's views. There has been a clear consensus among both parties on the foundation of U.foreign policy. Throughout the confirmation process, however, Mr.Tillerson indicated that his views did not necessarily align with that consensus. During discussions on international human rights, the hearing record shows that Mr.Tillerson was vague about oppressive governments, extrajudicial killings, and the bombing of hospitals. He demurred when given the opportunity to rule out a Muslim registry, a concept that is anathema to American values, and yet this administration is dangerously close to implementing one.  Perhaps most concerning were Mr.Tillerson's views on I don't need to be the umpteenth person to list the many, many concerns we have about a country that is not America's ally. For decades, there has been bipartisan consensus about U.relations with Russia, and I am uncomfortable with confirming a Secretary of State who does not share that bipartisan view.  Secondly, I am not satisfied that Mr.Tillerson has the knowledge base to lead U.diplomacy. His vision for the State Department seemed to confuse the roles of the Department of State and the Department of During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Tillerson responded to a question on the South China Sea, but his answer focused on military solutions instead of the long list of diplomatic options which we should first explore.  That is not to say a Secretary of State can't recommend military solutions. There is certainly a long history of the State Department doing just that, but it should always be as a last resort. It always comes after a long pursuit of peace through diplomacy.  Finally, I am not satisfied that Mr.Tillerson will be able to translate the considerable skills he has from ExxonMobil to the State His long career at Exxon is certainly impressive, but it is the only international job on his resume, and let's be clear, the company's record does not at all align with U.foreign policy, from accusations related to human rights abuses to Exxon's business operations in countries that are not friendly to the United I am not arguing that this makes Mr.Tillerson a bad person. As the CEO of a big company, he had his own imperatives and his own obligations, and I understand and respect that. But it is not enough to say that I used to care only about ExxonMobil's interests, but now I only care about the U.interests.  The next leader of the State Department will have to argue for our values and our priorities with friends and adversaries alike. He or she will need to balance business interests with national security and with American values. I approach this nomination process with an open mind, but Mr.Tillerson's confirmation hearing left me with too many doubts about his views, his knowledge set, and his abilities. I will be voting no on his nomination.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

It is outrageous that today, more than four decades later, President Trump and my Republican colleagues have made restricting choice their first order of business.  Yesterday, President Trump signed an executive order banning health organizations that receive U.funding from even mentioning abortion as a medical option for their patients. And today, this House is launching a radical assault on women's health care that penalizes women and small businesses that choose private health insurance plans that cover abortion services.  The effect of these unprecedented restrictions is clear: restricting the comprehensive health coverage available for women.  Terminating a pregnancy is a personal choice that should be a woman's alone, made in consultation with her family and her physician. Politicians have no role in this process.

33,topic-id,460,"Finally, Mr.President, I wish to turn to the CBO report that just came out today. The Congressional Budget Office today released a new report outlining the consequences of the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Remember, the CBO is a nonpartisan entity. The numbers don't lie. Try as they might, our Republican colleagues can't discredit them.  The numbers are even worse than experts could have imagined. Repealing the Affordable Care Act will mean tens of millions will lose their health insurance and individuals will see their premiums double. Let me repeat that. If the Republican bill passes--according to CBO, which is nonpartisan--tens of millions will lose their health insurance and individuals will see premiums double. Thirty-two million Americans would lose their health insurance, 18 million within the first year of repeal.  The report makes it crystal clear that the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act will increase health care costs for millions of Americans and kick millions more off their health insurance. No wonder President-Elect Trump realizes repeal without replace is the real disaster. No wonder he has admonished the Congress not to do plain repeal.  Some Republicans have tried to dismiss the CBO report as meaningless. I would remind my Republican friends of two points. First, this is the CBO Director that Republicans handpicked. This is not some Democratic operative. He is a person who knows numbers, who was chosen by our Republican colleagues. You can't reject his findings.  Second, this is your repeal bill that the CBO is analyzing. They didn't make up the scenario. They took the exact bill we had on the floor and said: What are going to be the consequences? Devastating--over 30 million losing coverage, premiums doubling. All the things that our colleagues are complaining about with ACA are even worse under their bill. Their complaints on ACA are incorrect. We have gained numbers, and costs have gone down. The rate of costs have gone down--much lower than they would be under this report.  I say to my colleagues, this is your repeal bill. The CBO didn't make this up. It looked at the bill you sent to the President's desk, the bill you say your repeal bill will be modeled on. It isn't meaningless. It is your plan.  Now that repeal is real and not just a political exercise, the tide is turning. The American people are becoming roused by the prospects of dismantling health reform and leaving chaos in its wake. This is exactly why Republican Members of Congress are getting an earful back home from constituents who want them to turn back from their dangerous plan to make America sick again. I urge my Republican colleagues to listen to the growing outcry before it is too late.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS324-2.txt,1036,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

As I have mentioned here on the floor several times, we Democrats want the process to be as fair and transparent as possible, abiding by all the ethics requirements demanded of nominees in the past. Yet the HELP Committee today will hold a hearing on Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos, who is worth $5 billion and owns an investment company with untold financial entanglements, despite the fact that she doesn't have a signed ethics agreement in place. When somebody has such wealth and such complicated holdings, we have always made them sign an ethics agreement that says ``Here is how I am going to divest so there is no conflict of interest,'' so it is clear that the nominee is doing things for their country, not for their financial holdings. We don't have it, and we are rushing ahead with hearings in the HELP My dear friend whom I have so much respect for, the chair, the Senator from Tennessee, is just rushing forward, rushing forward.

37,topic-id,547,"Mr.President, I wish to address a troubling report about the President-elect's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services that came out last night. We learned that Congressman Price bought shares in a medical device manufacturing company just days before introducing legislation in the House that would directly benefit that company.  His legislation wasn't broad legislation. It didn't affect health care in general. It specifically blocked a regulation on medical device companies that do hip and knee implants, including the very business he bought stock in. According to CNN, the company Representative Price bought stock in was one of two companies that would have been hardest hit by this new regulation--one of two--and he puts in legislation to repeal it just after buying stock in it.  Again, this is not someone who has Johnson & Johnson stock and then votes to cut This is a narrow company that works on hip and knee implants--narrow legislation that deals with undoing some regulations on them. It is really troubling.  These revelations come on top of the report late last year by CQ and the Wall Street Journal that Congressman Price had traded stocks in dozens of health care companies valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars during his time in the House as chair on the Budget Committee, when he introduced, sponsored, or cosponsored several pieces of legislation that impacted these companies.  Yesterday's report makes it clear that this isn't just a couple of questionable trades but, rather, a clear and troubling pattern of Congressman Price trading stock and using his office to benefit the companies in which he was investing.  Our President-elect claims he wants to drain the swamp, but Congressman Price has spent his career filling it up. I have asked the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate whether or not Congressman Price violated the STOCK Act during his time in office before his nomination moves forward in any way.  It may well be that this trade was illegal. This isn't a witch hunt. These are serious and disquieting allegations. The American people deserve to know if their potential Secretary of Health and Human Services violated a law against insider trading in  The facts here are a narrow company with hip and knee implants and legislation with hip and knee implants coming soon thereafter, after he bought stock--whoa. These questions cry out for answers before--let me underline ``before''--Nominee Price goes before the Senate Finance  When the public faith in government is as low as it is today, when politics and campaigns are saturated by money, as they are today, when folks feel their representatives are beholden to special interests before their constituents, reports like the one that just came out about Congressman Price perpetuate that distrust. They add fuel to the fire.  We need to get to the bottom of these allegations and get to the bottom of them quickly. The only way to restore faith in our government and in our most important democratic institutions is to insist upon transparency and ethical behavior by those in positions of the highest public trust.

For working-class Americans, struggling Americans, now it is harder for them[[Page S349]]to get amortgage. What did he do? He reversed a recent decision by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to reduce annualinsurance premiums that many borrowers pay, saving new homeowners an average of $500 per year. What a terrible thing to do tohomeowners. President Trump, with a flick of the pen, ended that new policy, making it harder for Americans of modest means toobtain their piece of the rock, the American dream: their own home. It took only an hour after his positive words on theinaugural platform for his words to ring hollow. And actions speak louder than words. One hour after talking about helpingworking people and ending the cabal in Washington that hurts people, he signs a regulation that makes it more expensive for newhomeowners to buy mortgages--1 hour later.

423,topic-id,488,"Mr.President, I would like to discuss five topics this afternoon: the President's remarks this weekend and the lack of Republican reaction to them, his Executive order on Friday about mortgage rates, the continuing nominations process here, the President's withdrawal from TPP, and the Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act that was announced this morning.  First, the need for Republicans to speak out when President Trump engages in the kind of rhetoric he engaged in this weekend. The first few days of the new administration are traditionally a time for an incoming President to call for unity and to try and bring the country together. Instead, President Trump kicked off a bizarre first weekend in office that alternated between braggadocio and furor. The President quarreled over the size of inaugural crowds, bragged about his election victory in a speech at CIA headquarters, with a wall commemorating fallen American intelligence officers behind him, and then sent his Press Secretary out to hold an emergency briefing to present ``alternative facts,'' as one of President Trump's advisers described them yesterday, about the size of the crowds again.  Whatever your politics, in order to debate, argue, compromise, and get things done for the American people, we have to be able to agree on a base line of facts. Facts aren't partisan. They don't have alternatives. The alternative to fact is fiction. If this Presidency is going to be based on ignoring the facts on the ground, we are going to have huge problems. It is not that important when you are talking about the number of people who attended an inauguration, but what about the facts if Russia is doing something that is very bad or something terrible is happening to our economy or something else? If the Presidency looks away from the real facts, we have trouble. You cannot govern a country like that.  So if the White House is ignoring the facts on the ground and is willing to make up ``alternative facts'' about crowd size, what else are they willing to stretch the truth about? National security? What Vladimir Putin is up to? The implications are terrifying.  A White House that presents alternative facts needs to be called out for doing so by both parties. The folks who can really help rein in the President are the members of his own party who have a special responsibility to do so, but they have been silent, totally silent when President Trump has been saying and doing things they know are wrong. They should be speaking out for the good of the country.  I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to help us hold the President and his White House accountable for the truth; otherwise this country is going to have a lot of trouble. Whether you are a Democrat, Republican, liberal or conservative, you cannot ignore the facts and govern and move the country forward.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS368-3.txt,1036,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7, NO TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABORTION",2017.0,23.0,January

President Trump said in his inaugural address that ``for too long a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.'' He promised to combat that trend, but only 1 hour later--1 hour after that speech--in one of his first acts as President, President Trump made it harder for average Americans to afford a mortgage by reversing a recent decision by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to reduce annual insurance premiums that many borrowers pay, saving homeowners about $500 a year. These are young families just starting out. They want part of the American dream--a home. There is no need to raise their mortgage rates, which is what was done 1 hour after those populist words were delivered on the steps of the Yes, it only took 1 hour for those populist words delivered on the steps of the Capitol to ring hollow. Actions speak louder than words.  So I will just say this.

Totally different, I would say to my good friend the majority leader, than what happened when President Obama took office. As I said, our constitutional duty to advise and consent does not mean ramming through nominees. Here are three instances, just new ones. They pile up. Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson did not adequately respond to our questions for the record, and a number of Democrats still await more complete responses.

I worked, frankly, with the nominee for Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, and with many others to try and get both President Bush and President Obama to label China a currency manipulator. It didn't happen, unfortunately. But President Trump promised that he was going to do it on his first day in office, and it has not happened.

841,topic-id,849,"Mr.President, according to President Trump's words, yesterday--not Friday--was his first official day in office. It is an important distinction because throughout the campaign, President Trump made numerous promises about what he would do on his first day. So we went through them. Turns out he made upwards of 30 promises of Executive actions or plans that he would announce on day 1. This didn't require any congressional approval; he could just announce it. Even by a generous count, the President fulfilled only two or three of them. Let me mention just a few of the important omissions.[[Page S408]]  The President campaigned against both establishments, promising to oppose elites and the powerful in Washington, ``to drain the swamp.'' He campaigned against the Democratic establishment, but he also campaigned against the Republican establishment. As a result, he explicitly promised to introduce an 18-point plan for ethics reform on day 1. How did he do on that? He promised to sign a 5-year ban on lobbying after officials worked in Congress or the White House, but he did not deliver. He promised to institute a lifetime ban on White House officials from lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, but he did not deliver. He promised to put in place a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections, but again he did not deliver.  On day 1, did President Trump fulfill his pledge to bring ethics reform to Washington? In fact, looking at his ``swamp Cabinet''--stacked with billionaires and bankers with myriad conflicts of interests--he may have already lowered the ethical standards in our government.  On trade--this is an issue where I am probably closer to the views of the President's than I was to either President Obama's or President Bush's, but it seems President Trump is again failing to deliver on his day 1 promises. He promised over and over again--it was one of the few things he said in the campaign I really liked. He said he was going to label China a currency manipulator on his first day. But he did not deliver. Instead, he issued an Executive action withdrawing from the  Everyone knew the TPP was dead in the water a month or two ago. Leader McConnell would not bring it up on the floor of the Senate because he did not have the votes. Furthermore, saying we won't do TPP, which is not in effect anyway, isn't creating a single new job.  So there is something else he could have done--his promise: On day 1, label China a currency manipulator. China is propping up their currency at the moment. They do whatever is best for China even if it hurts American jobs and American workers over and over again. You can be sure they will continue manipulating their currency when it is in their best interest to do so. You can be sure, even when they move up the currency, they are manipulating it.  Guess who I worked with on the issue of currency manipulation. Attorney General nominee, then-Senator Jeff He and I were partners in this, and many others. On our side, Senator Brown and Senator Stabenow were allies. On their side, Senator Graham and Senator Collins were allies. It was a broad bipartisan coalition. And we were opposed, frankly, by both President Bush and President But here we have President He promised to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. We are still waiting.  Last night at the White House, I mentioned this to the He didn't say no. I am not going to say what he said. He didn't say no. Maybe he will do it. I hope and pray he does. We await real action on trade, one of the President's signature issues. It is another promise not fulfilled.  There are many promises President Trump made during the campaign that we are glad he is not keeping, to be honest with you, but the bottom line is, there is a giant gulf between what the President says he is going to do and what he actually does. His rhetoric does not match reality. That is becoming clearer each day. Just look at what happened on Friday, inauguration day, which perfectly sums up my point. The President gave an inaugural address arguing that for too long Washington has reaped the rewards of government, while the people have suffered. Then, an hour later, the President took an Executive action that made it harder for Americans to afford a mortgage, even though Washington could certainly have afforded to give them a tax break. We are seeing a pattern emerge. President Trump is using populist rhetoric to cover up a hard-right agenda.  In short, actions speak louder than words. If day 1 is any indication, the grandiose promises this President made to the working men and women of America seem to be just a hall of mirrors.  I yield the floor.

1239,topic-id,867,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon, like much of America, angry and perturbed but in resolute opposition to the President's Executive order issued on This Executive order was mean-spirited and un-It made us less secure. It put our troops in the field at increased risk. It was implemented in a way that caused chaos and confusion across the country. It must be reversed immediately. Let me give three reasons why.  First, it ought to be reversed because it will not make us safer, as the President argues. It will make us less safe.  The President's Executive order targeted seven Muslim-majority countries. Not one terrorist attack has been perpetrated on U.soil by a refugee from one of these countries--not one. Moreover, it could alienate and inflame the communities we need most in the fight against terrorism.  As my friend Republican Senator John McCain noted, it could increase the small number of lone wolves, which pose the greatest threat of terrorism. Both the San Bernardino and Orlando attacks were done by lone wolves, American citizens importuned by the evil This rule would have nothing to do with that.  As my friend John McCain has noted, it could increase the small number of lone wolves, which pose the greatest threat of terrorism. As both Senators McCain and Graham expressed yesterday, this order is a valuable propaganda tool for We saw that happen today. They predicted it yesterday, McCain and It happened today. They want nothing more than to paint the United States as a country at war with all of This order feeds right into the perception ISIS and other extremists want to create. The bottom line is, the policy will make us less safe, not more safe.  Second, while there is no way to defend the order, it was poorly constructed and even more poorly executed. The order was signed into effect without the consultation of the Federal agencies that are responsible for enforcing it: the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, or the Department of State, and possibly others.  People across America saw utter chaos and confusion that resulted in our airports over the weekend. The people in charge of implementing it weren't even told about it. Folks were caught in detention at airports around the country, young children separated from their mothers, husbands from their wives, green card holders and legal residents being denied the right to see an attorney. Some folks were pressured into signing away their permanent legal status. We are looking into that right now.  It raises serious doubts about the competence--the basic competence--of the new administration when such an important order is so poorly vetted and executed, just like some of their Cabinet nominations. Such a far-reaching and impactful Executive order should have gotten extreme vetting. Instead, it was rushed through without much thought or deliberation. I could not disagree more with the intention behind the order, but the haphazard and[[Page S463]]completely incompetent way in which it was implemented made matters even worse.  Third, and most important of all, the order should be reversed because it is un-We are a nation founded by the descendants of asylum seekers, a nation that has been constantly invigorated, replenished, and driven forward by immigrants, many millions of whom came under duress, seeking a new birth of freedom in The ability to find refuge from persecution, whether based on one's religion or race or political views, goes to the very foundation of the country, starting with the Pilgrims and Plymouth The Executive order is antithetical to everything we are about.  President Trump seems to want people to believe that all immigrants are terrorists or criminals, but when you meet immigrants, you see they are not the face of terrorism; they are families just like ours. Yesterday I met two. They were at my office. Mr.Hameed, an Iraqi refugee, worked at a local university department in English literature and, because he loved our country and what we were trying to do, he chose to use his language skills to be a translator for American soldiers in He worked as a translator for the U.Army in Iraq for 10 years. He endured death threats and harassment to himself and to his family because he was helping us and our soldiers. So he began the refugee process about 2 years ago.  He arrived on January 5. If Donald Trump had been inaugurated on January 1 and enacted his order 6 weeks sooner, Mr.Hameed would have had to stay in His life would have been threatened for cooperating with our military.  What kind of message does this send to the untold millions of people just like Mr.Hameed throughout the Muslim world who today will be less likely to work for and with our great country?  Then I met the Elias family. They were a different type. They have four children. They arrived here a month ago. Their journey to the United States began 5 years ago from war-torn After surviving the brutal civil war, where suicide bombs had been blowing up in front of their house, they were finally reunited with their family in the You see, the driving force that brought them here were two American citizens, their grandparents.

The implication was that he wouldn't support a proposal that would in any way alienate and inflame them. He said he didn't think it was helpful to suggest that Americans should be afraid of That would suggest he might be wary about a policy that explicitly singles out seven majority-Muslim countries for different treatment under U.policy.  Now, many of the comments Mr.Tillerson made to the committee are at odds with the President's policy. So Democrats and Republicans alike and the American people, most of all, deserve to know whether Mr.Tillerson would implement this Executive order or not because it seems to directly contradict comments he made under oath to a Senate committee. Key allies around the world are wondering whether the potential future Secretary of State supports this policy, and so are the American people.  Here are some important questions: Did he have any involvement or consultation in the construction or drafting of the Executive order? How would he answer the outcries from countries around the world that are asking that President Trump rethink this policy? Does he think it would make us less safe? Does he think it would alienate moderate Muslim communities in the United States and around the world? And does he believe current green card holders should be subjected to another round of scrutiny if they come back to the United States, even though they have been vetted before?  We need these answers from President Trump's nominees, and Mr.Tillerson's nomination is before the Senate right now, so it is imperative that we know what he thinks before moving forward.  So, Mr.President, I am making two unanimous consent requests.  First, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senator Feinstein's bill, 240, introduced earlier today; that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be considered read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; finally, that there be no amendments, motions, or points of order in order to the bill.

1284,topic-id,1406,"Mr.President, so we have had a number, a large number of eloquent speeches about the President's Executive order. While they were going on, of course, we had a Monday night massacre. Sally Yates, a person of great integrity, who follows the law, was fired by the She was fired because she would not enact, pursue, the Executive order on the belief that it was illegal, perhaps unconstitutional.  It was a profile in courage. It was a brave act and the right act. I hope the President and his people who are in the White House learned something from this; first, that we are a nation under the rule of law. You cannot just sit down, Twitter something out, and then think: Let's enact it. It is a complicated country. When you do something as major as what the President proposed in his Executive order, you have to think it through. You have to talk to people.  Sally Yates was the Acting Attorney Why wasn't she consulted? Maybe they would have known what she felt and maybe they would not have done what they did. Clearly, that lack of consultation went up and down the line. Sally Yates is from a different administration. General Kelly was President Trump's selection.  He learned of this Executive order when he got a phone call from the White House while he saw it being announced on television. How can you run a country like that? I am hearing from my constituents in New There are hard-core Trump supporters. They are for him. But they are a small minority of New  There are many progressive, liberal, and pro-immigrant people. Obviously, they are horrified, but I would say this to the President and his minions. There are a lot of people who voted for[[Page S486]]President Trump--not the hard core--and they are appalled by the simple ineptitude of this administration. Substantively, even more important, how can you run a country like this? How can you make a major order, major doing, and not check it out with your Homeland Security Secretary, with the Justice Department and the Attorney General?  I will say, if this continues, this country has big trouble. We cannot have a Twitter We cannot have a Presidency that thinks: Oh, this sounds good. Let's just go do it and not think the consequences through. Most of all, we cannot have a Presidency that does not understand the beauty and depth of America, in this case when it comes to immigrants.  We have been an amazing country. In the city in which I live there is a big lady in the harbor with a torch. It is a beautiful symbol. Americans revere it and admire it. The world reveres it and admires it. Why? Because it says: America will be a place where people can take refuge if they are persecuted religiously, politically, and then they can build a great life for themselves.  That is a beautiful thing. That moral force of America helps us win wars, helps us win support, helps us be the greatest country in the world that everyone admires.  Of course, we need a strong military. Of course, we need a strong economy. Praise God, America has had both through the decades, but we also have been a moral beacon, ``God's noble experiment,'' as the Founding Fathers called it. In those days, as now, we have welcomed people from distant shores and said: Come be  Our President is trampling on that, to be honest with you. The idea that immigrants are preponderantly criminals and preponderantly terrorists is absurd. They are the future of In my State of New York, 25 percent of the people are foreign born, probably as high as 40 percent if you are either foreign born or had a parent foreign born.  They are great New I was with a Syrian refugee this week. He and his wife and his children had just come. His parents were American citizens. They had come to America in 1970. The parents and Mr.Elias, who lived in the Bronx, came here. He was a tailor. We don't have that many fine tailors in America these days. It is a lost art. So people who do it tend to be immigrants; mainly from Italy is my experience.  But he was a tailor from He then did what immigrants do in He founded a little business. He reupholsters boats, a lot of them in a place in the Bronx called City He built a company. He made America better. He is a Syrian immigrant.  His children and grandchildren were in danger. A suicide bomber had even blown up himself in front of their home nearly killing them. They just got in this month. Had Donald Trump's Executive order been in effect several weeks earlier, they would not have been able to get here. They might have perished. They might have been hurt.  Similarly, another guy I met is Mohammed knows He was so impressed by America, by the lady with the torch, by our values, by what we stand for, that he volunteered to be a translator for our soldiers. He put his life in danger for doing that.  Then he began to get threats from the terrorists in He is an His wife was in danger. His children were in danger. He came January 5. Again, had President Trump and his evil order--and that is what it is, it is evil--gone into effect January 1, for all we know Mohammed would have died for helping our soldiers.  Do we have to prevent terrorists from coming into America?  The greatest source of terror are lone wolves. Americans, citizens--ISIS gets its evil ideas in their heads, and they do terrorist things.  John McCain, my colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona who is an expert on this stuff, said: This Executive order will encourage and increase the number of lone wolves.  Here is another group that needs tightening, I would suggest to the President and his minions: those available in the Visa Waiver If you are a country that has generally been friendly to us, there is something called the Visa Waiver Program, which means you can come into this country with very few questions asked, very little vetting.  Refugees are vetted for 2 years. That is why not a single refugee from any of the countries that were proscribed by the President has committed an act of terror here--not a single one.  I heard someone defending the President saying: Well, all these people would have come in; the terrorists would have come in had they done it slowly and announced a date.  Well, we have done it like this for 15, 20 years, and we haven't had a single terrorist come in. What kind of absurdity is that?  Anyway, the Visa Waiver Program allows people from, say, France and Belgium to come into this country with few questions asked. We have seen French citizens, Belgian citizens do terrorism. They would be allowed to come into this country to do it here. Why aren't we tightening that up? That is what should be done.  So I am going to conclude. The evening is late.  Sally Yates was a profile in courage, a profile in courage. Maybe some of her courage, her insight, and her wisdom would rub off on the people in the White Maybe they will back off and repeal this Executive order, and then we can work together and truly try to tighten up the laws, the actions of the administration to prevent terrorists from coming in.  This Executive order makes us less safe. It was poorly done in a slipshod, quick way that foretells real trouble in the White House, and, most of all, it has done more to tarnish the great American dream, the great moral force of America that has, in part, made us the greatest country in the world--in 1, 2 days, undoing the work of generations.  Please, Mr.President, reconsider. Really think about this. Don't just tweet. Don't just get mad. Don't just call names. Think about it. Change it. Repeal it.  It is too far gone to change; we have to repeal it. And then maybe we can work together on tightening up some of the areas that I have talked about.  I see my friend from Arizona has come to the floor, and I will not hold him up, so I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS467-2.txt,1036,DHS ACQUISITION DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,30.0,January
1664,topic-id,1210,"Madam President, there is a theme that is beginning to define this new administration: incompetence leading to chaos. Over the weekend, the hastily constructed Executive order on immigration and refugees caused chaos in airports across America and across the world. Folks were caught in detention at airports for up to 12 hours, young children separated from their mothers, husbands from their wives, elderly travelers denied medical care, green card holders and legal residents being denied the right to see an attorney. Some folks were pressured into signing away their permanent legal status. There were scenes of utter havoc.  Nobody seemed to know the legal ramifications of the order, including the most senior officials in charge of enforcing it--at DHS, DOJ, and There is a reason no one knows the legal ramifications. No one asked the professionals in the Isn't it amazing--on one of the most sweeping Executive orders ever issued, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the head of the CIA have said through reports that they did not even know of it.  The level of incompetence of this administration already, only 10 days into the Presidency, is staggering.  The legal ramifications leading to the firing of Sally Yates last night--there is a reason no one knows the legal ramifications. No one asked the professionals in the Departments and agencies responsible for implementing the rules.  A good manager, an administration with even a low bar of confidence, would have given the Department of Justice ample time to shape this policy and review it, as well as 15 or 30 days to implement it. At Kennedy Airport, Customs, the CPB--they had no idea this was coming down.  Last night, incompetence led to chaos at the Justice Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, then-Acting Attorney General, issued a notice saying the Department of Justice will not defend President Trump's Executive order on immigrants and refugees from Muslim-majority countries because of its dubious legality and even more dubious constitutionality. To put this in perspective, this was our country's top lawyer, someone who served administrations in both parties, someone who has the reputation of doing things on the merits, of not being political, saying that the Executive order is on such shaky legal and constitutional ground that the administration's lawyers should not defend it.  I have to say that she was our country's top lawyer, because within hours of her principled statement detailing her professional legal opinion, the Trump administration fired her. An hour later, the Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director was dismissed as well.  The hair-trigger response from the White House to relieve them of their duties was a Monday night massacre, eerily reminiscent of the political firing by the Nixon administration during But instead of it happening 6 years into an administration, it happened within the first 2 weeks. How many more of these dismissals will take place over the next 4 years? How many more firings because the President and his people in the White House do not want to hear a proper legal opinion?  Sally Yates was the Acting Attorney Why wasn't she consulted on the Executive order? Maybe if she had been, they would have learned all of the ways it is legally and constitutionally deficient and the administration would not have issued it.  But here we are, 2 weeks into the new Trump administration. Already we are on the cusp of a constitutional crisis. We are already in a crisis of competence.  A dangerous pattern is beginning to emerge because throughout the past week, incompetence led to chaos at the State Department as well. Before the Secretary of State is confirmed, before any Deputy and Under Secretaries have been named, the President unceremoniously cleared out more than a century of experience among senior officials at the State One of the top officials removed last week was in charge of management issues at the State Department, including security of our embassies and associated personnel overseas. This could potentially put our people overseas at risk and could potentially make it more difficult for our government to conduct the business of our Nation overseas. This makes America weaker, not stronger.  Another official was in charge of ensuring the compliance of nations with whom we have arms control and security treaties. This is an area where my friends from the other side of the aisle--most notably, my friend from Arkansas--demanded robust action under the previous administration, especially with respect to These important issues require continuing senior-level government attention and expertise, not a vacant office.  So, again, incompetence is astounding the American people. It is amazing how poorly done so many things that have come out of the White House in the first 2 weeks have been. It seems the President is treating our Nation's most senior and capable members of his workforce as if this is an episode of ``The Apprentice.''  Unlike on the campaign trail, the President's slapdash decisions, tweets, and the basic incompetence of his administration threatens to spread chaos across the country and across the world, undermining America's global reputation and making Americans less safe--especially the Executive order on immigrants and refugees.  The events of last night make that fact as clear as day. Our country's top lawyers think it is illegal, unconstitutional, and indefensible. An unprecedented number of senior nonpartisan State Department personnel--many of whom served under Republican administrations loyally and ably--signed[[Page S501]]onto a letter of dissent, a memo of dissent, actually, arguing that the Executive order ``will immediately sour relations with much of the Muslim world . . . [and] increase anti-American sentiment'' from seven countries from which not a single refugee has ever committed an act of terrorism in America, not a single one.  Today, even more than yesterday and over the weekend, we have reason to overturn this Executive order. I urge my Republican colleagues to rethink their position, to join us on Senator Feinstein's bill to rescind the order. Then we can actually get to work, actually protecting our country with a smart, thoughtful, and effective policy against terrorism--not with what seems good on a tweet.  I asked a unanimous consent request yesterday because this order is so bad for our safety, for our security, for our troops, for our country, and for the moral leadership that we have always held. There is even a greater need today because we saw what Sally Yates said and the President's actions.  The need to rescind this order is even greater today than it was yesterday, so I am pleading with my colleagues. I know many of you have doubts about this order. You have expressed them. Let's rescind it and really get to work on tightening up our laws and making America safe from terrorists.

Mr.Speaker, tonight I am given this time as a result of the majority leader, Mr.He has given me time to talk about an important issue that faces not only our country, but also elected Members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate and the President of the United States, our new President, President  As each of us is aware, the issue of health care is one of the most important issues that has been faced in our Nation for many years. Back in 2009, President Obama began the search that he talked about for what was called an Affordable Care The Affordable Care Act seemed to be a promise to make health care better. It seemed to be a word, in the words of the President, an Affordable Care Act that would help all Americans to receive health care on a fair basis and one that would be sustainable.  The President stood before this body several times and talked about his ideas about health care. It took about a year, maybe a little bit more, for the Democratic Congress to work through this issue. On or about March 21 or 22, 2010, a bill popped out of the United States Senate, came to the House of Representatives, and we handled the matter here up in the Rules Committee, brought it to the floor, passed it with debate, no opposition--no opposition, meaning Republicans were not allowed to present an alternative case, a bill. It was a closed rule. And the Democrats passed it and went to the White House the next day, March 23, 2010, and signed the bill.                              {time}  1930  The American people had grave reservations about that, but what happened is that it took several years in which they were working through this process. We did not know exactly what would happen; but, almost immediately, hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of spending would take place and taxes would take place. What the President did and what the Democrat Party did is they tied health care directly to employers and put mandates on top of employers and mandates on top of individuals with the belief that individuals would be forced into taking what was then ObamaCare--health care--under the Affordable Care  What has happened over the years, including as we stand today, is that only some 12 to 20 million people are on ObamaCare at any one time. That is because the system that was devised and run by the Affordable Care Act is a system that does not work well. It is very expensive. It provides limited benefits. And perhaps worst of all, the promise that it would make health care available and better for poorer people never materialized as they sold it. In fact, healthcare providers are reimbursed 50 percent less than from normal insurance; meaning that, while you may have some bit of coverage, the people who would accept that health care are hard to find.  It is true that many times you could find someone who is a GP--someone who is a family physician, someone who is an internist who might take what is known as ObamaCare--but if he found something that might be wrong or needed to refer that individual, it was very difficult to do. In my hometown of Dallas, Texas, major hospitals do not take what is known as ObamaCare under the Affordable Care Act, and it is because of this problem that it is a false promise for the people who are on it.  Members of Congress are legally required to be on ObamaCare if we accept the health care from our providers, but President Obama did not ask anyone else in government to fall under the same opportunities that we would have as Members of Over the years, it became a festering point--a sore--among not only those who were paying the costs, but also those who were on it saw it as a concrete life preserver, one that did not live up to its billing. Repeatedly, businesses would come to the House of Representatives--to Members of Congress--and say to us: This law is not only not working, it is causing us to make full-time employees become part-time employees because we cannot either pay or do not want to or do not have the ability to follow all of the requirements of the law.  We here in America saw not only dwindling opportunities for employment, but we also saw the skyrocketing cost--from taxes, from behavior that did not help health care. So Republicans, yes, and the American people began talking about some way that we could isolate health care to where we would have our friends who were Democrats want to accept one of these opportunities to fix this broken system. Over the years, Republicans offered some 60 different alternative votes--piece parts, rifle shots--that said we want to fix ObamaCare, the Affordable Care We picked 60 different things about the bill that were either incomplete, that did not live up to the billing, that caused bad behavior, or that simply were tremendously anticompetitive in their nature.  It was a lonely few years.  As the chairman of the House Rules Committee, day after day, we would seek opportunities for our colleagues to come join us to present their ideas, and they not only disagreed with us, but they chastised us. We kept going. We kept offering alternatives to a healthcare system that was not working.  Mr.Speaker, what happened is the American people soon saw, as we came close to another election, that we were going to have to ask the American people to be a part of the solution. We had tried in Washington, D.We had over 60 votes and we had made it a regular part of our discussion. Republicans, each time, had better ideas, better alternatives--ways to take 60 different pieces and trade them out so that we could better this terrible law that was not working.  Then came the election. With the election, one of the most key and cleanest issues that was discussed was not only the repeal of ObamaCare, but the promise that Republicans would replace it also. For the past 4 or 5 years, Republicans have had a talking point that we want to repeal and to replace the healthcare system that was known as  Mr.Speaker, that is why I am here tonight--to talk about Republican ideas that we think are better for health care and ideas that we think will work not only in a marketplace, but that will be able to be used by a vast number of people here in It will not be something that is use it or lose it, as health care many times is. It will be sustainable. Perhaps, more importantly, there will be the ability for families to get what they want and to not have to pay for what they do not need. It passed on March 21 by a vote of 219-212. No Republican supported the Affordable Care Act, but every Republican understands that health care is important to families. It is important that a family takes the responsibility and tries to cover its family.  Tonight, as I speak with you about where we are in health care, I want to include the words that come from Dallas, Texas--my home--of the families whom I have gotten to know and of the families who have communicated with me, because, as their Member of Congress, I am expected not only to listen, but to try and work for their betterment. I am probably no different than hundreds of other Members of Congress who come to Washington every week with a message.  This is from Julie Ross of Dallas, Texas, with her two beautiful children. This is a very high-level conversation in which she says:       Now that my daughter is at home and thriving--who was in      the hospital--we depend upon these protections to provide[[Page H596]]     health care for her complex healthcare needs.  ObamaCare did not meet those needs; but as a Member of Congress, if I am going to talk about repealing, I need to also, forthrightly, talk about replacing what is a bad healthcare law with a better healthcare alternative. Republicans have better ideas to fix health care, and I am going to speak about these.  The first thing I would like to speak about is the reality that about 150 million Americans have an opportunity to receive their health care on a pretax basis. That means that our employers and our employees who work for large companies have a chance to get their health care without paying for it on an after-tax basis. I pay about $13,000 myself out of pocket for my health care. My employer pays essentially what is a 70-30 split, but that entire amount is on a pretax basis. The 1943 employer-sponsored insurance exemption and the 21st Century Cures, which we just passed this last December, allow businesses an opportunity to provide their employees with pretax health insurance. Pretax health insurance means that they are able to deduct the contributions that they make for their employees, and employees are allowed to receive this as a benefit.  However, this, I believe, is part of what we have known for a long time as being an unfair, rigged system. It is a system that says, if you work for one of these larger companies, you will get that tax advantage; but if you do not--if you are self-employed, if you are an entrepreneur, if you are a 941-type employee, meaning perhaps you are a real estate agent who is self-employed or perhaps you work for a small company--then you are not offered this pretax opportunity. It is probably true that you could deduct that amount next As you pay your taxes, you would file if you qualified based upon the amount of money that you spent.  Mr.Speaker, this right here is the disadvantage for about 100 million They do not receive what 150 million other Americans do, and that is to get their health care on a pretax basis. I have worked now for some 2 years with some 500 physicians who are across the country. We have worked on a system that would allow every single American not only to have better health care, but to have an opportunity to participate on a fair basis.  The gentleman from Lubbock, Texas (Mr.Arrington) will participate with me tonight and will speak about how important this is for him.

I thank the gentleman for letting his voice be heard about what will be a bill that will be before the House of Representatives tomorrow.  Mr.Speaker, continuing our discussion about health care and Republican ideas. Back in 2013, some 4.7 million Americans that had their own health care were knocked off that health care because it didn't qualify in the way that President Obama and Democrats wanted to have a comprehensive healthcare plan. So it knocked off 4.7 million Americans, and what it did is it placed America into a circumstance where we began looking for options and alternatives about how we would insure the uninsured.  We were told: Just watch and wait. This Affordable Care Act is going to make sure that it takes every single American and gives them an affordable healthcare plan.  Here is what happened, Mr.We found out that we still have some 30 million people in this country--now in the sixth year of ObamaCare--that do not have coverage. We have learned that about 49 percent of those who are insured work for employers, about 20 percent of the marketplace is Medicaid, about 14 percent is Medicare, but we still have some 9 percent who were uninsured.  We then find out that what happened is that the Federal Government decided that insurance was not working, so we had coops that were invented out of the Affordable Care Seventeen out of the 23 coops have now gone into bankruptcy. They could not provide the services that the Affordable Care Act was just so sure, with government-run programs, would work; and they wiped out almost unilaterally every single insurance plan where they came in. I don't know if it was just because they undercut them, but what they did is provided a false indicator for people.  Well, the Federal Government is here. Barack Obama and Democrats now have a healthcare plan for every single Only a few short years later, they are gone. They are gone from the marketplace after wiping out the insurance that was there.  Perhaps worst of all, as they left, there was a requirement by the Obama administration that somebody had to come and renew insurance, even late in the year, or they would receive a $2,000 penalty because they did not have insurance at the end of the year.  Mr.Speaker, this is what the insured and the uninsured look like. A gentleman from Dallas, Texas, Kennis Ketchum told us: I am being penalized for being an entrepreneur. I am in here, and I want to be in here. I want to be able to go and to allow myself to be in insurance, but I cannot afford it because I do not have the tax advantage.  So Republicans finally have the chance for our ideas that we believe are bigger and better. We have a chance to do, I think, what we have wanted to do for a long time; and that is to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but with the promise that we need to make sure that we replace it with something better.  What does this mean?  Well, I will tell you what it means, Mr.What it means is that Republicans are going to understand that a simple plan that can be paid for literally with the existing dollars that are in health care today and authorized by law--some $1.2 trillion that exists in law and authorized today--can be utilized for a healthcare system to take care of each and every I would like to describe that.  First of all, it is important for us to understand that of the uninsured in this country, 74 percent work. That means that people that are no different than me and you, Mr.Speaker, get up and go to work to the best of their ability. It might be that they don't have all the advantages of education that I have. It could be that they have something in their life that might be an impediment. It could be some sort of perhaps what might be a difference or a disability. I understand this. I have a son that has Down syndrome. Alex is not really capable of taking care of himself, so he is not necessarily one of these that would qualify for what we know as the alternative to  There are millions who do need the help, who do want and need insurance and not insurance that is like the Affordable Care Act because we know[[Page H597]]that reimburses at 50 percent less than insurance, some 25 percent less than Medicaid, a plan that limits the number of physicians and healthcare professionals that a person can see.  The American people need something that they can count on. They need something that is better, that provides better reimbursement to where virtually every hospital would take their plan instead of a few, where four times as many doctors would take their plan, their insurance as opposed to them being on These people who want and seek health care need a plan that is worthy of the representation that would be given to them, and that is the Republican idea.  So Republicans have a chance, an opportunity. Just one of the ideas is to allow the healthcare tax benefits to be consistent with those of every American who works for a large company.  You see, there are two ways to look at this. One might be a high standard deduction that an employee or a person would be able to take and buy health insurance and, next April, be able to write that off, so to speak, as a pretax deduction. You know the problem with that and so do Seventy-four percent of the people who are uninsured do not have the money to buy health care. Seventy-four percent of the people who are uninsured might not have enough money to be able to go buy insurance and wait all year long to get back their money next April when they file their taxes.  So one of the ideas that I have--and I shared this plan with Senator Bill Cassidy from Louisiana--is that what we would like to do is to provide a $2,500 tax credit for adults and a $1,500 tax credit for dependent children that would be advanceable, assignable, and refundable.  What would this mean?  This would mean that this year every single American that did not receive the tax advantage--the tax advantage like I receive and some 150 million Americans receive by getting their health care on a pretax basis--would have an opportunity to go online. They would be able to go online and look at the insurance in their area, and they would be able to receive this benefit, this tax advantage. It would not ever come to them. It would go directly to their insurance program.  They would be able to take, for a family of four, some $8,000. They would be able to use this first $8,000--the exact same tax advantage that Pete Sessions and 150 million other Americans get--January 1st of next year and to assign this $8,000 to their healthcare plan.  They could decide they wanted more, and they would be able to do that on a pretax basis also up to $5,000. They could decide that they would like perhaps to get a plan that would be at their local hospital. That is fine. They could decide that they would like to have what is called a health savings account, an HSA, which, more generally, is an opportunity for them to control their costs. This is very attractive for young people and advantageous for young people because they would be able to control their costs and roll these advantages or savings over year after year after year as opposed to losing what they had saved or, at the beginning of the year, starting back over.  Republicans have an opportunity to make things fair. I think this is what President Trump talked about when he was candidate I think he talked about a rigged system. When you have a system where 150 million Americans get a tax advantage and you don't, you would describe that as a rigged system.  So Republicans, at least one of the proposals that is out there--because it is Senator Cassidy's and mine, known as the World's Greatest Healthcare Plan--employs an opportunity where up front we allow every single American to have health care January 1 that is superior in nature to whatever they had with  It allows the purchase of a nongovernment plan and it allows each individual, if they choose, to go to a health savings account.  What is a health savings account?  A health savings account is a well-known product whereby a family would be able to get what is called major medical coverage. They actually, as part of their plan, would make sure that, if they were in the hospital or a member of their family was in the hospital, they would have to cover the first $5,000, but that the insurance plan then that they could find about affording out of this $8,000 for a family of four would give them a chance then to have either a 90/10, 80/20, or 70/30 contribution. Meaning they could decide what they wanted to afford based upon their age, based upon their risk, based upon their own circumstances. But they, as a consumer, would be able to make sure that they are taken care of if they go in the hospital.  Then that contribution, to the level that they would choose--either they would pay 30 percent or 20 percent or 10 percent for expenses past $10,000--gave them the coverage that they need in the marketplace. Maybe it is a baby. Maybe it is major surgery. Maybe it is cancer. But they would receive hospital coverage.  Then with the remaining amount of money, they could then put that into a health savings account and use cash for their doctor's visits. Cash is king. Cash is also the most economical way to get your health care because you go and actually, instead of negotiating with a doctor or looking at what your insurance company negotiated, you negotiate paying that person today instead of the doctor having to file insurance and go through the necessary elements to receive their money back.  You go to the doctor you choose. You pay for what you want. You pay for those things that you have made a decision, and you pay out of your cash account. It is the most leading edge, fastest way to get health care in America, and, generally speaking, it is 18 percent cheaper.  Mr.Speaker, these are but one of the ideas that Republicans bring to the table.                              {time}  2000  And it is why I can stand up, as chairman of the Rules Committee, when my colleagues say: oh, you are going to take away something that people had with the Affordable Care And I say: you know, I think we have got a better way to look at it.  Instead of only some 27 out of 100 doctors being available to you as a patient, I would like to double or quadruple that. I would like for you to be able to make your own decisions, and, in the long run, you will be better.  But there is more to the story. And the more to the story is, what this will do is allow a robust marketplace where, instead of forcing people to go into a system and then penalizing them, we encourage people to go into a system and encourage them to be not only consumers, and not only to take care of themselves, but to help everybody out because it helps the curve.  It helps people get in of all ages, of all needs, of all types back into the marketplace automatically January 1st. Didn't have to guess at how much money they were going to make; didn't have to worry about whether they got laid off; didn't have to go check with the IRS; didn't have to ask Uncle  We are automatically giving the tax advantage by virtue of them being American and us doing the right thing off the existing money that exists in ObamaCare and health care today.  Mr.Speaker, that is a better idea. That is a better opportunity for us, as Republicans, to go back home, and, no matter who we want to look at, we can say: we get it. We do get that you want and need health care, that we want and need America to have the greatest healthcare system in the world, but we need to make sure we can pay for it. And it should not restrict business. It should not come and tell a business or a group of people what they will--how they will tie themselves together with their health care and their job that makes absolutely no sense.  I know we were told that is the way it would happen, but it did not. It became a concrete life preserver for employees, employers, and for the marketplace.  So, Mr.Speaker, this health insurance tax advantage is but one of the ideas that is available to the American people and to the Republican Party as part of the world's greatest healthcare system.  I believe that we need a very disciplined approach. I believe that we need to be thoughtful. I believe that we need every single Member of Congress to understand what kind of healthcare system America deserves, not only for the physicians and the hospitals back[[Page H598]]home but for the real live people who are called constituents. And we as Members of Congress should know, the day we pass a bill, how we intend it to work.  My colleagues, the Democrats, for 6 years have bumbled around and, even today, don't even understand, nor will they admit, what a disaster ObamaCare is. So, the American people did it for them.  The American people voted in Donald They voted in Republicans to the House in the majority. They voted in Republicans to the And now we are in Washington, and we are going to struggle. We are going to struggle mightily. We are going to throw ideas onto the wall. We are going to have committee hearings. We are going to have the best thought process.  We are going to be able to go back home and to sell to the American people not only some of the ideas that I have but some of the ideas that my colleagues have. And we are going to come up with a better healthcare system.  So what we are about is fix the system before we repeal it. I believe it is wise to say that Republicans owe it to the American people to say: before we go replacing something--before we repeal something, let's replace it. And more and more and more and more of my colleagues are saying this openly. It only makes sense.  We have nothing to fear with a Republican option and an alternative that will be superior for the American people, and every single person will be able to see that. We believe establishing a Republican alternative that can be implemented this year is the best answer.  Now, this is my idea. My idea is, let's go get it on. We know what we are doing. Let's go hold our hearings. Let's go to the American people. Let's sell the ideas that we have got. Let's go move forward and get this process on.  Secondly, we believe that what we have got to do is use reconciliation to repeal the most onerous mandates. What might those be? Well, the individual and the business mandate, the Cadillac tax.  We believe that we have got to go and use the processes, the leverage that we have got. And then we have got to count on what I hope will be the gentleman from Georgia, Tom Price, who is today the chairman of the Budget Committee, but tomorrow has been nominated to be the Secretary of Health and Human  We will count on Tom Price actually sitting in the seat, looking at the exact same law that was overwhelmingly voted by Democrats and no Republicans, and using those levers that he has that were expressly given to the head of HHS to make wise decisions on how to implement the law as we move forward.  I will tell you, Chairman Price, as a physician with a long history of understanding health care, as a provider of health care for years, as an awesome physician, Tom Price knows the problems, and he will use those same opportunities that exist in the law today. Instead of it being something that would be more difficult for a consumer, more difficult for a person on ObamaCare, more difficult for what might be an employer, more difficult and time consuming for a consumer, more costly to the consumers of this country, but, perhaps worst of all, making it harder to provide better health care for a patient, Tom Price will have that opportunity.  So this is a three-tier process for Republicans, for us to also bring the best ideas. The American people should be checking with their Member of Congress who will be able to understand the Republican alternative. This is great for the American people to know.  We are going to use the levers of laws to change them, to repeal and take back the most onerous parts of ObamaCare, and we are going to work within the law that Mr.Price, as head of HHS, would be able to use exactly the same levers that someone sat there, if they really wanted to fix health care instead of making it harder for someone.  We know that Republicans have better ideas, and that what we want to do is to establish a tax benefit system while allowing the employer-sponsored insurance tax system to remain. That means that every single American will have parity on the opportunity to buy health care on January 1 of every year; that no longer will we find that people lag behind because they can't afford, or it is a rigged system, or they have a disadvantage.  Republicans have an opportunity to level the playing field. This is why Republicans openly in any crowd can say: we have better ideas. We don't have to force anybody. We will invite them to come be a part of what we do. And I guarantee you, more people will flock to our system than fled and ran from ObamaCare, because it has to work for everybody, not just some of us.  The healthcare system that we have today, ObamaCare, literally, young people ran from the system. They could not afford it. But worst of all, they could not pay the high deductible. And if you have such a high deductible, it means, by and large, insurance is useless to you.  So, Mr.Speaker, what Republicans are doing is going to allow a tax benefit system. Republicans are going to make HSAs available as an option, an alternative, so that people have a choice and a chance to buy what they need but not pay for what they don't want. We want an opportunity for them to become consumers. We want them to be a part of a system where it is not use it or lose it, rather, they can only, through their own means and their hard work, roll over perhaps $1,000 a year, $1,000 at 21, $1,000 at 22, $1,000 at 23, and to allow private physicians to make sure they are in the system.  Lastly, as my time is moving forward, I want to say something to each and every American because it seemingly has been a part of the lexicon in my Democrat friends' viewpoint, and it is this: The Republican plan has available to it and, I believe, will accept the rights that were known as under ObamaCare, which were very bipartisan, dependent coverage through age 26--Republican plan, you bet. No lifetime annual limits--Republican plan, absolutely. Modified guarantee availability renewability, just like what was in ObamaCare--you bet we will have that too.  Prohibition on preexisting conditions exclusions--literally, just the same. You have to buy in. And if you don't, then you have a problem. But if you buy in the first time you get a chance, it is an opportunity just like  Prohibition on discrimination based on health status--absolutely. That is a Republican idea, too. It is not owned by just one party. It is a generally accepted idea and would be a part, should be a part, of a Republican plan, and nondiscrimination and healthcare coverage.  Mr.Speaker, what I have tried to do in this hour is to give the American people and my colleagues the confidence that what lies ahead will be an awesome debate, but it will be done in public. It will be done above board. It will be done where Members of Congress can go back home and explain to people not only what we want to do but be willing to take their own feedback also.  It will be a system that will fix the inequities, the things that were unfair about tax benefits. And it should be, and I hope will be, a system that will be available this next year so that, on January 1 of this next year, as we find the American people wanting eagerly to look at the health care that their families would want and need, that they will find a tax benefit that is consistent with what any other American gets.  Now, the last point I would like to say is a thank you. I would like to say a thank you to some 500 physicians of the National Physicians' Policy Council who have worked through, for 2 years, 9 very large meetings across this country, the last one, the first week of December here in  John Gill, national co-chairman, and Marcy Zwelling--Gill is from Zwelling is from Los Angeles--and our 16 vice chairmen, who have devoted not only hard work but a belief that a healthcare change should be done with physicians, with the people who care about not only patients but care about the system that they would be engaged in, the system of health care in America, that is the greatest system that we know of.                              {time}  2015  They have sent me hundreds of ideas and hundreds of things which we have openly discussed where we rubbed elbows trying to decide how do we hone[[Page H599]]this idea. It has come down to every single American should end up with a better healthcare system than one that was designed that they could not explain and still leaves some 30 million people uninsured in America, and that is called We should not have a system that demands that a person be on that system or have to pay a huge fine. We would want a system where people gleefully came to it, liked their healthcare system, became a consumer, were proud of what they got, and perhaps more importantly, could go to the doctor of their choice instead of calling a number and being assigned or take the person that they were given.  Mr.Speaker, there are lots of ways to get things done in this country, but Republicans have, for years, had better ideas. The idea on health care is one that Republicans are eager--eager--not only to accept this challenge, but eager to say that we are going to work together. Speaker Ryan has pledged himself to our We have Members of the United States Senate, Mitch McConnell--the other body--and there are a number of Members, including Bill Cassidy and Rand Paul who have come out with their own healthcare bills, ways to attract not just other cosponsors, but their colleagues who are Democrats also.  So I would say tonight to my colleagues: I would like for you to take just a minute to look at the world's greatest healthcare plan. I would like for you to be concerned, instead of the some 12 to 20 million people across the country--everybody has their own congressional district, and there might be a large number in some of their districts. But by and large, the vast number would not be on ObamaCare, and each of our Members owe them a better healthcare system also.  But if we all get together, every single person can have the opportunity to have a nondiscriminatory system where virtually every hospital would take your coverage instead of only a few. ObamaCare is only a few, only a few doctors. And if we work together and form larger team sizes, we can make health care even better for all  So, Mr.Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity tonight to talk about not only better ideas to fix health care, but it would be done through a deliberate, disciplined approach, one in which every single Member of this body should be able to describe what they want. If they want to be for ObamaCare and say that only 24 percent of physicians and only a few hospitals will take their plan, then let them stand on that.  But I want to be for a system where virtually every hospital and virtually every doctor would take the healthcare plan that I would like my family to be on and them, also. That is why I stand up tonight and speak favorably about the Republican advantages of where we will head, specifically about the world's greatest healthcare plan that Senator Bill Cassidy and I have cosponsored and, more specifically, that the American people can be sold by every single one of us to make health care work and be better for each and every  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH594-3.txt,1548,A RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS AND NEW DEAL FOR,2017.0,23.0,January
598,topic-id,567,"Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming not only for being on the Committee on Rules, but also today for handling her first rule. Welcome to Congress and welcome to the Committee on  Madam Speaker, the bill that we have before us today is an extension of, really, a bipartisan agreement that we have had for 30-plus years: that we should not have abortions that are paid for by the taxpayer. The bottom line is[[Page H627]]that this is a very difficult issue, no matter which side you might be on; but I believe that the right thing to do is to say that, based upon the morality and, really, the right thing, that the Federal Government, the taxpayers, should not be engaged in paying for abortions, killing of babies in this country.  We believe it is morally wrong, and all we are simply doing today is standing up and saying we are going to extend the same privileges that we have had on a bipartisan basis for 30-plus years not only with the Hyde amendment, but placing that across all pieces, parts of appropriations and bills and things that we do here in This has absolutely nothing to do with taking away a woman's right to choose. It has nothing to do with dealing with the Supreme It has everything to do with using taxpayer dollars.  Yesterday we had a very appropriate and a very timely conversation at the Committee on Rules, and I think both sides handled their arguments and their agreements and disagreements well. It is my hope that we do this here today.  But let me say this, that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Smith) came up as an advocate for women, as an advocate for women who are engaged in the scurrilous trading of women and misconduct with women. I think he was seen for what he is. He is a strong advocate for life and for women who need to feel safe in this country. He stood up yesterday as an advocate for saying we should not use taxpayer money to pay for abortions, and that is really what this bill is.  I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for allowing me to be here.  Mr.Madam Speaker, the distinguished gentleman from Texas, the chairman of the Committee on Rules, says this bill has nothing to do with taking away a woman's right to choose. I would beg to differ. I think it has everything to do with taking away a woman's right to choose.  But this is the rule. I was hoping that maybe he would address the fact that, again, three thoughtful amendments were brought before the Committee on Rules yesterday by They were all germane. They all comply with the House rules. I was hoping he would explain why they were all denied, especially since the bill before us didn't go through regular order; it didn't go through a committee process to be brought to the floor. This was just kind of plopped into the Committee on Rules, and no amendments were made in order. That is not the way a deliberative body should be run. There are disagreements on this issue, but don't be afraid of allowing opposing viewpoints to be heard on this House floor. But apparently he didn't want to talk about that.  Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.Panetta).

730,topic-id,3337,"Mr.Speaker, tonight I rise in support of describing to each of my colleagues some important attributes of a big issue that we are all working on, and that is about health care. I rise today to talk about not just the current state of health care, but also a direction about where this body has an opportunity and a chance to go to make America's healthcare system even better so that it is the greatest healthcare system in the world.  President Obama signed what is known as ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, into law on March 23, 2010. This was an attempt then by the President and his party, receiving no votes from the Republicans in the House or the Senate, to offer a brand-new vision to the American people of their idea of health care.  It took several years for the American people really to comprehend and understand this undertaking, but we are now in the sixth year of ObamaCare, and it has turned out that it not only is not sustainable, but it has provided millions of people who have lost coverage, higher premiums. It is not uncommon to see where some healthcare providers are raising their rates by 60 percent, and in 2013 alone, 4.7 million Americans had their preferred healthcare system canceled.  So the plan began with the high accolades of President Obama and Democrats, only to see, in its sixth year, it has become a concrete life preserver to many who are not only on the plan, but those who would wish to have their own healthcare coverage and cannot because of this law.  Tonight what I would like to describe to my colleagues is a chance for them to begin understanding that the American people have elected Donald Trump, Republicans, back into the majority, and Republicans back again into the majority in the United States This was done because there were a number of ideas that were made well aware to the voting public that Republicans would have an answer not only to repeal, but to replace the Affordable Care  Republicans, in fact, now that we are in our second or third week of being in the majority, with President Trump taking office last Friday, Republicans have begun working not only with themselves, but with this administration on ideas that will make the replacement of ObamaCare even better for each and every person in this country.  The ability to make this transition, I believe, will require a deliberate and disciplined approach by Members of Congress and the American people for us to listen to each other, for, you see, Republicans do have better ideas to fix health care for all The basis of the understanding about where Republicans will come from, I believe, is embodied in the law as it exists today.  In 1943, employer-sponsored insurance exemption was given. It was during World War It was at a time when there were wages that were frozen but opportunities for benefits to be given to employees that would not be taxed. And so back in 1942, this benefits system arose. Sure, it became an opportunity as a result of being employed. It became an employer benefit. And that is what has taken place today with about 150 million Americans who receive the benefits of pretax contributions not only by their employer, but also by the employee to their healthcare system.  Well, just last December, under the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress made a new change, updating, allowing more[[Page H676]]people in the system, this time small business, allowing small business the opportunity to deduct up to $4,500 per employee, a chance for them to receive their health care on a pretax basis.  What this has established now is a different, unfair system that Mr.Trump was speaking about when he was on the campaign trail. He referred to it as a rigged system. Now, he was not just speaking about the healthcare system. He actually was speaking about much of the way America operates, systems that are not fair for the average American not only to have a shot at making their life better, but in this case, a healthcare system where about 150 million Americans get their health care on a pretax basis and others do not. This is the basis of where I believe Republicans have an opportunity to help make the tax advantage for all Americans available.  So the question is: Who is insured and who is uninsured? Well, we can go to the chart that we see here. About 49 percent of all the people in this country who are insured, health care would be provided by an employer, meaning that an employer most likely is able to offer, as a benefit, a healthcare package on a pretax basis, and the employee is able to receive that, allowing them to make their own contributions on a pretax basis.  As an example, as a Member of Congress, I have this opportunity. My employer, being in the House of Representatives, provides about 70 percent, which is standard for the operations of almost any business in this country, 70 percent, and the employee would provide 30 percent. In this case, I provide the premiums of about $13,000 for my health care.  Then I have a $3,600 deduction under my ObamaCare health insurance that I receive. I am required by law, as a result of being a Member of Congress, to receive, to buy into health care that would be ObamaCare, and then I have a $3,600 deductible that is a pretax contribution. So I make about a $17,000 contribution to my health care every year. Not unusual for employer-provided contributions on a pretax basis.  Medicaid is about 20 percent of all the people who are insured, and then, as you see here, Medicare is about 14 percent.  As you look at Medicaid, Medicaid is what is commonly known as insurance for those people who are at or below the poverty level to gain coverage. But it comes with strict requirements. Many of those requirements work against the opportunity to go and get a job for fear that they will lose their contribution that comes from the government because they might not have an opportunity to receive other help.  Then, as you see, we have got exchanges, and those that just buy their own insurance. And then about 9 percent, or about 30 million Americans, are uninsured.  This is the current status of where we are in America today.  When I say these things to people back in Dallas, Texas, I receive a lot of feedback, and one of them that I have selected comes from a man who is self-employed. He falls under the what might be off exchange, meaning he pays for his own health care without it being on a pretax basis. He said: I am being penalized for being an entrepreneur--penalized.  This is true of the 20 percent who are on They are in a system that essentially keeps them there and keeps them from going to gain the opportunity to receive full-time employment because it might not be an employment that provides health care.  So Republicans have a daunting challenge. We have a challenge to understand that there are about 12 to 20 million people who presently are on ObamaCare, including Members of Congress, and it is a very expensive--not only to the country, but also to individuals--insurance plan.  The biggest problem with ObamaCare is not its expense. The problem is that people are not on the system, as we were told would happen. We were told there would be upwards of 40 million people, providing an opportunity for more people to pay into the system, to sustain the system, and for it to be, what I would say, structured in such a way to where it had young people, middle-aged people, and perhaps older people up to Medicare age who would be paying in or be a part of a system--and it didn't work that way.  Younger people are not in ObamaCare because it is tremendously expensive, and they have found that to meet their deductible, it takes thousands and thousands of dollars. It does not meet their needs. It does not meet my needs with my family. It would not be a preferred healthcare choice that I or my family would make.  So we now have a choice, a chance as a result of the American people saying: Okay, Republicans, let's see what you can do. Bring us your ideas to make health care better.  Here is one of the facts that we know. We know that of the family working status of uninsured, 74 percent of people who are uninsured go to work. Now, this is a staggering fact because we were told by President Obama and Democrats that they were going to make sure that people got health care, the working poor, as we were told, people who needed coverage. But, in fact, 74 percent of 30 million people get up and go to work.  What we find is that they have lost, many times, their full-time status because of ObamaCare rules and regulations, mandates on employers to where employers cut their full-time status to part-time workers. Because we have so many part-time workers, they cannot afford to get the payments that are necessary, even though they were above the Medicaid line.  So Republicans now have a choice to be able to say, if we are going to outthink ObamaCare, if we are going to make sure that we believe--as President Trump has said just in the last few weeks and on the trail as he was running, he believes we should have a system that is not rigged. We should have a system that helps cover every single American and creates an opportunity that is sustainable and does not mean that we have 60 percent or even double-digit increases every year in health care because of the inequities that exist in the system.                              {time}  1900  This is the system that exists today.  So what might be one of those options or alternatives?  One of those options or alternatives might be a bill that I have worked on for 2 years, with over 500 physicians from across this country, known as the National Physicians' Council for Healthcare The National Physicians' Council for Healthcare Policy has formally met with hundreds of doctors nine times. They are co-chaired by Marcy Zwelling from Los Angeles, California, and John Gill from Dallas,  We have worked diligently with economists also to put together a plan that matches what President Trump is speaking about, but probably has not had time to fill in all of the rest of the activities.  This is what I would like to tell you. We believe that we should first allow every single American to be a part of a pre-tax credit, an advanceable credit that can be given to every single American to allow them to buy into a nongovernment healthcare system. That means, yes, people who are on Medicaid today can receive their health care and go out and get a job without fear of losing their healthcare coverage. It means that you no longer would have to go to the Federal Government and the IRS and to tell them how much work or how much money you think you will do this next year, and if you guess wrong, to pay differently. It creates a well-understood system, and can be done for the same amount of money that is presently in the system today.  It means that a person, a family, would be able to, effective this next November, go online and go to a database and fill it in. I am from Dallas, I would put my name in, I would put my wife's name, our social security numbers, and our children, and it would allow this pre-tax credit that is advanceable, assignable, and refundable, not coming to me, but going to a healthcare plan that I could then purchase. I could co-purchase, I could put my own money in on a pre-tax basis.  But what it would mean to me, Pete Sessions, is that I would be out of I would choose to be in what is called a health savings account, an A health savings account requires that you have a major medical component with any coverage that you get.  What is major medical?  Major medical is hospitalization, the chance, the risk that you would have of[[Page H677]]needing hospitalization. It could be a car wreck, it could be cancer, it could be something really unexpected. But I would then purchase this major medical policy that is well known in the marketplace today, and then have a choice of deciding the type of coverage where I would pay the first $5,000 that is required. And then after that, based upon the risk that I would choose.  If I were younger, I would choose probably a plan that would be 90/10. That means that I would pay 10 percent beyond what happened after I paid my $5,000. Perhaps I couldn't afford that and would want to move to a 70/30 where I accept more of the risk.  The other component that I would then choose is a health savings account. That is I would take the $17,000 that I contribute to my health care every year, cash, and I would take that to a pre-tax cash account that would be available for me to go to the doctor. Instead of showing up with a card, I would shop the doctor that I choose, only buying the things that I and my family needed, choosing my doctor, and asking my doctor and the marketplace what services would be available for a cash price.  Generally speaking, cash prices are about 18 percent less. Because a doctor would receive that money directly in, rather than having to file a claim, or wait time to get back their money. It would allow my family a chance to receive virtually an 18 percent opportunity upfront savings. It would allow me to manage the things which I needed to and not worry about paying for the things I didn't use. It would save my local doctor, who would then look at me as a preferred customer as opposed to me shopping around, perhaps with others in the marketplace, based upon a model of ObamaCare, which today you can't always count on who your doctor would be. A far better idea. Every single American that would qualify would receive this opportunity, but not required.  Now, how do we make it better, because there is more?  We would, under every single one of these circumstances, take away the mandate on an individual and the mandate on the business. We would do away with the Cadillac tax, because I don't think health care should be taxed. I think everybody should have an opportunity, and the world's greatest healthcare plan would allow that. Every single person would have a chance to have their health care provided, just as I have mine, too.  So what I want to say to the Members today is Republicans are going to be sharing ideas. We are going to be presenting our ideas at the Energy and Commerce Committee, at the Ways and Means Committee, and we believe we have an opportunity under three scenarios to make sure that health care is available and ready for every single  First, we need to establish a Republican alternative that can be implemented this year. Not waiting. Our better idea is ready in a bill ready to go.  Would we do hearings?  Would we want to scrub that and maybe add some things?  We should be ready to do it and make the transition this year. We should use reconciliation to repeal the most onerous parts of mandates. Yes, we should. And I believe we are doing that.  Should we make sure that we replace before we repeal?  And we should allow HHS, under what is today becoming Tom Price, a proud Member of this body, a chairman of the Budget Committee, who is in hearings over in the Senate to be the secretary of Health and Human Services, he should use everything that is available in law today to manage a system and to make it better. But my bet is that he will count on real people, not government, to make these decisions. And in doing so, he will empower a better opportunity.  So what Republicans want to do is to establish a tax benefit system while allowing a continuation of an employer-sponsored system. Those people that are on a system today that is provided by your employer, that would continue. But we would do away with the mandates on the individual and the business and the Cadillac tax. And we would encourage each of these companies to continue that system and work with their employees on a benefit system to make it better.  We would make HSAs available to every single person, not just Members of Congress, to where they would have an opportunity to have a system that would help their health care and their families and not be use it or lose it. It would make no sense that I would have to spend $43,000 a year simply to start over next year when I could actually benefit from saving and being efficient with my money. Maybe I am 30 years old and want to save for the future. Maybe I am 50 and cannot save, but I would roll over the system and make it work for me.  It will allow private physicians to endure. And what this does is empowers the private physician.  But there is more. And that is we will also keep--I believe we should, and the world's greatest healthcare system would, keep what are known as consumer protections that today exist in law: dependent coverage through age 26, no lifetime or annual limits, modified guaranteed availability and renewability, prohibition on preexisting condition exclusions, prohibition on discrimination based on your health status, and nondiscrimination in healthcare coverage.  I would like to tell the Members that back in Dallas, Texas, I am proud to also represent the disability community. I believe I can look at every single person back in Dallas, Texas, in the 32nd Congressional District of Texas, and say this: If you like your health care, you can keep it. If you like your own doctor, you can keep your own doctor.  But, more importantly, I believe that we will give equal to or better than opportunities for every single We will end the discriminatory services that ObamaCare is today. Because virtually every single doctor and virtually every single hospital will begin taking coverage, where today only about 24 percent of doctors take ObamaCare because it does not reimburse properly. And hospitals all over Dallas that do not take ObamaCare, leading edge hospitals in Dallas, Texas, and across this country, will begin taking this new health care because it reimburses based upon actual cost and marketplace availability.  So to my colleagues who want to go back home and talk to their constituents about Republican ideas, I don't know which one we will end up with. What I do know is that Senator Bill Cassidy and I have worked with hundreds of physicians for 2 years, and we have a bill, the world's greatest healthcare plan. The world's greatest healthcare plan is a bill that you can understand that is guaranteed to provide people a better opportunity without guessing about their healthcare coverage, and it is not use it or lose it.  So it is my hope that my colleagues that saw this this evening and took part in this will understand that there is an opportunity to go back home and sell the world's greatest healthcare plan for their people back home, too.  I thank my colleagues for being here tonight.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgH675-2.txt,1548,A RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS AND NEW DEAL FOR,2017.0,24.0,January

885,topic-id,1283,"Mr.President, I am pleased to follow my neighbor from Vermont, Senator Patrick We also had a very inspiring march in the capital of New Hampshire on Saturday that Senator Hassan and I both attended. But I am not here to talk about that so much as about the 44th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. That anniversary happened this past That ruling affirmed the constitutional right of women to control our own reproductive choices. It made birth control safer and more accessible for women across this country.  On Saturday, as Senator Leahy said so eloquently, we saw millions of women and men come together in Washington and Concord, NH, and other cities across New Hampshire and across the United States and all across the globe. There were events in all 50 States and in 32 countries. We came together to defend this constitutional right, as well as other critical gains for women in recent years. Our message, expressed peacefully and powerfully, was that we will not allow these gains to be taken away. We will not be dragged backward.  Despite the progress since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, women's reproductive health care remains under constant assault. States have passed restrictions intended to shut down clinics and limit access. Sadly, Republican leadership here in Congress has repeatedly attempted to defund Planned Parenthood, which is one of this Nation's leading providers of high-quality, affordable health care for women, and over 95 percent of the work that is done by Planned Parenthood is done to provide preventive services and health care to women, such as mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, and other important preventive care.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration and Republican leaders here in Congress have exhibited a dangerous obsession with rolling back women's reproductive rights. President Trump has promised to nominate Supreme Court Justices who will overturn Roe v. It is interesting--he has talked about court decisions around LGBT rights as being settled law, and yet we have the Roe v. Wade decision, which is 44 years old, and for some reason he doesn't include that as settled law.  Just yesterday, in one of his first official acts, the President signed an Executive order reinstating the global gag rule, also known as the Mexico City policy that began with Ronald Reagan's Executive order. That Executive order prohibits U.financial aid to many international organizations that offer contraception and comprehensive family planning services to women. But what we have seen with this Executive order that President Trump signed is a broad expansion of that Mexico City policy.  The new Trump administration has joined with Republican leaders in Congress in pledging a much broader assault on women's rights and the gains women have made in recent years. In addition to terminating funding for Planned Parenthood, which more than 12,000 Granite Staters depend on for quality, affordable health care, they have promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would have profoundly negative consequences for women's health. The repeal would end ObamaCare's ban on discrimination against women in health insurance. Depending on how the law is crafted, it would allow insurers to once again classify pregnancy as a preexisting condition and to deny many women coverage; it would allow insurers to charge women more simply because we are women; it would reverse women's access to contraception without cost-sharing; and it would end access to preventive health services, such as mammograms and cervical cancer screenings, without cost-sharing--all very significant benefits of the Affordable Care  Last week, we also saw reports that at the Justice Department, the Trump administration plans to eliminate the Office on Violence Against Women, including all 25 grant programs that have been working to prevent domestic violence, sexual assault, and other forms of violence against women for more than two decades--this at a time when one in five women in this country still reports being the victim of a completed or attempted rape.  Taken together, these actions amount to more than a dangerous obsession with throwing back women's reproductive rights, they amount to an assault on the safety and well-being of women and girls in the United States and across the globe. This is exactly what millions of women and men were protesting on  Sadly, people are not just concerned, they are frightened, and unfortunately with very good reason.  As those of us who gathered and marched on Saturday made very clear, we are not going to stand still for this assault on our rights and gains. We are not going to be taken backward. This week, I am introducing bipartisan legislation to permanently repeal the global gag rule, with Senator This rule bans Federal funds for nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion services or information about abortion as part of comprehensive family planning services.  As I said earlier, the Trump administration's reinstatement of the global gag rule is even more extreme and harmful than it has been in previous[[Page S420]]Republican administrations. Previously, under President Reagan and the Bush administration, this policy applied only to family planning funding, but under President Trump's order, it applies to every program that falls under global health assistance. This means that it puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families. This targets some of the most effective health organizations that work in the developing world--organizations that are doing great work to provide HIV services and maternal health care and to counsel women on the risks of the Zika infection--and it ignores decades of research. We know that when family planning services and contraceptives are accessible, there are fewer unplanned pregnancies, fewer maternal deaths and child deaths, and fewer abortions. So if you want to prevent abortion--something I think we all agree on--then why not give women and their families access to family planning services? I don't think we can allow extreme ideology to triumph over the urgent practical needs of women and families across the world.  The facts make clear that when family planning services are accessible and contraceptives are affordable, rates of unplanned pregnancies and abortions go down. Here in the United States, the abortion rate has dropped to the lowest level since 1943--a success that is directly attributed to reduced cost-sharing for contraception under the Affordable Care And what do we have? We have the leadership and Congress trying to reverse that assistance to women and families.  In recent days, we have been presented with a fateful choice. We can stand aside and allow the Trump administration to lead an across-the-board assault on women's rights--on women's access to health care, on programs that protect women from sexual assault and other forms of violence--or we can come together on a bipartisan basis to protect the important gains women have made in recent years and decades.  Back in the early 1980s, I chaired a committee in New Hampshire that was working on women's employment in the One of the conclusions we came to was when women are supported, their families are supported. So this is not just about women in this country; this is about families. It is about women and their children and their husbands and their brothers and their fathers and their mothers. This is about what is in the best interests of the American people.  Millions of Americans joined together on Saturday, peacefully and passionately, to urge Congress to make the right choice, to protect women's constitutional rights, to protect our access to health care. I urge my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to listen to those voices, and I urge my colleagues to join with me in ending the global gag rule once and for all.

720,topic-id,1362,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today wearing this pink scarf in solidarity with so many millions of Americans who rose up this past Saturday, whether it be in D.C., on the West Coast, East Coast, so many cities in the Midwest, as well as those around the world.  It is interesting. My wife and I awoke to chanting of thousands of people. It almost felt like the protest was in our living room. And when we got out on the balcony, we saw thousands of people who were wearing pink hats and carrying signs and so boisterous with hope.  Amanda and I decided we would go down to join them. When we got to the street, it was an amazing scene, with the Capitol ahead of us, and so many folks just gathered together--like-minded--with a message of respect and of resistance. As we tried to get towards the stage as we got to The Mall and about a mile away, we couldn't even get past a wall of bodies of so many people who were there to cheer on the message of so many great speakers.  But we found our way through, eventually, and made it onto the stage. And what I can tell you was just sheerly unimaginable: 17 blocks of Americans, of all States, of all creeds, of all colors, of all backgrounds, who were there with a message.  We had some wonderful speakers that day. We had folks from labor. We had folks from criminal justice reform groups. We had folks who were fighting for reproductive rights. We had many celebrities there, of course, and we also had folks who cared about everything from our economy to agriculture, to equality, to anything you could imagine, so many values that we fought for over the last 8 years.  There is a sense that there is going to be common ground among many of these issues as we go forward.  American jobs, obviously, everybody in this Chamber wants to make sure that we protect Americans and make sure that we have employment for everyone.  We are also going to fight for common infrastructure among all of the 50 States, and that is something that we saw in the Senate the other day that was presented.  We may also have some common ground on tax reform, particularly if it means bringing back from overseas a lot of corporate money that certainly would be important to go through the same process as profits derived here.  But there is certainly, as we saw at the speech of so many people, there will be areas of resistance.  We care about workers' rights. We care about making sure that we have a Department of Labor that will stand on the side of working American families.  We care about having an inclusive economy, one that will respect a higher minimum wage; one that will fight for more high-tech, higher paying jobs; one that will fight for our manufacturing base; one that will be based upon tax cuts for the middle class, tax cuts for folks who are working, everyday Americans, as opposed to trickle-down economics and tax cuts for the wealthy.  It was also about health care and about saving ACA or, at the very least, replacing it with something that is still going to make sure that we don't have 18 million Americans, according to the CBO, losing their health insurance.  It is about making sure that we have a Medicare system that is not going to be block-rented out to the States as a creative way to cut Medicaid for our seniors and for our poor.  It is also about protecting Medicare for our seniors who paid into it through their whole lives and making sure it is not privatized, as well as Social Security, making sure that not only those who are receiving it today, but up to those who are millennials and beyond, will be able to receive that benefit. We all paid into it, and we all expect it to be there.  But it was also about equality. Many of our LGBT community are worried: Are these executive orders in place that are protecting equality in our Federal workforce going to be continued? Is this advance, this progression, this success in the Supreme Court and in so many other areas of society to have equality for the LGBT community going to be continued onward? There is a big doubt about that.  It is also about women's reproductive rights. We saw so many, including Planned Parenthood and so many other groups, who fought not only to protect health care, but to protect women's choice, stand up and say that they don't want to revert back, that they don't want our society to revert back on equal rights for women.  And we saw that today with the reinstatement of the gag rule across the Nation and the world, to encourage nations to prohibit reproductive rights, prohibit the ability to have birth control, prohibit the right to be able to exercise the right to choose.  So many of my fellow Hispanics are worried about immigration. A simple executive order can assure that our DREAMers go from law-abiding students and members of our military and those who are applying in part of this program to being undocumented and being potentially even hunted down by their government. It is about long-term comprehensive immigration policy and reform.  So many from my district, whether it be those who are also Hispanic or those who are from the Caribbean in my district, they care deeply about this. So does our agriculture community, so does our tourism community, so does business in general. These are going to be things that people are going to stand up for, and they certainly stood up for them during the march, along with women's rights, along with equality in general.  Then there is the concern about climate change and how there was a push forward over the last 8 years and there will be an attempt to backtrack.  I don't have to tell everybody, from the way the weather has been working over the last 10 to 15 to 20 years, that this is going to be one of the greatest challenges of our time--and for our kids and for our grandchildren. We do have to do it the right way, but we stood up to make sure that everybody knows we cannot go back.[[Page H669]]  In addition, Dodd-Frank and financial reform, so critical to preventing another Great Many of us remember in 2008, in October, when President George Bush got on TV and told everyone that we were in for a Great Recession and one that President Obama described as the greatest recession since the Great There will be an attempt to chip back on those reforms and an attempt to try to get away from the lessons we learned to try to prevent another global meltdown.  And of course criminal justice was critical. So many of our youth, so many Hispanics, so many African Americans, so many people who find themselves in greater proportion than other Americans in jail from a system that sometimes discriminates against them.  All of these folks stood up, millions of Americans stood up, and, yes, we had hats and, yes, we had pink scarfs and, yes, we spoke about the progress that we made in the fight. But in one word, this was about respect. It was about respect for all women across the Nation, all minorities across the Nation, regardless of ethnicity and religion, all Americans, all of our Americans with disabilities, all of our working class folks who are fighting every day to try to make a good living.  The message is clear. The message is clear from the millions of Americans who marched on Saturday that we will be watching, that we will speak up when we see things we disagree with, and when we have to, we will resist.  Those who marched on Saturday, we welcome you to the resistance, and we thank you for your support. It is going to be a long 2 years.

1332,topic-id,641,"Mr.Speaker, three centuries ago, Hans Christian Andersen wrote a fairy tale about a king who was so vain and insecure that nobody dared challenge him. Andersen wrote: ``He cared nothing about reviewing his soldiers, going to the theater, or taking a ride in his carriage except to show off his new clothes.''  Sound familiar--a leader so vain and insecure that those around him are afraid to challenge him? a man who thinks he is so smart that he can ignore intelligence briefings and who thinks he is so powerful that he can attack an entire religion without respecting the Constitution, consulting Congress, or even his own Cabinet?  The White House claims its ban on Muslims entering our country is about ``keeping America safe.'' Don't be fooled. It is about keeping America scared. I am not naive. There is good and evil in this world. My argument is that the administration has the two sides confused.  On Saturday, a 5-year-old Maryland boy was held for hours at the Washington Dulles International Airport while his frantic Iranian-born mother waited outside. Meanwhile, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, alt-right provocateur Steve Bannon reassured the President that their extreme vetting was protecting us from evil.  Okay, Mr.Let's talk extreme vetting.  Before refugees make it to America, they are first vetted by the U.Commission for Then the State Department investigates and interviews them overseas, checking them against databases with data from battlefields, email intercepts, intelligence, and other interviews.

They are also nations in which The Trump Organization has no business. Meanwhile, the homes of every one of the 9/11 hijackers--Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Lebanon--were left off the list. The Trump Organization has holdings in three out of the four.  Last weekend, at the San Francisco International Airport, an Afghani interpreter for our military was detained--held--and questioned after risking his life for our country.  In Chicago, Sahar Algonaimi traveled from Syria to care for her dying mother. Despite having a valid visa, she was put back on a plane and sent home. Before she left, her sister said she was coerced into signing papers that canceled her visa.                              {time}  1030  Other detainees say they were asked their views on the current What does that have to do with anything? If having a negative view of the man in the White House is cause for getting kicked out of the country, we are going to need a lot more planes.  Since Friday, hundreds have been detained and thousands of legal residents and visa holders are in limbo overseas. ISIS is rejoicing, and American troops and travelers are in danger.  So how does the White House describe the results? `` . . . a massive success story . . . on every single level.'' If this is the Trump administration's idea of success, God help us all when they fail.  At the end of his famous story, Hans Christian Andersen's foolish emperor parades naked down the street while those around him marvel at his magnificent clothes. Andersen wrote:  ``No costume the Emperor had worn before was ever such a complete success.''  Then a child cried out: ``But he hasn't got anything on.''  We all know how the story ends. Just like in the fairy tale, sometimes it takes a child to show us the truth.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH752.txt,1890,MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS ALLOWABLE USE ACT,2017.0,31.0,January

991,topic-id,357,"Mr.President, I wish to talk a little bit this afternoon about the way my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are, unfortunately--and with no reason--delaying and delaying the confirmation of heads of critically important agencies, Cabinet Secretaries, for our country.  Now, we have differences of opinion in this body. That is often a good thing. We debate, we share ideas, we agree, we disagree, we give the voters the very best we have, and then we let them make their own decisions, which they do at the ballot box.  On election day, the American people chose President Trump and Vice President The American people did so knowing they would appoint a new Cabinet and be focused on the issues they ran on, but the American people did not vote for delay and they did not vote for obstruction. They voted for action and they voted for a smooth transition, which is what this body has traditionally done.  It has been a longstanding tradition of the U.Senate, working hard, to confirm Cabinet nominees of a newly elected President in a timely fashion, particularly when it comes to the President's national security team.  For example, in 2009, upon the election of President Obama, 7 of his Cabinet members were sworn into office on the first day, 5 more were confirmed by the end of the first week--14 Cabinet officials inside of a week.  Where are we right now? Two Cabinet officials and one CIA That is not what the American people expect. That is not the tradition in the My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a responsibility to the American people to put a government in place and to treat the confirmation process with the same courtesy and seriousness the Senate gave to President[[Page S458]]Obama's Cabinet-level nominees, and that is not happening right now. This is serious business, particularly on national security issues.  I am hopeful my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can start getting serious and show this administration the same courtesy that Republicans showed President Obama's administration when he came into office.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS457-3.txt,2290,1415,2017.0,24.0,January

When the United States incarcerated 115,000 Japanese Americans during World War II, including my parents and grandparents, Fred Korematsu resisted Executive Order 9066 and courageously stood up for the oppressed when few others would.  History often forces us to ask ourselves: How would we have acted if we lived in that moment? Through the President's recent executive order, we no longer have to wonder.

The Department of Defense announced his death January 28 in the Arabian peninsula after wounds sustained in a raid against al It should also be noted that two others were wounded in the raid and three others injured in a crash landing.  I looked for my own words today, but I came across the profound writing of Andrew Stumpf, and I shall recite his powerful words today in honor of Chief Owens and his family: ``A Debt That Cannot Be Repaid.''  ``In a country that most would struggle to find on a map, in a compound that few possess the courage to enter, men from my previous life took the fight to our enemy.  ``In that compound, they found men that pray five times a day for your destruction. Those men don't know me, they don't know you, and they don't know They don't understand our compassion, our freedoms, and our tolerance. I know it may seem as if those things are currently missing, but they remain, and I know they will return. Our capacity for them is boundless, and is only dwarfed by their hatred for you. They don't care about your religious beliefs; they don't care about your political opinions. They don't care if you sit on the left or the right, liberal or conservative, pacifist or a warrior. They don't care how much you believe in diversity, equality, or freedom of speech.  ``I'm sorry that you have never smelled the breath of a man who wants to kill you. I am sorry that you have never felt the alarm bells ringing in your body, the combination of fear and adrenalin, as you move towards the fight, instead of running from it. I am sorry you have never heard someone cry out for help, or cried out for help yourself, relying on the courage of others to bring you home. I am sorry that you have never tasted the salt from your own tears, as you stand at flag draped coffins, burying men you were humbled to call your friends. I don't wish those experiences on you, but I wish you had them. It would change the way you act, it would change the way you value, it would change the way you appreciate. You become quick to open your eyes, and slow to open your mouth.  ``Most will never understand the sacrifice required to keep men from that compound away from our doorstep, but it would not hurt you to try. It would not hurt you to take a moment to respect the sacrifices that others make on your behalf, whether they share your opinions or not. It would not hurt you to take a moment to think of the relentless drain on family, friends, and loved ones that are left behind. Ideas are not protected by words. Paper may outline the foundation and principles of this nation, but it is blood that protects it.  ``In that compound, a man you have never met gave everything he had, so that YOU, have the freedom to think, speak, and act however you choose. He went there for all of us, whether you loved him, or hated what he stood for. He went there to preserve the opportunity and the privilege to believe, to be, and to become what we want. This country, every single person living inside its borders and under the banner of[[Page H753]]its flag, owe that man. We owe that man everything. We owe him the respect that his sacrifice deserves.  ``Saying thank you is not enough.  ``We send our best, and lose them, in the fight against the worst this world has to offer.

You have the choice, every day, as to which category you want to be in, and which direction you want to move. You have that choice, because the best among us, the best we have ever had to offer, fought, bled, and died for it.  ``Don't ever forget it.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH752-2.txt,2351,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,31.0,January
67,topic-id,389,"Mr.President, I wish to start off my remarks by thanking Senator Sasse for us being able to work on this bill together. This is a good bill. He is exactly right--that this bill came out of the Presiding Officer's committee last year, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental We met in the hallway and said: Let's fix this problem, because it is a problem. We have a bill on the floor today that does exactly that. It is a good-government bill. As the Senator from Nebraska has already pointed out, it is a truly bipartisan bill.  The GAO Access and Oversight Act makes the government more transparent and more accountable to our taxpayers.  Congress passed legislation in 1996 that created the National Directory of New Hires at the Department of Health and Human Since that time, Congress has amended the law to permit other Federal agencies to access the directory. Today, Departments such as the Department of Education and the Department of the Treasury[[Page S335]]can access the directory for information on the collection of defaulted student loans or the collection of delinquent Federal loans, but the GAO--the Government Accountability Office--has not been allowed access to this directory.  Now, by clarifying that the GAO has the authority to access the National Directory of New Hires, we can ensure that the taxpayers' watchdog is more easily able to do its job and root out Federal overpayments as well as waste, fraud, and abuse.  Federal agencies reported nearly $125 billion in improper payments in fiscal year 2014 alone--that is $125 billion with a ``b.'' By allowing the GAO access to this directory, Congress will provide the office with a critical tool that can help save taxpayers billions of dollars in unnecessary waste.  Once again, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for reaching across the aisle and working in a bipartisan fashion. This bill has strong support from Senators on both sides of the aisle, and--guess what--it passed unanimously in the House of  I agree with folks across the country who have made themselves heard. They want a more transparent government, a more accountable government, and a more efficient government, and that is exactly what this bill does.

444,topic-id,640,"Mr.President, I wish to start my remarks by saying I have tremendous respect for anybody who will go through the process of confirmation. It is a tough, rigorous process, but it is a process that is very important to this country. The Senate needs to confirm the nominees, and we need to do our work as Senators to make sure the people in the positions in the Cabinet are well-suited to those positions.  In that regard, I am going to rise today in opposition to the nomination of Mike Pompeo to lead the Central Intelligence  As our Nation's top intelligence agency, the CIA plays a critical role in keeping our country safe from those who want to do us harm, but Mr.Pompeo envisions American intelligence-gathering that does much more than keep us safe from our adversaries. He wants to collect the private information of law-abiding citizens. Mr.Pompeo has advocated for reestablishing bulk metadata collection, combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a searchable, comprehensive database.  That might sound fine, but it isn't. What this means is that a phone call with your friend or coworker could be a conversation tracked by the U.That is not right. What this means is that a kid from Lewistown, MT, who is attending college in Bozeman and feels homesick and wants to call home on a Sunday afternoon, that could be tracked. Look, he is not a threat to our country. A grandmother calling her grandkids on their birthday to wish them happy birthday, that could be a tracked. It is not a threat to our country.  This type of bulk data collection Mr.Pompeo advocates for fails to protect our right to privacy and potentially treats innocent Americans like hostile actors. The threats we face in this world are real, but we cannot afford to revive and expand some of the worst elements of the PATRIOT Every American has a fundamental right to privacy, and Mr.Pompeo has indicated he is willing to sacrifice that right. The President deserves to have the guy in office whom he wants, but we can't allow a person to be in office that is going to take away our privacy, take away our civil liberties.  It has been pointed out on this floor before all the bad people out there--in North Korea, in China, in Iran, in Syria, in Let me be clear. We must strengthen our national security, but we do not have to sacrifice our civil liberties in that process.  We can have a safe nation that respects our fundamental freedoms. Both are possible. Because of these reasons--of bulk metadata collection and infringement on our civil liberties in this country--I cannot support Mr.I urge my colleagues to look at what he is requesting and oppose his nomination.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  Mr.Mr.President, the new Director of the CIA must focus on uncovering facts about the many complex national security threats confronting our Now is the time to turn the page on our discussions of old programs and activities, which we have thoroughly reviewed and addressed.  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision to apply the Army Field Manual's interrogation requirements to all U.agencies, including the Congressman Mike Pompeo voted for that law. During both our personal conversations and his confirmation hearing, Congressman Pompeo has repeatedly committed to me that he will comply with the law as Director of He also committed to me that if, after talking to professional officers of the CIA, he has any recommendations for changing the law or updating current guidelines, he will present those recommendations to the  I have no reason to doubt Congressman Pompeo's word, and I fully support his confirmation.

471,topic-id,2908,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have the speech that I gave to the Montana House of Representatives on January 16, 2017, printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Speaker Knudsen, Majority Leader Ehli, Minority Leader Eck,      honored guests, members of the House: It is truly an honor to      be here.       I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that today is      Martin Luther King Day--[[Page S392]]     a day that celebrates a man who saw injustice in this country      and worked to change it. It is a great reminder of the impact      a citizen can have on our government if we work together.       This tradition of inviting the members of our Congressional      Delegation to address this body reminds us: we are Montanans      first. Twelve years ago, when I was Senate President, we made      time for these addresses because they are a way to align      Montana's priorities at a state and federal level. Montanans      look to our elected officials for leadership and a spirit of      cooperation. I will admit it is disappointing that the      current Montana Senate President chose to abandon the smart      tradition of joint addresses to the Legislature, especially      early in the session when there is a little more time to do      so. Speaker Knudsen, thank you for doing your part to honor      this tradition.       But first, I would like to take a moment and thank the men      and women who have made our country the leader of the free      world for so many generations: our veterans. Would all of the      fine folks who served our country please stand to be      recognized. Thank you for your service to our country. As the      incoming Ranking Member of the VA Committee, I promise we do      not take our responsibility to you lightly. Whether it is      getting the Southwest Vets Home in Butte built or holding the      VA accountable for long wait times, we will work together to      do right by our veterans.       As a citizen legislature, we have veterans, farmers,      teachers, and small business men and women. And for 90 days      or so, you come to Helena to represent your district, vote      your conscience, and make Montana proud. Our state's founders      knew that whether you are a rancher from Bloomfield or a      teacher from Helena, for these 90 days, your priority would      be to your constituents and our great state. Despite our      differences, we have a common goal, to ensure Montana      continues to be the Last Best Place for generations to come.       We know Montana is already a great place. With Glacier and      Yellowstone National Parks, world-class hunting and fishing,      and the best agriculture products in the world, folks from      all over come to our state to experience a little slice of      the paradise we get to call home. From Sidney to Regis      and everywhere in between, Montana is full of the hardest      working people in the nation.       I hope to work with you to create good paying jobs across      Today I will present a thoughtful, common sense,      Montana-focused plan to strengthen our economy and create      high paying jobs. I am calling it Employ Employ      Montana will rebuild our infrastructure, create a marketplace      for our products, pave the way for innovation, invest in our      workforce, and responsibly develop our resources. This will      let folks know Montana is open for business.       But in order to compete in a global marketplace Montana      needs more than scenery and a dedicated workforce. My first      objective, as part of Employ Montana, is to invest in our      infrastructure. Together, we can ensure that folks have an      infrastructure that allows them to get to work during the      week and to play on the weekend and that businesses big and      small can get their products to market.       That's why I worked to pass a long-term highway bill that      ensures Montanans gets more bang for their buck. Thanks to      the highway bill, for every dollar that hardworking Montanans      contribute to the federal Highway Trust Fund, our state gets      about two-and-a-half bucks back. This year, that's about $424      million for our roads, bridges, and highways.       But we only get that funding if the state agrees to put up      a certain amount as well. The Governor provided a temporary      fix that ensures we get that funding this year. But this is      still a systemic issue that we must address in the future.      Montanans need you to ensure the tens of millions of dollars      that Montana families pay into the Highway Trust Fund are not      sent to New York, California, or Alabama instead. Our      construction workers, contractors, and middle class families      cannot afford to see money left on the table because their      politicians can't agree. I've seen this body rise to the      challenge time and time again and I know you will not      disappoint.       Montana's infrastructure needs go beyond our bridges,      streets, and water systems. That's why Employ Montana will      also prepare our state for the 21st Century economy by      ensuring responsible investments in rural broadband. In 2015,      the second phase of the Connect America Fund delivered nearly      $100 million to two broadband companies that serve I      want to see that money resulting in fiber being laid down      across this state as soon as possible. That's why I plan to      hold CenturyLink and Frontier's feet to the fire and find out      what progress they are making. We've invested in them, and it      is time to find out what kind of return we are receiving.       Strong connectivity across Montana will attract businesses      to our state and allow our Montana made companies to market      their product worldwide--companies like Kracklin Kamut, a      healthy wheat-based snack food. I am pleased to have Thomas      joined by his wife Heather and daughter Grace who just moved      to Big Sandy to work for Kracklin An innovative start-     up like Kracklin Kamut brought Thomas and his family to Big      Sandy to work, and with stronger broadband, Kracklin Kamut      can be sold even in the biggest markets, which could bring      more jobs and more families to the community.       In Montana, we know that, whether it's snack food or      textiles, we make a superior product and we are proud to see      ``Made in America'' slapped on the label. It is time that we      make sure our taxpayer dollars are being used to support      American workers, not lining the pockets of foreign      corporations.       Through my Employ Montana plan, I will introduce the Berry      Amendment Extension Act, which would require the Department      of Homeland Security to purchase their supplies from American      companies. I think of Bozeman's own Mystery Ranch, which      could provide the folks on the border with their quality      multi-purpose backpacks. This is a common sense solution that      will create jobs here in Montana and keep our taxpayer      dollars within our own borders. Whether Montanans produce      backpacks, airplane parts, beef, or wheat, we are competing      in a global marketplace.       President-elect Trump and I agree: we need to ensure      America has fair trade, not free trade. And as part of my      Employ Montana plan, I look forward to working with the      President-elect to develop trade policies that ensure Montana      producers get a fair shake while protecting American workers.       My friends from the forested counties can agree: it's time      to negotiate a new softwood lumber agreement. I will work      with the new Administration to create a fair, effective, and      sustainable softwood lumber agreement. This will help our      timber industry get the certainty they need to responsibly      cut trees and help get our mills back to work.       Our timber industry is not the only one suffering from      unfair trade practices. Farmers across Montana continue to      feel the consequence of unfair wheat grading by the Canadian      government. There is many a company that gets stopped at the      border because of unfair trade practices. Montana farmers      produce the best product. To see it immediately downgraded to      feed grade at the border is unacceptable. I'll do my part,      and I want the Trump administration to do their part to      ensure Montana farmers can be competitive in the global      marketplace. This will create a strong market for Montana's      farmers, putting more money into the hands of our farmers,      more money that they can spend on Montana products.       I believe the best way to create jobs is to build an      economy that empowers innovators. Often times, creative      Montanans lack the access to capital in order to start their      business. A large part of my Employ Montana plan is dedicated      to ensuring Montana innovators have access to capital and the      means to develop private partnerships. Programs like the      Small Business Innovation Research Program provide grant      money to companies to help them get off the ground.       I am pleased to have one of those innovators, Stan Abel, of      SiteOne Therapeutics, in the gallery today joined by his wife      Stan saw the opioid crisis ravaging our country and      worked with scientist to try and find a better, less      addictive, way to manage pain. With the help of SBIR grants      Stan was able to get his business started and went on to      secure private investment from Montana's first successful      Venture Capital firm Next SiteOne will continue to      grow and employ more and more people in Montana because of      Stan's ability to see a problem and think of an innovative      solution to solve that problem. A Montana business supported      by Montana capital makes SiteOne a model for our state and we      need to look to spread their success statewide. With      increased SBIR grants, we will have more innovators like Stan      leading the way.       Small business grants are only one piece of the puzzle. The      next part of my Employ Montana plan is to cut red tape and      increase access to capital for community banks. I am pleased      to have Bob Nystuen and his wife Kim in the gallery today as      well. Bob is President of Glacier Bank in       Bob has worked for community banks from Miles City to      Kalispell, and he tells me that Montana is bursting with new      ideas and ripe for a growing business climate. But our      community banks are hampered by regulation that was meant to      police the big guys, not the small credit unions and      community banks that serve rural America and Main All      you have to do is spend five minutes with Bob to understand      the differences between him and a Wall Street banker. As a      member of the Banking Committee, I will work with Democrats      and Republicans to provide responsible reforms to Dodd-Frank,      to cut red tape for Bob and other Montana banks that are the      cornerstone of our rural communities. With regulatory relief,      our businesses will have better access to capital and be able      to invest in their product, hire more workers, and expand      their markets.       Luckily, for our businesses, Montana's workforce is second      to none. My Employ Montana plan includes lean and mean      investment in our workforce, an investment that is designed      to meet the needs of the community.       In the gallery today, we have Mike Robbins, the Chairman of      the Board of Montana Precision Montana Precision      Products builds components for GE This company      needs welders and has plans to hire 80 to 100 people by 2020.       And that's why they've partnered with the Anaconda Job      Corps to build a skilled pipeline of employees. The Employ      Montana plan proposes to boost our Job Corps programs in      order to meet the needs of Montana businesses. So folks like      Ray Ryan, the Site Manager for Anaconda Job Corps, can train[[Page S393]]     up the next generation of skilled workers, workers like Megan      Widmer and Katie These two young ladies are active in      the Anaconda Job Corps and they are here today with I      want to thank them for their dedication to       With additional resources, we can ensure the Anaconda Job      Corps and programs like it expand, create good paying jobs,      and meet the needs of local industry with well-trained local      workers.       But these types of community partnerships should not just      be limited to Job Corps--we need to look at our education      system and ensure it is creating a workforce that meets      Montana's needs. Our two-year colleges are the key. That's      why as part of Employ Montana, we need to give our community      colleges the resources they need to develop the talent our      employers are asking for. Because of our investment in      education, a kid from Columbia Falls can go down to Flathead      Community College, join its culinary program, and start a      restaurant in And a young woman from Terry can      travel southwest to Miles City Community College, enroll in      its Commercial Driver's License course, and learn to drive an      18-wheeler hauling grain up to the Port of We can      work together to build on the success of our community      colleges and expand our job training programs so that our      workforce is ready to answer the call. Investing in our      education is an investment in Montana's future.       Developing our human resources is critically important to a      strong economy. But in Montana we have an incredible supply      of natural resources as well. Included in Employ Montana is a      plan to responsibly develop an all-of-the-above energy      strategy. I plan to introduce the Carbon Capture Utilization      and Storage Act, which will incentivize investment in the use      of carbon capture technology. This legislation will provide      tax credits to allow for Montana companies to burn coal      cleaner and create good paying jobs.       But we can't ignore the fact that our climate is changing.      This isn't a tree hugging issue; it's a jobs issue, and it's      a food security issue. Montana's number one industry,      agriculture, will lose profits and be more dependent on the      federal government to pay the bills if we don't start taking      proactive steps to protect our clean air and water. This is      Montana's Constitutional right.       So I hope you will join me in supporting Employ      From stronger infrastructure, to better broadband, increased      start up grants and access to capital. From strengthening      workforce programs and tapping our energy economy--Employ      Montana will create high paying jobs and an economy we are      proud of.       Now I would be remiss if I didn't take the last few minutes      to talk about health care. It's a pressing issue and one that      both Congress and the Montana Legislature will have to      grapple with. Thanks to your good work last session Montana      expanded Medicaid to over 60,000 hardworking people. For the      first time in their lives these people were able to afford      health coverage, you should be commended for that.       Repeal and replace. Repeal and            Here are the facts: The health care industry accounts for      over 52,000 jobs in Health care in Montana is a $4      billion industry. If Congress repeals the Affordable Care      Act: Coverage would be ripped away from the 60,000 folks you      gave hope to just two years ago. Montana's economy would lose      $3.1 Billion--with a capital ``B''--between 2019 and 2023. It      would add $350 Billion to the deficit. We would lose 8,200      jobs in 2019 alone. And rural areas would feel it the most,      hospitals in towns like Culbertson, Hamilton, and my home      town of Big Sandy would potentially have to board up their      doors. Working together to fix the Affordable Care Act is      just good business.       I've been around the state and the message is clear: People      don't want Congress taking away their health care. Right now      we have an incredible opportunity to find bipartisan      solutions that can make health care more affordable for      middle class families. But instead of having that important      conversation, Congress is on the cusp of repealing all the      progress we've made.       I want to be clear. I know premiums are rising. We cannot      settle for any situation where middle class families cannot      afford health insurance. I know that. But let's work together      to keep the accountability up, and the costs down. Repealing      the ACA without a plan for what comes next will not lower      costs. Our families' health care is too important to throw it      into chaos. We need to look before we leap. And we can't      throw the baby out with the bath water. We need to be working      to provide affordability to families and certainty to the      rural communities that rely on our hospitals. I know we can      find common ground to deliver that to       In Montana, there is far more that unites us than divides      us. We can all agree that Montana raises the best agriculture      products in the world. We can all agree that on a summer      afternoon we'd rather be on the river than cooped up in an      office. And we can all agree that Montana is home to the      hardest working men and women in the world. We owe it to      these hardworking men and women to come together to build a      stronger       Together, we can build stronger roads and bridges. We can      build a 21st Century infrastructure. We can build the quality      products to supply folks at home and abroad. We can build a      business friendly environment that encourages innovation and      investment. We can build a more efficient workforce to meet      the needs of our changing economy. We can build an energy      sector that doesn't mortgage our future for today's profits.      We can build a health care system that works for everyone,      not just big insurance or drug companies. And we can build a      stronger, better Montana for our next generation.       Good luck in the coming weeks.       God bless you, God bless Montana, and God bless this great      country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS391-2.txt,1829,NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS ECONOMIC EXPANSION ACT,2017.0,23.0,January

903,topic-id,1148,"Mr.President, it is hard to believe, but the Internet as we know it is already in its third decade. While it is no longer novel, this essential technology continues to transform the world around us in often very unexpected ways. Just a few short years ago, the idea of the Internet being built into farm equipment would have been unthinkable. Yet, today, wireless Internet in tractors and combines is making agriculture more and more efficient. This is just one small example of how new information technologies have become a fundamental part of our economy. There isn't a job creator in America who doesn't have a story to tell about how or when he or she realized the Internet had become a critical part of his or her business.  But while the digital economy is creating massive opportunities, our Nation's laws are not keeping pace. Over the past several years, Netflix and Amazon have completely disrupted the video world. The iPhone, which redefined personal computing and connectivity, just celebrated its 10th anniversary. Yet most of the government policies dealing with video, wireless, and Internet platforms were written for a world where none of these things existed. It is a testament to the ingenuity of American businesses and entrepreneurs that they have been able to adapt and succeed with laws that are increasingly out of date. While I don't doubt that they will continue to work around these challenges, American companies and consumers deserve better.  It is past time to modernize our communication laws to facilitate the growth of the Internet, and it is high time to update government policies to better reflect the innovations made possible by digital technologies. As the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, I have committed to modernizing government policies for the digital age, and that will be one of our top priorities in the Commerce Committee this year.  One way the government can boost investment in our digital infrastructure is by finding ways to make it cheaper and easier to build broadband networks. At the Commerce Committee, I introduced legislation called the MOBILE NOW Act to ensure that huge swaths of wireless spectrum are made available for use by the year 2020. By then, we hope to see the next generation of ultra-high speed services known as 5G, which will need more spectrum than is available today. The MOBILE NOW Act will also cut through much of the bureaucratic redtape that makes it difficult to build wireless infrastructure on Federal property.  I am happy to report that the Commerce Committee passed the MOBILE NOW Act earlier today, but this legislation is just the start. The Commerce Committee will continue to develop legislative proposals to spur broadband deployment, make more spectrum available for the public, and improve connectivity throughout rural  Good Internet infrastructure policies and investments matter very little, however, if government bureaucrats can overregulate the digital world. The Federal Communications Commission has long been the main government regulator for telecommunications. As we have turned away from traditional telecom services and toward new technologies, the FCC has found its role gradually diminishing. This is inevitable and a good byproduct of technological innovation. But instead of accepting this, over the last several years the FCC has aggressively pushed for government interference in the Speaking about new economic opportunities on the Internet, the last FCC Chairman declared: ``Government[[Page S425]]is where we will work this out.'' The government is where we will work this out? Well, I believe consumers and job creators should be the ones deciding about new technologies, not the government. I think most Americans would agree.  Right now, Internet providers are offering innovative service plans that allow you to stream video, music, or other content for free. These innovative offers are a sign of strong competition in the marketplace. Yet, 2 weeks ago, the outgoing FCC issued a report raising what it called ``serious concerns'' that such practices ``likely . . . harm consumers.'' That is right, it seems the FCC thinks that being able to do more online for less money is somehow bad for consumers. Meanwhile, consumers themselves seem to strongly disagree because a lot of these free data offerings are turning out to be quite popular.  One of the most important takeaways from the last election is that people are tired of bureaucrats trying to micromanage their lives. One way we can address this concern is to see how the FCC operates and reform what it is allowed to do. The FCC should be focused on fixing fundamental problems in the marketplace, not dictating the direction of technological progress. The last time Congress passed meaningful laws affecting the FCC was when the Internet was in its infancy. It is clearly time for the FCC's reform once again.  At the Commerce Committee, we have had many conversations about improving this agency, and I believe this year presents a real opportunity to turn those conversations into solutions. I am confident that we can attract the bipartisan support that is needed to move legislation modernizing the FCC across the Senate floor.  Another area where I would like to achieve bipartisan agreement is on legislation to protect the open We need clear and reasonable rules for the digital road that everyone can understand. Complex and ambiguous regulations that shift with the political winds aren't in anyone's best interests. For Americans to get the maximum benefit from the Internet, they need certainty about what the rules are and, most importantly, what the rules will be in the coming years. The only way to achieve that is for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation. I have been working with my colleagues to find a legislative solution. While we are not there yet, I am committed to getting there.  The Commerce Committee was incredibly productive last year, with 60 measures enacted into law. We made real progress on Internet-focused legislation, including committee approval of the MOBILE NOW Act that I mentioned earlier. We will build on that foundation in this I look forward to taking advantage of the good ideas of our committee members on both sides of the aisle.  At the end of the day, it is not, as I said, Congress that is going to come up with the best solutions. It will be American innovators and entrepreneurs who will determine what the digital future holds, not us here in Washington, Government should focus on facilitating their success while making sure that we are not accidentally standing in their way.  I am excited to see how the Internet and other emerging technologies will continue to change our world in the coming years, and I am eager to do my small part to ensure that all Americans benefit from these amazing advances.

This      paragraph shall not be construed to excuse a witness from      testifying in the event the witness's counsel is ejected for      conducting himself or herself in such manner as to prevent,      impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the orderly      administration of a hearing or the taking of a deposition.      This paragraph may not be construed as authorizing counsel to      coach the witness or to answer for the witness.

Record.--An accurate electronic or stenographic record      shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in executive      and public hearings and depositions. If testimony given by      deposition is transcribed, the individual administering the      oath shall certify on the transcript that the witness was      duly sworn in his or her presence and the transcriber shall      certify that the transcript is a true record of the      testimony.

Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time      limit set by the Clerk of the Committee, a witness may      request changes in the transcript to correct errors of      transcription and grammatical errors. The witness may also      bring to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the      witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about      those facts with a request that it be attached to the      transcript.

1698,topic-id,1482,"Mr.President, every year around this time, House and Senate Republicans get together for a joint conference to share ideas and develop our action plan for the year. Last week, we gathered in Philadelphia for this year's conference, and we had a very productive session. All of us came back energized and ready to achieve big things for the American people.  In November, the American people elected Republican majorities in the House and Senate and a Republican That was a tremendous show of trust, and Republicans know it. We are committed to living up to that trust by delivering on the promises we have made.  The last few years have been tough for American workers. Job creation has been sluggish. Wages have been stagnant. Economic growth has lagged far behind the pace of other recoveries, and opportunities for workers have been few and far between. It is no surprise that so many hard-working Americans feel as if they have been left behind. For millions of American workers discouraged over the past 8 years, I want to say this: We hear you. Republicans hear you, and we are going to act.  Republicans have outlined an agenda focused on growing our economy, creating jobs, increasing wages, and lifting the burdens that the Obama administration has placed on the American people.  One big issue that we will tackle this year is repealing and replacing Seven years ago, ObamaCare was sold to the American people with a lot of promises. The law was going to reduce premiums for families. It was going to fix problems with our health care system without hurting anyone who was happy with their health coverage. If you like your health plan, you will be able to keep it, people were told. If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, people were told. Well, as everyone knows, every one of these promises was broken.  Premiums for families continue to rise. Millions of Americans lost the coverage that they liked. Americans regularly discovered they couldn't keep their doctors, and their choice of replacement was often limited. These broken promises were just the tip of the iceberg. The law hasn't just failed to live up to its promises; it is actively collapsing, and the status quo is unsustainable. Premiums on the exchanges are soaring. Deductibles regularly run into the thousands of dollars. In fact, for 2017, the average deductible for a bronze level ObamaCare plan is rising from $5,731 to $6,092. With deductibles like that, it is no wonder that some Americans can't actually afford to use their ObamaCare insurance.  The problems on the exchanges are not limited to soaring costs. Insurers are pulling out of the exchanges right and left, and health care choices are rapidly dwindling. Narrow provider networks are the order of the day. One-third of American counties have just one choice of health insurer on the exchange. One-third of American counties have one option--one option. Tell me that is not a monopoly. This is not the health care reform that the American people were looking for.  Republicans are committed to replacing ObamaCare with real health care reform that focuses on personalized patient-centered health care. One massive problem with ObamaCare is that it puts Washington in charge of health care decisions that should be made at a much lower level. Any ObamaCare reform that Republicans pass will focus on fixing this. We are going to move control from Washington and give it back to States and individuals. Health care issues don't have one-size-fits-all solutions. It is time to stop acting as if they do. States should have power to innovate and embrace health care solutions that work for the individual employers in their State, and individuals should be able to make health care decisions in consultation with their doctors, not Washington,  Another thing we are going to focus on is breaking down the ObamaCare barriers that have artificially restricted choice. As I said earlier, ObamaCare has defaulted to a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to health care. That means many Americans have found themselves paying for health care that they don't need and don't want. We need much more flexibility in insurance plans. A thriving health care system would offer a wide variety of choices that would allow Americans to pick a plan that is tailored to their specific needs. We also need to give Americans tools to better manage their health care and to control costs. Of course, any reform plan[[Page S512]]has to make sure that employers have the tools they need to provide employees with affordable health care coverage.  Mr.President, another priority of the Republican-led Congress will be regulatory reform. While some government regulations are necessary, every administration has to remember that regulations have consequences. The more resources individuals and businesses spend complying with regulations, the less they have available to focus on the growth and innovation that drive our economy and create new opportunities for American workers.  Unfortunately, the Obama administration chose to spend the last 8 years loading employers with burdensome regulations. According to the American Action Forum, the Obama administration was responsible for implementing more than 675 major regulations that cost the American economy more than $800 billion. Given those numbers, it is no surprise that the Obama economy left businesses with fewer resources to dedicate to growing and creating jobs. Repealing burdensome regulations is one of the most important things we can do to get our economy healthy again. That is going to be a Republican priority.  Mr.President, another big thing we can do to make America competitive again is to reform our outdated Tax That will also be a Republican priority this year.  Right now, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting that our economy will grow by an average of just 2 percent over the next 10 years. If we can increase that growth by just 1 percent, we would see average incomes rise by $4,200. Just get the growth rate from an average of 2 percent, which is what the CBO is projecting for the next 10 years, to 3 percent, and incomes go up by $4,200. We would see an additional 1.2 million jobs created in our economy, and we would see much faster increases in the standard of living.  So many younger Americans today are finding that they are not able to enjoy the same standard of living that was enjoyed by their parents because of a sluggish economy that is growing in that 1-percent to 2-percent range. One of the ways to achieve that kind of growth, to get back to a 3- to 4-percent growth in our economy, is to reform our broken Tax  The current Tax Code is costly, complex, and frequently unfair. Some corporations benefit from special rules, deductions, and credits, while others are forced to pay the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world. More and more American companies are focusing their business operations overseas because the tax situation is so much better abroad. That means American jobs are going overseas with them. Instead of pushing employees out of the country, we should bring our Nation's tax rates in line with those of other countries to keep more jobs here in the United  We should make our whole Tax Code flatter, fairer, and less complex. Our Tax Code should work for all taxpayers, not just a privileged few. A simpler, flatter, and fairer Tax Code will make U.businesses more competitive in the global economy, and it will help businesses create new good-paying jobs for American workers. It will jump-start our economy and ensure long-term economic growth.  Finally, Mr.President, Republicans in the Senate have another important trust to uphold this year, and that is confirming a new Supreme Court We are committed to confirming a well-qualified nominee with the right temperament to sit on the Court and have the proper understanding of the role of the Court in our country. Supreme Court Justices are umpires. They call balls and strikes; they don't write the rules of the game. The job of a Supreme Court Justice is to interpret the law and the Constitution, not rewrite the law based on his or her personal opinions.  Democrats have spent a lot of time talking about the need for nine Justices on the Supreme Republicans trust that they will follow through on their statements by working with us to confirm the President's nominee.  To every American who voted for change in November, to every American frustrated with the sluggish economy and a lack of opportunity, I want to say again that we hear you. The Republicans hear you. We are not going to let you down. We will spend the 115th Congress fighting for your priorities, and we will not rest until every American has access to a future of security, hope, and opportunity.

178,topic-id,384,"Mr.President, today I voted against the confirmation of General John Kelly to be Secretary of I have deep concerns about the homeland security policies that President Trump advocated during the campaign, and Iworry that as Secretary of Homeland Security, General Kelly will feel it necessary to work to advance those reckless policies.For instance, General Kelly was unable to promise the Senate that the administration will refrain from deporting our nation'sDREAMers, and I am troubled by his stated plans to reverse the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, DACA, program. Furthermore,General Kelly did not provide sufficient assurance that he fully opposes the President's wasteful and misguided plan for aborder wall.  However, now that he has been confirmed, it is my hope that Secretary Kelly will be the voice of reason in thedeliberations to shape the Trump administration's homeland security policy and that many of the reckless ideas candidate Trumpespoused during the election will never become reality.  While I voted against General Kelly, I recognize and appreciate hislong and distinguished career in the marines. I believe this experience, particularly his final assignment as head of the U.S.Southern Command, will serve him well. In addition, I am encouraged by several statements General Kelly made during hisconfirmation hearing--statements that are at odds with the dangerous comments President Trump made during the campaign.  Atthe hearing, General Kelly spoke out against the use of torture and said the U.should always abide by the Geneva Conventions.He did state that building a wall along the southern border was not an effective way to secure the border, though he has notpromised to oppose such a plan. He agreed with the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was responsible for hackinginto our elections. He said that surveilling mosques and targeting Muslims as security threats was unacceptable. Finally, hesaid the sweeping collection of data on Americans violated the right to privacy and a much more focused effort is needed.  General Kelly has a reputation for speaking truth to power--I sincerely hope he does so as a member of the Cabinet, and Ihope the President will listen. New Mexico is a majority-minority border State with thousands of hard-working families nowliving in fear of President Trump's immigration plans. Unfortunately, I am deeply concerned that General Kelly will be theinstrument of the President's harmful and backwards homeland security agenda.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-20-pt1-PgS356-3.txt,1567,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

180,topic-id,593,"Mr.President,Jim Mattis is an extraordinary individual and an American patriot who has dedicated his life to service of country.  Nevertheless, his nomination did concern me, given that it was contrary to underlying law that has been in place since WorldWar This law restricts individuals who have come out of the military less than 7 years ago from serving as Secretary ofThe reason for this longstanding law is to ensure civilian control over the military. Civilian control is an importantAmerican tradition which General[[Page S357]]Mattis himself called a ``fundamental tenet of the American military tradition.''  Dueto this fundamental concern, I opposed the legislation to create an exception to the law to allow General Mattis to serve. Iintend to oppose any future such exceptions for any future President as long as I serve in the However, now that theexception exists for General Mattis, and he is eligible to serve and has been nominated, I supported his confirmation today.  During his confirmation hearing, he clearly stressed that he understood his new role and would work to ensure thelongstanding American tradition of civilian control. He will serve at the pleasure of the new President, but his job now is notto simply give and follow orders, but provide candid advice, ask tough questions, provide civilian leadership, and exert broadmanagement over all aspects of DOD, not only warfighting. During his career in the U.Marines he has distinguished himselfboth in combat and at home, earning the respect of his fellow marines as well as servicemembers in every branch of themilitary. He has also held his marines and anyone serving with him to the highest of standards, emphasizing commitment to dutyand the importance of learning and perfecting their profession.  While I voted against a waiver for him to serve as Secretaryof Defense, I in no way can oppose him on the merits now that the waiver has been approved. My vote on the waiver was no way areflection of my support for his qualifications, but a vote which I felt was important to maintain the tradition of civiliancontrol of the military, an important American tradition which General Mattis himself called a ``fundamental tenet of theAmerican military tradition.''  As Secretary of Defense, he will be charged with the important task of providing civilianleadership at the Department of Defense, the largest agency in our country, and the one tasked with our national defense.  New Mexico plays an outsized role in these efforts, beginning with our national labs, that maintain our nuclear weapons andplay an important role in multiple defense efforts.  In addition, New Mexico is home to three Air Force bases. Kirtland AirForce Base, one of the most diverse in the country, not only plays a lead role in managing our nuclear weapons, but is both thehome of state of the art Air Force Research Lab facilities and AFSOC's premier training wing--the 58th Special Operations Wing.Cannon Air Force Base, home of the 27th Special Operations Wing, is at the tip of the spear in our efforts to counter terroristthreats to the United Holloman Air Force Base, which was recently selected to receive additional F-16s, continues aproud tradition of training our future F-16 pilots. Furthermore, White Sands Missile Range, which is utilized by all ourservices, is the premier testing facility in the country.

442,topic-id,1041,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the confirmation of Congressman Mike Pompeo as Director of the Central Intelligence I respect Congressman Pompeo's background and service to our However, I strongly believe that his positions on at least three key issues undermine his qualifications to lead the Central Intelligence  First, he has supported broad surveillance programs that allow the government to spy on the American people--programs that were far-reaching, invasive, and violated law-abiding citizens' constitutional rights to privacy.  These programs were hastily passed as a part of the PATRIOT Act in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. I was one of only 66 Members in the House of Representatives to vote against the PATRIOT  Since then, we have learned through reviews by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, as well as the unauthorized disclosure of programs by Edward Snowden, that these programs did go too far. There is no doubt about it. They did go too far.  The government collected massive amounts of personal cell phone information, with no probable or reasonable cause to justify the collection, and the PATRIOT Act was used to obtain hotel records, car rental records, apartment leasing records, credit card records, and other personal information. While the government collected personal information from innocent Americans, there is no credible evidence that it made us more secure.  The majority of the American people opposed the surveillance program. They understood it went too far and violated our basic American right to privacy. So Congress responded and passed the USA FREEDOM Act--bipartisan legislation to rein in the surveillance programs.  Congressman Pompeo was skeptical of the USA FREEDOM Act, and he introduced his own bill to resume and expand the spying programs.  I believe in strong national security, and I have consistently supported our[[Page S380]]military and our National Labs to ensure that we have the strongest and most effective defense in the world. However, in the United States of America, we protect national security and our constitutional rights. The United States is not a police The U.Constitution protects us from overreaching invasions of our privacy. Congress struck an appropriate balance in the USA FREEDOM Act between security and civil liberties. I hope the new administration will not try to return to mass surveillance programs that don't work, aren't supported by the American people, and invade our civil liberties.  Second, Congressman Pompeo's views on torture are deeply concerning. He has stated that the so-called enhanced interrogation programs used by the CIA in the Bush administration ``were within the law'' and ``within the Constitution.'' That is his quote, ``were within the law'' and ``within the Constitution.'' They were not. They violated Federal law prohibiting torture, and they violated the U.Convention on Torture and the Geneva Conventions--treaties the United States signed and that became Federal law. Programs of torture were a stain on our Nation's history and contrary to our value as  Beyond the legality of these programs, any CIA Director must understand that the use of torture is ineffective. It yields bad intelligence, which makes it harder for our analysts to do their jobs. The Senate Intelligence Committee's 6,000-page classified report, issued in December 2014, concludes: ``The CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.'' This finding is from the publicly available executive summary from the report.  On key national security issues, like the use of torture, the new administration's top appointees must speak with one voice. Secretary of Defense Mattis has disavowed the use of torture. His many years of experience, training, and leading troops have taught him that torture does not work. Americans go to war--and risk and sacrifice their lives--to preserve our deeply held values. We cannot be engaged in conduct antithetical to those values at the same time. We must lead by example.  Finally, if America uses torture, we have no moral authority to stop foreign countries or terrorists from torturing We can never give implicit license to others to brutalize our soldiers. President Obama banned the use of torture in 2009. Again, I hope we will not be forced into debate about whether to return to the use of inhumane interrogation techniques that don't work and that undermine what we stand for as a nation.  Third, Congressman Pompeo has expressed that the Guantanamo Bay detention center should remain open, and he has said he believes detainees can be imprisoned indefinitely. The continued use of Guantanamo Bay prison and indefinite detention are at odds with our Nation's commitment to human rights and rule of law. There is no place in America's traditions under the Constitution and under international norms for indefinite detention without trial or adjudication. Guantanamo Bay hurts America's standing around the world, it is a recruiting tool for terrorists, and it is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars. Again, we must strike an appropriate balance between national security and America's fundamental principles. We cannot take actions to preserve American values that at the same time are opposite those very same values.  Finally, Congressman Pompeo's views on Muslims are troubling. He has stated that Muslim leaders are ``potentially complicit'' in acts of terrorism if they don't condemn it. Muslim leaders around the world have condemned extremists' violence. Muslims around the world strongly condemn such acts. Accusing Muslim leaders of complicity and acts of terrorism that they have nothing to do with, that they oppose, is not acceptable speech from a Director of a national security agency.  In conclusion, I want to underscore that I have nothing but respect for the men and women who work in the Central Intelligence They are true patriots who work hard every day, at personal risk, to keep our Nation secure. These patriots deserve a leader who will keep our Nation secure and secure our Nation's basic values.  In defense of America, in the name of national security, we must protect Americans' constitutional rights, the rule of law, and human rights. I believe Congressman Pompeo's views do not hold with American values. His positions will not keep America safe. I think they could undermine our security. For these reasons, I must oppose Congressman Pompeo's nomination as Director of the Central Intelligence  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1710,topic-id,2528,"Mr.President, thank you for the recognition, and I thank Senator Merkley very much for yielding.  I have been here on the floor, listening to Senators Kaine and Merkley, and I saw Senator Cardin speaking earlier from my office. We can see that for many of us who sat through these hearings and heard the answers, it didn't give us a lot of confidence that Rex Tillerson was going to be able to step in and be the top diplomat for the United States of So I join in all the comments that have been made earlier.  I want to talk about one of the issues that has developed over the last couple of days and that really has bearing on this. For the last century, the United States has led the world stage. We are the inspiration for countless nations as they nurture hopeful democracies--democracies that respect human rights and individual liberties. We are a nation of freedom, where men and women can work hard, build a happy, healthy life, and live the American dream. That is what makes President Trump's anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant actions last week so repugnant.  I believe his actions violate the They also violate everything we stand for as a country. Turning our backs on refugees and those seeking a better life doesn't project strength. It shows weakness. It fuels anti-American rage around the world. Our Nation doesn't punish innocent people because of what they believe and who they pray to. We don't slam the door in the faces of those who need help the most.  I call on all of us, especially my colleagues across the aisle, to denounce this action and the people behind it. I am relieved that Federal judges around the nation are blocking the President's unconstitutional order, and I am also very proud of our strong constitutional system of checks and balances.  I can't express adequately how proud I am of Sally Yates, the Acting Attorney General who was fired by President Now you have to know something about her. This is a very courageous person who stood up and did the right thing. Sally Yates is a career prosecutor. She has served as a U.attorney in the U.attorney's office under Democrats and Republicans--a career prosecutor. When she was put up for a vote in the Senate, she got 84 votes when she was approved for Deputy Attorney General of the United This is someone who understands what is going on, understands the Constitution, and understands her legal obligations. She stood up and said that she wasn't going to represent in court the President on this Muslim ban, and he fired her. He fired her.  These kinds of actions are disturbing. They are un-American acts, and they are the most urgent reason I rise today to state that I cannot support confirming Rex Tillerson as Secretary of  There is no doubt that Mr.Tillerson was qualified to run Exxon was his first job out of college, and the only company he worked for during his 40-year career in the oil and gas industry. There is no doubt that Mr.Tillerson, as CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil, was 100 percent committed to making sure the best interests of the company's shareholders were served. But with no diplomatic experience or history of public service, I am not confident that Mr.Tillerson is qualified to serve as the United States' chief diplomat.  After studying his work and studying the history and his responses at the confirmation hearing and looking at his answers in writing, I do not believe that Mr.Tillerson is able to commit 100 percent to serving the best interests of the American people. Negotiating the complexities of oil and gas deals is not the same as negotiating the complexities of treaties and agreements with foreign governments.  ExxonMobil's top priority is profit. That is its reason for existence. Leaders negotiate business deals over money and access to resources. The United States and the American people have different priorities--sometimes conflicting priorities.  Our Nation is economically successful, for sure, and we value business and we value making money, but our core values go way beyond economics. We value representative government, we value human rights, and we value freedom of speech. We value the four freedoms that President Roosevelt talked about when we entered into international agreements to spread the four freedoms around the world.  An incoming Secretary of State should not be learning on the job. He or she should already have substantial relevant experience. He or she should already have proven experience fighting for our Nation's core values, for human rights. Mr.Tillerson made it clear during his hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he lacks substantive foreign policy experience and knowledge. He told the committee many times that he was not familiar with the issues at hand or needed briefing. He must have said that a number of times. As just one example, Mr.Tillerson was unfamiliar with Russia's role in the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians in He had no opinion of the legality of the slaughter under international law. These are some of the most important, most urgent foreign policy matters we face, but he was unprepared to answer them.  Like Senators on both sides of the aisle, I am concerned about Mr.Tillerson's close personal business ties to the Russian I am concerned about those. They may color his view of He has been long friends with Vladimir He has a highly profitable relationship with Igor Sechin, the head of the state-owned oil company I worry that these ties make it difficult or maybe even impossible for him to objectively evaluate Russia's actions and to act in America's best interests.  Are his close ties to Russia why he does not condemn Russia's actions in Syria? We cannot be sure. Mr.Tillerson also will not confirm whether he will advocate maintaining sanctions against Russia for invading We know that the sanctions also continue to cost ExxonMobil because it is not able to drill for oil in Russia's  Will Mr.Tillerson not commit to maintaining sanctions because of his ties to Russia? We cannot be sure.  In a third example, Mr.Tillerson would not commit to sanctions against Russia for its interference in our Presidential election. He said he didn't have enough information. Well, every U.security agency--all 17 of them--has concluded that the Russian Government hacked the Democratic National Committee, disclosed email from the hack from getting in there, and tried to influence our election. They agreed that these actions were authorized at the highest levels of the Russian Government, with fingers pointing right at Vladimir The intelligence community's public reports stated it this way:       We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an      influence campaign in 2016[[Page S522]]     aimed at the U.presidential election. Russia's goals were      to undermine public faith in the U.democratic process,      denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and      potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian      Government developed a clear preference for President-elect      Trump--  Now President Trump--       We have high confidence in these judgments.  So 17 of our intelligence agencies pooled together all of their information, and they had high confidence in what they concluded there.  Mr.Tillerson had adequate information to make a strong statement against this attack, against this hacking, and in favor of American democracy. He did not make such a statement.  We must have a Secretary of State whose allegiance is 100 percent committed to U.interests. Mr.Tillerson's equivocating testimony on Russia did not convince me that he can be counted on to serve America's interests and America's interests only. Mr.Tillerson's equivocations mirror the Republicans' record on Russian interference in our democracy.  While the President has plans to dismantle the post-World War II international order, Republicans have done nothing to address Russia's attempt to dismantle our democracy.  I was also unsatisfied by Mr.Tillerson's answers on climate change. While he acknowledges the existence of climate change, he testified that ``our ability to predict that effect is very limited'' and that what action to take ``seems to be the largest area of debate existing in the public discourse.'' That is not what the overwhelming majority of scientists tell us. Our ability to predict what is happening to the planet's climate is not ``very limited,'' and there is international consensus written into the Paris Agreement as to what actions nations agree they must take. Scientists from all over the world have joined together through the United Nations and said that climate change is real and we have to take specific actions.  I appreciated that Rex Tillerson at least said that he believes the United States should remain at the table, but he questioned a key part of the Paris Agreement: the nationally determined contribution, or what is called the Without the NDC from the United States, the agreement is likely to fall apart, and his claimed support for the Paris Agreement becomes meaningless.  I cannot be clearer: Ignoring the threat of climate change is a direct threat to the United We have heard other Senators talk about the threat to their States, and it is a direct threat to my home State of New  While President Trump may be trying to quiet our climate scientists, the science is clear. Climate change is real. We just finished the hottest year in recorded history. We know we must act, and we know there will be devastating impacts if the United States does not lead on this issue.  No matter what one believes about science or foreign policy, we should all be alarmed at the lack of transparency in the new administration, especially the unwillingness of our President and key Cabinet members to be open and honest with taxpayers about their finances and potential conflicts.  While Mr.Tillerson has divested from ExxonMobil, we still don't have copies of his tax returns. Mr.Tillerson's ties to ExxonMobil are decades old. Yet he has said he will recuse himself from matters related to ExxonMobil for only 1 year. For only 1 year will he recuse himself. He has worked for this company his entire life. He should refrain from taking calls from his old company for as long as he serves as Secretary of He is serving the country. He is serving in a taxpayer-funded job. I don't understand why he cannot agree to this simple standard to avoid the appearance of any conflict. If he deals favorably with ExxonMobil, how can the American people know he is working for us or for his former employer, which made him an extremely wealthy man?  But most concerning to me is whether Mr.Tillerson will be able to speak truth to power. We have just seen this weekend how vital that will be in this administration, where it appears that there is no unifying vision, and different factions of President Trump's Cabinet are competing for his attention. We need a leader with a clear vision for America's role in the world, someone who will put American values ahead of everything else.  Too many times, when pressed during his confirmation hearing about U.interests and values, Mr.Tillerson did not give straight answers. On questions such as human rights violations in the Philippines and Syria, he did not call out these offenses for what they were. On questions about whether we should maintain sanctions against Russia for illegally invading Crimea or for interfering with our electoral process, he deferred; he wavered; he said he would decide at a later date when he can be briefed or meet with the If Mr.Tillerson can't give straight answers, from the heart, about the most pressing human rights issues, on violations of international law, on a foreign power's interference with our Presidential election, how can we expect him to speak up and temper the worst angels in the Trump administration?  If Mr.Tillerson were the nominee for a more conventional Republican President, these concerns would not be as serious. But I think every Senator can agree that Donald Trump is not a conventional He is offending allies and upending alliances on a nearly daily basis. He has made negative statements about the German Chancellor's domestic policies. He is threatening to extort the Mexican Government to pay for an offensive and ineffective wall on America's southern border. He has repeatedly questioned NATO, the fundamental alliance that has secured peace between major powers since World War He is threatening to slash funding for the United Nations, including the World Health Organization, which fights global pandemics.  While addressing employees of the Central Intelligence Agency, standing in front of a wall honoring professionals who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms, President Trump threatened to take Iraq's oil--that he wanted to take another look at taking Iraq's oil--and he said: ``To the victor go the spoils.'' This is a line attributed to Julius Caesar, who decreed himself He began rattling the saber with China before he was sworn in.  The President has done all of this while repeatedly praising Vladimir Putin as a strong leader and proposing to improve relations there, while making them worse nearly everywhere else.  This weekend, he closed America's doors to Muslim refugees trying to escape the very evil our government is fighting against. He not only closed the doors to people who believe in our democratic institutions and the freedoms we enjoy, he closed the doors to people who have risked their lives in service of our ideals.  These are not normal changes in foreign policy between administrations. I would change many aspects of U.foreign policy if I could. But President Trump's approach to foreign policy so far is one of reckless change that is frankly scaring the American public and our allies around the world. In such a foreign policy environment, we need experienced, skilled hands, people who understand these allies and who understand our longstanding alliances and why we have them. But the President has fired all U.Ambassadors, and most high-level State Department employees have resigned or been forced out.  Mr.Tillerson, there is no doubt, is a talented businessman. He loves his country. He has devoted himself to other worthy causes, like the Boy It is no exaggeration to say that the post-World War II international order is under attack by the President, endangering U.leadership in the world. As a result, our national security and place in the world are threatened like never before. During such tenuous times, we need a leader as our chief diplomat who is prepared to take the reins and calm the waters. But I do not have confidence that Mr.Tillerson has the experience, knowledge, values, or temperament to stand up to the President, to be a voice of reason, or to moderate the President's extreme views and actions. For these reasons, I oppose Mr.Tillerson's confirmation as Secretary of State, and I urge my fellow Members, including those who claimed the mantle of President Reagan, to do the same.[[Page S523]]  I know my good friend Senator Markey, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, is here on the floor, as well as Senator Coons, another member of the committee, and I think both of them will speak on the Tillerson nomination.

250,topic-id,288,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.511. I would note that this is our colleague Mr.Welch's bill that moved through the regular process through the Committee on Energy and Commerce last year. It received extensive bipartisan support. I am again glad to move this bill today.  External power supplies, EPS, are used with a wide variety of devices, and we have learned from experience that the Federal energy efficiency standards for them are not compatible with some of these applications. In particular, we need an exemption from these rules for security and life safety alarms and surveillance systems. This bill, H.511, the Power And Security Systems (PASS) Act, provides a targeted exemption that allows these critical systems to stay on the market.  Devices like home security alarms or fire detection systems need to be on 24/7, but the 2007 energy law requiring energy efficiency standards for external power supplies did not allow for this. Subsequent legislation created an exemption for external power supplies used with these always-on devices. This exemption will end on July 1 of this year. This bill extends that exemption until 2023.  The result of the bill would be that these important security systems will continue to be available, preserving the jobs of those who make them and certainly the safety of those who use them. As with H.518, the other external power supply bill that we are addressing today, these provisions enjoyed strong bipartisan and bicameral support when they were added to last year's energy bill.

I would note that we passed this bill through regular order again in the last Congress, passed with bipartisan support. It is appropriate that we bring it up early this year. Again, this is another bipartisan bill. We must allow the public to have administrative process relief in those cases where FERC does not actually issue an order, and this legislation will do just that. I urge passage of the bill.  The Federal Power Act sets forth processes to set rates for electricity, including opportunities for the public to protest a rate change filed with New rates take effect if FERC approves them or if FERC fails to issue an order approving or denying the filed rate within 60 days.  The failure to approve or deny a rate may result from agency delay or, in some limited cases, from a vote that results in a deadlocked Commission, for example, a 2-2 vote. In such cases, the rates become effective by operation of law, even when these rates were not approved by a majority of  The Federal Power Act, of course, provides administrative redress for members of the public to protest Commission rate decisions. However, if these rates become effective by operation of law, for example, that 2-2 deadlock, the administrative processes are not available to the public because FERC did not actually issue an order for the public to protest. The public literally gets shut out.  I don't want to speak for the gentleman from Massachusetts, but I think some of his constituents recently experienced this firsthand.

SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Advanced Nuclear Technology      Development Act of 2017''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Nuclear energy generates approximately 20 percent of      the total electricity and approximately 60 percent of the      carbon-free electricity of the United       (2) Nuclear power plants operate consistently at a 90      percent capacity factor, and provide consumers and businesses      with reliable and affordable electricity.       (3) Nuclear power plants generate billions of dollars in      national economic activity through nationwide procurements      and provide thousands of Americans with high paying jobs      contributing substantially to the local economies in      communities where they operate.       (4) The United States commercial nuclear industry must      continue to lead the international civilian nuclear      marketplace, because it is one of our most powerful national      security tools, guaranteeing the safe, secure, and      exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy.[[Page H570]]       (5) Maintaining the Nation's nuclear fleet of commercial      light water reactors and expanding the use of new advanced      reactor designs would support continued production of      reliable baseload electricity and maintain United States      global leadership in nuclear power.       (6) Nuclear fusion technology also has the potential to      generate electricity with significantly increased safety      performance and no radioactive waste.       (7) The development of advanced reactor designs would      benefit from a performance-based, risk-informed, efficient,      and cost-effective regulatory framework with defined      milestones and the opportunity for applicants to demonstrate      progress through Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval.     3.       In this Act:       (1) Advanced nuclear reactor.--The term ``advanced nuclear      reactor'' means--       (A) a nuclear fission reactor with significant improvements      over the most recent generation of nuclear fission reactors,      which may include inherent safety features, lower waste      yields, greater fuel utilization, superior reliability,      resistance to proliferation, and increased thermal      efficiency; or       (B) a nuclear fusion reactor.       (2) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the      Department of       (3) Licensing.--The term ``licensing'' means NRC activities      related to reviewing applications for licenses, permits, and      design certifications, and requests for any other regulatory      approval for nuclear reactors within the responsibilities of      the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.       (4) National laboratory.--The term ``National Laboratory''      has the meaning given that term in section 2 of the Energy      Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.15801).       (5) NRC.--The term ``NRC'' means the Nuclear Regulatory            (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary      of     4. AGENCY       The NRC and the Department shall enter into the a      memorandum of understanding regarding the following topics:       (1) Technical expertise.--Ensuring that the Department has      sufficient technical expertise to support the civilian      nuclear industry's timely research, development,      demonstration, and commercial application of safe, innovative      advanced reactor technology and the NRC has sufficient      technical expertise to support the evaluation of applications      for licenses, permits, and design certifications, and other      requests for regulatory approval for advanced reactors.       (2) Modeling and simulation.--The use of computers and      software codes to calculate the behavior and performance of      advanced reactors based on mathematical models of their      physical behavior.       (3) Facilities.--Ensuring that the Department maintains and      develops the facilities to enable the civilian nuclear      industry's timely research, development, demonstration, and      commercial application of safe, innovative reactor technology      and ensuring that the NRC has access to such facilities, as      needed.     5. ADVANCED REACTOR REGULATORY       (a) Plan Required.--Not later than 1 year after the date of      enactment of this Act, the NRC shall transmit to Congress a      plan for developing an efficient, risk-informed, technology-     neutral framework for advanced reactor licensing. The plan      shall evaluate the following subjects, consistent with the      NRC's role in protecting public health and safety and common      defense and security:       (1) The unique aspects of advanced reactor licensing and      any associated legal, regulatory, and policy issues the NRC      will need to address to develop a framework for licensing      advanced reactors.       (2) Options for licensing advanced reactors under existing      NRC regulations in title 10 of the Code of Federal      Regulations, a proposed new regulatory framework, or a      combination of these approaches.       (3) Options to expedite and streamline the licensing of      advanced reactors, including opportunities to minimize the      time from application submittal to final NRC licensing      decision and minimize the delays that may result from any      necessary amendments or supplements to applications.       (4) Options to expand the incorporation of consensus-based      codes and standards into the advanced reactor regulatory      framework to minimize time to completion and provide      flexibility in implementation.       (5) Options to make the advanced reactor licensing      framework more predictable. This evaluation should consider      opportunities to improve the process by which application      review milestones are established and maintained.       (6) Options to allow applicants to use phased review      processes under which the NRC issues approvals that do not      require the NRC to re-review previously approved information.      This evaluation shall consider the NRC's ability to review      and conditionally approve partial applications, early design      information, and submittals that contain design criteria and      processes to be used to develop information to support a      later phase of the design review.       (7) The extent to which NRC action or modification of      policy is needed to implement any part of the plan required      by this subsection.       (8) The role of licensing advanced reactors within NRC      long-term strategic resource planning, staffing, and funding      levels.       (9) Options to provide cost-sharing financial structures      for license applicants in a phased licensing process.       (b) Coordination and Stakeholder Input Required.--In      developing the plan required by subsection (a), the NRC shall      seek input from the Department, the nuclear industry, and      other public stakeholders.       (c) Cost and Schedule Estimate.--The plan required by      subsection (a) shall include proposed cost estimates,      budgets, and specific milestones for implementing the      advanced reactor regulatory framework by September 30, 2019.       (d) Design Certification Status.--In the NRC's first budget      request after the acceptance of any design certification      application for an advanced nuclear reactor, and annually      thereafter, the NRC shall provide the status of performance      metrics and milestone schedules. The budget request shall      include a plan to correct or recover from any milestone      schedule delays, including delays because of NRC's inability      to commit resources for its review of the design      certification applications.     6.

362,topic-id,400,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands who is helping to lead tonight's Special Order hour.  I, again, want to highlight how President Trump's inaugural address served as a preview of what the African American community can expect over the next 4 years.  This past Friday, thousands of Americans from all over the country traveled to Washington, D.C., to witness the new President and what type of message he was going to deliver. Unfortunately, instead of starting his Presidency with a bold, new agenda that would benefit all Americans, what we heard was an inaugural address that reminded us that the America he wants to build will leave many of the constituents of those of us who serve as members of the Congressional Black Caucus behind.  In his speech, President Trump said that a nation exists to serve its citizens. But for far too many, a different reality exists. He also painted another grim picture of mothers and children trapped in poverty in inner cities and rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and crimes and gangs and drugs that have stolen the lives of too many and robbed the country of so much of its unrealized potential.  Those are problems that need to be addressed. I don't think that anybody will disagree with that. We need to make sure that our children have access to good public schools and good, quality education. We need to make sure that, as the nature of work changes in this country, people are ready to get those new jobs. We must make sure that we invest in our communities so that they prosper.  But yet, very little of what President Trump proposed would actually address the root cause of any of those problems. Not even his new deal for Black Americans provides real solutions for the problems that he outlined in his inaugural address. Instead, we see the same recycled, broken promises.  Since the creation of the Congressional Black Caucus, we have been fighting to uplift our communities. We have bold ideas to help transform the lives of those individuals that were mentioned and real ideas that can get going.

I have also received public and private assurances from Congressman Pompeo that he will accurately represent the unvarnished views of the analysts and folks who work for the CIA and that he will relay those views no matter what the President or others want to hear.  One of the most important jobs of the Intelligence Committee is speaking truth to power.  Congressman Pompeo has also given me assurances that he will support those who work for the CIA and not discriminate against anyone based on their personal views and, not in the least, that he will cooperate with Congress, particularly as we look into Russia's efforts to interfere with our election system.  I heard my friend, the Senator from Texas, call out the former Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, who has over 50 years in the intelligence business. And again, Mr.Clapper, along with all the other leaders of the intelligence community, basically has said that the Russian efforts to interfere in our elections in this past year were unprecedented.  We all know that President Trump has said some unacceptable things about the intelligence community, accusing them of leaks and of politicizing intelligence. Those of us who serve on the Select Committee on Intelligence--indeed, all of us in Congress, and I know I see my friend, the chairman of the committee, is sitting here on the floor--know that those attacks were unwarranted and should not be continued.  Congressman Pompeo did not participate in those attacks. Instead, throughout his tenure on the House Intelligence Committee, he showed respect for the intelligence community and worked to help make them even better.  His former colleagues and staff on the committee speak highly of him, even when they disagree.  Since he was nominated for the position of Director, Mr.Pompeo has spent a great deal of time at the CIA, working with the professionals there to understand his new role and the challenges he will face. We have had a number of conversations about that.  I have heard nothing that undermines my view that he will treat the employees of the Agency with the decency and fairness they deserve. And since most of those employees also happen to be my constituents, I will watch his actions very carefully.  Under Congressman Pompeo, the CIA will face many challenges. For example, the growth of open source information and big data will supplement and challenge traditional collection means. The Agency has the increasing need to operate in expeditionary and nontraditional environments, which will drive a need for changes in personnel, support, and training. The Agency will have and will need an increasingly diverse workforce which grew up online, which will create new opportunities but also new problems, for example, in establishing and maintaining cover. And if he is confirmed as Director, Mr.Pompeo will have to complete and sometimes tweak the reorganization begun by his predecessor, John  While Congressman Pompeo and I disagree on many issues--and I suspect will disagree on many in the future--I support his nomination. I believe he can be a good leader for the CIA and will cooperate with the oversight of the SSCI and  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1280,topic-id,4437,"Mr.President, on Friday night, President Donald Trump issued an Executive order that strikes at the very heart of our democracy.  I wish I were exaggerating. I wish this were some sort of game. But the ban that imposes religious tests and keeps refugees and immigrants from entering our country is illegal, it is unconstitutional, it is immoral, and it must be overturned.  The effects of this order were immediate and terrifying for people in Massachusetts and all across this country. My office got a call from an Iranian citizen who was traveling to Massachusetts to see his daughter who is currently receiving treatment for cancer. He was denied boarding in Germany and sent back to We heard from a woman who already has an approved immigrant visa but still hasn't found an airline that will allow her to board a flight to the United A Massachusetts resident called because her cousin who holds a student visa was not allowed to board a flight either. Another Massachusetts resident called because her Iranian sisters were denied boarding at London Both have their valid J-1 visas. One is a visiting professor at Harvard, and the other is a postdoc fellow at Harvard We heard from an Iranian student studying at She was denied entry on Saturday, and when she tried to return on Sunday, after the temporary stay had been issued, she was denied boarding by A Massachusetts student on a student visa called because his wife was denied boarding in  None of these people are criminals. None of these people are threats. They are students at some of the world's top universities; they are doctors and scientists at some of the country's best hospitals. Most of them have already been vetted and granted the right to come to One is a father who wants to see his cancer-stricken daughter. They are husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, friends and neighbors. They are people. They are real people. They are part of what makes Massachusetts great, and they are part of what makes America great.  Donald Trump's radical ban on Muslims isn't in line with American values or with our It is also not in line with what the Republican Party stands for.  In the months following the attacks of September 11, President George Bush made a point to remind the United States that we were not at war against In a speech in April of 2002, he said:       America rejects bigotry. We reject every act of hatred      against people of Arab background or Muslim faith. America      values and welcomes peaceful people of all faiths--Christian,      Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and many others. Every faith is      practiced and protected here, because we are one country.      Every immigrant can be fully and equally American because      we're one country. Race and color should not divide us,      because America is one country.  Do Senate Republicans agree? If so, then come down here and say so. Where are you? Where are Senate Republicans when their Republican President issues an order targeting one religious group?  Let's be clear about what happened here. Keeping the details secret, working with a small group of operatives inside the White House, consulting no experts in diplomacy or homeland security, and getting advice from outsiders with no actual legal authority, President Trump acted unilaterally to issue this order.  Make no mistake, while it may not affect every Muslim in the world, Donald Trump's Executive order is a Muslim ban, and it is unconstitutional.[[Page S475]]This is a crisis. The Senate should take up and pass Senator Feinstein's bill to overturn this illegal order right now. What is happening is shocking. It is shocking, but it is not surprising.  Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he was going to do. During his Presidential campaign, he promised ``a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.'' That is what he said. Last year, it seemed like pretty much everyone agreed that this was not acceptable in the United States of  Speaker Paul Ryan declared:       A religious test for entering our country is not reflective      of America's fundamental values. I reject it.  Where are you now, Paul Ryan? Have you rejected President Trump's order to impose a religious test for entering our country? Have you introduced a bill to overturn it? You have the power. Where are you?  As Governor of Indiana, Vice President Mike Pence said: ``Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.are offensive and unconstitutional.'' Where are you right now, Vice President Pence? Have you called to overturn President Trump's offensive and unconstitutional order? Have you asked Republicans to introduce a bill to overturn it? You have a platform. Where are you?  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called a Muslim ban ``completely and totally inconsistent with American values.'' Where are you right now, Mitch McConnell? Have you rejected President Trump's Muslim ban that is completely and totally inconsistent with American values? Have you introduced a bill to overturn it? You have the power. Where are you?  President Trump ignored these Republican leaders. Today these Republican leaders will not stand up for what is right. President Trump may be willing to ignore the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and the Republican leadership in Congress may be willing to ignore the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, but the American people are not.  This weekend, Americans across this country came together to reject this sort of fear and hate. The American people showed courage, even as the Republican leadership hid out. Crowds of people raced to airports across this country to welcome immigrants and refugees and to demand compliance with court rulings that gave individuals and families temporary relief and to demand that this reckless order be rescinded.  I was proud to stand with hundreds of people at Logan Airport in Boston on Saturday night and then with more than 20,000 people in Copley Square on We had one of the biggest demonstrations in the country. I also want to say I am in awe of the hundreds of lawyers and translators who dropped everything and spent sleepless nights in airport terminals and courts fighting for justice. Because of their tireless work, we have already been able to undo some of the damage caused by President  While I am encouraged by our victories in the courts this weekend, the Trump administration has derided these judges and, in some instances, refused to follow these orders. This is shocking and unconstitutional. Congress must act. We must act now. Congress must stand up and say to President Trump that this is not who we are. Congress must say to Donald Trump and to the world: We will not turn our backs on lawful immigrants and refugees fleeing murderers. We will not turn our backs on people who risk their own lives to protect our soldiers in Iraq and in the fight against We will not give ISIS more recruiting material. We will not promote an imagined religious war between America and We will stand for our values, for American values, for human values. We will not be divided by hate and fear.  Fifteen months ago, I traveled to the Greek island of This is the first stop for many Syrian refugees as they flee from the terrorists of That was where I saw the shoddy, paper-thin river rafts that people cram onto, with nothing more than a hope and a prayer that they will make it across a choppy sea. I saw the little plastic pool floaties that people put on small children, hoping it would be enough to save them if the raft went down.  I met a 7-year-old girl who had been sent out on that perilous journey alone. I thought about what horrors her parents must have faced to hand a wad of cash to human smugglers with only the most desperate dream that their little girl would find something better on the other side.  President Trump is trying to shut the door on that little girl and on countless others who are fleeing for their lives. He is trying to shut the door on children, on doctors, on students, on engineers, on husbands and wives, on grandmas and grandpas. That is not all. President Trump is trying to shut the door on people who risked their lives helping American soldiers, people who face execution in the hands of terrorists if they are sent back.  President Trump is even trying to shut the door on legal immigrants, on students and faculty, on people who work in Massachusetts and across this country, on people who have already been thoroughly screened for entry into the United States and have been granted permanent status to live and work in our country. This has nothing to do with security--nothing.  Little girls fleeing from murderers are not a threat. Elderly grandparents detained at airports are not a threat. Students and teachers and people who work in Massachusetts and across the country are not a threat. Iraqi translators who put their own lives at risk to protect American soldiers are not a threat. We should welcome them. We should welcome them with open arms. That is who we are.  Voices from across the political spectrum, including many of my friends from across the aisle, have already stepped forward to criticize this order, but criticism is not enough. President Trump's Executive order must be overturned. We must overturn it.  For those who remain unconvinced, I would like to take some time this evening to talk about some of the people who are hurt by the President's reckless, heartless, illegal, and unconstitutional actions. As stories have poured into my office, on the evening news, on social media, we have heard time and again about the consequences of President Trump's reckless and illegal order, and I would like to share some of those stories in my time tonight. I want to read one.  My staff and I have spent the weekend listening to and meeting with people who have been affected. I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of President Trump's actions. I want to start with a story of someone I met at Logan Airport on Saturday night. The story I want to read is from CBS Boston, ``Detainee Released After Federal Judge Grants Stay On Trump's Immigration Freeze.''       Hamed Hosseini Bay was questioned at Logan Airport Saturday      while trying to get back into America after caring for his      sick father in his native Hosseini Bay has lived in the      Boston area for approximately nine years. After a judge      granted a case brought by lawyers from the American Civil      Liberties Union Saturday night, Hosseini Bay was reunited      with his wife and daughter, who had traveled with him to Iran      but returned two weeks earlier.       He was not angry about his questioning.       ``Everybody was friendly,'' Hosseini Bay told WBZ-TV's Jim      ``They had to do what they had to do. I'm grateful for      all the people back there, but it was chaotic.''       Hosseini Bay's wife is now questioning what the future will      be like for her family in ``It's just terrifying how      my life has changed in two days, in three days,'' she said.      ``I don't know (about the future). Last week everything was      normal. I would pick up my daughter from preschool, she was      like everyone else, I was like everyone else. But now we're      different.''  I met with this family. This is what President Trump's order means. It means stopping people like this and telling them that their future is different now in  I am going to read another story. This one is from NBC ``Protesters Rally as Doctors, Students Blocked From Entering Country After Trump's Orders.''       At Boston's Logan International Airport, at least six      people from Iran were detained Saturday after their flights      landed in the U.A Federal judge in New York issued a      temporary stay late Saturday for all detainees affected by      Trump's executive orders, which barred all refugees from      entering the United States for four months, and indefinitely      halted any from Trump argued the ban is needed to keep      out ``radical Islamic terrorists.''       A tweet by Samira Asgari, an Iranian doctor, stated that      she was denied boarding when she arrived for her flight to      the U.S.[[Page S476]]     from In a Skype interview from Switzerland, Asgari      told us she had planned to come to the U.to start a study      at Harvard Medical School analyzing tuberculosis.       ``My view of America of course, doesn't change because of a      decision a politician makes. My view of America changes      because the land that used to be the land of those who want      to be there, who want to do something good to the community      and take something good from the community--that picture of      America has changed for me,'' she said.       Several students at Massachusetts colleges also tweeted      that they were being blocked from entering the country.       In a statement, MIT officials said they're ``very      troubled'' that Trump's executive order is affecting the      university's community and are exploring options for helping      impacted students.       Northeastern University in a statement to their community      offered support to their students, faculty and staff      reminding them of ``their commitment to each other.''       We believe in the commitment to inform each other, but that      is what it is that Donald Trump is trying to destroy.  Another story, from WBUR, a ``Somali Family Resettling In Lowell Worries For Other Refugees As Trump Promises Restrictions.''       The order will have global implications, including for one      newly arrived Somali family now living in       The three Ahmed sisters from Somalia huddled on a couch      with their mother in a lobby of a busy office. Each woman      wore a brightly colored head scarf and winter jacket, and      each clutched a plastic bag carrying their personal      documents.       They are the most recent refugees to be welcomed at the      International Institute of New England's Lowell resettlement      office. And, with Trump's refugee restrictions hanging in the      balance, they are likely the last Somali family to enter the      state for some time.       ``My mom and dad fled from the conflict in Mogadishu,''      explained Hawo Ahmed, 24. She and her twin sister were only 4      months old when their parents fled for       Hawo retold the story of her mother, Fatuma, and why she      and Hawo's father left in 1993 amid the Somali Civil       ``She said that it was, like, conflict all over the      country,'' Hawo said. ``People were killing each other, like      tribes, different tribes were killing each other. Whenever      they see you, they kill you, and they even used to come in      the houses to rape the girls and kill them. So they had to      move.''       The youngest daughter, Asha, was born in Kenya, where the      girls grew up, and went to school and learned Still,      they all very much consider themselves       When asked about their father, one of the young women said      she watched him die in 2006 from an asthma attack. She said      the family didn't have enough money for a new inhaler.       After beginning the refugee application process in Kenya 6      years ago, the family arrived in Manchester, NH, only a few      days ago.       Hawo and Muna said their arrival barely felt real, like a      dream come true. And then, Hawo said, as soon as they got off      the plane, they saw the news about Trump's executive orders      on the airport television.       ``Even tears were filled up in my eyes, because I felt very      bad for others,'' she said. ``They have more expectations,      some were even told where they are going, which city they are      going, and if they stop all the things, it's going to be very      painful. I just have a very sincere request to the President,      that he should drop out that idea. That is all.''       Hawo said that they know many fellow refugees in Kenya who      are in the final phases of their application process.       She said her aunt and cousin, who live in a refugee camp in      Kampala, Uganda, had only one more interview to complete      before they were hoping to meet them in Now      they're not sure what will happen.       ``I couldn't sleep last night just thinking about them, and      she has been in the process for so long, and we want, if you      can help her,'' Hawo said.  That is what Donald Trump is doing to people around the world.  Another story--WCVB       Trump's executive order worries Massachusetts family      awaiting loved one.       With the stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump fulfilled      a campaign promise that temporarily bans more than 130      million people from entering the United       Several people were prevented from entering Boston due to      Trump's executive order.       ``We are very worried. We are very concerned,'' Omar Salem,      of Canton, said. ``I'm hoping for the best. I'm hoping that I      could get a text from him saying, `I'm here.'''       Salem is anxiously awaiting his brother's arrival back in      The Syrian-born, Boston-based orthodontist was      on vacation when the President signed the executive order      suspending visa entry from seven countries.       ``We didn't know it was going to be that bad and that      shameful,'' Salem said.       Salem's brother thought his green card would be enough to      secure his return, but the business owner is now facing      uncertainty.       ``It always starts somewhere and we see it evolving to      become much bigger and much more sophisticated,'' Salem said.       While Salem is hoping to see his brother soon, his heart is      heavy for the millions of refugees and visa holders, who see      the U.as a sanctuary of freedom and acceptance.       ``I really call it un-American to do this with the stroke      of a pen,'' Salem said.       The seven countries included in the executive order may be      just a starting point as the order left room for a broader      ban.  That is what Donald Trump is doing around the world.  Another story--this is a Facebook post from Niki Rhamati, a student at       I just got back home (Tehran) and I figured I should break      the silence. I want to start by saying how grateful I am to      all the friends, faculty, alums, sorority sisters, staff and      admin at MIT and other parts of the US who have contacted me      in the past couple of hours. My inbox is flooded with      messages and emails of love and support. I am truly      speechless, grateful and proud to be part of the MIT      community. I have never been subjected to any form of      religious or racial discrimination at Our community is      extremely diverse, inclusive, supportive and accepting of      individuals and their backgrounds. But I cannot believe all      this love is coming from the same country that banned me from      entering its borders just a couple of hours ago.       I don't want to get to the political mess that has created      this situation for me and many others. I just want to share      what millions of other people and I are going through, and      simply what it feels like to be an Iranian and targeted to      such racism and discrimination--things I have been very      familiar with most of my life.       I currently have a valid multiple entry student visa that      I've used for the past year and a half and have traveled very      smoothly (thank you Obama!). I came home (Tehran) to visit my      parents and family. I suspected I would not be able to travel      as easily as before with the new President, so I extended my      stay.       Here's the story of what happened this past week. On      Wednesday, I woke up to the announcement of the new Executive      Order by President Trump that would restrict entry for Syrian      refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries      (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen) for 30      days. As BBC Persian, one of the reliable sources here,      contacted immigration attorneys and Politicians, this order      was read and interpreted as, ``issuance of any types of      immigrant and non-immigrant visas would be banned for      citizens of those countries for 30 days.''       The President had not yet signed this order so the ban was      not yet effective. I changed my flight to another one that      would get me to Boston on Saturday night with a transfer in      It was rumored that the President signed the Order      once I was on my way to the airport, and it was executed      while I was in my first flight to But I looked on the      White House website, BBC and Washington Post and nothing had      been published yet. When I got to Doha, I was stopped at the      gate for my U.flight.       We found out that the ban (which is effective for 90 days      now instead of 30), included everyone currently holding an      immigrant, student or tourist visa as well as Green Card      holders. We heard a lot of people were deported at the      American border in different cities.       About 30 other Iranians and I were stuck in Doha, waiting      for flights back to Among them were old couples      trying to go and see their children in the US, 2 old women      trying to be with and help their pregnant daughters there for      their third trimesters, students who had just gotten their      visas and families who had sold their belongings back home so      they could build a better life in the All these people      had gotten visas legally and had gone through background      checks. The President had said that the goal of this Order      was dealing with illegal immigration. Do any of the people      sound like illegal immigrants?       This will not secure the borders from the terrorism and      illegal immigrants. It will only increase racism in the      American society. The President is trying to make      Islamophobia a norm and policy by which he wants to lead the      country. There has not been a single terrorist activity from      those 7 countries listed above, in the       If you feel like helping millions of people facing this,      please contact your representatives or senators in your areas      and ask them to fight against this absurd ban. Reach out to      friends and ask them to do the same. Please also let me and      everyone else know how we can contribute to this.       As I was stuck in Doha, with other Iranians, I was telling      stories of interactions with many of the Americans I know.      Please know that I love and respect all of you because you      have always treated me with love and respect.  This is who Donald Trump is trying to keep out of the country.  Another story--this time from       A Syrian teen was headed to MIT and then came the ban.       Mahmoud Hassan was ecstatic when he got the acceptance      letter.       All through high school, the 18-year-old had one goal in      mind: get an engineering degree from the prestigious      Massachusetts Institute of       But Hassan is from Damascus, And Friday, he had his      hopes crushed through no fault of his own.[[Page S477]]       When President Trump signed the executive order on      immigration, temporarily banning citizens from certain      Muslim-majority countries, Syria was one of the seven.       ``Now Trump's orders will prevent me from going there,'' he      told ``My dreams are basically ruined.''       Hassan had been looking forward to his journey to the      Cambridge campus in the fall. He says he had been offered a      scholarship.       He's read and reread that letter from MIT dozens of times.       ``Dear Mahmoud, On behalf of the Admissions Committee, it      is my pleasure to offer you admission to the MIT Class of      2021!

He is currently safe in the United  Emam has also decided to begin his U.citizenship application, and the couple have two young children whom they are raising in the United States, afraid to travel outside the United States on business because of President Trump's ban.  Another story. This is a story via the Wall Street       Iraqi interpreter Laith al-Haydar received multiple death      threats for working with the American military at the height      of the war in his country. In return for helping the U.S., he      and tens of thousands of other Iraqis were promised U.     immigration visas.       Nearly four years after he applied, the 41-year-old father      of two is still waiting for a visa--and now he faces a new      setback: President Donald Trump signed an order suspending      immigration from several countries with a Muslim majority,      including Iraq, and a temporary ban on all refugees.       Mr.Haydar is among roughly 58,000 Iraqi applicants for      U.immigrant visas and refugee resettlement under the      federal programs that promised to fast-track entry for Iraqis      who worked with the U.government and other institutions      deemed critical to the U.S.-led effort in Iraq, according to      the State A similar program for Afghans who've      worked with the U.government may also be at risk.       At least one Iraqi and two Afghans who worked with the U.     government and also qualify for expedited immigration visas      were turned away from American ports of entry on Friday and      Saturday, a State Department official said, adding that      several more were prevented from boarding planes to the U.      A substantial backlog of applications remains in part      because Congress limits the number of visas that can be      granted each year. Frustration with visa delays has now been      aggravated by Mr.Trump's executive orders.       Critics of the visa ban say it abandons thousands of      valuable allies abroad and risks deterring such people from      working with the United States in the future at a time when      Mr.Trump is promising a more aggressive military posture      abroad.       ``These guys laid their lives on the line alongside      American soldiers and got paid a fraction of what I made,''      said Jake Thomas, a U.Army veteran who worked with ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS467-2.txt,2182,ADVANCED NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2017,2017.0,30.0,January
1281,topic-id,460,"Thank you, Mr. I will continue with the story that was published this morning in the Boston This is from a veteran who was writing of his own experiences.  He says:       Trump's executive order, which seeks to ``keep radical      Islamic terrorists out of the United States,'' will only      embolden those very same people, who already had a near-zero      chance of gaining entry to our country to begin with.

1719,topic-id,1349,"Mr.President, I rise today to express my strong opposition to President Trump's nomination of Rex Tillerson to be the next Secretary of There are many, many reasons to oppose this nomination, and my colleague from Washington has just listed several of them. But the main reason for me is as simple as it is disturbing: Tillerson's extensive and longstanding ties with Russia mean that the United States of America simply cannot trust him to be a strong advocate for the interests of our country.  Here is what has been publicly reported. Our intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian Government conducted a successful series of cyber attacks on the United States designed to help Donald Trump get elected Intelligence chiefs have briefed the President on a dossier alleging that the Russian Government has collected compromising information on him. And in response, the President has attacked the intelligence community.  This week, he installed his political crony, Steve Bannon, a man with ties to White nationalists, on the National Security Council while marginalizing the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National  Now, there is significant reason to believe that the President has extensive financial relationships with Russia, but nobody actually knows any of[[Page S529]]the details because he has refused to release his tax returns. And, apparently, the President's own national security adviser is currently under FBI investigation for his own interactions with the Russian  This is only the 12th day of the Trump Presidency, and this is what is going on right now--12 days. I wish this weren't happening. I wish things were normal, but this is not normal. We cannot simply ignore all of this as we evaluate the President's nominees to critical foreign policy and national security jobs.  I have heard some people say that Rex Tillerson doesn't know anything about diplomacy or have any experience with foreign policy. I actually think that is wrong.  For the last decade, Tillerson has served as the CEO of ExxonMobil, a massive company that would have roughly the 42nd largest economy in the entire world if it were its own country. As the leader of that giant oil company, Tillerson was an expert at diplomacy; specifically, how to advance the interests of his own fabulously wealthy oil company and himself, no matter the consequences for American foreign policy toward  Russia has vast oil resources, and Exxon is one of the world's largest oil companies. Getting at that oil is a critical priority for Exxon--such a high priority, in fact, that when it came time to pick a new CEO, Exxon chose Tillerson, who had spent years managing the company's Russia efforts. This isn't just a passing coincidence. Tillerson has worked closely with Putin's senior lieutenants, and, in 2013, Tillerson received the highest honor that the Kremlin gives to foreigners.  Tillerson's Russia projects ran into trouble the following year, however, because after Russia invaded Ukraine and started illegally annexing territory, Europe and the United States slapped sanctions on Those sanctions made life more difficult for Exxon, so Tillerson ignored them. He forged ahead despite the sanctions, signing more agreements with Russia, and then he used his army of well-funded lobbyists to undermine our sanctions with  When confronted with the facts about this in his confirmation hearing, Tillerson first pretended that he didn't know if the company had lobbied at all. And then later, he said: Well, the company simply participated in discussions with lawmakers without actually taking a position.  He is saying that they paid their lobbyists to show up and just talk generally, not to advance what the company wanted. You know, when you hear something that lame, you wonder just how dumb he thinks we are.  Mr.Tillerson has argued that in his job at Exxon he was advocating for the interests of his giant oil company. And he understands that being Secretary of State is a different job.  Really? At his hearing, Tillerson lamented that when sanctions are imposed, ``by their design, [they] are going to harm American businesses''--as though the principal question the Secretary of State should be asking when deciding whether to hold Russia accountable for hacking our elections or for annexing Crimea is whether it might dent the bottom line of a powerful oil company.  And has Tillerson really separated himself from Exxon? Tillerson is receiving a massive $180 million golden parachute for becoming Secretary of State--$180 million. It is a special payout that he wouldn't get if he were taking some other job. He is getting it only because he is coming to work for the government.  I have opposed these parachutes for many years now, and many of us have worked on legislation to make them criminally illegal--many of us. I have opposed nominees in my own party over them because if your employer offered you $180 million to go to work for the government, that looks an awful lot like a bribe for future services. This kind of payment raises questions about whether you work for the government, for a multinational oil company, or for both at the same time. America deserves a Secretary of State who works for the American people, period.  Will Tillerson help Exxon while he is in office? Well, the law requires him to recuse himself from any matters involving this company for how long? For just 1 year.  Common sense requires Tillerson, who, again, is receiving a $180 million special payment from the company where he has worked his entire adult life--common sense requires him to recuse himself from all matters involving Exxon for the entirety of his time in government. But when pressed by my Massachusetts colleague, Senator Markey, Tillerson flatly refused to do it.  Mr.Tillerson's views, experiences, relationships, and compromising arrangements with Russia aren't my only problem with this nomination, not by a long shot.  Mr.Tillerson's company has spent years lying about climate change. In Massachusetts, we have laws about consumer fraud: telling people lies about your product, lies that could make a difference about whether or not customers want to buy it. The Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healy, has been investigating whether Exxon deliberately misled people about the impact of climate change on our economy, on our environment, on our health, and on our future.  Exxon didn't want to answer, so they bullied and stonewalled all the way. But it hadn't worked. In fact, our attorney general won a court ruling earlier this month, and Exxon is being forced to hand over 40 years' worth of internal documents that will show what the company knew about climate change, when they knew it, and whether they lied to their customers, their investors, and the American public.  Tillerson bobbed and weaved on climate change at his confirmation hearing. I wonder if he is just trying to avoid accidentally saying anything that might help Massachusetts finally find out and hold his company accountable for massive fraud. Look, that may be OK for a CEO, but that is not good enough for someone who wants to be our Nation's Secretary of  Climate change is a defining issue of our time, and the last thing we should do is hand our foreign policy over to someone who cares more about lining his own pockets than the survival of our planet.  I could go on at length about the glaring problems with Mr.Tillerson's nomination. It is amazing how far we have fallen, to go from John Kerry, an accomplished statesman, combat veteran, Presidential candidate, long-time public servant, and son of Massachusetts, to a billionaire with a golden parachute and no record of public service or putting American foreign policy interests ahead of his own corporate interests.  When we vote, Senators should understand this: Handing American foreign policy over to the leader of a giant oil company is not something we do in the United States; it is something Vladimir Putin would do in  Donald Trump is building his Presidency in the image of Vladimir Putin, and that is good for Russia, but it is a real problem for  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

316,topic-id,467,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Young for being a great partner in the presentation of this bill. Many of us worked together on rural telecommunications issues, from getting broadband to all Vermonters and folks in rural parts of your districts to improving our wireless infrastructure to ensuring we have adequate choice and competition in cable markets. That is because it is our desire, and mine especially, to ensure that rural America has comparable telecom services to urban and suburban America, just as the 1996 Telecommunications Act requires. Making that happen requires constant effort and focus.  We often focus on rural broadband accessibility and affordability so that the next generation of technological innovation does not skip rural America and leave it behind. The promise of innovation, like the Internet of things, should not be earmarked just for urban and suburban America, which is why it is backwards and unfortunate that we are still talking about finding ways to ensure that traditional landline telephone calls can be completed without interruption on a consistent basis, but that is exactly what this bill that I worked on with Representative Young is getting at.  Our bill would require the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, to establish rules that require third-party providers--or least cost routers, as they are called, which is the problem in the call chain--to register their companies, for the first time, with the FCC and, therefore, have to comply with FCC service quality regulations, just like other companies.  This legislation would make it easier for the FCC to hold accountable third-party providers. The FCC will finally know who they are and make them comply with those quality standards.  This is really important in rural areas because we have got companies that do business with urban In Vermont, Dakin Farm had rural call completion problems during their busiest times in 2012. That was the Thanksgiving to Christmas holiday period.  It really hurt their bottom line. It put them at a competitive disadvantage. When people call in and the call is dropped, they think it is bad service from Dakin Farm or the company that they are calling, when it is not. Those folks have to then deal with the reputational harm that is caused.  It is important in rural school districts like Camels Hump in Vermont that rely on these calls when there is a snowstorm or ice storm--and there is one coming tonight--to check whether, in fact, they have got to get their kids to school or not. So it is a big deal when they need it.  I appreciate, by the way, the work that Representative Young has done on this. I look forward to this bill passing both Chambers and being signed into law so we can, hopefully, make rural call completion issues a thing of the past.                              {time}  1715  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH583.txt,1879,EPS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017,2017.0,23.0,January

58,topic-id,1879,"Mr.President, in my ``Time to Wake Up'' climate speech--this is 154--I sometimes feel as if I am out here banging hopelessly against a tightly locked, barred, and soundproofed door. I make them anyway because, at a minimum, I want history to know what happened here when people look back and ask what the hell went wrong with American democracy. But I do admit that it can sometimes be discouraging.  However, last week something important happened. A public servant won a victory against a massive special interest. A court in Massachusetts allowed the attorney general of that Commonwealth to obtain files and records from the ExxonMobil corporation about its climate denial enterprise.  That is great news, and it is an important event. There is virtually universal scientific consensus--and even alarm--about climate and oceanic changes caused by burning the fossil fuel industry's products. In the face of that concern, the fossil fuel industry has gone to the mattresses to defend its business model. It is defending what the International Monetary Fund has described as a $700 billion--billion with a ``b''--annual subsidy just in the United  To defend a prize of that magnitude, the industry has set up an array of front groups to obscure its hand and to[[Page S332]]propagate fake science designed to raise doubts about the real thing. With that fake science, they dupe the public and provide talking points for their political operatives. The front groups are a tentacled Hydra named after everyone from Cato to Madison, Jefferson, and Franklin, to George The resemblances between this fossil fuel climate denial operation and the tobacco fraud scheme are profound, and these resemblances are noted often, including by the lawyer who won the tobacco case. Yes, the Department of Justice won that case.  At the same time, the fossil fuel industry has taken advantage of the political weaponry handed to them by five Republican appointees on the Supreme This industry has used the unprecedented political power bestowed on mighty special interests by the Citizens United decision to extirpate--root out--any Republican support for climate action. When I got here, there was plenty of Republican support for climate action, but after Citizens United that changed. They have seized that party like a hostile political takeover and turned the Republican Party into the fossil fuel industry's political arm. It turns out that you can do this on the cheap, compared to losing a subsidy of $700 billion a year.  This whole scheme reeks of mischief and self-interest, but in political forums the industry is such a powerful behemoth that it can block proper hearings, spout calculated misinformation, cloud up the truth, lobby to its heart's content, refuse to answer questions, pile up the spin doctors and front groups, buy and rent politicians, and threaten to end careers of anyone who crosses them--and they do. They made an example of Representative Bob Inglis and bragged of the political peril--their words--that would result to those who crossed them. That is how they play in the political branches. Truth doesn't matter to them. Truth is their adversary.  But you cannot play that way in court. That is why last week's victory was important. Court is different. In court you have to speak truthfully. Your lawyers can be sanctioned for lying in court. In court, your testimony is under oath, and you can be cross-examined. In court, evidence can be demanded and must be produced. In court, you cannot buy a judge's good will or bully a jury into compliance. Tampering with the jury is a crime. Judges cannot meet secretly with one side. No money can change hands, and biased judges must be recused.  Sir William Blackstone was the best-known jurist in England and America at the time of the Trial by jury, he said, ``preserves in the hands of the people that share which they ought to have in the administration of public justice, and prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens.''  No wonder powerful and wealthy ExxonMobil wants no part of that. This industry has gotten used to saying things with no accountability, dodging the truth, hiding the evidence, and using the massive weight of their political might to see to it that Congress has just the right bias wherever fossil fuel interests are a concern.  This Massachusetts ruling is a chink of light--and a welcome one--as darkness falls over an executive administration stuffed with nominees from the climate denial fringe, wrapped tight in the political tentacles of fossil fuel interests.  It makes the fossil fuel folks crazy to be called into court and to have to stand annoyingly equal before the law when they are used to being the big behemoth, able to tell everyone what to do or pay them or threaten them to do what industry wants. That is why they launched legislative subpoenas at attorneys general and what even Texas newspapers have called out as unseemly abuse of government power.  That is why they rush to the oil patch for judges who will interfere in investigations by attorneys general, even suggesting that attorneys general should not pursue cases against corporations whom they believe are responsible for misconduct because believing that is prejudicial.  Think of that. That is why the industry PR machine creates and propagates magical theories about the industry's First Amendment rights, when it is black letter law--admitted even by Senator Sessions in his Judiciary Committee hearing--that the First Amendment ends where fraud begins. Fraudulent speech, including fraudulent corporate speech, is not protected by the First It is not now, and it never has been.  To clarify this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a June 2016 Washington Post op-ed by Yale Law School dean Robert Post titled ``Exxon-Mobil is abusing the first amendment.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, June 24, 2016]               Exxon-Mobil Is Abusing the First Amendment                            (By Robert Post)       Global warming is perhaps the single most significant      threat facing the future of humanity on this planet. It is      likely to wreak havoc on the economy, including, most      especially, on the stocks of companies that sell hydrocarbon      energy products. If large oil companies have deliberately      misinformed investors about their knowledge of global      warming, they may have committed serious commercial fraud.       A potentially analogous instance of fraud occurred when      tobacco companies were found to have deliberately misled      their customers about the dangers of smoking. The safety of      nicotine was at the time fiercely debated, just as the threat      of global warming is now vigorously contested. Because      tobacco companies were found to have known about the risks of      smoking, even as they sought to convince their customers      otherwise, they were held liable for fraud. Despite the      efforts of tobacco companies to invoke First Amendment      protections for their contributions to public debate, the      Court of Appeals for the D.Circuit found: ``Of course it      is well settled that the First Amendment does not protect      fraud.''       The point is a simple one. If large corporations were free      to mislead deliberately the consuming public, we would live      in a jungle rather than in an orderly and stable market.       ExxonMobil and its supporters are now eliding the essential      difference between fraud and public debate. Raising the      revered flag of the First Amendment, they loudly object to      investigations recently announced by attorneys general of      several states into whether ExxonMobil has publicly      misrepresented what it knew about global warming.       The National Review has accused the attorneys general of      ``trampling the First Amendment.'' Post columnist George      Will has written that the investigations illustrate the      ``authoritarianism'' implicit in progressivism, which seeks      ``to criminalize debate about science.'' And Hans von      Spakovsky, speaking for the Heritage Foundation, compared the      attorneys general to the Spanish       Despite their vitriol, these denunciations are wide of the      mark. If your pharmacist sells you patent medicine on the      basis of his ``scientific theory'' that it will cure your      cancer, the government does not act like the Spanish      Inquisition when it holds the pharmacist accountable for      fraud.       The obvious point, which remarkably bears repeating, is      that there are circumstances when scientific theories must      remain open and subject to challenge, and there are      circumstances when the government must act to protect the      integrity of the market, even if it requires determining the      truth or falsity of those theories. Public debate must be      protected, but fraud must also be suppressed. Fraud is      especially egregious because it is committed when a seller      does not himself believe the hokum he foists on an unwitting      public.       One would think conservative intellectuals would be the      first to recognize the necessity of prohibiting fraud so as      to ensure the integrity of otherwise free markets.      Prohibitions on fraud go back to Roman times; no sane market      could exist without them.       It may be that after investigation the attorneys general do      not find evidence that ExxonMobil has committed fraud. I do      not prejudge the question. The investigation is now entering      its discovery phase, which means it is gathering evidence to      determine whether fraud has actually been committed.       Nevertheless, ExxonMobil and its defenders are already      objecting to the subpoena by the attorneys general, on the      grounds that it ``amounts to an impermissible content-based      restriction on speech'' because its effect is to ``deter      ExxonMobil from participating in the public debate over      climate change now and in the future.'' It is hard to      exaggerate the brazen audacity of this argument.       If ExxonMobil has committed fraud, its speech would not      merit First Amendment protection. But the company      nevertheless invokes the First Amendment to suppress a      subpoena designed to produce the information necessary to      determine whether ExxonMobil has committed fraud. It thus      seeks to foreclose the very process by which our legal system      acquires the evidence necessary to determine whether fraud      has been committed. In effect, the company seeks to use the      First Amendment to prevent any informed lawsuit for fraud.       But if the First Amendment does not prevent lawsuits for      fraud, it does not prevent subpoenas designed to provide      evidence necessary to establish fraud. That is why when a      libel plaintiff sought to inquire into the editorial      processes of CBS News and CBS[[Page S333]]     raised First Amendment objections analogous to those of      ExxonMobil, the Supreme Court in the 1979 case Herbert v.      Lando unequivocally held that the Constitution does not      preclude ordinary discovery of information relevant to a      lawsuit, even with respect to a defendant news organization.       The attorneys general are not private plaintiffs. They      represent governments, and the Supreme Court has always and      rightfully been extremely reluctant to question the good      faith of prosecutors when they seek to acquire information      necessary to pursue their official obligations. If every      prosecutorial request for information could be transformed      into a constitutional attack on a defendant's point of view,      law enforcement in this country would grind to a halt.      Imagine the consequences in prosecutions against terrorists,      who explicitly seek to advance a political ideology.       It is grossly irresponsible to invoke the First Amendment      in such contexts. But we are witnessing an increasing      tendency to use the First Amendment to unravel ordinary      business regulations. This is heartbreaking at a time when we      need a strong First Amendment for more important democratic      purposes than using a constitutional noose to strangle basic      economic regulation.

59,topic-id,296,"Mr.President, it makes this industry crazy to be in court and to have to tell the truth, so they will fight desperately on. The $700 billion a year in subsidies makes it profitable to ``lawyer up'' by the boatload for this fight and to litigate to their damndest. So this is not over, but this may be the moment when the truth finally found a path around the ramparts of our well-kept congressional indifference and began to find its way into the daylight.  That is one of the reasons the Founding Fathers gave us independent courts and juries. ``Representative government and trial by jury are the heart and lungs of liberty,'' wrote John Independent courts and trial by jury were a big deal to the founding generation. The Founding Fathers had a keen sense of history and of politics and of the mischief of conniving men. They were deeply concerned about corruption--corruption of the body politic by interests and factions.  They knew the Bible and had read Isaiah's warning of how ``the faithful city has become a whore,'' with ``princes'' that are ``companions of thieves.'' They knew about abusive power. They could envision an interest become so powerful as to overwhelm the executive and legislative branches of government and bend those branches to its will. They could envision a special interest so powerful that it could buy its own presses and confuse or beguile the public with propaganda and nonsense. They could envision special interests so powerful as to abuse and distort the very democracy they were building.  So there stand the courts and there stands the jury, the places in our system of government where money has no sway and where evidence, testimony, and truth rule the day.

893,topic-id,687,"Mr.President, Republicans in Congress have been on the warpath for a long time to repeal the Affordable Care In fact, in this new Congress, their first order of business has been to pave the way for dismantling this law. Despite the fact that 20 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage thanks to this law, despite people no longer being denied coverage for preexisting conditions, despite big savings in health care costs, and despite everyone with insurance being able to access important preventive health services for free, my Republican colleagues have decided to repeal it. And, after 7 years to get ready, they have no replacement, not even a path to a replacement at this point.  Yes, they are set on repealing a law that has provided both health and financial security to millions of Americans, with no replacement in sight, just at this point some empty IOU for some future piece of legislation that may or may not be any good. It is a little like being asked to jump out of an airplane without a parachute and being told: Trust us. We will build the parachute for you before you hit the ground.  We don't know what this nonexistent Republican replacement would look[[Page S422]]like, but we sure do know what a repeal would do; it would gut health insurance premium tax credits that help millions of Americans obtain health insurance they could not otherwise afford. It would unwind an expansion of the Medicaid Program that covers millions more Americans in some 30 States that have chosen to participate, casting tens of millions of Americans--men, women, and children--out of their health insurance.  At the same time, it would deliver an enormous tax boon to millionaires and billionaires, as usual for Republicans, by repealing the revenue we used to pay for This tax boon is a 16-percent reduction in the taxes owed by millionaires and billionaires on their investment income.  Republicans want to take health insurance away from tens of millions of ordinary Americans and simultaneously reward those at the very top of the income pile with a big tax benefit. So much for all the talk we have heard from Republicans about the deficit.  At least in Rhode Island, the Affordable Care Act is working. The law launched accountable care organizations that are improving care while lowering costs. In Rhode Island, Coastal Medical and Integra Community Care Network--two primary care-focused ACOs--are not only driving down per person health expenditures but achieving high marks on quality and on patient experience. In total, Coastal has saved $24 million over 3 years and Integra has saved $4 million in its first year as an  The Affordable Care Act also has protected seniors from the dreaded drug price doughnut hole, and I can tell you I heard a lot about the doughnut hole from seniors in Rhode Island when I was running for the The Affordable Care Act has protected families where someone had a chronic condition and couldn't get insurance, and the Affordable Care Act has prevented insurers from throwing customers off coverage when they get sick.  It is true that some of the health insurance exchanges haven't attracted enough competition. We can fix that. Indeed, to help with that issue, Senators Brown, Franken, and I are today introducing the Consumer Health Options and Insurance Competition Enhancement Act, or the CHOICE Act, to add a public health insurance option to the health insurance exchanges. This public option would guarantee that consumers always have an affordable, high-quality option when shopping for health insurance and a strong health care fallback when markets fail.  ObamaCare may not be perfect, but it has done an awful lot of good. Millions of Americans who lacked insurance now have it, and the rate of uninsured Americans has fallen to 8.6 percent, about half of what it was in 2010. Projected Federal health care costs are down nearly $3 trillion.  Instead of demolishing a system that works well for millions of Americans with no replacement on the horizon, let's use our proposal to make it better. Let's add a public option to our health insurance exchanges.  ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS421.txt,1823,1415,2017.0,24.0,January

896,topic-id,795,"Mr.President, the question I bring to the floor today is what is Scott Pruitt hiding? Last week, the Environment and Public Works Committee held a hearing on President Trump's nominee to the Environmental Protection Today, for my 155th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I have unanswered questions about Mr.Pruitt's fitness for that role. His evasiveness at his hearing signaled nothing good about his ties to the industry he would regulate if confirmed, and the lack of curiosity about these industry ties from my Republican colleagues speaks volumes about the political clout of that industry.  One question stood out. Our new chairman, Senator Barrasso, posed the standard question of nominees to Mr.Pruitt in our hearing: ``Do you know of any matters, which you may or may not have disclosed, that might place you in any conflict of interest if you are confirmed?''  Mr.Pruitt answered: ``No.''  Scott Pruitt crawls with conflict of interest. He has conflicts of interest with the fossil fuel industry from his political fundraising. We just don't know how bad. He likely has conflicts of interest from confidential private meetings with fossil fuel companies at Republican Attorneys General Association get-togethers, but we just don't know how bad. There is almost certainly evidence of conflict of interest in his undisclosed emails with fossil fuel companies, but again we don't know how bad. He came clean on none of this in his confirmation hearing.  This chart is a simple, and a likely incomplete, representation of the many financial links reported between Pruitt and the fossil fuel industry. At the top are the companies and the entities that have supported Mr.Pruitt with political funding. Down below are the political organizations for which he has raised money.  Pruitt for Attorney General was his reelection campaign. The polluters gave to Pruitt for Attorney Oklahoma's Strong PAC was his leadership PAC, a separate political fundraising vehicle. The polluters gave to Oklahoma  There was another one here called Liberty 2.0, Mr.Pruitt's super PAC, but he closed it down so we don't list it. While it existed, his super PAC took nearly $200,000 in fossil fuel industry contributions. Mr.Pruitt served as the chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association in 2012 and 2013 and was a member of RAGA's executive committee through 2015. Between 2014 and 2016, RAGA received $530,000 from Koch It received $350,000 from Murray It received $160,000 from ExxonMobil, and it received $125,000 from Devon  Devon Energy, by the way, is the company whose letter Mr.Pruitt transposed virtually verbatim onto his official letterhead to send to the EPA as the official position of the Oklahoma attorney general.  During his hearing, Mr.Pruitt refused to provide details about any solicitations he made from regulated industries for the Republican Attorneys General We know they got special attention from Here is a confidential 2015 meeting agenda from RAGA when Pruitt was on its executive committee.

897,topic-id,1039,"This confidential agenda mentions a private meeting[[Page S423]]with Murray It mentions a private meeting with Southern Company, and it mentions a private meeting with American Fuel Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents a lot of these characters. Murray Energy, of course, is right there. Southern Company is right there, and the American Fuel Petrochemical Manufacturers organization, I am sure, represents the others.  This confidential meeting agenda is all we have about what took place in those private meetings. I asked Mr.Pruitt in our hearings about the content of these private meetings, and he wouldn't answer any questions. He doesn't want us to know what was discussed there with the big fossil fuel polluters--companies whose pollution he will oversee as EPA  Pruitt was also a chairman of the Rule of Law Defense The so-called Rule of Law Defense Fund is a dark money political operation that launders the identity of donors giving money to the Republican Attorneys General As the New York Times said, the fund is a ``legal entity that allows companies benefiting from the actions of Mr.Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general to make anonymous donations, in unlimited amounts.'' It is a complete black hole of political cash.  In the hearing, Pruitt refused to shine any light into the dark money he solicited or received from these fossil fuel polluters or others for the Rule of Law Defense Fund--not whom he asked for money, not who gave money, not what they gave, nothing. This is an organization that appears to have a million-dollar-a-year budget so someone was busy raising a lot of money. How much exactly, from whom, and what was the deal? Scott Pruitt doesn't want our committee or this Senate or the American people to know.  Colleagues and I sent letters to the Office of Government Ethics and to the Environmental Protection Agency's top ethics official. Their responses indicate that their ethics rules predate Citizens United and its torrent of dark political money. Their regulatory authority on government ethics has not caught up with the post-Citizens United dark money world. Since their ethics authorities have not been updated for these dark money conflicts, if Pruitt doesn't disclose any of this information before the Senate, no one will know, and even those government ethics watchdogs may end up blind to conflicts of interest.  That doesn't mean there isn't a conflict of interest here. What it means is it is a hidden conflict of interest. That makes it our duty in the Senate to examine those relationships, except for the fact that the fossil fuel industry now, more or less, runs the Republican Party, so there is a scrupulous lack of interest in this fossil fuel industry dark money.  How badly does Mr.Pruitt want to hide his dealings with his fossil fuel patrons? An Open Records Act request was filed with the Oklahoma attorney general's office--Mr.Pruitt's office--for emails with energy firms, fossil fuel trade groups, and their political arms, with companies like Devon Energy, Murray Energy, and Koch Industries, and the American Petroleum Institute, which is the industry's trade association.  Let me share three facts about this Open Records Act inquiry: 1, the Open Records Act request was filed more than 745 days ago--over 2 years, 2 years. 2, Pruitt's office has admitted that there are at least 3,000 responsive documents to that Open Records Act request. Consider that fact alone for a moment. There were 3,000 emails and other documents between his office and these fossil fuel companies and front groups--3,000. 3, zero, exactly zero of those documents have been produced--745 days, 3,000 documents, zero produced.  Think how smelly those 3,000 emails must be when he would rather have this flagrant Open Records Act compliance failure than have any of those 3,000 emails see the light of day. Given the important financial interests of these groups before the EPA, do we really not think that 3,000 emails back and forth between him and his office and those groups might be relevant to his conflicts of interest as Administrator? Until very recently, Republicans had a keen interest in emails. Chairman Barrasso asked that important question: ``Do you know of any matters which you may or may not have disclosed that might place you in any conflict of interest if you are confirmed?'' Scott Pruitt answered: ``No.''  On this record, there is every reason to believe that his statement is false. Might having raised significant dark money from the industry that he would regulate create a conflict of interest? Let's say that he made a call to Devon Energy and said: I slapped your letter on my letterhead and turned it in as if it were the official work of the Oklahoma attorney general's office. Now I need a million bucks. And you can give it to the Rule of Law Defense Fund as dark money, without anyone knowing that it was you.  Might such a quid pro quo create a conflict of interest in his ability to carry out the duties of EPA Administrator in matters affecting Devon Energy? It is impossible to say that it would not be a conflict of interest.  Let's say that at those confidential private meetings with Murray Energy and Southern Company, something went on. Might something that takes place in private meetings with Big Energy interests that he is going to have to regulate create a possible conflict of interest? They paid to be there. They wanted something. Might that not give rise to a conflict of interest?  And who knows what conflicts of interest would be divulged if his office were not sitting on 3,000 undisclosed emails with fossil fuel industries that he will be regulating as EPA Administrator?  I challenge anyone to come to this Senate floor and tell me with a straight face that there is nothing that those emails could reveal that might create a conflict of interest for the man discharged with regulating the companies on the other end of those emails. ``No'' just doesn't cut it as an answer from Mr.Pruitt when there is still so much that he is hiding.

75,topic-id,1252,"Mr.President, I spent the last few days having town hall meetings at home. It was a big challenge. We had a tremendous amount of snow. The distinguished Presiding Officer is very familiar with that. We had the most snow since 1937, and it just goes on and on. We are battling freezing rain. Yet Oregonians came out in big numbers to participate in the discussion about what is going on in Washington, They were particularly troubled about what was being done at the Environmental Protection Agency in the nomination of Scott Pruitt to head it. We had 200 people in McMinnville on Saturday night, a small community. I think the temperature was about 22 degrees. What really troubled them is that it sure looks like, when you examine the record of Mr.Pruitt, that he is trampling on everything we call the Oregon The Oregon Way is something that Democrats, Republicans, people across the political spectrum subscribe to because it involves protecting our treasured land, air, and water. It was something we want for our generation, and we will pass it on to our kids, and it has been hugely valuable to us in attracting more industries that pay well because the workers at those industries want clean air and clean water.  When you look at Mr.Pruitt's career, it really upends everything that I would call the Oregon Way--repeated attempts to weaken or eliminate health-based environmental standards, air quality standards for toxic air pollutants, limits on carbon emissions to take on the challenge of climate change. These rollbacks are particularly harmful to children and low-income households, communities of color, minorities, families, and communities.  Yesterday, Senator Merkley and I spoke at our wonderful Martin Luther King Day Breakfast put on by The Bernie and Bobbie Foster have been doing this for years. All I could think of is, if you roll back clean air and health standards, the people who are going to be hurt the most are low-income minorities, and communities of color. I don't see a big outcry in America for policies that would do that kind of harm to some of the most vulnerable  Mr.Pruitt also has a troubling history of denying that fundamental science really ought to be the basis of American policymaking when it comes to environmental protection.  For example, he disputed the Agency's science-based findings in 2009 that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. Now, my view is that this is an inarguable and unfortunate reality of climate change. But Mr.Pruitt's challenge suggests either a misunderstanding about how environmental agencies ought to make science-based decisions or, even worse, a habit of setting science aside when the outcome is at odds with the special interests.  Again, that comes back to the kind of comments that were made during my five town hall meetings over the last few days at home. People would say: Look, Democrats and Republicans at home in Oregon, great Republican Governors--particularly led by the late Tom McCall--they would constantly come back to the proposition that you should not let the special interests trample on your treasures, your land and your air and your water, because not only was it bad for this generation--our generation--but it would be particularly damaging to our young people.  So it is really troubling that this has been the choice of the President-elect. My own view is that when it comes to environmental standards, one of the unsung successes of the last few years has been a rule cutting emissions of mercury, arsenic, lead, and other dangerous materials. It prevented, in 2016, 11,000 premature deaths. My concern is that a lot of those deaths would be seen in minority communities and communities of color, the people I was concerned about when we had our Martin Luther King Day  Mr.Pruitt worked hard to gut that rule. He really pulled out all the stops to oppose a rule cutting emissions of mercury, arsenic, lead and dangerous heavy metals. He worked hard to gut it. If he is confirmed, he may just possibly be successful.  Now, the message that I have heard again and again is that we can do better than this. We can do better than this. I think the American people, when they see what is at stake--it has been hard to follow all of the hearings. I know that I was very interested in the questioning in the Foreign Relations Committee by the Presiding I was trying to follow all the nominations, and I could not get to all the hearings. I could not follow all of the questioning that I thought was important.  But even when all of this is going on, when people tell you before a Trailblazers game--at home in Portland, a pregame event--that they are unhappy about the environmental rules and the prospects of the environmental rules being gutted by the new head of the EPA, you know that you have people alarmed.  Oregon is no stranger to the threats of pollution. In 2015, there was a discovery that heavy metals, including cadmium and arsenic, had been emitted for decades into the air of Portland neighborhoods at dangerous levels.  This pollution was caused by a regulatory loophole the size of Crater At the time, I called on the Environmental Protection Agency to take action. Within days, they were on the ground in Portland helping to assess the public health risks. Not long after, they identified the cause of the regulatory oversight and corrected course.  It seems to me that Americans need to trust that the Environmental Protection Agency will be able to defend their communities from air pollution or from water contamination. That is how we have always looked at it in my home State of We always felt that we could trust those that we elected of both political parties for years and years to say: You don't mess with Oregon's land and air and water.  Now, obviously, we have continued, even with that ethic, to have problems. While I was pleased that we were able to get some significant public health changes after we made that discovery in 2015 that there were heavy metals, including cadmium and arsenic, in the air of our neighborhoods, we have to do better. We have to do better at every level of government, and the EPA plays a critical role in ensuring clean and safe water, whether the water is running through a mountain stream or through a pipe to a Portland kitchen. Cities across the country, like my home town of Portland, are facing threats with high levels of lead in the water supply and outdated infrastructure to fix the problem.  These communities are counting on the Environmental Protection Agency[[Page S338]]to be in a partnership with them to get this fixed to enforce strong water quality standards, and it only can happen if you have strong leadership that starts at the top. The American people have a right to have confidence that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency is going to defend the health and well-being of our communities and not the profits and the pocketbooks of the most powerful special interests in our country.  I am going to close by saying that I am not confident that a Pruitt EPA will stand on the side of those families against the special interests.

438,topic-id,3711,"Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I want to thank Senator Leahy, particularly because, once again, on this issue he showed there was a path forward that was bipartisan. The senior Senator from Vermont got together with our colleague from Utah, Senator Lee, and the two of them set out from the get-go to try to find common ground.  I think most people didn't give us great odds. Senator Leahy and I used to talk about how when we began the effort, being on the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, a group of us could probably have met in a phone booth, but then, under Senator Leahy's leadership, we began to pick up colleagues from both sides of the aisle.  The Obama administration, which we both remember, had reservations at the beginning. We said: Look, we can find a way. The intelligence community said to go forward with this, but this didn't happen by osmosis. It happened under the leadership of Senator Leahy and Senator Lee, our colleague on the other side of the aisle. One of the reasons we feel so strongly, as the Senator from Vermont has stated, is that if we are not careful, particularly with this nomination, we could undo, we could unravel a lot of that good bipartisan work.  I know my colleague has a tight schedule, and I so appreciate his coming over and very much recognize that one of the reasons we are here is to make sure we don't undo the good bipartisan work that he has authored.  Madam President, today the Senate is doing something that doesn't happen often around here--having an open debate about the future of the Central Intelligence The Central Intelligence Agency, in my view, is an enormously important and valuable part of our government. It is staffed by thousands and thousands of patriotic Americans who make extraordinary sacrifices on our behalf. They work so hard to protect our country in so many ways Americans will never find out about. They give up their time. They give up their weekends, family vacations, and all kinds of things that would be scheduled that they would enjoy personally, and they give it up on 1 or 2 hours' worth of notice because they want to protect the security and the well-being of our The fact is, many at the CIA have risked their lives defending us and some have made the ultimate sacrifice with their lives.  When you talk about the CIA on the Senate floor, it is especially important to protect the people I have just mentioned and to protect what are called their sources and methods. Sources and methods are the secret means by which the CIA gets the information that is needed for our national security, and it needs to stay classified. While sources and methods need to stay classified, the debate about our laws and those who execute them is a public matter. The policies that guide what the CIA does in its important work--the debate about policies always has to be public. The nomination of a CIA Director is a rare and important chance to talk about what the nominee thinks those policies ought to be.  In the beginning, I am going to offer my guiding principle. Smart national security policies protect both our security and our liberty, and they recognize that security and liberty are not mutually exclusive; that it is possible to have both; that it is essential to have both. Nothing illustrates the need for policies that promote security and liberty more clearly than the issue of encryption, which we will be talking about--in my view--at length in this Congress as part of the intelligence debate.  Strong encryption protects Americans from foreign hackers, criminals, identity thieves, stalkers, and other bad actors. It is the key to protecting our cyber security. Yet there are some in government and some in the Congress who think it would make sense to require American companies to build backdoors into their products so the government can get access to that information. My own view is this would be an enormous mistake, a mistake from a security standpoint, a mistake from a liberty standpoint, and also very damaging to our companies--companies that produce jobs with good wages. I have been fighting against ill-advised encryption proposals because they would be bad for security for the reason I mentioned. It would be a big gift to foreign hackers and bad for liberty. The reality is, if we require our companies to build backdoors into their products, the first thing that is going to happen is all the companies overseas, where they will not have such rules, will benefit enormously. A lot of good-paying jobs--high-skill, high-wage jobs--would be at risk. I bring this up only by way of stressing how important it is that we get this right; that we advance policies that promote security and liberty and we recognize right at the get-go that they are not mutually exclusive.  With that in mind, we turn to the nomination of Congressman Mike Pompeo to be the Director of the Central Intelligence After consideration of his testimony and a review of his past statements--and response to written questions--I have concluded that he is the wrong man for the job. He has endorsed extreme policies that would fundamentally erode the liberties and freedoms of our people without making us safer. He has been unwilling to provide meaningful responses to my questions with respect to these views. When he has provided responses, they have often either been so vague or so contradictory that it is impossible to determine what his core beliefs are or what he might actually do if he is confirmed.  On issue after issue, the Congressman has taken two, three, or four positions, depending on when he says it and whom he is talking to. He has done this with surveillance, with torture, with Russia, and a number of other subjects. So now we are at the end of the confirmation process. There has been a hearing. I met with the nominee in private. We submitted two sets of questions, both before and after the hearing. Despite it all, it has been impossible to walk away with consistent answers on the Congressman's beliefs on how he would lead the Central Intelligence  Let me begin with surveillance. Just over a year ago, after the USA FREEDOM Act had become law, Congressman Pompeo wrote in an op-ed that Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all metadata. This was a reference to the program in which the government collected and kept the records of tens of millions of innocent When the American people found out about this program, they were rightly horrified and they rejected it, which was why--as we touched on this afternoon on a bipartisan basis--Congress abolished the program through the USA FREEDOM That law got the government out of the business of collecting these millions of phone records on law-abiding people, and it did nothing to harm our security. For example, I am very proud that I was able to work in a bipartisan way to author a provision that allowed the government, in emergency circumstances, to get phone records immediately and then go back later and seek court approval. I wrote that provision to make sure that when the security of our great Nation was on the line, it would be possible for our national security officials to move immediately, without delay, to get the information that was needed. Congressman Pompeo himself voted for the USA FREEDOM Act before he turned around 8 months later and wrote that he wanted to reestablish this sweeping and unnecessary program. So understand the timeline. The Congressman talks about voting for the USA FREEDOM Act, but after he cast that vote, he came out in a widely circulated article in the Wall Street Journal for a proposal that really makes all the earlier collection of phone records about law-abiding people look like small potatoes. I am going to discuss that this afternoon.  The question really is, What does the Congressman believe? Does he stand by his vote to abolish the NSA phone records dragnet? Was that what he was suggesting when he brought up that vote during his hearing or does he stand by what he wrote in his major opinion article that came out well after the law he voted for? In response to questions, the Congressman wrote[[Page S374]]that he believes the collection of tens of millions of Americans' phone records provided a significant tool for the intelligence community and that ``I have not changed my position.'' That sounds like an endorsement of the mass surveillance of phone records.  Again, in the hearing, the nominee said something else. Senator Heinrich asked him whether he had been briefed on whether the current process--where the government collects phone records on an individual basis rather than in bulk from millions of Americans, even if they are not suspected of a crime--protects our Nation as well as the liberty of millions of innocent The Congressman is a member of the House Intelligence Committee so he has had the opportunity to be briefed on this topic, but here is his response to Senator Heinrich: ``Senator, I have not had a chance to have a complete briefing on that, but I can say I have not heard anything that suggests that there is a need for change today.'' In other words, in just a matter of days, Congressman Pompeo has taken the position, first, that the bulk collection of American phone records was a significant tool and that it should be reestablished, and, second, while testifying to the committee, that he has no basis on which to believe that is necessary. That is such a head scratcher, I just don't know how to go about squaring these truly conflicting statements.  What troubles me especially is if the Congressman were to be confirmed as CIA Director, the doors would close and he would operate in secret. Yet Americans do not know which position he would take in running the The American people have no idea how Congressman Pompeo would advise the President and his national security team on what is truly necessary to protect the  Phone records are not the only communication records we need to be concerned about. Until a few years ago, the NSA also ran a program in which millions of Americans' email records were collected. Since the Congressman wrote that he wanted to reestablish collecting all of the metadata, I asked him whether he would support the resumption of that program as well and whether he believed that millions of Americans' email records should be combined with millions of American phone records. He could have said no. He could have clarified that he was only talking about phone records. Instead, he ducked taking a position. In fact, he even indicated that he would be open to including email records in his new database. His exact words were: ``If I am confirmed and agency officials inform me that they believe the current programs and legal framework are insufficient to protect the country, I would make appropriate recommendations for any needed changes to laws and regulations.''  What is especially troubling about this is that the bulk email program was discontinued because it wasn't effective. I spent a lot of time pressing intelligence officials to give us some evidence that you had to go out and collect all of these email records from law-abiding In the end, the Agency decided to look at it, and they came to the same conclusion I did; that it wasn't needed. That is not a judgment about whether the program violated Americans' privacy because it definitely did that. The NSA determined that--in its words, not mine--the program did not meet their ``operational expectations.'' This is public information. All the details are available to the House Intelligence Committee on which the Congressman sits. This should have been an easy answer for the nominee, but he refused to rule out the inclusion of millions of Americans' email records--records the NSA has said it doesn't need--in what would be his idea of a massive new government database.  The collection of phone and email records of millions of innocent Americans is small potatoes compared to what the nominee wrote next. His proposal was to combine all of the communications metadata, and these are his words, with ``publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive searchable data base.'' This is far bigger and more encompassing than any such data collection program that the Bush-Cheney administration ever imagined.  I have been a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee since before 9/11. I have been in a lot of debates about the appropriate scope of government surveillance. I have never heard ever--not from anyone--an idea so extreme, so overarching, and so intrusive on Americans' privacy. I wanted to give the Congressman the opportunity to explain what he was actually proposing. So during the confirmation hearing--and later in what are questions that are submitted to him--I tried to find out what his database would include and what, if anything, it wouldn't include. I could not get substantive answers. What we basically got was a big word salad with a liberal helping of words that just kind of skirted the issue. My folks would call them weasel words.  The Congressman did mention social media in his answers. But it is one thing for the government to read the social media postings of Americans because there is a specific reason to do so; it is something else entirely to create a giant government database of everyone's social media postings and to match that up with everyone's phone records. We asked where the nominee would draw the line. He wouldn't say.  Congressman Pompeo's vision of this vast government database doesn't stop, by the way, with social media. What he wrote in his responses to my questions was that he was ``generally'' referring to publicly available information on the Internet or other ``public databases.'' I will repeat that. He was generally talking about information already in the public domain. That raised the question of what else the nominee wanted to enter into a giant government database of information on millions of innocent For example, did he have in mind information on Americans that the government could obtain or purchase from third parties, such as data brokers who collect information on the purchasing history of our people? Imagine putting every American's purchases into a government database, along with their social media postings and all of their phone records.  After two rounds of submitted questions and a hearing, it was not clear what the Congressman meant when he referred to ``all metadata'' or how he defined ``publicly available financial and lifestyle information.'' What we do know for sure is that he wouldn't give us any real sense of what he wanted to do with this proposal. He was unwilling to talk about it.  The responses I got from the Congressman on this and other topics generally fell into three categories. The first was, I will do what is legal. The second one was, when it comes to Americans' privacy, that is the FBI's problem, not the CIA's. And third, as CIA Director, I won't do policy. I am going to briefly state why these are unacceptable answers.  First, I asked the Congressman if there were any boundaries to his proposed new, vast database on His response was, ``Of course there are boundaries; any collection and retention must be conducted in accordance with the Constitution, statutes, and applicable presidential directives.'' That is not a response. Just because the government may be able to legally obtain information on Americans on an individualized or limited basis doesn't necessarily make it legal, much less appropriate, to create this vast database with all kinds of information on law-abiding If you take his response to mean that the only boundaries are those established by law, then it is worth considering how the intelligence community has frequently interpreted the legal limits in which it operates: flexibly and in secret.  Even if we imagine that there are established legal boundaries that would rein in the Congressman's CIA, consider what he himself has said about those legal boundaries. He wrote in his op-ed--and these are his words, not mine--that ``legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed.'' It is also significant that throughout his response to questions, he refers to CIA policies, procedures, and regulations. As CIA Director, he would be in a position to change those.  It seems to me that the Congressman can't have it both ways--he can't say he is bound only by legal restrictions and avoid saying what he thinks those restrictions should be.  The nominee's second way to avoid answering these questions was by arguing that concerns about the privacy of[[Page S375]]Americans are the business of the FBI, not the That is just not the case. There is a long and unfortunate history related to the CIA and domestic intelligence, which the Church Committee documented in the 1970s. I will be clear--I don't believe the CIA is up to anything like this today, but the possibility of returning to those days is certainly a possibility if the Director of the CIA takes the flexible approach to the rules that are intended to keep the CIA out of the lives of American citizens. I will give just a few examples.  On January 3, the Director of National Intelligence put out new procedures about the distribution within the intelligence community of what is called raw signals intelligence. These are the actual content of communications, as opposed to an analyst's report about these communications. According to the new procedures, these communications can be provided to the CIA if the CIA Director asks for them and explains to the NSA why the CIA needs them.  Here is why this matters to the privacy of Americans: When raw communications are distributed to the CIA, they include the communications of Americans that have been sucked up in the overall collection. So at this point, the CIA would have these communications. According to the new procedures, in some instances the Director of the CIA can approve CIA searches of that data for the communications of The Director of the CIA can also approve the use of Americans' communications. The question is, How would the Congressman exercise these authorities? We just don't know.  Another example would be the CIA's own procedures for dealing with information on Last week, the CIA updated these procedures in a 41-page public document. They covered, for example, the CIA's collection of vast amounts of information that includes the communications of or information about Americans--what can be collected by the CIA, what can be kept by the CIA, what can be distributed by the The new procedures also cover when CIA officers are required and when they are not required to identify themselves when participating in organizations in our country.  Just reading these procedures makes it clear that the CIA's activities bump up against the liberties of Americans all the time. That is why the regulations exist. But if a CIA Director has extreme views with regard to the liberties and freedoms of our people, that could very well be reflected in how the Agency implements these procedures or whether they get rewritten. How would the Congressman apply these rules? Would he propose new ones to make it easier for the CIA to look at more information about Americans? Again, we just don't know.  One thing is clear: The views of the CIA Director about the liberties and freedoms of Americans are just as relevant as those of the FBI  The nominee's third effort to avoid discussing his position was to say that as the CIA Director, he wouldn't be responsible for policy. As he asserted in his opening statement at the hearing, he would ``change roles from policymaker to information provider.'' But anyone who is familiar with the role of the CIA Director knows that is just not what happens at the  First, the CIA Director does far more than deliver analysis to government officials. Collection priorities, methods of collection, relationships with foreign services, covert action, and many other responsibilities of the office are policy matters.  In addition, the CIA Director and other leaders of the intelligence community are asked repeatedly what they think is necessary and appropriate to keep our Nation safe. At a moment of crisis, these questions are especially pressing. We now know what happens in those moments when leaders give wrong answers. After September 11, the Directors of the NSA and the CIA offered their views of what should be done. We all thought they had time stamps on them because we came back to look at them after the immediate crisis was over, but our country ended up for a fair amount of time with programs that ripped at the very fabric of our democracy. There were warrantless wiretappings and torture.  The Director of the CIA is a unique position. When someone is nominated to lead a department that operates more or less openly, at least the public can assess his or her performance, and at least a fully-informed Congress can respond when he or she implements wrongheaded policies. But the CIA Director operates in secret. What the public finds out is entirely up to the CIA and the administration.  When it comes to deciding whether this is the right person for the job, there is nothing for the public and most of the Congress to go on other than what the nominee has said and done before and during the confirmation process. Unless this is going to be a rare exception and the Congressman would be a historically transparent CIA Director--and there aren't any indications of that--then what we are talking about in this confirmation debate today and why I thought it was important to have a real debate today is that what we are talking about in terms of much of the future of the CIA and the person who heads it--this is a one-time shot for that discussion. That is why I don't consider the vetting process to be finished.  (",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS369-4.txt,1247,PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR,2017.0,23.0,January

454,topic-id,413,"Mr.President, I want to be very brief. I know colleagues are facing tough weather and are trying to deal with the logistics of all that. I just want to close with a couple of points.  The first is that I have heard several of my colleagues say to me that a central reason for voting for Congressman Pompeo this afternoon is that they have said that he voted for the USA FREEDOM That is correct. The problem is that just a few months after he cast that vote, the Congressman turned around and said he wanted to reestablish the bulk phone record program in a way that was vastly more encompassing and way more intrusive than the USA FREEDOM Act abolished. What he was proposing after he voted for the USA FREEDOM Act, which says that Congress says you ought to have limits, was a bulk metadata program that was way beyond anything that the Bush-Cheney administration ever imagined.  I have been on the Senate Intelligence Committee since before September 11. I have been in the middle of countless debates about the appropriate scope of government surveillance, but I have never heard--not from anyone--an idea that was so extreme and so overreaching and so intrusive of Americans' privacy. I bring this up only by way of saying that, if confirmed, the nominee is going to be dealing with a whole host of issues that, if we really think it through carefully and thoughtfully, we can find a way to ensure that Americans have security and liberty and that the two are not mutually exclusive. If we do it wrong, which would certainly happen if one were to weaken strong encryption, we will end up with less of both--less security and less liberty.  With respect to the process, I would only say that this matter of the way the Congressman handled his views with respect to surveillance and torture and Russia really reflect how his views change on a major issue, whether it is surveillance or torture or Russia, depending on the time and who he is talking to.
