                   COMMUNISM'S CENTURY OF DEVASTATION

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week, in a column by 
Heritage Foundation President Ed Feulner in The Washington Times, it 
sadly identified November 7, 1917, as a day of infamy. This day marks 
the overthrow of the Russian Government by the Bolsheviks, led by 
Lenin, and the establishment of the murderous communist dictatorship 
100 years ago.
  This revolution led to horrific deaths. Ed Feulner notes historians 
estimate that, according to Richard Pipes, 9 million were deceased. 
Richard Conquest says at least 20 million and, likely, as many as 30 
million died in the Great Terror.
  Ed Feulner continued: ``Its legacy is also one of grinding poverty. 
Most of the 88 countries that score `repressed' or `mostly unfree' on 
the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom are either 
communist, former communist, or some type of socialist economy. They 
are also the world's poorest nations.''
  Americans still hope for democratic reform in Russia, which, with its 
extraordinary culture and limitless resources, should be one of the 
wealthiest nations on Earth.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
