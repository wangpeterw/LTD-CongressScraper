                               TAX REFORM

  (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our framework 
for tax reform to put American workers and businesses first.
  I come from Michigan, and the last time our tax system was updated, 
Steve Yzerman was the captain of the Detroit Red Wings. Hockeytown is 
rebuilding, and it is about time our Tax Code was rebuilt. We have the 
opportunity to reform and reduce taxes for American workers and the 
small businesses that create jobs for those workers.
  America's nearly 30 million small businesses are the engine of our 
economy, employing nearly 60 million workers, half of the United States 
workforce. But our current Tax Code is a monstrosity. When combined 
with State and local taxes, small businesses pay up to 50 percent of 
their income to the government.
  Polling indicates that small- and mid-size businesses would use their 
tax savings to invest in their businesses: opening new locations, 
upgrading equipment, and increasing hiring and wages.
  Tax reform is about rewarding work and prosperity for all Americans. 
Let's get on with that work.
