                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  In the final hour of the First Session of the 115th Congress, we give 
You thanks for Your faithfulness to our Nation. There have been many 
struggles, many sorrows, and yet we are still here and able to give You 
thanks that millions of our citizens live free.
  May the work of the second session issue forth with legislation to 
the benefit of our Nation and its citizens, and where the efforts of 
this Congress have fallen short, we ask Your forgiveness and the 
forgiveness of all Americans.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
