               YAKIMA VALLEY'S BEST BEER EXPERIENCE AWARD

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a region in my 
district, the Yakima Valley, for being recognized as the winner of the 
World Food Travel Association's FoodTrekking Award for Best Beer 
Experience.
  John Cooper, president and CEO of Yakima Valley Tourism, nominated 
the region for the award, and this is just one example of the efforts 
John and his group are making to promote the budding beer and 
hospitality industries of the Yakima Valley.
  The FoodTrekking Awards recognize excellent food and beverage tourism 
experiences all over the world, and it is an honor for Yakima to be 
selected as

the winner for the Best Beer Experience among the international 
applicants. Central Washington's beer industry is thriving and has 
greatly contributed to the increase in tourism as well as the overall 
economic development of the area.
  As a third-generation hops farmer from the Yakima Valley, I am proud 
that our fellow growers and our local craft brewers are receiving 
recognition for their efforts in making our region a unique travel 
destination.
  Please join me in congratulating John, his team, and the entire 
industry for helping bring such a prestigious award to Washington's 
Fourth District.
