     HURRICANE HARVEY DISASTER RELIEF, FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT, AND 
                          PREVENTING A DEFAULT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, at the outset of the week, I 
outlined three issues we needed to address immediately: provide 
resources for Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma preparedness, ensure 
that the government remains funded, and ensure that a default is 
prevented so the emergency resources I mentioned can actually get to 
Americans who need them.
  That is what the legislation I filed cloture on yesterday achieves, 
and it achieves it all together in one package. It will provide 
certainty and stability for first responders, State officials, and the 
many others involved in preparing for and recovering from these storms 
with critically needed emergency resources that will not be interrupted 
by the prospect of a shutdown or default.
  The recovery effort for a record-setting storm like Harvey has 
strained resources to the limit already. The advance of another 
historic storm now makes the need for action even more urgent, so let's 
work together and act on this legislation very quickly.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
