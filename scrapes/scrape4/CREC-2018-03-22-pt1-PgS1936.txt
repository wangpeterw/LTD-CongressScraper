information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to 
have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.

       The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has requested 
     a possible purchase of a new Foreign Military Sales Order 
     (FMSO) II to provide funds for blanket order requisitions 
     under a Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Agreement 
     (CLSSA) for common spares/repair parts to support Saudi 
     Arabia's fleet of M1A2 Abrams tanks, M2 Bradley Fighting 
     Vehicles, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles 
     (HMMWVs), Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs), M198 Towed 
     Howitzers, additional support, and other related elements of 
     logistics and program support. The total estimated program 
     cost is $300 million.
       This proposed sale will contribute to U.S. foreign policy 
     and national security objectives by helping to improve the 
     security of a friendly country which has been, and continues 
     to be, an important force for political stability and 
     economic growth in the Middle East. This potential sale is 
     consistent with U.S. initiatives to provide key allies in the 
     region with modern systems that will enhance interoperability 
     with U.S. forces and increase stability.
       The primary objective of this proposed sale is to allow the 
     Royal Saudi Land Forces Ordnance Corps to continue to 
     purchase needed spare/repair parts to maintain Saudi Arabia's 
     fleet of M1A2 Abrams Tanks, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, 
     High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs), Light 
     Armored Vehicles (LAVs), M198 Towed Howitzers, additional 
     support vehicles and other related logistics support as part 
     of the Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Arrangement 
     (CLSSA) program. Saudi Arabia will have no difficulty 
     absorbing this equipment and support into its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       There are no principal contractors involved with this 
     potential sale. There are no known offset agreements proposed 
     in connection with this potential sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the 
     permanent assignment of any U.S. Government or contractor 
     representatives to Saudi Arabia.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.

                          policy justification

       The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has requested 
     to buy up to six thousand six hundred (6,600) TOW 2B missiles 
     (BGM-71F-Series) and ninety-six (96) TOW 2B (BGM-71F-Series)

     elements of logistics and program support. The total 
     estimated program cost is $670 million.
       This proposed sale will support U.S. foreign policy and 
     national security objectives by improving the security of a 
     friendly country which has been, and continues to be, an 
     important force for political stability and economic growth 
     in the Middle East. This potential sale is consistent with 
     U.S. initiatives to provide key partners in the region with 
     modern systems that will enhance interoperability with U.S. 
     forces and increase stability.
       The proposed sale of TOW 2B missiles and technical support 
     will advance the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's efforts to develop 
     an integrated ground defense capability. A strong national 
     defense and dedicated military force will assist Saudi Arabia 
     to sustain itself in its efforts to maintain stability. Saudi 
     Arabia will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into 
     its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The principal contractor is Raytheon Missile Systems, 
     Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset agreements proposed in 
     connection with this potential sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the 
     permanent assignment of any U.S. Government or contractor 
     representatives to Saudi Arabia. There will be no more than 
     two contractor personnel in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at 
     any one time and all efforts will take less than two weeks in 
     total.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.

     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The TOW 2B RF Missile is a fly-over-shoot-down missile 
     designed to defeat armored vehicles. These missiles are fired 
     from a variety of TOW launchers in the U.S. Army, USMC and 
     FMS customer forces. The TOW 2B RF can be launched from the 
     same launcher platforms as the existing wire-guided TOW 2B 
     missiles without modification to the launcher. The TOW 2B 
     missile (both wire & RF) contains two tracker beacons (xenon 
     and thermal) for the launcher to track and guide the missile 
     in flight. Guidance commands from the launcher are provided 
     to the

[[Page S1938]]

     missile by an RF link contained within the missile case. The 
     hardware, software and technical publications provided with 
     the sale are unclassified; however, the system itself 
     contains sensitive technology that instructs the system on 
     how to operate in the presence of countermeasures.
       2. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains 
     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the 
     information could be used to develop countermeasures or 
     equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system 
     effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with 
     similar or advanced capabilities.
       3. A determination has been made that Saudi Arabia can 
     provide substantially the same degree of protection for the 
     sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. 
     This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign 
     policy and national security objectives outlined in the 
     Policy Justification.
       4. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal are authorized for release and export to the 
     Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
