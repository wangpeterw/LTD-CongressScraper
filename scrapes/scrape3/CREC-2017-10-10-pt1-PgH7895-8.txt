                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the many women who have 
lost their lives to breast cancer and those who have survived.
  As you know, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. In order to 
prevent additional loss of life, it is essential that women educate 
themselves on prevention and receive regular screenings.
  In 2008, I cosponsored legislation supporting the observance of 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month, in part, to help get the message out 
that this disease can and does kill men and women of all ages.
  According to the American Cancer Society, since 2007, death rates in 
older women with breast cancer are decreasing, yet death rates in women 
under the age of 50 are steady.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all women watching to get screened regularly 
for this devastating disease.
