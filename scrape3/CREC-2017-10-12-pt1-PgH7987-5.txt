         RECOGNIZING ALABAMA STATE REPRESENTATIVE JAMES BUSKEY

  (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alabama State 
Representative James Buskey.
  Representative Buskey recently announced that he will be retiring 
from the Alabama House of Representatives after 42 years of 
representing people in Mobile, Alabama.
  He was first elected to the House in 1976, making him one of the 
longest-serving legislators in Alabama history. Outside of the 
legislature, Representative Buskey spent much of his life working in 
public education, including as a school administrator at E.S. Chastang 
Middle School in Mobile.
  While we have had our share of political differences, I have always 
appreciated his institutional knowledge and respected his passion for 
our local community. I am honored to call James a friend and appreciate 
his decades of service to the people of Mobile and Alabama.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish James and his wife, Vergie, all the best upon his 
retirement and the years ahead.

                          ____________________
