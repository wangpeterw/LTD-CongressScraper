              SUPPORTING THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE

  (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the dutiful service 
of the United States Secret Service. The Secret Service protects the 
President and Vice President, their families, and foreign dignitaries, 
while also investigating cybercrimes and preventing fraud. These men 
and women place their lives on the line daily to protect some of the 
most highly targeted individuals in the world.
  Further, they continue to conduct counterfeit interdiction operations 
despite the increasing need for protective details and low retention 
numbers.
  While the Secret Service is often in the news for personal 
shortcomings, the organization has had a storied history in protecting 
the United States. It is a remarkable fact that, within the last year, 
they have successfully conducted security operations for multiple 
Presidential candidates, the U.N. General Assembly, a visit to New York 
City by Pope Francis, and countless foreign dignitary visits to our 
soil.
  So from all of us here in Congress, I would like to thank the Secret 
Service for their service to our Nation and for their sacrifices. In 
the coming months, I plan to routinely honor this great example of 
American exceptionalism.
