                                 PRAYER

  Rabbi David-Seth Kirshner, Temple Emanu-El, Closter, New Jersey, 
offered the following prayer:
  As we embark on this sacred day of work to better the lives of all 
Americans, we ask that You, God, help instill these leaders of the 
115th Congress with patience, wisdom, empathy, and respect to achieve 
and exceed our goals for today and for tomorrow. Help us demonstrate 
our gratitude for our service people and first responders who work as 
our partners in fulfilling our shared mission.
  God, we ask You today to disseminate Your sunlight and shower down 
Your rain, which will help us cultivate the seeds of securing our 
freedoms, celebrating our democracy, and championing tolerance for now 
and forever.
  May it be Your will that the generations to come that will live 
within and lead this great Nation can enjoy the blooming flowers and 
sweet fruits of our labors on this sacred day.
  God, we ask You to bless this Congress and these United States of 
America.
  Amen.
