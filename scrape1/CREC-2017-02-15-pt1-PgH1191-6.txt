             WE OWE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's 
resignation is no substitute for answers to the serious questions that 
remain over President Trump's questionable connections to Russia, to 
Vladimir Putin.
  Federal investigators believe that Flynn, who held secret 
communications with Russia's Ambassador, could have been compromised, 
or even the subject of blackmail. The Justice Department disclosed this 
danger to the White House weeks ago, yet the President allowed Mr. 
Flynn to continue in his position as National Security Adviser, after 
having that information disclosed to them.
  This conduct could only be the tip of the iceberg. There are serious, 
unanswered questions that remain, and our

national security is at stake. Americans deserve answers.
  Did the President or others know or direct Flynn's secret 
communications with Russia?
  Why did the White House sit on its hands for weeks, even after being 
told its National Security Adviser could have been compromised?
  Were Trump campaign officials colluding with Russians?
  These are questions that the American people deserve answers to. We 
need a bipartisan, independent commission to examine these questions. 
The credibility of our government is at stake. Congress must act.
