                    GIVE A VOICE TO UNBORN CHILDREN

  (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which was 
introduced by Representative Marsha Blackburn.
  This year marks the 45th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision, 
Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, with this decision, we have seen the number 
of abortions occurring in the United States growing each year. 
According to Planned Parenthood's 2016-2017 annual report, abortions 
make up 96 percent of the organization's pregnancy resolution services, 
whereas prenatal services dropped significantly.
  Additionally, Planned Parenthood has performed more than 1.6 million 
abortions over the past 5 years. Now, more than ever, it is crucial 
that we celebrate the sanctity of life by encouraging and supporting 
pro-life legislation. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, 
which I am a proud cosponsor of, affirmatively states that if a baby is 
born after a failed abortion attempt, doctors must exercise the same 
degree of medical care on that child as a baby born on any other day.
  If doctors refuse to do so, they will be held criminally accountable 
for their actions. As a proud west Tennessean, I believe we must give a 
voice to the unborn and preserve the life and health of all children.
