                          KEEPAMERICA HEALTHY

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to keep America healthy, saving 
the Affordable Care Act.
  I rise in the name of Cynthia Perry, facing a life-or-death scenario. 
Without the law in place, Cynthia Perry would also befacing life or 
death. Perry suffers from an immune deficiency that requires her to 
take medication she estimates costs roughly$40,000 a year. Cynthia, who 
lives today.
  I rise to keep America healthy. Kathryn Will, terrified about losing 
access to treatment, terrified because she, herself, at28 years old, 
was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer.
  I rise to keep America healthy because a Senator from Kentucky said 
we need to think through how we do this, and it is ahuge mistake for 
Republicans if they do not vote for replacement on the same day they 
vote for repeal.
  I rise to keep America healthy and not give hundreds of billions of 
dollars in tax breaks to insurance companies and drugmanufacturers 
while eliminating tax credits for millions of working Americans.
  I rise to keep America healthy. Vote to save the Affordable Care Act.
