                            FORSYTH ACADEMY

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, March is National Reading Month, and students 
across the country often kick off this observance by celebrating the 
birthday of treasured children's author Dr. Suess. Last week I visited 
Forsyth Academy in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where I read 
``There's a Wocket in My Pocket!'' to first grade students.
  Forsyth Academy is a charter school serving students from 
kindergarten through eighth grade. The school was founded on the 
principles of academic excellence, moral focus, parental partnership, 
and student responsibility. Its leadership believes in setting high 
standards, making expectations clear, providing meaningful instruction, 
and watching children surpass expectations as a result.
  It is always a pleasure to visit local schools and witness the great 
things happening in classrooms across the Fifth District. Every student 
in every school deserves an excellent education, but, unfortunately, we 
are falling far short of that goal. Thankfully, innovative charter 
schools like Forsyth Academy are providing thousands of families new 
hope and opportunity.
  School choice is a powerful tool to help children succeed, and I am 
encouraged by the momentum that is building. I look forward to the work 
ahead and exploring additional opportunities to provide parents more 
choices for their children's education.
