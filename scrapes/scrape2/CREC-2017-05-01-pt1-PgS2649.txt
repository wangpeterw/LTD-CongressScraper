                        NATIONAL SEERSUCKER DAY

  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the seersucker 
manufacturers and enthusiasts across the United States. The storied 
history of this uniquely American fashion dates back to 1909 when 
Joseph Haspel designed the first seersucker suit at his Broad Street 
facility in New Orleans. Louisiana is proud to have played an important 
part in introducing the country to seersucker apparel.
  During the hot summer months, Americans across the country have worn 
and enjoyed this lightweight cotton fabric, known for its signature 
pucker. Mr. Haspel said it best, ``hot is hot, no matter what you do 
for a living.'' In the 1990s, Members of this Chamber established 
Seersucker Day to honor this unique American fashion. I proudly resumed 
this tradition in 2014 in the U.S. House of Representatives by 
designating Wednesday, June 11, as National Seersucker Day. I have 
continued this tradition in the U.S. Senate and wish to designate 
Thursday, June 8, as the fourth annual National Seersucker Day. I 
encourage everyone to wear seersucker on this day to commemorate this 
iconic American clothing.
