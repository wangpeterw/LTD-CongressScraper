                      REPUBLICANS' CYNICAL EFFORTS

  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I just want to address the cynical effort 
by the Republicans to link the Trump shutdown to Children's Health 
Insurance Program, or CHIP.
  The fact of the matter is, if the Republicans cared about children's 
health insurance or anybody's health insurance:
  They wouldn't have tried repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act.
  They wouldn't have put the provision in their tax scam that says that 
people don't have to buy insurance, which we estimate will result in 
about 13 million Americans losing their health insurance.
  They wouldn't have put a CHIP bill on the floor earlier this month, 
or earlier this year, that basically eliminated or cut back on the 
prevention fund and, at the same time, said, if you didn't pay your 
health insurance within the first 30 days, you would lose it, which the 
CBO says would cause another half a million people to lose their health 
insurance.
  If you care about children's health insurance, which you clearly 
don't, then you don't want to eliminate and cut back on health 
insurance for the American people in general, which is what you are 
doing by sabotaging the Affordable Care Act every day.
  The only reason why you linked the CHIP bill to the CR this week is 
because you don't have to pay the subsidies for people's health 
insurance because they are going to lose it.
