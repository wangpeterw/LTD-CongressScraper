                 BENEFITS OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT

  (Mrs. HANDEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. HANDEL. Mr. Speaker, last month, the House passed the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act. Already these pro-growth policies are having a positive 
impact. Businesses are making investments in operations and people.
  Thane Brooks operates a resource center for children with special 
needs in Alpharetta, Georgia. Because businesses can now immediately 
expense new equipment purchases, Thane is able to open a second 
facility to serve even more special needs children.
  Georgia-based Aflac announced that it will increase contributions to 
employee retirement plans. AT&T, with nearly 3,000 employees in the 
Sixth District, gave a $1,000 bonus to nonmanagement employees as a 
direct result of the tax cut bill.
  Overall, more than 2 million workers across the country are feeling 
the benefits of this law through increased wages, bonuses, and more 
retirement dollars. And with paychecks for nearly every American set to 
increase in the coming weeks, there is even more good news on the 
horizon for American families.
