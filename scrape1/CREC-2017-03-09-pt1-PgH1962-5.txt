          CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES COMPEL US TO FIX HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind us of the 
need to repeal ObamaCare. We have an opportunity to address the 
Affordable Care Act. It is real simple: by gutting it.
  In northeast Georgia, I have heard again and again how my neighbors 
have suffered at the hands of ObamaCare. ObamaCare levied $1 trillion 
in new taxes, not including the de facto taxes that came to middle 
class Americans in the form of increased deductible and insurance 
premiums.
  The laws that our friends across the aisle forced on the American 
people while they worked in the shadows have crippled our healthcare 
system. The Affordable Care Act is not affordable, and it is not 
acceptable. Not from my neighbors and not for your loved ones, Mr. 
Speaker.
  Democrats created a brave new world in which coverage came with no 
promise of quality health care, in which insurance markets continue to 
crumble and families watch their healthcare resources slip way.
  The only way forward is to say good-bye to ObamaCare, good-bye to 
personal and employer mandates. Good-bye to additional and frivolous 
taxes. Good-bye to unnecessary spending. Good-bye to heartbreaking 
healthcare outcomes. Good-bye, and good riddance.
