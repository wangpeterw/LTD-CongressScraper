                     CONGRATULATING THERESA BRYANT

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Theresa Bryant, who 
is West Forsyth High School's 2016-2017 Teacher of the Year.
  This first-generation college graduate, Kiwanis member, and Key Club 
adviser has worked at West Forsyth in Clemmons since 2000, where she 
teaches sophomore English and Shakespeare as an elective.
  Theresa's proudest moment in the field of education is her role in 
the creation of the Shakespeare elective class. After an educational 
opportunity at the Globe Theatre in London, she worked with a colleague 
to create an intensive curriculum covering eight plays. The class has 
brought the words of the Bard to more than 4,000 students at West 
Forsyth, as well as four other schools in the district.
  Theresa is known for her dedication to her students and making her 
lessons relevant to their different learning styles so everyone can 
understand the material.
  We are lucky to have a teacher of her caliber serving students in 
North Carolina's Fifth District.
