                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God, Father of us all, we give You thanks for giving us another day. 
Ever faithful to Your promises, we ask Your presence with Your people, 
now and forever.
  The sun grows dim and the daylight is measured. In the darkness, 
phantoms loom. The eye cannot discern as the distance fades. Be for us 
light.
  Help the Members of Congress make clear judgments that will propel us 
into a blessed future. Remove any shadowy cloud so that they might 
follow the patterns of Your inspirations.
  O Lord of the ages, ever faithful to Your promises, be with us 
throughout these waning days of the session, and may all that is done 
in the people's House be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
