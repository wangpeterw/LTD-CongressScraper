                      HONORING PATRICIA BROUGHTON

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Patricia Broughton, 
my caseworker in San Pedro, California, who is retiring after her 
distinguished career in public service.
  Patricia has served for 32 years, and has served five Members of 
Congress, including me. She also served former Representatives Janice 
Hahn, Jane Harman, the late Steve Horn, the late Glenn Anderson, and 
then myself.
  Patricia isn't just a caseworker, she is a miracle worker. She has 
handled virtually every type of case that is referred to a 
congressional office.
  Patricia has resolved Social Security and Medicare claims for 
seniors, helped disabled veterans who weren't receiving their veterans' 
disability checks, and assisted those who had trouble with the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the IRS.
  Patricia has been an advocate for the frustrated, and a source of 
comfort for those tangled up in the Federal Government's bureaucracy.
  I wish Patricia the best in her well-deserved retirement from public 
service.
