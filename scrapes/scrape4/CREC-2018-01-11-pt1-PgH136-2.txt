                  FOR DREAMERS, THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, every day, 122 DREAMers lose 
their protections from deportation. Every day, 122 young people in this 
country still consider whether they should go to class, whether they 
should show up for work, whether they should put on the uniform of our 
military in service to our country, because every day that Congress 
delays and does nothing means more bright, hardworking young people who 
know no other home than the United States are being asked to leave or 
risk being arrested.
  Our inaction is creating an impending crisis for workforces, 
families, and communities around the country. We must pass a permanent, 
bipartisan solution to enable DREAMers to continue to live, work, and 
contribute to this country and that provides a pathway to full 
citizenship.
  We have seen time and time again that the overwhelming majority of 
Americans on both sides of the aisle in both parties agree that we 
should protect our DREAMers. Yesterday, 115 business leaders, including 
CEOs from Amazon, Facebook, General Motors, and Verizon, asked Congress 
to act immediately.
  DREAMers don't have the luxury of time. Hundreds of thousands of 
deserving young people are counting on us. We can't wait until March to 
make sure that our DREAMers are protected and included and welcomed.
  Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now.
