                      HONORING OFFICER NICK RODMAN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to begin this morning by 
paying tribute to a fallen hero. Yesterday, Officer Nick Rodman of the 
Louisville Metro Police Department passed away after a crash in west 
Louisville on Tuesday night.
  Officer Rodman had served in the department for 3 years, where he 
followed in a strong family tradition of law enforcement. In his life, 
he showed compassion and dedication, which are among the best virtues 
of public service.
  According to LMPD Chief Steve Conrad, Officer Rodman is the second 
officer in the department's history to be killed in the line of duty.
  Officer Rodman's tragic death reminds us of the tremendous debt of 
gratitude we owe to all of the courageous men and women like him who 
daily put themselves into harm's way to defend our communities. They 
deserve our utmost respect.
  This morning, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in expressing our 
deepest sympathy to Officer Rodman's family, friends, and fellow 
officers. They will all be in our prayers.

                          ____________________
