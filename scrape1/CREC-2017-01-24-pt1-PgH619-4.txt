                        HONORING RUTH SAMUELSON

  (Mr. BUDD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I stand here 
to share with you a few words about North Carolina's dear friend, Ruth 
Samuelson.
  Ruth was only 57 when she went to glory yesterday morning. Her grace 
in the fight against cancer was a trait that was seen in her life as a 
wife of 35 years to Ken, as a mom, and as a public servant.
  It was this strength rooted in her Christian faith that provided her 
with the grace to lead and to champion causes that she held dear. 
Although Ruth worked in the often divided world of politics, she 
garnered respect from all sides.
  This week we will discuss an issue that was very dear to Ruth: the 
right to life. She fought hard for the lives of the unborn with heart 
and compassion that earned admiration from all.
  Her grace and leadership will forever continue to inspire all she 
encountered.
  I would like to end with a passage of significance to Ruth and her 
husband, Ken. It is from Matthew 6:33:
  ``But seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all 
these things shall be added unto you.''
  We will miss you, Ruth, but we know that you have been added to the 
Kingdom of God.
