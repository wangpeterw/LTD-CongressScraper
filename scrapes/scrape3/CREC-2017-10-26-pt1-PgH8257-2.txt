                  75TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDIAN ROCK DAM

  (Mr. PERRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the 75th anniversary of 
Indian Rock Dam in York County, Pennsylvania.
  Indian Rock Dam was completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 
1942 as part of an unprecedented boom of water resource infrastructure 
construction across America that stemmed from the Flood Control Act of 
1936.
  It is an earth and rock structure measuring 1,000 feet long, rising 
83 feet above the streambed that dams up to 9.1 billion gallons of 
water that otherwise would inundate downstream communities.
  While impossible to prevent all floods, we can limit the damage and 
risk. Since Indian Rock Dam was completed in 1942, it has prevented 
more than $55 million in potential flood damage to our community of 
York, Pennsylvania.
  Managed by the Corps' Baltimore District, Indian Rock Dam is one of 
the 13 Corps dam projects in the Susquehanna River watershed.
  For 75 years, Indian Rock Dam has been a silent protector for our 
citizens. For that and its continued benefit of reducing risks to 
Americans downstream, I am proud to recognize the 75th anniversary of 
Indian Rock Dam.
