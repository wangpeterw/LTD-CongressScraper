                NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS DAY

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as a judge in Texas, I saw it all: 
rape, robbery, murder, kidnapping, child abuse. Now, in Congress, we 
are learning about the horrors of human trafficking, sex slavery.
  Many groundbreaking laws have been passed to increase resources for 
victims and crack down on traffickers and buyers, but like all criminal 
enterprises, traffickers constantly stay ahead of the law.
  Fortunately for victims, there is an army of individuals, NGOs, 
religious and other advocacy groups fighting on behalf of victims. The 
people serving in these organizations are New Friends New Life, RAIN, 
Polaris, Rights4Girls, Shared Hope, Coalition Against Trafficking, and 
Demand Abolition, just to name a few. They have all dedicated their 
lives to serve and save victims of trafficking on the front lines.
  On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, I want to thank all 
those warriors--the victims' posse, as I call them--battling the 
injustice of human slavery. We will not give up this fight until this 
scourge has been eradicated.
  And that is just the way it is.
