             REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL IS A REPULSIVE SCAM

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Senate bill that was 
unveiled this morning, much like the House Republican healthcare bill, 
is a repulsive scam perpetrated against the American people.
  On page 30 of the bill, section 120, under Executive Compensation Tax 
Cut, UnitedHealthcare will get a tax cut, under this bill, representing 
$15.5 million. If that is not egregious enough, the fact is that 
UnitedHealthcare is under investigation today by the United States 
Department of Justice for defrauding the Medicare program of billions 
of dollars over the last 7 years.
  This should be rejected today and, decisively, by all decent Members 
of this Congress who believe there is a moral responsibility to ensure 
that the legislation passed here is fair and just.
