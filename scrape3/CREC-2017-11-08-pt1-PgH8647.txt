          ENCOURAGE CONSTITUENTS TO SIGN UP FOR A HEALTH PLAN

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, in Burien, Washington, tomorrow, we will be 
holding an event to provide constituents information on signing up for 
healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
  With open enrollment season beginning last week, I want to make sure 
that residents of our district know that they have until December 15 to 
sign up. And while the Republican majority has been undermining the ACA 
at every turn, the numbers that are coming in tell a completely 
different story about how important this act is for thousands of 
Americans across the country.
  More than 200,000 Americans chose a plan on the first day of open 
enrollment, which is more than double last year. This is all on top of 
the more than 1 million people who visited healthcare.gov, the official 
Federal website; a one-third increase in traffic from 2016.
  Mr. Speaker, our State exchange in Washington State has reported a 19 
percent increase in visits from last year. The surge in enrollment is 
promising and it is a clear repudiation of the Republican's efforts to 
strip healthcare from millions across the Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to spread the word about how their 
constituents can get covered.
