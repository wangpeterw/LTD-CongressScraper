               PUTTING THE AMERICAN DREAM BACK INTO REACH

  (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, my generation has known two very profound 
events: war and recession.
  To some folks, a decade seems like forever ago, but for most 
Virginians, most Americans, the events of the financial collapse 10 
years ago still haunt their memories today. Financial devastation hit 
the poor and middle class in this country unlike anything we have 
witnessed in our lifetimes: businesses shuttered, retirement plans 
halted, families losing many homes.
  In response, Congress passed Dodd-Frank, a bill with more regulations 
than all other bills passed during the Obama administration.
  Dodd-Frank regulations have pushed many community banks out of 
business. We lose one of them or a credit union every single day. 
Small-business lending, the driver of jobs in this country, has 
declined; everyday banking services have been reduced; and 
homeownership is increasingly out of reach.
  The Financial CHOICE Act provides more accountability over unelected 
bodies, unlocks small-business lending, allows community banks to 
survive, stops big-bank bailouts with our tax dollars, will increase 
homeownership, and it imposes the toughest penalties ever for financial 
fraud. This bill puts the American Dream into reach for millions of 
Americans.
