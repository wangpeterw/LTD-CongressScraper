I am a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, but I am also the proud daughter of immigrants from I understand how important citizenship is to families.  When I was young, I remember watching my mother study for the exam. I would help ask her questions and make sure that she knew the history of this country so that she could pass, and I remember the day that she went in to take her exam and passed. It was a proud moment for our family.  June 17 is a day to encourage not just our colleagues to support initiatives to make the citizenship process more accessible to millions of people who are pursuing the American Dream but also to go into communities and educate them about the importance of citizenship.  8.8 million people are eligible to become citizens but have not yet begun the process, and 3.7 million of those are eligible for citizenship fee waivers. Becoming a citizen can cost over $700, and there are significant language and access barriers for those who apply. I know my aunt had to take it five times because her English wasn't good enough, and it took her some time.  But I encourage those who can, to do it, to make sure that they can because legal permanent residents face an uphill battle to citizenship.  My father was one who actually never became a citizen. My father was older, so I never really had an opportunity to ask him why he didn't do it, but I see today the importance of it, especially in a day where immigrants are under attack, where more and more people who think they have a right to be here and have status here may do something that causes them to become deportable.  It is so very important for people, who can become citizens, to take that opportunity to do it. It is really a gateway to voting, to employment, receiving benefits, and investing in our family's future. Citizens receive higher wages, greater economic opportunity, and full access to the equal rights that are fundamental to becoming an  We should be promoting programs to ensure that these immigrants have the skills and the resources they need to learn, succeed, and give back to the communities they call home. Organizations like the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles are working hard to make citizenship more attainable for everyone by providing free citizenship services.  Again, I urge my colleagues to support these efforts on Saturday, June 17.

The opioid abuse disorder and drug addiction have impacted every community in our The epidemic knows know boundaries; does not discriminate based on age, gender, or socioeconomic status.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 91 American lives are lost every day from an opioid[[Page H5224]]abuse overdose. Unfortunately, drug overdoses in Indiana have increased fivefold over the past decade, and southern Indiana and the Wabash Valley, the area I represent, are bearing the brunt of this devastation.  This year in Vigo County, Indiana, population around 108,000 citizens, authorities have responded to over 16 opioid- or heroin-induced overdoses already this year.  Vanderburgh County, Indiana, 182,000 citizens, saw 29 deaths from overdose in 2016, which is a fourfold increase from the prior year. This year, the county has seen 25 confirmed heroin- or fentanyl-related overdoses already, but the coroner thinks it may be more.  Just this month, we have seen reports of instances of an opioid-based drug called gray death in Evansville,  We are working here in Congress with our States and local communities to finally bring relief to these families, but a lot of work has to be done. While we still have much to do, over the past couple of years, we have actually made significant progress to bring hope to our communities and expand access to treatment for those who need it.  I was proud to be part of our efforts that we put into law, the landmark legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, and I had the opportunity to author a portion of CARA that expanded access to medication-assisted opioid use disorder treatment, ensure patients have wider access to more comprehensive-based treatment options, and helped minimize the potential for diversion.  As Congressman Murphy mentioned, the key here is ongoing therapy, counseling, and monitoring. Medication-assisted treatment is not a panacea, but it is a component of a more comprehensive treatment plan for each individual.  Through our work in implementing the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress has provided significant funding for the In fact, Indiana recently was granted nearly $11 million from the Department of Health and Human Services to help us with this epidemic.  Again, most of us know someone, a family member, a friend, a neighbor, who has been impacted by this epidemic in some way. As a physician, I have seen the power of addiction up close and have focused on shaping real policy solutions here in Washington, D.C., to improve access to treatment for patients who are battling their problem every day. We all share in this fight, and we can't end this epidemic through policy changes alone. It is ongoing, and it is going to take all of us working together as a community to meet this challenge.  In that respect, I have met with and have been working with people who represent medical schools and residency programs in our country to help better educate the physician on prescribing habits as it relates to pain, whether that is surgical pain or chronic pain. It is a multifaceted approach, and I commend Congressman Murphy for his dedication to helping end this crisis in our country, and I thank him for yielding.

310,topic-id,1264,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this afternoon with my colleague from Maine to talk about an important issue, as well, something we had long planned to introduce today and did so this morning--the reintroduction of a Senate bill focusing on apprentice programs.  My colleague Senator Collins and I, in the past Congress, wanted to make sure people understood how important we thought the apprentice program was, and we introduced legislation then to create a Federal incentive for apprentice programs. We are coming back now in this Congress and reintroducing this legislation.  I know there has been a lot of talk about apprentices this week. We just had a roundtable discussion this morning with some of our business and labor leaders talking about the skills gap and the need for more apprentice investing as it relates to manufacturing. I know the President is doing some discussion of the apprentice program too. Obviously, it is no surprise to anybody in America that the President knows--or at least has used--the word ``apprentice'' in a pretty aggressive way throughout his career. So I hope he will tune in and listen to what my colleague from Maine and I have to say about this.  We are saying that it is time in America to have a Federal priority on apprentices; that is, the first-ever tax incentive for hiring an apprentice. Why do we want a Federal priority? Because we know that in America we need to skill and train a workforce for tomorrow, and so many people in America aren't training and aren't skilling for those jobs.  In the downturn of our economy, a lot of people lost faith. What should they invest their time and money in? There was so much transition in the economy that people weren't sure where they should skill themselves. As we see a transitioning economy now in various sectors, as they continue to modernize, and as technology continues to change, people also say to themselves: What should I skill myself in? What should I get trained in? Because they are not sure that, at the end of that period, they will be right there with what the job market wants. That is why apprenticeship is so important today.  By giving a Federal incentive for the apprentice program, we are saying: Hire and train. We are actually saying: The apprentice program is earning while you learn, and it will help so many Americans take that issue off the table where they weren't sure whether or how they should skill themselves. They actually are hired and trained on the job.  This is something we have known as a country for a long time. We know the apprentice program has worked. We have seen it across many sectors, in building trades and construction. We have seen it in other areas. In aviation, for example, in the Pacific Northwest, the Boeing Company has taken great advantage of the apprentice program. There are so many other sectors. The maritime sector has taken advantage of the apprentice programs. What we are saying today is that we need to make this a national priority in a more aggressive way. The Department of Labor and registered apprentice programs are part of what we make an investment in here in the Federal budget. But what we are not doing is putting it on steroids, and that is what we need to do now.  Our legislation would create enough incentives for 500,000 new apprentice program individuals over the next 10 years. We think this is critically important because we know how much the U.economy needs these skilled workers. According to the National Skills Coalition, 53 percent of U.jobs are middle-skilled, meaning that they require some postsecondary education. Yet only 43 percent of U.workers are trained at that level. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, 67 percent of their members report a shortage of available, qualified workers. We are going to need 3.5 million manufacturing jobs over the next decade, and this leaves us with a shortage of about 2 million.  So we need to give our businesses the skill levels they are looking for so they can be competitive, so they can meet their market needs, and so they can make profits and help grow our economy. We can't let them be deterred by the fact that they have the opening and they have the jobs, but they just don't have the skill level. By doing an incentive program, we can help get a national message out: The apprentice program is a key part of our economic strategy, and skilling a workforce for the jobs of today and tomorrow is the best recipe for growing our economy.  There has been an overall decline in employer-provided training over the last two decades. By making this investment now, we are going to help U.businesses with the investment that should be made and, further, as I said, expedite getting people into the programs we need to get them into. If we are going to be competitive and our businesses are going to compete in this global economy and they are going to continue to innovate, they need the workforce to do it.  I think about the chip fabrication industry. Before Intel came along, probably no one knew how to do chip fabrication. But there was a sector of our economy that taught and educated people on chip manufacturing. That will not be the last innovation our economy sees. In aerospace, we have been able to, with composite manufacturing, make lighter weight planes. That composite was a huge shift from the aluminum that dominated aerospace. But composite manufacturing is a whole new skill level in which we are still training and educating the workforce. We need to compete in that sector, which is so important to manufacturing jobs.  I would say that every aspect of our economy needs apprentices. But what does the apprentice get out of it? Not only do they get a job and they get to be skilled on the job, but they also earn more. Over the course of their career, a registered apprentice earns about $300,000 more than a non-apprentice working in the same field. A study done by our State Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board found that completing apprentices earned $13,000 more per year just as they started.  So apprentices are a win-win for us and our economy. They give the employer the skills they are seeking to make their companies successful, and the individual worker gets trained and hired in a field that takes away this uncertainty about our economy, which has so plagued us over the last decade or two, and the community gets a more successful employment base and successful companies that add to the economy of a region and to our country.  I am so glad to be here with my colleague Senator Collins, who has[[Page S3490]]known that this apprentice program has been a success, and that is why she and I have partnered for years on this program. We hope now that by reintroducing it and getting more of our colleagues to join in, they, too, will talk about why apprentices are so important today.  We hope there is a guy down the street in the White House, who had a program called ``Apprentice,'' who takes seriously the bipartisan effort of two Senators who have been at this for a few years, and says: This is where we should be spending our money and making an investment to skill, educate, and employ Americans right now, for today.

336,topic-id,590,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in this most important area.  Mr.Speaker, the heroin and opioid scourge is running this country into the ground, and, unfortunately, the problem appears to be getting worse, not better. That grim reality is particularly true in my district in Cincinnati, where, during a single week last summer, city health officials reported 174 overdoses in 1 week.  Deaths caused by opioids have doubled in my district, where, during the first 4 months in 2017, the Hamilton County Coroner's Office had already logged in hundreds and hundreds of opioid overdoses--heartbreaking numbers.  But numbers only tell part of the story. The circumstances surrounding the spike in overdoses can, at times, be horrifying.  A couple of months ago, in Cincinnati, Ohio, a 9-year-old girl called 911 about both of her parents, who overdosed on heroin in their She told the dispatcher she was scared and that her parents wouldn't wake up. The girl didn't know where she was or what was wrong with her parents, but she, fortunately, knew how to call 911. That call saved her parents' lives.  But no little girl--or little boy, for that matter--should ever be placed in that situation by their parents, or by anyone.  These types of stories are becoming all too common. Opioids don't discriminate based on age or race or socioeconomic class. Opioids can kill anyone, in any neighborhood. Every day, there are more headlines about how heroin and other opioids are basically taking over the country.  The simple fact is that nearly every Member of Congress could come to the floor today and share a similar story from their own district. That is why, Mr.Speaker, it is imperative that we work together to find new and more successful ways to combat the opioid epidemic. We need to put politics aside and help people in need.  Last year, we came together in a bipartisan manner to pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, and I think there is a good chance that the expanded treatment and recovery options that legislation created will help some of those suffering from addiction to turn their lives around.  While CARA will give local law enforcement and healthcare officials more resources to fight opioid addiction, we need additional legislation to help combat the importation into the United States of extremely dangerous synthetic drugs like fentanyl and carfentanil, which many have blamed for the spike of heroin overdoses. According to the DEA, much of the supply of these two dangerous drugs on our streets originates overseas, particularly from China and  Bipartisan legislation is being led by Representative Tiberi and Senator Portman, the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention, or STOP, It would update the customs process to require that advanced electronic notice of all packages, large or small, be provided to Customs officials. Providing this information to Customs before the packages arrive will help them, meaning the Customs agency, to intercept more illegal shipments and prevent these dangerous drugs from reaching drug traffickers within our borders.  I am hopeful that this legislation will be embraced with the same bipartisan enthusiasm that we saw with CARA because the heroin and opioid problem in this country is too serious, too significant, and too widespread for us not to work together at every level of government to find a solution to this epidemic. It is way overdue. We need to work together in a bipartisan manner about this.  I again want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership in this area.

Mr.Chairman, this should not be a partisan issue. National security experts on both sides of the aisle have concluded that keeping Guantanamo open is harmful to American interests.  Secretaries of State from previous Republican administrations, including Henry Kissinger, James Baker, and Colin Powell, have all said that closing Guantanamo would improve America's image around the world.

311,topic-id,595,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in support of the Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act, which Senator Cantwell and I are reintroducing today.  Few issues are as important to the American people as the availability of good jobs in our communities. It is crucial that we continue to improve job training initiatives to help people find jobs in fields with open positions. Many business owners in Maine have told me that they do, in fact, have jobs available, but they cannot find qualified workers to fill these highly skilled vacant positions. In fact, I cannot visit a machine shop in the State of Maine, no matter where it is located, and find that they are not looking for skilled machinists. There is such a shortage. And those are good jobs. They are jobs with good benefits and job security.  One way for employees to acquire the skills needed to succeed in these in-demand fields is through apprenticeship programs. Apprentices gain hands-on experience that is invaluable to them and to their employers. These programs help workers secure good-paying jobs.  According to the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, more than 49,000 participants graduated from an apprenticeship program in fiscal year 2016. In Maine, we have some innovative job-training apprenticeship programs at places like Bath Iron Works, which builds naval destroyers, and the Portsmouth Naval Ship Yard, which has an extraordinary program. Partnering with employers like these and others, more than 2,220 individuals in Maine worked actively on industry-recognized skill certifications in just the last year. That number--impressive as it is--remains insufficient to meet the needs of employers statewide.  We must do all we can to ensure that an adequate pool of skilled workers is available. Our legislation would help achieve this goal by giving a $5,000 tax credit to businesses that hire apprentices full time in high-demand mechanical, technical, healthcare, or technology professions. In order for a business to claim the credit, the apprentice must be employed for at least 7 months. What we find is that the people who go through these apprenticeship programs stay in these jobs, thus benefiting both the worker and the employer.  Our bill also provides incentives for experienced workers who spend at least 20 percent of their time passing their hard-earned knowledge on to the next generation. These workers would be allowed to receive some retirement income early without facing tax penalties. That is a way we can ensure that the experienced older worker is passing knowledge on to the next generation.  Finally, our bill would ensure that the brave men and women who defend our country are given credit for the skills they learned in the military while wearing our Nation's uniform. Training received while serving in the Armed Forces would count toward an apprentice's training requirement.  This bill would help to better align the needs of our Nation's employers with potential employees. It would promote hiring and the creation of new jobs. It would enhance the skills that the people of our country need to obtain good-paying, secure employment. The Presiding Officer and I were talking about this very issue at lunch today and the need to bridge that skills gap.  I encourage all of my colleagues to support our bill, and I want to salute Senator Cantwell for her leadership over many years in working on this issue. This is something that should unite us all--Democrats, Republicans, It is not a partisan issue; it is looking at ways that we can help more Americans secure good-paying jobs that will last them for a lifetime.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-06-14-pt1-PgS3489.txt,2121,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,14.0,July

Transmittal 16-84     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to          Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                           Annex Item vii       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:       1. The AN/TPQ-53(V) radar system is a highly mobile radar      that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates      the point of origin of projectiles fired from mortar,      artillery and rocket systems with sufficient accuracy for      first round fire for effect. It mitigates close combat radar      coverage gaps and replaces the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37      Firefinder Radars; fully supporting Brigade Combat Teams      (BCT), Division Artilleries (DIVARTYs), and Field Artillery      (FA) Designed to be transported by ship, trucks,      train, or aircraft, it is capable of deploying as part of the      counter-rocket, artillery, and mortar system of systems to      provide a sense and warn capability for fixed and semi-fixed      sites. The AN/TPQ-53(V) provides a net ready system with      increased range and accuracy throughout a 90 degree search      sector (stare mode) as well as 360-degree coverage      (rotating).       a. The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) hardware      design of the AN/TPQ-53(V) is Foreign source      systems of similar design and capability are available in      advanced industrial nations such as Sweden and       b. The AN/TPQ-53(V) software gives it an enhanced      capability in terms of target detection and classification in      an Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) environment. Release of      detailed knowledge of the software code or test data could      aid an adversary trying to identify ways of countering the      detection capabilities of the AN/TPQ-53(V) or improve the      performance of their own radar systems. Although the      detection, classification technology, and concept used in the      AN/TPQ-53(V) has been utilized for more than a decade, the      ability to incorporate such technology on a solid state air      cooled radar would be a major technological improvement. The      software is The system is classified SECRET      when employed in a theater of operations.       c. The Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System      (SINCGARS) is a tactical radio providing secure jam-resistant      voice and data communications of command, control, targeting,      and technical information for the AN/TPQ-53(V) radar system.      The spread-spectrum frequency hopping Electronic Counter-     Counter Measures (ECCM) technology resident in the radio is      sensitive but While sensitive, the frequency-     hopping algorithms used to generate the ECCM waveform are      unique to the country of ownership and cannot be manipulated      by potential adversaries for use or interference with other      countries possessing SINCGARS technology. Should a potential      adversary come into possession of one of these radios, they      would have the potential to intercept operational command,      control, and targeting information. This potential problem is      mitigated by the fact that the customer can secure      information passed over the radio network using a commercial      grade security capability equivalent to an AES 256-bit      encryption system whose keys are controlled by the customer      country.       d. The Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS)      Receiver (DAGR) is a handheld GPS location device with map      background displaying the user's location. Unlike commercial      grade GPS receivers capable of receiving Standard Positioning      Signals (SPS) from GPS satellites, the DAGR is capable of      receiving Precise Positioning Signals (PPS). PPS satellite      signals provide significantly more accurate location data      than do SPS signals. This capability within DAGR is possible      due to the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module      (SAASM). The SAASM is an encrypted device permitting both      receipt of PPS signals and the benefit of preventing      potential adversaries from spoofing the system to display      incorrect location information. The SAASM capability within      the DAGR is sensitive but The SAASM      capabilities are sensitive due to the system's ability to      access[[Page S3325]]     restricted PPS GPS satellite signals and to prevent spoofing.      While sensitive, the ability of potential adversaries to      exploit the system are limited. The SAASM chip goes through a      special process of loading encryption signals and unique      access codes keyed to the customer country. These processes      are strictly controlled by the US Air If the DAGR is      compromised, the US Air Force can cut off the device access      to PPS signals and the anti-spoofing capability.       e. The same SAASM capabilities resident in the DAGR are      also resident in the AN/TPQ-53(V) KN-4083 Inertial Navigation      System (INS). The KN-4083 is a SAASM enhanced INS capability      with a 3-axis Monolithic Ring Laser Gyro allowing extremely      accurate location as well as 3-axis accelerometer to provide      angular information regarding the radar position (i.e. pitch,      roll, and azimuth data). While inertial navigation and      accelerometer capabilities are well-known, the SAASM      capability within the system makes it sensitive but      As with the DAGR, the US Air Force can cut off      access to PPS signals and anti-spoofing capabilities,      minimizing impacts should a potential adversary obtain the      system.       2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain      knowledge of the specific radar hardware and software      elements, the information could be used to identify ways of      countering the detection capabilities of the AN/TPQ-53(V)      Radar System or improve the performance of their radar      systems. Testing and identification of methods to defeat the      AN/TPQ-53(V) ECCM capabilities would lead to improvements in      the overall effectiveness of an adversary's system and      improve their survivability.       3.

In fact, I wore our Nation's uniform for nearly 12 years, served in Ranger Regiment, though I was not involved as a combat veteran.  I would not want to do anything to limit our ability to fight and win the war on terror. Indeed, the sole intent of this is to keep us laser-focused where we can. Resources are scarce, and the need to focus on defeating our enemies who have already been authorized by combat to engage in combat is critical.  In fact, it does alarm me to see that there is some concern that this is overly broad and limiting, as it is the law of the land.

It gives them 90 days to engage in combat anywhere where there is a clear and present danger to the national security of the United  That could very well happen in that region of the country. The waters are tight. The threats are real. As I said, there are strategic, operational, and tactical concerns at play.  But this is nothing different than what President Eisenhower foresaw.

If you remember, the JCPOA provided Iran with $150 billion in sanctions relief, even had the appalling spectacle of planes hauling in $1.7 billion in cold, hard cash, dropped off in So this regime has been flush with money as a result of the nuclear deal done during the Obama administration.  One of the frustrating things about that was that, even after that deal is enacted, even after all this money is flowing as a result of the deal, the Obama administration--this was not even required by the deal--sent millions of dollars to Iran in order to get heavy water. And that was not required by the deal. That was a gratuitous transaction, but it certainly provided more economic--an even greater economic lifeline to  This is still, to this day, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. They are fomenting discord all around the Middle East, in Lebanon, in They fund Hamas in the Gaza They are supporting the Houthis in They have major control over portions of Iraq, and the Shiite militias that they back are running rampant.  Remember, they were probably the leading source of U.servicemember deaths in Iraq during the Iraq campaign. They funded Shiite militias. They had their Quds Force from Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps on the ground in Iraq; and certainly, hundreds of our servicemembers, some estimates say as many as 1,500 servicemembers, were killed from some of these Iranian proxies.

They haven't left the deal. They haven't really done anything to fight back against the deal, and I hope that will happen.

No more taxpayer dollars to the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

When I first learned of them--longer than I want to admit--there were just a few of them. Now there are 72 and many more in the pipeline. They have served 305,000 military families.  For many veterans and their families, the distance to their nearest VA medical center can be too far to travel on a routine basis, and the cost over time means many veterans are alone--nobody by their side--during their treatment or hospital stay--a situation no one should be in.  No veteran who has served their country should have to face medical care or a hospital stay without the support of their loved ones by their side. Fisher Houses provide the lodging and transportation resources to help families stay together throughout the treatment process.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

217,topic-id,315,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, throughout the country, there are remote areas where the men and women of our armed services prepare for war in order to protect the peace.  Although these places are often overlooked, our investments in military test and training ranges are returned[[Page H6500]]to the Nation many times over in the projection of American military supremacy around the globe protecting the homeland and preserving international order.  In the Southeast, the Joint Gulf Range Complex facilities are for testing and training of supersonic and hypersonic weapons systems, including combat training and live-fire exercises of the frontline fighters like the F-22 and F-35.  The 325th Fighter Wing and the 53rd Weapons Evaluation Group at Tyndall Air Force Base, the 96th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, and the Special Operations Command at Hurlburt Field make extensive use of the Joint Gulf Range  There is no comparable area in the United States near an established base with instrumentation infrastructure that can support advanced testing and joint training exercises like this. However, deployment of the instrumentation necessary to collect the data during the training on these fifth- and sixth-generation weapons systems is not in keeping with the U.Air Force needs. Instrumentation limitations have restricted the F-35 and F-22 training missions to the northernmost portion of the range. According to a study by the 96th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, this limitation causes congestion and has obstructed at least 80 missions per year.  This amendment, which I am offering with my Florida colleagues, Mr.Tom Rooney, Mr.Matt Gaetz, and Mr.Francis Rooney, will accelerate investments approved by Congress to deploy new infrastructure along the Joint Gulf Range The amendment will maximize the utility of this vast range, which is a true national treasure for combat training and advanced testing and evaluation.

FINDINGS AND       (a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From      Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the      current system of privately financed campaigns for election      to the United States Senate has the capacity, and is often      perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United      States by--       (1) creating a culture that fosters actual or perceived      conflicts of interest by encouraging Senators to accept large      campaign contributions from private interests that are      directly affected by Federal legislation;       (2) diminishing or appearing to diminish Senators'      accountability to constituents by compelling legislators to      be accountable to the major contributors who finance their      election campaigns;       (3) undermining the meaning of the right to vote by      allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and      unfair influence within the political process;       (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through      legislative and regulatory distortions caused by unequal      access to lawmakers for campaign contributors;       (5) making it difficult for some qualified candidates to      mount competitive Senate election campaigns;       (6) disadvantaging challengers and discouraging competitive      elections; and       (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with      fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry      out their public responsibilities.       (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From      the Fair Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and declares that      providing the option of the replacement of large private      campaign contributions with allocations from the Fair      Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and general elections      to the Senate would enhance American democracy by--       (1) reducing the actual or perceived conflicts of interest      created by fully private financing of the election campaigns      of public officials and restoring public confidence in the      integrity and fairness of the electoral and legislative      processes through a program which allows participating      candidates to adhere to substantially lower contribution      limits for contributors with an assurance that there will be      sufficient funds for such candidates to run viable electoral      campaigns;       (2) increasing the public's confidence in the      accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect      them, which derives from the program's qualifying criteria to      participate in the voluntary program and the conclusions that      constituents may draw regarding candidates who qualify and      participate in the program;       (3) helping to reduce the ability to make large campaign      contributions as a determinant of a citizen's influence      within the political process by facilitating the expression      of support by voters at every level of wealth, encouraging      political participation, and incentivizing participation on      the part of Senators through the matching of small dollar      contributions;       (4) potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars that      may be (or that are perceived to be) currently allocated      based upon legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the      influence of campaign contributions;       (5) creating genuine opportunities for all Americans to run      for the Senate and encouraging more competitive elections;       (6) encouraging participation in the electoral process by      citizens of every level of wealth; and       (7) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with      raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their      public responsibilities.     102.

252,topic-id,581,"Mr.Chairman, as you know, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 tasks the Missile Defense Agency with developing a space-based ballistic missile intercept layer.  There is no doubt that a space-based missile defense, if it is technologically feasible and economically justifiable, would make an important contribution to our national security. So would the Star Trek transporter or the warp drive, but as a scientist and, in fact, the only Ph.scientist in the U.Congress, I think that we need to do our homework before investing hundreds of billions of dollars into attempting to develop this system. As such, my amendment would prohibit the use of funds to attempt to develop a space-based missile intercept layer.  It has been more than 30 years since President Reagan called for defending the United States against a first strike by developing a strategic defense system, commonly known as Star  The idea of a space-based version of this has gone in and out of fashion for the last 30 years, but every time this space-based concept has been looked at by technologically competent outside experts, it was deemed to be unworkable, impossibly expensive, vulnerable to countermeasures, easy for an opponent to destroy, easy to overwhelm with a small number of enemy missiles, or all of the above. This approach was judged technologically unworkable in[[Page H6503]]1983, and the status quo has not changed.  In order to reach a ballistic missile during the first few minutes of flight, a large number of interceptors must be stationed in low-altitude orbit. A report conducted by the American Physical Society in 2003 concluded that in order to ensure full coverage, a fleet of 1,000 or more orbiting satellites would be required to intercept just a single missile.  To put that in perspective, the United States currently has slightly more than 600 satellites in Earth orbit, which includes commercial, scientific, and military satellites. Moreover, the amount of launch that is required to put this material into orbit in a reasonable amount of time would greatly exceed the current U.launch capability.  The National Academies of Sciences estimated that it would cost at least $300 billion--in 2003 dollars--for just such a limited capability. And just last year, in his testimony to the House Armed Services Committee, the former Director of the Missile Defense Authority, Admiral Syring, concluded the same thing.  Setting aside the high cost, a space-based missile defense system has inherent vulnerabilities that greatly limit its effectiveness. Even with thousands of interceptors deployed, only a few would be within range to target an incoming missile, and those could be easily overwhelmed by the launch of several missiles from one location. And because interceptors must be stationed in low-altitude orbit, they are easily detected, tracked, and destroyed.  Finally, there is a more fundamental question that we must ask ourselves. And that is: Is it wise to deploy weapons in space, especially when the required technology is becoming widely available around the world?  Deploying such a system would strain strategic relationships around the globe and almost certainly trigger a space arms race.  There is no doubt that ensuring our Nation's defense and national security are of paramount priority, but spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a system which will not work, without having serious debate and at least some concept for how this might be remotely practical or affordable, is indefensible.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on my amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

I thank the subcommittee chairs, the ranking members, and the Members who presented well over 120 amendments that were made in order.

We heard that from Chairman Thornberry of the Armed Services Yet, as we know, the world did not get 21 percent safer.  In fact, we ask more of our military than ever before, and we need to support them here at home and abroad.  Today--and I said this earlier in the debate--we have the oldest Air Force in history, the Navy's fleet is smaller than it has been in decades, and the Army has just three combat brigade teams fully prepared to fight.  Moreover, we have too many aircraft that can't fly, too many ships that cannot sail, too many troops who cannot deploy. We need better equipment and training for our warfighters, and we need more of the warfighters. We need a cyber component that is really effective.

132,topic-id,1979,"Mr.Speaker, it has been a deeply troubling last 12 hours--[[Page H6569]]24 hours, I guess. The House went about trying to repeal the--and it is just tough to say--Affordable Care Act because of the thousands of people we have heard from in my district in the last 7 years who have just been devastated by the costs that skyrocketed, the premiums that skyrocketed, the deductibles that skyrocketed, the critically important doctor or medicine or facility that President Obama promised they could keep that was taken away by It is just hard to call it the Affordable Care Act because it has cost some people everything.  But every Republican had promised we would repeal It is possible Susan Collins in the Senate may not have. She didn't vote for the repeal in the last Congress, but it is my understanding that virtually everybody had promised: If you will elect me, or reelect me, I will vote for repeal.  I have literally prayed for Senator John McCain with the cancer that they found out has overtaken him, and I do hope and pray for a speedy, full recovery. But I do recall, vividly, that election in Arizona, and apparently he was extremely concerned about getting reelected.  There was hard-charging opposition in the Republican primary, more than one primary opponent, and as I recall, there were repeated promises that the Senator, if the good people of Arizona would just reelect him, give him another 6 years, he would be working tirelessly, he would be working so hard to repeal  And I did go down to the Senate Chamber this week a couple of days ago. I went down because I thought it would be historic, potentially, to have the Senate vote to proceed to debate on what we hoped would be an actual repeal of  It turns out they called it a skinny bill, or a skinny repeal. It wasn't much of a repeal at all. In fact, I guess there is a decent chance, if that had passed and become law, it may have very well ensured the total collapse of private insurance and, ultimately, the desire of those who pushed through We would ultimately end up with socialized medicine, rationed care.  I am not a fan of the term ``single payer'' because it masks what we are really talking about. We are talking about government takeover of healthcare. And as we have watched the little precious child, Charlie Gard's parents going through absolute hell, there have been so many questions: Whether you agree or disagree, should he be allowed to have further surgery? Should he have been allowed to have a procedure that might have saved his life?  It ends up going to court, and because of the laws in England with their socialized medicine, the government gets to choose who can have potentially lifesaving procedures, what life-enhancing procedures, and who can't. That is the nature of socialized medicine.                              {time}  1430  During my summer in the former Soviet Union, back when I was in college as an exchange student over there, I didn't just have tours, I saw the way people were treated in the socialized medicine of the Soviet  I have heard even some of my dear friends and colleagues here in the House say: We know socialized medicine always fails.  Actually, that is something I don't know. What I know and what I believe is socialized medicine never actually fails. Now, socialism will always fail. It always has. Even going back to the New Testament church when the Apostle Paul tried this beautiful, wonderful concept: bringing all into the common storehouse, sharing and sharing alike.  Well, eventually he realized that is going to work in Heaven just beautifully, but it sure doesn't work on So here is a new rule: if you don't work, you don't eat.  Why? Because in this beautiful, incredible world where people are human, they are imperfect. Everyone has done wrong at some point and fallen short of the glory of God--every one of us. Nobody is perfect. So you can't have a perfect system that does anything but become a totalitarian government.  It has to become totalitarian in order to force people to bring into the common storehouse. When you do that, you eliminate the incentives that have proved over recorded history to be the least effective. If you don't have incentives, it is ineffective. People don't work the hardest.  Mr.Speaker, I have mentioned before--because there was a great example during that summer in the Soviet Union at a collective farm 30 miles or so outside of Kiev--there were thousands and thousands of acres, but I could not tell the difference between the cultivated areas and the noncultivated areas.  I've worked on farms and ranches. This was in the middle of We are at about the same latitude in east You want to get out there as close to sunup as you can because it gets so hot by midafternoon you want to be finishing up by midafternoon.  Here it was the middle of the morning, and most of the farmers were out there in the middle of the village area there in the shade. Back in Mount Pleasant growing up, some of the older gentlemen had a spit and whittle club. That reminded me of that, the old guys just sitting around talking--young and old.  So I tried to use my best Russian and asked: When do you work out in the field? Obviously, these guys hadn't worked up a sweat all morning. I was trying to be pleasant. When do you work out in the field?  They all laughed. So I thought maybe I didn't say it right. But one of them then responded in Russian: I make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the sun or I am here in the shade, so I am here in the shade.  Obviously, I have not forgotten this. It is such a great example of why socialism never works because there is no incentive to work. Oh, yes, you can punish people. But that doesn't provide nearly the incentive as the Pilgrims found, their beautiful Compact: bring into the common storehouse, share and share alike.  After they lost so many people that first harsh winter, they tried something called private property--you got to keep what you produced. Wow, did it work out well. It has worked out well over the years even to the present time, although this government has continued to buy and take over more and more land and move in the direction of being socialistic.  But our medicine has not been really socialistic. It has been taken over more and more by government and the insurance companies. Why in the world did the insurance companies support ObamaCare, the ACA, in the past? Because they were so shortsighted.  I think they and the big pharmaceutical companies knew that eventually by signing onto ObamaCare they were signing their own death warrants. Not immediately. Those executives that got involved would be able to take their golden parachutes and their millions and millions of dollars in distribution. But, ultimately, we would become a socialized medicine country.  You would see mortality rates begin to go up where people didn't live as long. People would not get the knee, hip, and the back surgeries and hearing aids. The government ends up deciding who is worthy and who is not.  So America voted the Democrats out of majorities in the House and Senate mainly because they pushed through The huge majority of Americans were satisfied with their health insurance, their health insurance plans, and their healthcare.  There is a big difference. Those terms, health insurance and healthcare, have been skewed. There is a big difference. We have got to get back to a place where patients and doctors have a relationship unencumbered and without being separated by insurance companies and the government.  But if we don't repeal ObamaCare, we will move to total government control and Charlie Gard's situation where the government says: You can have a lifesaving procedure, but you cannot.  That day has already come, and it is going to be a common occurrence if we don't keep our promise and repeal  I was down there when they voted to proceed to debate. But, honest to goodness, even though I have been here 12 years and think nothing shocks me, I couldn't believe that so many people who promised over and over and over again ``we will repeal ObamaCare, we will end ObamaCare, we will get you back in control of your healthcare, we will get you back affordable healthcare'' couldn't vote even for the skinny bill.[[Page H6570]]  It hardly did much of anything to ObamaCare, even a little bit.  It is the first time I am aware of in the history of the United States Congress where one body contacted the other body--the Senate, in this case, contacted the Republicans in the House--and said: Please, we think we can pass our bill in the Senate, but you have got to promise us you won't pass it in the We will go to conference. Please promise us you won't pass it in the We have a chance to pass it in the  What kind of governance is that? I think it is a good thing to take a break from being here in session where we talk to ourselves too much. I think that is a problem here on both ends of the  I am proud of some of the things we have done here in the We have made some progress. We need to make a lot more. We need to pass the tax reform. I want to see the corporate tax get down to 15 percent so those hundreds of thousands of millions of jobs that went to China can come back to the United Why? Because we undercut the income tax that China charges to corporations.  What is a corporate tax? It is an insidious fee that citizens have to pay where the government makes them think they are not paying it--oh, it is the evil corporation paying it. It is every customer pays for the corporate tax.  If you reduce that tax, then we become competitive around the world in things that we are not competitive, and jobs come back here. As any historian can tell you, an international power that does not produce the things they need in a time of war will not remain an international power after the next war.  When we lost production of steel, of rubber, and of tires--all these things that are critical in the time of war--it will encourage our enemies to take advantage of the fact that they provide the things we will need in a time of war. The only way you really effectively avoid war, as President Reagan made clear, is you become so strong nobody wants to fight you. Those are the small times of peace in world history either when someone is so strong they enslave everybody else or that one country is so strong that believes in freedom that they force the evil leaders in the world to stay at bay where people have peace.  I want peace. I want a strong I want to keep our promises and have tax cuts.

156,topic-id,1707,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate very much my friend from California, Dana Rohrabacher, making the point that he did.  There is nothing either sinister, wrong, criminal, improper when someone is engaged in an election or when someone is not engaged in an election, if offered information that may be helpful, whatever the source. Unless it is a known criminal that is going to advise someone about some potential crime, there is normally nothing wrong with seeking or even getting that information.  I doubt there is anybody on this House floor, when offered information from a source about an opponent in a campaign, didn't at least take some action to see if there was anything legitimate to it.  So it is just amazing, when we know that there is certainly probable cause to believe crimes have been committed during the Obama administration, yet we got nothing in the way of support in investigating the probable cause of real legitimate crimes; not those for which there is no known criminal statute that would be applicable or that may have been violated, but simply, you know, there may be times when it is bad taste.  But the villainization of Donald Trump, Jr., for inquiring of someone that Loretta Lynch, as Attorney General for President Obama, specifically and personally stepped in to ensure could be in this country, it is just incredible how much is being made of Donald Trump, Jr., meeting with somebody that Attorney General Lynch pulled all kinds of strings to get her in and keep her in the country.  And then when you see that picture of this same person sitting right behind the Obama Ambassador to Russia, Ambassador McFaul, and you know at these hearings, especially an appointed and confirmed official like an ambassador, they don't want somebody directly behind them who is not supportive and not capable of reaching up and handing them a note with information that may be helpful and them answering a question.  We have had countless hearings, and I have seen it done countless times. You want somebody behind you that can help provide answers to questions that you may not can answer without their help.  So there she is, this person that these same friends who pulled all kinds of strings to get her in this country. They are all upset that she ever talked to Donald Trump, Jr., and he has--I admire the fact that he immediately saw that this was a worthless meeting and walked away from it. So pretty amazing. It was good judgment to walk away from it, once he found out what she was about.  I wish that President Obama, Loretta Lynch, and Hillary Clinton had as good a judgment in their meetings with people instead of telling our enemy--and I do consider the man with whom President Obama was meeting an enemy. He was not a friend of the United  And what does President Obama do when he doesn't think the microphone can pick him up?  He says: Tell Vladimir Putin--President Obama's close buddy--tell Vladimir, my buddy, that I have a lot more flexibility once I am past this election.  ``I will pass that on. Dah, dah, I will pass that on.''  Clear intent; there is no mistaking. The intent is: I will be able to give away more of America's defenses the way I canceled our missile defense system in Poland once I am reelected because then I don't care. I won't be running. I can't be defeated in another election. So I will be able to give away a lot more of America's defenses.  And what did our friends--who are now so upset about Donald Trump meeting with a Russian lawyer, finding out she was not worth meeting with and leaving--do back then?  They defended President Trump's actions either vocally or by their silence while we were raising questions.  I can't end this week without expressing my grave disappointment with Congress over a specific detail of the National Defense Authorization There are a number of things in there that bother me that I think are big mistakes and that I don't think we should be doing. I think we are wasting money, but compromises have to be made. We are making a form of sausage called ``laws,'' so we have got to compromise on some things.  But there are some things that are so important that there cannot be a compromise. It is too important. It will result in lives being saved or lives being lost, depending on what we do here in  So our friend, Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, realized before I did that the law, as would be in the National Defense Authorization Act, with all the compromises that had to be made under the great leadership--and I am not being sarcastic--of Congressman Mac Thornberry--did a masterful job handling all the problems that arose--but the law of the NDAA was and will be, under this new law, such that President Obama and his administration would say, the way it is worded, the way it is, authorizes us to decide that an appropriate use of this very limited more and more precious money for our military to defend us can and should be used whenever someone requests a sex change operation.  The reports are that, with the hormonal treatment, it can be around $130,000 or so per person. Military commanders advise that they have been told: If you have a military member under your command that asks for a sex change operation and you say something like ``have you really thought this through?'' or they say something like ``why don't you talk to a counselor?'' or ``let's talk about this'' or ``you give it some more thought,'' those are career-ending statements that that commander would have made; that if someone requests a sex change operation, you don't ask questions, you don't refer them to counseling, you don't suggest that they give it more thought. You just sign them up.  Now, the problem there, too, is that apparently they are advised that they have about 2 years minimum that this servicemember will be out of commission, cannot be deployed, you can't be sending them anywhere because you have months of hormonal treatment leading up to the sex change surgery. And then even if there are no complications, the followup and the rehab is quite significant. So you better count on at least a couple of years minimum where that servicemember, that military member cannot be sent anywhere, cannot be ordered deployed. They are useless in defense of our country as far as filling the immediate needs of the military, and that is astounding.  Now, potentially, some might submit that we have come to find out about maybe the greatest political lobbying by any group of our medical practitioners. And those who compile the diagnostic statistic manual, referred to as DSM--we have had I, II, III, IV, V--each time, they have been subjected to political lobbying because they didn't[[Page H5881]]want people who were thinking about a sex change operation--and even though their chromosomes would not change--still indicating they are male or female, they wanted to have surgery to change. That was considered to be a very serious illness, psychiatric illness.  But with a lot of lobbying, it eventually got downgraded, and the most recent downgrading in the DSM is to something called a ``dysphoria.'' It went from ``disorder'' to ``dysphoria.''  But dysphoria, if you look it up, it still is--well, one psychiatrist just said it means confusion, basically. If you have got transgender dysphoria, you are confused. It is the opposite of euphoria. You are not well, you are not happy, you have got behavioral problems because you are not happy with your gender.  Well, for most of our country's history, we understood that, in our military, it is not to be a societal experiment. We want people who can fight, hopefully not to their death, but to the enemy's death to stop those who would kill us or take our freedom.  And it is heartbreaking that--when the amendment came to the floor last night for a vote to prevent any of that precious money that is going to save the lives of our military members, the amendment lost by five votes, 214-209. In other words, if three people had changed their vote, that amendment passes, and no money could be used out of that precious money they need for bulletproof vests, they need for up-armored vehicles to save their lives when an IED hits them, all of these things that are so important to our military.                              {time}  1345  We are told to account for $3.5 to $3.9 billion over 10 years they are projecting to be spent, but that, of course, means that is before word gets out that if you want a sex change operation, if you can get through basic training--I am not sure about that, you may not have to get through basic--but if you can join the military and demand a sex change operation, then you are not deployable. They can't send you to combat for at least 2 years.  We will pay you as a military member. We will provide you, free, the hormonal treatments. We will take that money that could save another member's life and we will spend that on this expensive surgery to change your organs, maybe cut them off or add some, and then we will spend more of that money that could save other military members' lives and spend it on your follow-up and your rehab, all while you can't help them because you are going through this transition.  This is a difficult time, and it breaks my heart. And it is not a civilization-ending thing that happened last night, but when the book one day is written about the rise and fall of what so far has been the most free and greatest nation in the history of mankind, this would be something listed as a symptom of why this country lost the next great war, because they were more concerned about playing societal experiments than they were with defending their lives and their freedom.

157,topic-id,882,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend for his comments.  In fact, some people sometimes think that we exaggerate, but my very good friend from Iowa and I have stood there on the mountaintop outside of Vienna where Western civilization stood there in the gap, and it was all at risk. The odds were that Western civilization was going to end with the fall of If the radical Islamic group that had taken so much of the territory already, if Vienna fell, then the rest of Europe would fall. There would be no stopping this radical Islamic movement through Europe, and there is a good chance we are not even here in this fashion today.  I thought about that and my friend and I standing up there getting a briefing from an individual that knew the history so well, that this is where one group was, this is where the siege was, that is where the Polish group brought cannons, and no one in the Islamic group thought it was possible to get cannons up there.  I thought about that and reflected on that as President Trump was speaking in Warsaw, Poland, and it was clear how desirous the Polish people have always been for freedom: Yes, you can practice what religion you want to, but don't come try to take over our country and tell us we can't pursue  I did not realize until President Trump gave that speech that there in Warsaw, when Pope John Paul II, came, that they were screaming ``We want God'' as a group--amazing.  So as I recall, though, it was a Polish prince or king that came down, King Jan Sobieski who came to the aid of the Viennese people. They were under siege. They were going to be defeated. It meant the fall of Western civilization; perhaps we headed into a new Dark And this Polish king comes down, determined, gets cannon up on this mountaintop that no one who was in the 2 years of seeking a sex change operation and sex reassignment, as they call it, could possibly help do during that 2-year period. They got cannons up the mountain in position to help stop the obliteration there of the Western-civilized Vienna, to stop the fall of that radical Islamic empire from taking over and destroying Western civilization, making slaves of all of those whom they overtook.  And some, of course, in their party believed that if an individual refused to become a Muslim, they should be killed. Others believed in the more humane treatment that, no, you make them slaves, and as long as they keep paying their tax, which is really an admittance that there is no God greater than the Islamic God, as long as they are willing to subjugate themselves and worship at the altar by paying that fee to show that they were subservient to the Islamic God, then they could be allowed to live.  Those were two problems back in that day: Do we let the people live if they won't become Muslim, or do we just go ahead and kill them? And many humane thinkers thought: Well, no. As long as they will submit to our god, pay the tax to show they are submitting to our god; and Christianity's God, they have got to forget talking about that or they do need to be killed. Just pay the tax and they can go about still living.  If Vienna doesn't stand, if it falls, as was anticipated, we are done.  And I can assure my friends here in the House that there was no one who was out there defeating the radical Islamic desire to wipe out Western civilization who had undergone a sex change operation in the prior 2 years.  This is a risky time in our history. As others have pointed out, no matter what societal experimentations people want to undertake, what type of lifestyles people want to undertake, the military is intended to protect our freedom so that we can pursue these things.  And I know President Obama was fond of saying: Gee, Guantanamo is a greater recruiting tool. But as I have talked to Muslim friends--yes, I do have them around the world. As I have talked to Muslim friends in other parts of the world, whether Afghanistan, Egypt, other parts of the Middle East, North Africa, they say: You have got to understand, some of the things you do in the United States make for incredible recruiting posters for radicals in our Muslim faith.  When it is advertised that the United States Congress is in favor of taking men and surgically making them into women with the money that they would use to protect the Nation otherwise, or taking women and doing surgery to make them men, the United States Congress would rather spend that money on that surgery than defeating radical Islam, then it is an advertising, just a bonanza for the radical  My Muslim friends tell me, they then agree, the recruits: You are right. If that is how stupid they are, their society has no right to remain on the We need to take them out. They are too stupid.  A disappointing night last night and a disappointing week.

They represent a strong and enduring consensus in Congress that Guantanamo should remain open and that detainees should not be transferred to the United States for any reason.  Striking these provisions would have unknown consequences for U.communities. It is impossible to know how many detainees might be brought here, where they might be held, and the impacts on communities and facilities holding them. It is also impossible to know what the potential costs could be.  Putting detainees in U.prisons, as the administration originally proposed, would be disruptive and, potentially, disastrous. Former FBI Director Mueller has stated: ``To transfer detainees to local jails could affect or infect other prisoners or have the capability of affecting events outside the prison system.''  The idea of bringing detainees for trials in the U.quickly collapsed as local jurisdictions voiced their strong opposition.  As everyone here is aware, several detainees who have been released from Guantanamo have gone back to the fight and killed and wounded The threat is real, and Guantanamo is already equipped to handle the detention and military trial of these individuals, as appropriate.

This week is National Police We should thank police every week, but this time of year provides a special opportunity to give honor where honor is due. Law enforcement officers deserve our deep appreciation and respect.  Police officers do an excellent job protecting the residents of my district, from Columbia to Waynesville, to Warrensburg and throughout They stand ready to help wherever needed. That is why, today, I am introducing the Police Officers Protecting Children This bill would allow schools that want to allow retired or off-duty law enforcement officers to be armed as a security measure to protect children in our schools. If a school wants to allow off-duty or retired police to protect their students, the Federal Government shouldn't stop them.  The Police Officers Protecting Children Act is even more important for schools in our rural communities where law enforcement may take a significant amount of time to respond to an emergency. A well-placed retired or off-duty officer could save lives.  Law enforcement in my district have shown their support for this bill because they know firsthand that police officers have the training and experience to protect our children when it counts. They have the trust of our communities and have years of experience carrying a weapon. I thank them for their service and their willingness to protect our children while they are at school.  Law enforcement officers live out the honorable duo of bravery and service. They put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities, often without the thanks they deserve. They work day in and day out patrolling our neighborhoods, getting drugs off the streets, and protecting us from criminals who seek to do us harm.  In Missouri, we honor the brave men and women who carry the badge as police officers. This National Police Week, I am glad to recognize those officers and their bravery and service protecting the people of  So to the police around the Nation and in my home State of Missouri, I say to you: Thank you for your service.

Daniel Kahikina Akaka dedicated his life to serving the people of He served as a Member of the U.Senate for 22 years. Prior to that, he served Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives for 14 years.  However, his story of leadership and service begins well before his tenure on Capitol  On December 7, 1941, a young Senator Akaka witnessed Japanese fighter planes attacking Pearl Harbor from his dorm room at the Kamehameha The events of that morning were life-altering for him and many young men his age, and he joined the war effort.  Following his service in World War II with the U.Army Corps of Engineers,[[Page S2879]]Senator Akaka earned a bachelor's degree from the University of He later attained a master's degree as well. As he has relayed in the past, had it not been for the benefits received under the G.Bill, Senator Akaka's future in public service would not have been more than a dream.  A believer in the power of education, Senator Akaka made it a career. Before entering politics, he served as a teacher, principal, and educational administrator, making a difference in the lives of many students for over 15 years.  As a veteran himself, Senator Akaka dedicated his service in Congress to helping servicemembers, veterans, and their families. His commitment to these issues led to his service as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs from 2007 to 2011. As chairman, he worked to expand VA services. He also authored and passed the Post-9/11 G.Bill, which is making a difference to new generations of veterans as the original G.Bill did for his generation.  Not only was Senator Akaka a champion for education and veterans, he was also a champion for Native He is the first person of Native Hawaiian ancestry to serve in the U.Senate, and he grew up in an era where the Hawaiian language and culture were heavily looked down upon. To help change this perception, he committed to protecting the language, culture, and traditions of indigenous peoples.  Senator Akaka advanced these priorities as chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs from 2011 to 2013. He also played a key role in ensuring the passage of legislation that enhanced Native Hawaiian education programs and authored a joint resolution that acknowledged the U.Government's role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893, while recognizing the special trust relationship held with the Native Hawaiian community.  He also fought tirelessly for self-determination for Native  During his time in Washington, DC, he served the people of Hawaii well and with distinction. Although he retired in 2012, Senator Akaka has continued down a path of leadership and service, speaking to students and mentoring some of Hawaii's up-and-coming leaders. We all appreciate his continued service.

304,topic-id,760,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding, and I thank the chairman for bringing this resolution to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, as I was sitting here listening to Congressman Johnson, I got so inspired that I just want to go out and jump in a soapbox or jump on a soapbox to give my talk.  I have been at this for a very long period of time. The soapbox derby has been going on for 76 years; 36 of those years, I had the great privilege of serving in this body. I rise each year to sponsor the resolution allowing the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to hold its annual race on the Capitol It is appropriate, I think, that it is here at the The inspiration of the Capitol, the inspiration of the dome, the inspiration and excitement of which Congressman Johnson just spoke, I think, captures the sense of what ``soapbox derby'' means.  This year marks, as I said, the 76th year of the derby, Mr.Speaker, at which young people from around the region, from age 8 all the way to age 17, compete in three divisions. Those divisions are stock, super stock, and masters. So you are talking about these sophisticated soapboxes. They are not your father's soapbox, that is for sure.  It is not only a fun and exciting event, it is also educational and brings children together, young people together, young adults together with their parents, grandparents, siblings, and neighbors to plan and build their soapbox racers.  You know, one of the things we need in America is more engineers. I am a lawyer. I don't know that we need more lawyers. And we need doctors, of course, but people tell me, if we are going to make things in America, we need more engineers, people who work with their hands, people who create, people who design, and that is what this soapbox derby is about.  Doing so, participating in this contest helps connect these young people with hands-on engineering and manufacturing lessons which promote greater interest in the STEM fields which we all talk about: science, technology, engineering, and math. This has been the case, Mr.Speaker, since the first soapbox derby in 1938, and this long tradition now continues in the 21st century.  The winner in each division will then qualify to race against the regional champions from across the Nation later this year, at Derby Downs, at the All-American Soap Box Derby in Akron,  This year, the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby will be held on June 17, Mr.The derby has been called ``the greatest amateur racing event in the world.'' I don't know whether it is the greatest, but it is certainly one of the great contests in the world and teaches participating youth about fortitude, about leadership, about engineering, sportsmanship, and pride of achievement.                              {time}  1645  In addition to bringing families together, the Soap Box Derby brings communities closer together, Mr.Many of the races are sponsored and cheered by their local civic groups, police, fire departments, and service organizations.  I have been proud, as I said, Mr.Speaker, to sponsor this resolution for 26 years, and I believe strongly in the importance of this tradition and am convinced of the very positive impact the Derby has on young people from my district who participate, around this region, and around the country.  Maryland's Fifth District, my district, has been home to a number of Greater Washington Soap Box Derby winners, including the winners from 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014.  The Washington region is millions of people. My young people and their advisers, otherwise may be called parents, are doing pretty well in this, and we are proud of that. Our racers even won the national championship in 2007 and 2008.  I hope my colleagues, Mr.Speaker, will join me in supporting this resolution and thanking the organizers of the Greater Washington Soap Box I hope they will also join me in congratulating, in advance, all of the young people from the region who will be participating on June 17.

294,topic-id,768,"Mr.Speaker, let me raise several questions for President Donald The American people and Members of Congress would like to know the answers.  I am deeply concerned the President is compromising the national security of our Why would a President share intelligence information with the highest ranking operatives of Russia close to President Vladimir Putin?  Though the President's cavalier and, frankly, outrageous behavior conveniently sucked up the airwaves last week, Americans cannot be distracted from his simultaneous firing of FBI Director James Comey, an official who spent his life protecting and defending the Constitution of our country on liberty's behalf.  Let me ask: Why were no U.journalists allowed into the President's historic meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and Russia's Ambassador to the United States for many years, Ambassador Kislyak, one of probably the highest ranking intelligence officers as well as Ambassador from Russia to the United States? To my knowledge, no U.President has ever received officials from Russia in the Oval Office and then brought only Russian journalists with digital recording equipment into that office. Let me repeat that. We don't know who they were, but they brought equipment, digital recording equipment.  Think about that. Think about that.  Meanwhile, the President excluded American press. Not a single journalist from this country was allowed in. He replaced them with Russian state media operatives. Today, CNN reports that, how conveniently, President Vladimir Putin has now said he will[[Page H4231]]make available to America the transcript of that meeting. He is willing to share it. Well, isn't that nice?  It is further alarming that his National Security Advisor, General McMaster, said that, despite the President being unaware of the source of the information, at that meeting he made a spur-of-the-moment decision to tell the Russians what he knew about very important intelligence we received from an ally.  It is starting to pile up, Mr.President: more and more reckless and cavalier behavior every day with America's security stakes very high.  I don't have to remind my colleagues, it is on the record. Russia has been buzzing into U.airspace over Her submarines are along the East This isn't exactly a friend to us. If you want to make America great again, you do not compromise America's national security.  Not only is the President struggling for a coherent foreign policy that keeps Americans safe and secure and doesn't make our allies quizzical, he fails to keep his attention on promises to working Americans here on home turf, particularly on trade and jobs. Let's take the promises he made to our steelworkers in Ohio, that they will not lose their jobs, that America will be great again, that the coalfields will just boom; right?  Well, in Lorain, Ohio, thousands of steelworkers are losing their jobs, with hundreds more, as I stand here today, being pink-slipped and getting termination notices unless the President takes action by the end of the first week in This is not the only community in America facing this, but it is not getting any publicity because all this other stuff is all over the front pages.  We know we need direct and immediate action to save America's steel industry that has been dumped on by Chinese, Russian, and South Korean steel for years now. We need to stop foreign-dumped steel. These workers' jobs are directly impacted by what is happening at our borders with all that stuff coming in here.  I have invited the President and his Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, to Lorain, Ohio, to witness firsthand this unfolding tragedy. Well, no promises are firm yet, not getting any acceptances while our workers need to be thrown a life raft in the typhoon that they are enduring. Perhaps it is hard to make America great again if you are moving from one self-made crisis to another and losing attention on the homeland.  Lorain County carried for Hillary Clinton, but only by 104 votes. It is a Democratic county. They were hoping jobs might actually begin to be increased in that area, not zeroed out.  So let's recap: a roller coaster foreign policy confusing not just us, but our allies, and broken promises regarding jobs.  How about healthcare? Well, let's take this--more confusion.  We can be certain TrumpCare removes--removes--protections for our seniors and does not address the rising costs of medications. His bill will take away assistance that closed the Medicare prescription drug hole after seniors reach a level of $2,500, costing them over $1,000 more a year.

337,topic-id,731,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Murphy for his incredible leadership on this important topic and for holding this Special Order this evening.  I can tell you, the citizens of the State of Ohio are paying attention. The opioid epidemic continues to intensify with over 2 million people addicted to prescription opioids and more than half a million addicted to heroin in 2015, alone.  According to an estimate from The New York Times, drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50; and drug overdoses are the leading cause of accidental death in our country, with prescription opioids responsible for more than 20,000 deaths in the United States just in 2015, according to the American Society of Addiction  I have to mention that Medicaid plays an important role in addressing this epidemic because it is a lifeline program, providing coverage to over 650,000 non-elderly adults with opioid addiction and covering a range of treatment services.  Ohio, tragically, leads the Nation in opioid overdoses in 2014. Sadly, deaths have continued to rise with increased use of heroin and fentanyl. Many States have expanded Medicaid, including Ohio, to cover adults who make a modest $16,500 a year per individual. By broadening coverage of adults, the Medicaid expansion reaches many low-income adults with opioid addiction who were previously ineligible for coverage and facilitates access to treatment.  The opioid epidemic is so bad that even librarians are learning how to treat overdoses for individuals who come into libraries.  Mental health can be comorbid with opioid abuse, and those suffering from that duality are truly an American tragedy. For an addict to complete rehab and recovery successfully, they need to work in concert. And over half of uninsured non-elderly adults with an opioid addiction had a mental illness in the past year, with over one in five operating with a serious mental illness, such as depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.  To address the gravity of the challenge, I want to put on the Record the work that Lucas County, my home county, is doing with their DART program, which engages hospitals, mental health centers, and businesses in the community.  Believe it or not, according to Sheriff Tharp, the DART program has helped nearly 2,300 overdose victims and has a 74 percent success rate of getting people into detox and treatment programs at a total cost of about $370 per individual. This is truly an amazing record, and I wish to include in the Record the information about other counties in the district that I represent.  The opioid epidemic does not just affect the addicted. Lucas County Children Services is struggling to help children displaced by the opioid epidemic.  The agency has been repeatedly forced to do the unimaginable tasks of comforting children as first responders work to save their parents from a heroin or fentanyl overdoses. On several occasions, it has had to break the terrible news to these children that their parents succumbed to their addiction.  LCCS is also coping with a dramatic increase in the number of children placed in protective custody because their families have been blinded by substance dependence. The State's current budget proposes no increase for this program, which is a shame. This is no time to short change children.  Finally, I submit for the Record a story of the Guest family of Lorain, Ohio, whose daughter Tera died of a heroin overdose at the age of 24.  According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer: ``Tera Guest, 24, died 29, 2014, shortly after she and her sister used painkillers and a heroin-fentanyl mix. Her death marked the end of a two-year period that included stints in treatment and losing custody of her two children to her mother.[[Page H5228]]  ``Tera is among the hundreds who have died of overdoses within the last three years in Lorain The county coroner's office said a record 67 people died in 2013, followed by 60 in 2014 and 62 in 2015.''  Lori took her tragedy and turned it into action and formed the Lorain Community Task Force, which is a group that raises awareness and provides assistance to addicts and their families.  Lori stepped up, and now Congress must do the same. We cannot turn our back on these people now. We must fight, we must work together, we must put politics aside. Only then can we begin to heal our Nation from this crisis.  ",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgH5221.txt,616,1645,2017.0,27.0,July

62,topic-id,636,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to address the ICE raids that have happened in  I was alarmed by the U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids that have resulted in the detention and possible removal of Iraqi nationals, as well as other members of the Detroit community.  Why am I alarmed?  Mr.Speaker, what we saw happen on Sunday, June 11, was an all out push to just remove Iraqi nationals who have been in this country, some for up to 40 years, who have lived in this country, raised families, have worked, and were subject to raids. Over 100 Iraqi nationals, including Chaldeans and Muslims, were removed from their families and transported to a correctional facility in Youngstown,  I have been in touch with community leaders, who are not only distressed by the ongoing situation, but also expressed concern regarding the dangers that await these individuals if they return to an active war zone in  Many of the communities characterize these raids as having a deliberate and calculated motive. Understand that these deportations are part of an agreement made between Prime Minister Abadi and President Trump as part of a deal to remove Iraq from the travel ban, an agreement that is not in writing, Mr.Speaker, an agreement that Congress nor the public has access to.  When ISIS reared its ugly head in 2014 in northern Iraq, its main targets for genocide, sexual slavery, and other gross human rights violations included these same people: Iraqi Christians, Muslims, and other ethnic and religious minorities.  In 2014, Congress passed a resolution, unanimously, recognizing Iraq's ethnic and religious minorities as victims of genocide in Iraq and Since then, both the Obama administration and Trump administration have referred to these acts of violence against Iraqi Chaldeans and others as genocide; yet still we are going to deport these same people back to a country where there will be, surely, a confrontation of death or slavery. Removing these individuals represents what many have described as a ``death sentence'' should they be deported into an active war zone.  The final orders, we are told, of people who were convicted of offenses are based on criminal activities; but we know for a fact, some were for driving without a license and some were for having possession of marijuana 25 years ago.

153,topic-id,978,"Madam President, as we know, the Senate is considering a stopgap--continuing resolution--to keep the government of the American people open for business. The stopgap, of course, helps us forget the fact that in November we had all the appropriations bills ready to go, but the leadership asked us to hold it off.  Now, I am going to support this 1-week continuing resolution, because I believe we are close to a bipartisan agreement that would avoid the devastating consequences of a government shutdown and save the Congress from once again facing the disruption and humiliation of failing to meet Congress's obligation to fund the basic functions of our government.[[Page S2634]]  But we shouldn't be in this situation. We shouldn't have allowed partisan politics to once again turn a looming deadline into a political standoff and what is really a manufactured crisis.  As I have said, our work could have been and should have been completed in We were prepared to do that. We were 90 percent to the finish line--98 percent, actually, to the finish line. Republicans and Democrats had worked together. But at the request of then-President-Elect Trump, all work ground to a halt. For 5 months we have faced one partisan obstacle after another from the Trump administration, including a demand to fund a misguided wall on the southern border at the expense of billions of dollars that would have to be paid for--not by Mexico or anybody else. It would be paid for by the American taxpayers. The administration then threatened to hold hostage the basic health insurance of millions of Americans, crippling the Affordable Care This is more than insulting. It is malicious, and it is wrong.  Now the other side of the aisle is holding the budget of the American people hostage, insisting we include dozens of poison pill riders as the price for funding the people's government and to advance their partisan agenda on abortion, Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reforms, and the environment.  The Republicans control both Houses of Congress and the White If they want to pass legislation on these divisive issues, then bring the bills to the floor and vote on them, instead of trying to hide them in an appropriations bill. If they really believe in all these poison pill amendments, then vote on them. Bring up legislation. They control the House and the They can bring it up anytime they want.  Partisan politics should not be tied to must-pass spending bills, because it is never the right time to play politics with the lives of the American people and the government of the wealthiest and most powerful Nation on  I think it is very obvious why they want to hide them in an appropriations bill. They don't want to vote on it and give great speeches on the wall, on our southern border. They know that they don't have enough Republican votes to pass it.  One party now controls the White House and both Chambers of It is incumbent upon the Republicans to ensure that the government of the American people stays open and is fully funded. I am afraid that the partisan bluster threatens to derail months of bipartisan negotiations.  As vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, I have been involved in those negotiations. Charles Kieffer and Chanda Betourney have worked almost around the clock for weeks representing us on the Appropriations If the bluster and the posturing would stop, we could wrap this up.  I hope that with one more week, our bipartisan and our bicameral negotiations, consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement and without poison pills, can continue, because this is no way to govern.  To date, negotiations have produced many positive outcomes for the American people. We have increased investments in the National Institutes of We secured full year Pell grants. We made investments in transit.  As to something that should be of concern to every single Senator from every single State, we made funding available to address the opioid crisis. That is not a Democratic or Republican issue. That is a human issue. Every single State in this country is facing an opioid crisis. I am pleased that Republicans and Democrats came together to address it.  Let's not govern by partisan manufactured crises. Let's do what the American people expect us to do and come together to pay the bills of our country. Stop posturing. We are the greatest democracy on Earth, the most powerful and the wealthiest Nation on Let's start acting that way. Let's start governing as we should. Let's not hide these divisive issues in an appropriations bill. Let's have votes straight up or down. Let people vote and show their constituents, the American people, where they stand.

312,topic-id,775,"Mr.President, the right to vote is among the most sacred rights guaranteed by our It forms the foundation for our democracy and inspires countless people across the world still striving for a meaningful opportunity to engage in the political process and shape their futures.  My friend John Lewis has often said that ``the right to vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democracy.'' I could not agree more with him. America is a stronger and greater country when more Americans participate in our democracy. We are better when our citizens hold their elected representatives accountable and voice their opinions on the critical issues facing our We can take a historic step to foster even greater participation in our democracy simply by modernizing the way Americans register to vote.  Today, I am proud to introduce the Automatic Voter Registration Act of 2017. This bill would require States to automatically register citizens who are eligible to vote when they interact with State and Federal agencies. Americans would have the option of declining automatic registration, but this bill would provide for a registration process that is easier for our citizens and one that is more efficient and accurate.  The bill I introduce today streamlines the voter registration process by providing for online registration and greater portability of registration when an individual moves to a different location in the same Under this bill, no one can be unfairly penalized for inadvertent registration, and punishment is limited to cases of intentional registration fraud or illegal voting. This bill also includes important privacy protections and makes clear that the information used to automatically register individuals will remain secure. These are commonsense reforms that would not only help Americans vote but also help maintain accurate and up-to-date voter registration rolls.  Last year, Vermont became one of the States leading the country on improving our citizens' access to the ballot by becoming one of just eight States to approve automatic voter registration. I want to commend Vermont secretary of state Jim Condos for his outstanding work on this issue and for the people of  State election officials estimate that tens of thousands of Vermonters will now be registered to vote because of this new law. Implementing these types of reforms nationwide will make America stronger and increase participation of a broader electorate. A recent study by the Center for American Progress on Oregon's automatic voter registration law that went into effect in January 2016 found that more than 272,000 people were added to voter rolls, and 98,000 of them were new voters in the November 2016 Presidential election. That is a remarkable success story, and hopefully other State legislatures will take notice. The Brennan Center for Justice, which has been a leading voice protecting Americans' right to vote, concluded in a 2015 report that a comprehensive, nationwide automatic voter registration plan has the potential to increase voter registration by 50 million eligible voters. This would not only save money and increase accuracy, but it would also reduce the potential for fraud and protect the integrity of our elections.  I would like to thank the Brennan Center for Justice for its work on this issue and for working with me on this bill. I would also like to thank Senators Durbin and Klobuchar for joining me as original cosponsors. Congressman Brady of Pennsylvania, the ranking member on the House Committee on House Administration, has been a leader on this issue and has introduced a House companion bill.  All members of Congress should support this legislation. We should all[[Page S3491]]strive to make sure that our constituents have access to the ballot box and are able to have their voices heard. This is of course just one reform we must make to ensure that our citizens' voting rights are protected. In the coming weeks, I intend to reintroduce legislation to restore the full protections of the Voting Rights It has now been almost 4 years since the Supreme Court's devastating decision in Shelby County v. Holder, and we have seen the effect of that disastrous ruling as States have attempted to enact discriminatory voter ID laws and other measures intended to prevent minority voters from going to the polls. That is disgraceful, and we must do better. Congress must act to ensure that millions of Americans are not disenfranchised.  The right to vote should not be a partisan issue. It is a right that forms the basis of our democracy, and it is incumbent on all Americans, Democratic and Republican, to ensure that no American's right to vote is infringed. Modernizing our voter registration system is one significant step forward.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-06-14-pt1-PgS3489.txt,1383,ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION,2017.0,14.0,July

Transgender individuals are part of the fabric of America and have always been part of our military, whether we have historically acknowledged them or not.  The arguments against allowing transgender servicemembers to serve openly in our military are the same arguments that have been used against every other group that has been prohibited from serving in our country's history--including Black and Latino men, women, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. Each time the doors of our military open farther to better reflect the diversity of our Nation, the same tired and discredited arguments are brought back: that any individual in the new group, regardless of his or her ability, is unfit to serve and that their service will disrupt unit cohesion.  The Acting The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgH6493.txt,850,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,27.0,July
236,topic-id,149,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.  Not only should all willing and able Americans be allowed and encouraged to serve--they already do. A report prepared for the Department of Defense estimates thousands of transgender individuals serve today, without issue.  The President must not impose blanket bans that prejudge servicemembers based on their identity, rather than their own merits. President Trump is attacking people who have shown a willingness--indeed, an eagerness--to risk their lives in the service of our country. It is apparent that the decision to ban transgender people from military service was taken without consulting Secretary of Defense Mattis, who seemed surprised by the tweets, or the military, which seems at a loss as to how to implement the order.  Even if this bigoted order is motivated by political opportunism, it disgraces our country and must be rescinded.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

334,topic-id,372,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership on this important issue and for the opportunity to address the House on this very important topic.  Mr.Speaker, as you have heard, our Nation is facing an epidemic. Over the past two decades, opioid overdoses have quadrupled. Think about that. They have quadrupled in the United My home State, as Murphy has just mentioned, has faced significant increases in drug overdose death rates, including a 70 percent increase in synthetic opioid overdose deaths in just the last 10 years. It is clear that this is a crisis, which is why we in Congress are committed to combating this growing epidemic.  Late last year, Congress passed sweeping legislation, called the 21st Century Cures It was bipartisan legislation that authorized $6.3 billion in funding to bring our healthcare innovation infrastructure into the 21st century. This legislation included $1 billion for opioid intervention and prevention treatment programs throughout all 50 Earlier this spring, the Federal Government began awarding grants in order to confront this crisis, including $11.7 million to the State of  While these funds will help expand treatment options, there is still much more work to be done at the Federal level, which is why I cosponsored legislation like H.1057, the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention, or STOP, Designed to stop dangerous synthetic drugs like fentanyl, which you heard about, and carfentanil from being shipped through our borders, this legislation will combat bad actors from China and India who have been taking advantage of weaknesses in international mail security standards to break U.customs laws and really wreak havoc on our communities.  This is just one step of the opioid crisis that we must address. We need to combat the illicit drugs coming into this country as well as equip doctors, nurses, and first responders with the resources they need to treat pain appropriately.  We also need to support better access to care for individuals suffering from psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. And, most importantly, we must ensure these drugs are not falling into the hands of our Nation's children.  My colleagues in Congress and I are committed to combating this epidemic to keep it from causing further harm to our Nation's families and communities.

The Clerk read as follows:       Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that      the President shall immediately disclose his tax return      information to Congress and the American people.       Whereas, in the United States' system of checks and      balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the Executive      Branch of government to the highest standard of transparency      to ensure the public interest is placed first;       Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every      President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return      information to the public;       Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline      disclosure because they contain highly instructive      information including whether the candidate paid taxes, what      they own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they      have made any charitable donations, and whether they have      taken advantage of tax loopholes;       Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns could      help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016      election understand the President's financial ties to the      Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed      and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity      interests, joint ventures or licensing agreements with Russia      or Russians;       Whereas, the President fired FBI Director James Comey last      week, whose FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign      colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election;       Whereas, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who made the      recommendation to fire Director Comey, during sworn testimony      neglected to mention his contacts with the Russian ambassador      and recused himself from anything involving the Russian      investigation;       Whereas, Senate Russia investigators have requested      information from the Treasury Department's criminal      investigation division, the Financial Crimes Enforcement      Network, or FinCEN, which handles cases of money laundering,      for information related to President Trump, his top officials      and campaign aides. FinCEN has been investigating allegations      of foreign money-laundering through purchases of U.real      estate;       Whereas, the President's tax returns would show us whether      he has foreign bank accounts and how much profit he receives      from his ownership in myriad partnerships;       Whereas, the President hired a law firm to send a letter to      Senator Lindsey Graham to fight suggestions he has Russian      business ties; this letter left open the question whether ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4291.txt,1510,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,17.0,July

Under rule IX, clause 1, questions of the privileges of the House are ``those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.'' There is nothing more of a threat to the integrity of this House than ignoring our duty to provide a check and balance to the executive branch. To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request President Trump's tax returns and begin to give the American people the transparency they deserve. That is what we should be giving them.  Now, Mr.Speaker, it is evidence time. Today there is in The Wall Street Journal an article entitled, ``Russian State-Run Bank Financed Deal Involving Trump Hotel Partner.'' It is a very interesting article, I advise, and I want to put it into the Record with your permission.  Mr.Speaker, a letter was sent just recently from Mr.Trump's lawyers to Mr.Trump and then on to Senator Lindsey That letter was supposed to be an explanation of the President of the United States' involvement in the finances and vice versa of Russia and President It does not in any manner, shape, or form, Mr.Speaker, go into any partnership which may exist.

I rise during this en bloc amendment debate to discuss an issue that is raised in the amendment about the importance of the DDG-51 to our In particular, I am grateful to our committee for the clear guidance and language that was provided in the fiscal year 2017 Omnibus Appropriations Act that was passed in this body just 2 short months ago.  That language called attention to the need not only to support the DDG-51 program but to ensure we do so with a design and upgrade that is technically mature and fiscally responsible.  It was clear in that language, and in report language that is included in the bill before us today, that Congress continues to expect the Navy to comply with the direction that the additional fiscal year `16 DDG-51 ship be contracted and completed as a flight II-A ship.  Because there are concerns raised by the GAO about the new flight III design radar upgrade for the DDG-51, there needs to be a thoughtful process in place.

I commend him for that work. Also, with mental health issues, he has been helping educate Congress about moving toward solutions.  My colleague has outlined the scope of the national problem we have, and each of us can talk about our respective districts and what has been going on there.  In my district, just over the border from my colleague's, western Pennsylvania has been especially hard hit. In Beaver County, we saw 102 overdose deaths related to opioids in 2016, up from 30 in 2013. In Cambria County, we lost 94 people to overdose deaths in 2016, a startling 62 percent increase from 2015.  The stories just keep coming. A story of the mother who lost her 10th child, her youngest child, to this epidemic, who insisted that the words ``damn heroin'' be put in her son's obituary. Or the couple we learned about before Christmas, who overdosed, and 3 days later their infant died from neglect, all three being found 4 days after that.  Mr.Speaker, it is all hands on deck to address this crisis. We are coming together at the Federal, State, and community level to develop a comprehensive strategy to stop this epidemic and to share best practices at every level. That is what a big part of our Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, passed last year, was all about--an important first step.  Another asset we have, Mr.Speaker, is the Office of National Drug Control This week, I led a bipartisan group of my colleagues, in a letter to President Trump requesting that the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy be re-elevated to a Cabinet-level position.  Since its inception, this Office has played a central and critical role in fighting drug trafficking and drug addiction. Both the Office of National[[Page H5225]]Drug Control Policy and its Director have played, and should continue to play, a central role in this effort.  The Office was created in 1988 with the Anti-Drug Abuse Its mission is to fight the Nation's drug problem through three areas: prevention, addiction recovery, and enforcement.  The Office's Director, commonly referred to as the ``drug czar,'' was elevated to the Cabinet in 1993 by President Clinton, who wanted to raise the Office's profile in order to coordinate and emphasize legislative efforts on the More importantly, he wanted to focus and emphasize efforts within the administration for the antidrug efforts of the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human The Obama administration removed the Office from the position it had in the  When it comes to drug addiction as well as to the illicit drug trade occurring across our southern border, the challenges have never been greater.

In addition to the legislation that we are passing here in Congress, the administration has a crucial role to play, as do leaders at the State and local level.  We all want to end this crisis, and this common cause unites us, perhaps more than any other issue, across party and partisan lines.

227,topic-id,599,"Mr.Chairman, the American people are becoming more and more aware of the degenerative disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, CTE, due to the crisis in the The NFL, of course, has been trying to sweep this under the rug.  Very recently, the Journal of the American Medical Association, a premier journal that is peer-reviewed, provided a study that found severe neurological damage in the vast majority of former football players' brains that were donated for research after they developed mental symptoms during life. Eighty-seven percent of all football players' brains showed CTE, but a truly horrible figure, 99 percent of the brains of NFL players showed  However, the dangers of CTE are not confined to football. Our servicemen and -women are subject to similar--or, oftentimes, even worse--dangers in the line of duty for the service they provide to our  Last year, I was honored to host Bennet Omalu for the State of the He is the doctor portrayed in the film ``Concussion,'' exposing the impact of CTE on professional football players. He began his research covering his own expenses and exposing a coverup of the suicides of former athletes. However, his research and the research of others is limited by the funding, which is why I am offering this amendment.  Today we have an opportunity to prevent a similar kind of coverup among our service agencies. This amendment would dedicate $25 million in funding as part of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs to award grants to medical researchers and universities to support early detection of                              {time}  1515  This amendment would not increase spending, but take the funding already allocated and put some of it--a very small part of it--towards  Every hour, we lose another veteran to suicide. We have made great strides towards supporting PTSD research, but the exposure to IEDs and other blasts and blows to the head, may be doing similar damage, which goes unseen until it is too late. By diagnosing CTE early among servicemembers, perhaps we can begin to change the troubling trend of suicides among our veterans.  You may hear arguments today that this amendment is not necessary, since DOD is already spending $125 million on TBI research. But this research is on short-term trauma, not on long-term effects of repeated head injuries and, what are called, subconcussive blows. Servicemembers at risk of CTE may not even have acute trauma. CTE can result from minor events over a long period of time.  You may also hear that Congress shouldn't dictate the DOD research. But it is absolutely Congress' role to have input into DOD spending, and there is a huge need that is not being filled. And we already are requiring that they do TBI research as it is.  Now, some have suggested: Well, there has been some projects funded. Of the $125 million of funding, the amount of money going to CTE projects has been, since 2012, only five projects, for a grand total cost of $2.9 million. And not one dime has been spent since 2013.  It is time for us to accept that science is real here. JAMA has just put out a stunning report that suggests that this is a very serious problem, and it is time for us to combat this issue.  Creating dedicated grants for the early detection of CTE has the potential to prevent suicides among our servicemembers and will have, I think, a very important impact on how we look at CTE in the future and how we make sure that our servicemembers are properly protected.[[Page H6501]]  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

93,topic-id,291,"Mr.Speaker, my legislation gives military spouses the choice to establish the same State of residency as the servicemember, giving them the benefit of retaining the same State of residency for voting and tax purposes.  As the proud Representative of Fort Drum and the Navy site at Kesselring, which I visited just this past Friday, I have heard firsthand about the challenges that military families face, and I have the highest respect for the sacrifices these families make to help protect our Nation and safeguard our freedom.  Military families must relocate every few years due to their spouse's responsibility to meet the requirements within the military. They sacrifice a great deal during these relocations, uprooting their lives and disrupting their families, all while serving as the critical support system for their loved ones. This is often a difficult and challenging time, with the heaviest burden falling upon military spouses.  Current law allows Active-Duty servicemembers to maintain one State of legal residence for tax and voting purposes, even when servicemembers receive military orders requiring them to relocate, but this does not apply to the servicemember's spouse. Essentially, this loophole requires spouses to establish residency every time the servicemember receives a new assignment, adding undue stress and anxiety to military families already under the pressure of managing their relocation. This legislation fixes this inconsistency.  Military spouses serve, too, and this bill eliminates the daunting task of documenting multiple tax jurisdictions and helps reduce instances of military spousal unemployment.  Traveling across the north country in New York, I have listened to the sacrifices our military families make to keep our Nation safe. We have a duty to reduce these burdens they face.

In my district, for almost four decades, the people of Bethpage and the surrounding areas have been dealing with an environmental crisis. Groundwater pollution, stemming from the Navy and defense contractor activity, has resulted in an underground plume of contaminated water that is moving south through Long Island's sole source of drinking water, towards Congressman King's district.  While costly remediation efforts ensure the water is safe to consume, it doesn't change the fact that residents deserve to have this cleaned up before it spreads any further.

Today it is estimated that 1 in 68 people will be born with autism. There has been a significant increase in the number of people born with autism in just a decade.  With an increase in diagnoses of Americans with autism spectrum, it is important that we expand research and provide adequate resources for people on the spectrum. By increasing awareness, we seek to support the numerous families along with millions of individuals managing an autism disorder.  The earlier autism can be diagnosed and treated, the better chance that person has to pursue an independent and productive life. Thus, it is crucial that our early childcare programs, and especially our schools, have the knowledge, resources, and ability to provide assistance to those with autism.  I also wish to acknowledge my friend and former constituent, Vincent McLaughlin, who serves as an inspiration for autism awareness. Vincent, like many Americans with autism, is an active and devoted member of his local community and proudly serves as a member of his local volunteer fire department. For years, Vincent has sought to increase awareness for autism and to serve as an example of just how beneficial early treatment can be.  Autism should not be a barrier to preventing Americans from achieving success and pursuing happiness.

60,topic-id,264,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today, on World Refugee Day, to share some facts on the United States Refugee Resettlement  America's Refugee Resettlement Program is a small but powerful humanitarian expression of American values and founding principles. And just as important, it makes us safer.  Refugees go through vetting that is already extreme. If there is any doubt about a refugee's identity, he or she is not admitted. The process is so rigorous, there hasn't been a single fatal terrorist attack carried out by a refugee in the United States since the Refugee Act became law in 1980.  Americans across our great country support resettlement. America's faith communities are leading the call for America to stand by her principles and shelter the fleeing victims of our enemies, including the Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Albany in my own 20th District of New That is because it speaks directly to American values of strength, inclusiveness, and compassion.  New Yorkers have played a vital role in the resettlement program, and refugees are positively contributing to communities across New York State and beyond. The United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' Albany field office has helped resettle refugees from Afghanistan, from Burma, Iraq, Ukraine, and the Congo, just to name a few. Some of these refugees are single mothers seeking a better life for themselves and their children; others are families fleeing war and persecution.  We have the strength, the means, and the capacity to welcome these refugees with open arms. Let us stand with these huddled masses and remain a beacon of freedom around the world.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgH4986-3.txt,1942,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,20.0,July
120,topic-id,197,"Mr.Speaker, right now we are facing one of the greatest humanitarian crises of our time. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has reported that over 65 million people are currently displaced due to war, famine, persecution, or human rights violations. That is why, on World Refugee Day, we must resist the urge to close our doors when the world's most vulnerable need our support.  As a cornerstone of American global humanitarian leadership for nearly four decades, the United States' refugee program has resettled more than 3 million refugees. I was honored to welcome one of these refugees as my guest for President Trump's joint session to Congress earlier this year.  Bothina Matar and her family were forced out of their home in Syria, and after spending months in a Jordanian camp, were resettled in Dallas, Following a rigorous vetting process, the al Sharaa family successfully resettled, and they are rebuilding their lives while contributing greatly to our country and economy, just like refugees before them.  Our country is a welcoming place where we can both protect the American people and extend our hand to people who need it. Let us not forget that fact, Mr.                         ____________________",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgH4986-2.txt,2166,RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,20.0,July

Congress needs to, finally, after 16 years, carry out its constitutional duty and stop hiding from this very important debate that the gentleman has raised in his amendment.

278,topic-id,481,"Mr.Chairman, I certainly would acknowledge that Iran is up to very nefarious purposes as far as sponsoring terrorism internationally.  I also acknowledge the gentleman referenced the previous administration more than once during his remarks as far as the issue before the House today.  In 2016, last year, heavy water was purchased by the Department of Energy and the State Department, but I would point out this is 2017 with a different administration, and essentially the amendment is a solution to a problem that does not exist.  The current administration has recertified Iran's compliance with the agreement twice. Iran does not have a nuclear weapon and is subject to intense scrutiny by the International Atomic Energy  But importantly to the point raised today, I would suggest that the Department of Energy consistently has indicated at the time of the 2016 heavy water purchase from Iran that the United States would not be a regular buyer of Iranian heavy water.  Since that purchase, the United States has not purchased any additional heavy water from that country. In fact, the U.has, through refraining from purchases of excess supply, forced Iran to ship excess heavy water abroad so that it can continue to adhere to the agreement entered into.  It seems highly unlikely that the current administration would now seek out an opportunity to purchase this heavy water.  Again, I believe the gentleman has a solution to a problem that does not exist, and I am opposed to his amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I would just say, if you want money to go to purchase heavy water from Iran, then obviously you should oppose the amendment. But if you don't think that is a good idea, then it doesn't hurt us to have this in here, given what has happened in the past.  I wish I had 100 percent confidence that we would not be repeating mistakes. I hope that is where we go, but I have not yet seen the real robust action to turn the tide away from a deal that has put Iran on the path to a nuclear bomb. The danger with the deal was always less that Iran would cheat on the deal. I think they probably are, but the danger is they get a bomb by keeping the deal.  This is a major problem. This is one small area of this to protect the taxpayer.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.

332,topic-id,629,"I thank the gentleman, who chairs our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee and is so passionate in not only finding a solution to the opioid epidemic, but also his great work on mental health reform as well, as was passed into law in the 21st Century Cures legislation.  As you know, the year before, the Energy and Commerce Committee also passed legislation to begin to address this issue. We will be doing a lot of work, going forward, to look at what is working on the ground and what is not.  Addiction, as you well know from your clinical experience, is an equal opportunity destroyer. It is a crisis that doesn't pick parties. It doesn't pick people because of their race, age, or socioeconomic status. We all know someone impacted by the opioid epidemic. It has literally touched every corner of our country and every community in our  The epidemic has hit close to home in my home State of Oregon, where more people now die from drug overdoses than from deaths in automobile accidents. I have met with community leaders, first responders, doctors, police officers, patients, and those on the front lines of this fight against opioid addiction.  At roundtables throughout the Second District of Oregon, I have heard firsthand accounts of the impact of the opioid epidemic. It didn't matter if I was in a rural eastern Oregon community or a more populated city in southern The tragic stories were all too similar and all too familiar.  Medical professionals across Oregon told me about the rapid acceleration of the opioid epidemic over the last 20 years. They have witnessed patient after patient fall into the traps of addiction.  I heard from Oregonians who have struggled with the epidemic themselves. At our roundtable, a woman in Hermiston talked about how she became addicted to painkillers. After a minor foot injury, she got a prescription for an opioid-based painkiller. In her decades-long battle with this addiction--trying to get off of this addiction--she was forced to travel more than 5 hours into Washington State just to find a provider who could help her with Suboxone and get off of her addiction. There was nobody locally who could help her.  I heard from a father whose son was a high school athlete. He was prescribed opioids after a sports injury. Tragically, he became addicted. Soon, he transitioned to what we know as a cheaper and more deadly version of the drug known as heroin.  Sadly, this young man would not survive his addiction. He died from heroin. It devastated the family and stole another American in the prime of his life. This story is repeated all too often.  Combating the opioid epidemic in Oregon and every State of the union is going to require a real bipartisan team effort to continue, from elected officials with the input from healthcare experts and those on the front line of this fight in our local communities.  In the Energy and Commerce Committee, we stand shoulder-to-shoulder, all of us together, saying: What can we do more to help in this crisis; to seize the opportunity before us; to look at the legislation that was enacted in the last Congress to make sure that the grants are getting to the ground, as they are in my State; and that we are getting the help and that it is actually working?  It is one thing to pass a bill. It is another to make sure it is implemented correctly and that it actually works effectively.  I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania, Chairman Murphy, for the work that he is doing on this and the compassion he has for those families who are tragically caught up in this addiction. Together, we are going to find our way through it.  ",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgH5221.txt,1596,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,27.0,June

It has received bipartisan support as it moved through the committee. It simplifies the process for a spouse of a servicemember to choose and change their State of residency for tax and voting purposes.  The bill is about removing additional headaches from servicemembers' lives and doing right by them. There are enough issues being a member of the military and for spouses and family.

102,topic-id,144,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I support H.1058, as amended. The VA Provider Equity Act is a commonsense solution to a really important problem that is plaguing the VHA--a shortage of healthcare providers.  This legislation would allow VHA to attract the talented and experienced podiatrists it needs to better treat conditions caused by lower extremity injuries.  By allowing podiatrists the opportunity to advance within the VHA while earning pay comparable to what private sector podiatrists earn, VHA can better attract and retain these providers.  I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio, Wenstrup's, work highlighting this, educating all of us on the committee, and making sure that the treatments of podiatrists between VHA and the private sector industry is aligned.

Number two, his sartorial taste had to do with tropical forests, which is not what we have in  I am very happy that General Mattis himself was outraged by this, and I applaud him.

103,topic-id,357,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1058, the VA Provider Equity Act, as amended, which would strengthen access to the comprehensive first-class healthcare that veterans deserve.  Podiatric care is one of the top needs at VA medical centers across the country. Veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan report high rate of musculoskeletal ailments resulting from lower extremity injuries inflicted by improvised explosive devices.  Veterans of previous wars also experience higher instances of foot and ankle ailments caused by aging, diabetes, and service-connected disabilities. All of this leads to increased demand for podiatric care at the  However, VA struggles to recruit and retain podiatrists due to a disparity in pay and leadership opportunities in comparison to both podiatrists in the private sector and to other physicians employed by the  This is because VA first established standards for podiatrists in 1976, and podiatric education, training, and practice have changed considerably since that time. Nonetheless, VA's outdated standards have remained unchanged. This has translated into increased wait times. As of 2015, 93 percent of new podiatry patients wait more than 15 days for an appointment, and podiatry is the fourth most referred-out surgical service to community care.  My bill, H.1058, the VA Provider Equity Act, would make VA's doctors of podiatric medicine equal to doctors of osteopathy and medical doctors within VA in terms of pay and ensure that VA podiatrists are eligible for the same promotions and leadership opportunities as other VA physicians, which is consistent with the private sector.  This bill will make it easier for VA to recruit and retain the specialists our veterans so desperately need. In turn, this will result in better care for veterans and savings to the taxpayer, as a recent study from the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research found that podiatry services provided to diabetic patients could have saved between $29 million and $97 million in 2014, in the State of California alone.[[Page H6172]]  Mr.Speaker, as the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and the rest of our colleagues in Congress continue to work together to help our veterans receive the care they need, I urge the passage of this bill.

146,topic-id,198,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to highlight Congress' making more important strides on behalf of our Nation's veterans.  The last few years, we have all heard stories about employees at the VA who failed in their duty to serve and protect our Nation's heroes. It is true that most VA employees are hardworking and dedicated, but as we have come to find out, there are bad actors who must be held accountable. Our veterans deserve nothing less.  Strangely, as the VA has tried to discipline these bad actors, the existing bureaucracy and red tape has stymied the Secretary's ability to do so. That is why the House today will pass the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, to create a more efficient and effective system to remove, demote, or suspend any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct.  Our bill still ensures due process and actually expands protections for whistleblowers, but, importantly, it will let the VA Secretary do his job and clean up the Department and protect our Nation's veterans.  Mr.Speaker, protecting those veterans isn't a political issue; it is a cause we must all champion. I encourage a bipartisan vote on today's bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgH4867-3.txt,2021,VA ACCOUNTABILITY,2017.0,13.0,June
