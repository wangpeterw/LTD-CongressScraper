7672,topic-id,1070,"Mr.President, today the Senate will vote on the confirmation of Marvin Kaplan to be a member of the National Labor Relations Board, I am glad that we are moving this nomination because the National Labor Relations Board needs to function as intended.  The board hasn't been full in nearly 2 years. I am certainly not the only one of us who thinks a full Board is important. One Democratic senator said at a hearing on May 16, 2013: ``I strongly support a fully functioning NLRB with five members. I think confirming the entire slate will ensure that the NLRB is working for American workers and American employers.''  Another said at the same hearing: ``What we don't need now--the last thing we need here in Washington or across the country--is more rancor, more division, more ideology, at a time we need this Board fully functioning. We need five people to get confirmed here. Any Senator who is standing in the way of getting five people confirmed and having a functioning Board has a lot of explaining to do . . .''  Then-Chairman Harkin said in September 2014: ``Keeping the NLRB fully staffed and able to do its work will send a strong message to the American people that yes, Washington can work, and our government can function.''  The National Labor Relations Board has five members with 5-year, staggered terms, and a general counsel with a 4-year term. There is no statutory requirement regarding party affiliation, but the tradition has been for the President to appoint members on a 3-2 ratio favoring the administration, with nominations for the two minority seats recommended by the Senate minority leader.  While we may often disagree with the opinions of the nominees for the other party's seats--many of us have ensured they had an up or down vote. For example, since 2013, I have voted for cloture for two board members and the current general counsel who I then voted against confirming.  Marvin Kaplan has been nominated for a position that has sat vacant for 23 months since President Obama declined to nominate a Republican for the then-minority seat. My hope is that this nominee will help restore some balance to the labor board.  After years of playing the role of advocate, the Board should be restored to the role of neutral umpire. Board partisanship didn't start under President Obama, but it became worse under him. When the Board is too partisan, it creates instability in our Nation's workplaces and does not serve the intent of the law--which is stable labor relations and free flow of commerce.  For example, under President Obama, the Board took three harmful actions, including the joint employer decision--which threatened to destroy the American dream for owners of the Nation's 780,000 franchise locations; the ambush elections rule, which can force a union election before an employer and many employees have a chance to figure out what is going on; and the micro-union decision, which gave factions of employees within single stores a path to forming their own unions.  Nominee Marvin Kaplan is currently chief counsel for the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, where he has served since August 2015. From 2009 to 2015, Kaplan worked as counsel for the House Education and Workforce Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform  Today some Senators have argued about Mr.Kaplan's experience practicing law. I want to note that Mr.Kaplan is in fact well-qualified under the National Labor Relations Act statute. He is an experienced lawyer. He earned his law degree at Washington University in Louis and is a member of the New York and New Jersey State bars. The years he has spent considering cases and writing opinions at the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, OSHRC, are an excellent preparation for the work of the National Labor Relations Board, I will also point out that there have been a number of NLRB members confirmed with limited experience representing clients in labor law matters.  Mr.Kaplan has an admirable record of public service spanning a decade. He could have taken a number of different career paths, but he chose public service, and that should be praised. There is bipartisan respect for Mr. At a July 2015 business meeting of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, Ranking Member Bobby Scott said this of Mr.Kaplan: ``A lot is said about the working relationships around here and how bad[[Page S4711]]they are from time to time. Staff can contribute to that. I just would like to say that Mr.Kaplan has not been part of that; he's been very cooperative even when you disagree. We have been able to work with my staff, have had good working relationships; a cooperative relationships. I want to add my two cents worth to your congratulations and God speed.''  Mr.Kaplan was nominated to be a member of the NLRB on June 20, 2017. We held his hearing on July 13, and he completed all paperwork in accordance with the HELP Committee's rules, practices, and procedures. Our rules require that their HELP paperwork be submitted 5 days before their hearing. We received Mr.Kaplan's HELP paperwork and his Office of Government Ethics, OGE, paperwork on June 26, 17 days before his hearing. Mr.Kaplan also offered to meet with all HELP members. Mr.Kaplan met with 10 of them, including 5 Following the hearing, Mr.Kaplan responded to 53 questions for the record, QFRs, or 81 if you include subquestions, and those responses were provided to Senators prior to the markup. The HELP Committee favorably reported out his nomination on July 19.  Recent comparisons show that this process was far from rushed. In comparison, under Chairman Harkin, the HELP Committee held hearings and markups on NLRB nominees with far less time for consideration. For former Board member Kent Hirozawa's seat, which Mr.William Emanuel has been nominated to fill, Mr.Hirozawa's hearing was held 7 days after his nomination, and his markup was held the next day. Former Board member Nancy Schiffer's hearing was held 7 days after her nomination. The HELP Committee also held a markup on her nomination the next day. Committee members were not able to get responses to any QFRs from Kent Hirowzawa or Nancy Schiffer before being forced to vote on them.  I look forward to voting for this nominee. I hope the Senate will take up the nomination of William Emanuel, also for the NLRB, very soon, so we have a full board.  ",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4700-3.txt,1695,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,2.0,April

7646,topic-id,2602,"Mr.President, in less than an hour, we will consider the nomination of Rod Rosenstein to be Deputy Attorney General of the United  We consider his nomination under highly unusual, if not unique, circumstances. Only today, there were revelations from the House Oversight Committee at a bipartisan conference indicating that General Flynn, formerly the National Security Advisor, may have broken criminal laws by his concealing payments from Russia--specifically, from Russia Today--in connection with his speaking fees and travel expenses in 2015. He concealed these payments in security clearance forms submitted in 2016, SF86 forms. False statements on such forms are a violation of our criminal laws. His potential criminal liability is a serious and important allegation that needs to be investigated further.  What we know for sure is that the investigation of this allegation and others--this very colorful violation of Federal criminal law--can be done reliably, impartially, and credibly only by a special prosecutor. That is why I have asked Mr.Rosenstein to commit that he will appoint a special prosecutor to investigate this allegation as well as others involving the President's staff, campaign associates, and staff in connection with Russia's interference with our election.  There is no question that the Russians sought to interfere and that they did so. That is the conclusion of the investigation that was already done by our intelligence community, and it is a conclusion that is virtually universally accepted. The only question now is this: What was the involvement and potential collusion and aiding and abetting of Americans in that Russian cyber attack on this country? In my view, it was an act of war. We can debate that question.  What is undebatable is the need for a thorough, impartial, vigorous, and aggressive investigation that will give that information to the American people. It must be an investigation that can pursue criminal wrongdoing, if it is proved, and that can prosecute it and ultimately make that investigation transparent to the American people so they know what actually happened.  I have asked Rod Rosenstein to follow the precedent that was established by Elliot Richardson under circumstances that were not unlike the ones we encountered here.  The saying is that history almost never repeats, but it rhymes. What we have here is a situation that rhymes with the one that Elliot Richardson encountered when he was Attorney General-designee. He was requested to appoint a special prosecutor as a condition of his confirmation. He agreed to do so in 1973. He appointed Archibald That, in turn, led to the Watergate investigation and, ultimately, it vindicated the judgment on the part of our Senate Judiciary Committee that an independent special prosecutor was necessary under those circumstances.  My colleague who is presiding, as a former State attorney general, knows well the importance of independence and credibility in any judicial role of this kind. This Nation now faces a looming constitutional crisis--again, not unlike Watergate, which ultimately resulted in United States v. Nixon before the U.Supreme Court, a subpoena that had to be enforced by that special prosecutor against the President of the United  Only Rod Rosenstein can vindicate that important public interest. Only the Deputy Attorney General of the United States can appoint a special prosecutor because the Attorney General rightly has recused himself. Jeff Sessions has recused himself because of his own conversations with Russian officials, which he failed to disclose during testimony to the Judiciary  Only the Deputy Attorney General can perform that vital function, and only a special prosecutor can do what is necessary to vindicate the public interest through a vigorous investigation into any criminal wrongdoing and to prosecute lawbreakers.  I have confidence that our Intelligence Committee in the Senate will impartially and objectively do whatever it can to uncover the truth. But even if it succeeds--and there are obstacles and challenges to its success--it cannot pursue a criminal investigation,[[Page S2517]]and it cannot bring criminal charges and pursue a conviction. It probably cannot make fully transparent or disclose all of the facts that it uncovers. Its custom is to issue a report and, when it does so, redacting information that can be considered classified or sensitive. It may well lead, in an abundance of caution, toward redacting rather than disclosing.  That is why I have asked Rod Rosenstein, as a condition of his becoming Deputy Attorney General, to commit that he will appoint a special independent prosecutor. Call that office whatever you wish--special counsel, independent counsel, special prosecutor. The role is what is significant. It is someone who will uncover the wrongdoing and follow the evidence and the facts wherever they lead.  Neither Mr.Rosenstein nor Mr.Sessions can do so. Neither Rosenstein nor Sessions will ever convince the public that they are really pursuing their boss, the President of the United States, if there is evidence that leads to his culpability. They report to him. Rod Rosenstein reports to Jeff Sessions, and he, in turn, reports to the President of the United That is why the appearance and the reality of independence is so critically important, and that is why only a special prosecutor can pursue that interest.  If we were in normal times, Rod Rosenstein would be an eminently acceptable nominee, and I would welcome his nomination without attaching any kind of request or condition. He is certainly an honorable public servant. He is a career prosecutor. I admire his dedication and commitment to public service. As U.attorney for Maryland, he certainly has an admirable record. He is, in some senses, what we value in the Department of Justice--someone who is committed to the rule of law. That is why I have been surprised and disappointed that he has failed to heed my request.  Whatever happens today, I want to ensure my colleagues and, most especially, him and the loyal and dedicated members of the Department of Justice that I will support his work in his capacity as Deputy Attorney General, if he is confirmed today, because the professionalism of the Department of Justice is of preeminent interest for me personally, having served as a U.attorney and also as attorney general of my State, but it is also vitally important to the American people.  We must consider his nomination in the light of the looming constitutional crisis that our Nation confronts. It is a crisis partly of the administration's making by its attacks on the judiciary, calling a member of the bench a ``so-called judge,'' saying to the American people that a circuit court of appeals will be responsible for any violence that may occur as a result of its ruling on the constitutionality of Executive orders related to immigration, demeaning and disparaging a judge because of his ethnic heritage--a judge born, in fact, in  These kinds of attacks on the judiciary undermine respect and trust in a branch of government that is the bulwark of our democracy and that, in my view, when the history of this era is written, will be regarded as having been one of its finest hours. We will be relying on it to protect our Nation's fundamental rights and liberties. The independence of the judiciary is a sacred pillar of our democracy, and it must be free of political interference.  The other hero of this era, in my view, will be the press, which has uncovered many of the facts leading to my conclusion, joined by so many of my colleagues, that there must be a special prosecutor. That conclusion is not mine alone. It has been joined by many of my colleagues, 10 of them having cosigned a letter I wrote in mid-February asking for a special prosecutor.  The independence of our judiciary and of our prosecutors is so critically important for the trust and credibility of the American people that the rule of law will prevail and that no official will put himself above the rule of law. That is the threat and the constitutional crisis that we potentially face.  Two high-ranking administration officials have been caught misrepresenting their ties with One of them is, in fact, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who did so before the Judiciary Committee, under oath.  Mr.Rosenstein has said that he wants to be approved by the Senate before he decides whether to appoint a special prosecutor, but that delay will mean that a man who was hired and can be fired by President Trump will decide whether the Trump administration will face a thorough and complete investigation. This body has a duty to insist on it before his confirmation. We must seize this opportunity to assure accountability to the American people and make sure also about their confidence in our electoral system. While Mr.Rosenstein has claimed he needs to be in office to familiarize himself with the facts of an investigation into the Trump administration before he can commit to appointing a special prosecutor, the row of facts are all a matter of public record now.  We know Russia interfered in the 2016 election. We know the FBI is investigating Trump administration lawbreaking associated with that interference. That investigation has been confirmed by the Director of the FBI himself. We know Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with officials of Russia's Government, and yet he said under oath that he did not meet with those That is more than ample information to justify appointing a special prosecutor, but there is much more, including actions by Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Roger These kinds of abundant facts are known now and warrant this action and also more than justify this body insisting that he commit to appointing that special prosecutor.  That public information concerning known associates of the President and their Russian contacts includes General Flynn's actions disclosed today. On December 10, 2015, General Flynn was paid to attend an event in Moscow celebrating the 10th anniversary of Russia Today, a propaganda arm of the Russian He concealed the amount Russia Today paid him for speaking fees and travel expenses in those security clearance forms he submitted in 2016, the He dined with Vladimir Putin just 18 months after leaving his position leading the Defense Intelligence As a retired general, he is prohibited from receipt of consulting fees, gifts, travel expenses, honorary or any other kind of salary from a foreign government without congressional consent. That action also is a potentially prosecutable action.  After the election, General Flynn spoke repeatedly to Russian Ambassador Kislyak regarding lifting sanctions on Putin, an amazing act of disloyalty. Misleading Vice President Pence and the American public on the nature of these secret discussions, he demonstrated a lack of candor and credibility inconsistent with the role of National Security Advisor, and therefore he was compelled to resign.  The President also selected Carter Page to serve during the campaign on his foreign policy advisory committee. He is the same individual we have learned who was under investigation for his contacts with Russian agents.  The President's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, worked for years on a disinformation campaign to benefit the Putin government and was paid millions of dollars to do so. The President's son-in-law Jared Kushner held an undisclosed meeting with both the Russian Ambassador and also executives from a Russian bank, EDB, a bank built by Putin's cronies. The President himself has sold real estate to Russian investors seeking to profit from their corrupt activities in Russia or, as his son, Donald Trump, put it, ``We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.''  The administration's supposed attempts to investigate itself have produced mixed signals and clear conflicts of interest such as House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes's ill-fated trip to the White House to discuss his committee findings.  The robust congressional oversight hearings that we all hope will happen are certainly essential, but only the Department of Justice can analyze these facts and information which are only the tip of the iceberg--analyze it, digest it, determine its relevance to a criminal investigation and to a prosecution, pursuit of a violation of law and charges. The FBI can investigate, but it cannot bring charges. Only a lawyer from the Department of Justice can do so, and only a special prosecutor can make that judgment independently and impartially without having to[[Page S2518]]worry about what his boss thinks or what his boss's boss thinks.  So I have reached the conclusion reluctantly--because Rod Rosenstein has a very admirable record of public service--that I must vote against his nomination in just a short time because of his failure to commit to a special prosecutor. I have no illusions about convincing my colleagues about joining me to vote on cloture with a degree of realism about the views of this body on his nomination, but I hope he will heed the example of Mr.Richardson in 1973 and also of Jim Comey, who at one point also resorted to a special prosecutor to investigate a controversial matter that arose during President George Bush's administration.  There is clear, unmistakable, bipartisan precedent for a special prosecutor under these circumstances. There is not only precedent, there is historical imperative. At the root of this constitutional crisis is a concern for the rule of law, for preserving the public's faith and trust and respect for our justice system. It is at the foundation of what we do when we vote. When we make laws, we presume they will be rigorously and fairly enforced without fear or favor, and that no official, not even the President of the United States, will be placed above the law. That is the lesson of Watergate, but it is also the lesson established throughout our history, going back to the Founders and the preeminent role played by our U.Supreme  I will support Mr.Rosenstein in his efforts to pursue the truth and pursue justice, as I believe he must do, and I hope he will do because the credibility the of the Department of Justice and our justice system is so much at stake.  I urge my colleagues to vote against his nomination, as I will do, but I also pledge my support for him and the loyal, dedicated, hardworking members of the Department of Justice if he is confirmed.

7677,topic-id,1233,"Mr.President, sometimes bipartisanship and comity do work. They have in the last 24 and 48 hours on two measures that are critically important to help our Nation's veterans have access to benefits and healthcare that they vitally need, that they deserve, and that they have earned. Those measures relate to appeals reform and to the Choice  Last night the Senate passed by unanimous consent--which means without any objection--H.2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017.  I am proud to have worked on this measure with the chairman of the VA Committee, Senator Isakson, when I was the ranking member of that committee during the last session. I thank him for his leadership, his vision, and his commitment to this very important cause.  This bipartisan measure now goes to the It provides a significant step toward securing benefits veterans have earned. Once these reforms are fully funded--and they should be--our Nation's veterans will no longer be bogged down by a cumbersome, time-consuming, irksome, and, in fact, aggravating process that denies them fair and full consideration when they appeal their claim's denial. This reform will begin--it is only a beginning--a better system involving transparency and communication for veterans and their families.  As ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I heard testimony that the Department of Veterans Affairs' appeals process desperately needs updating and reform. We all in this body have heard from our constituents again and again and again about the antiquated delay and burdensome process that exists today. The average wait time on an appeal today is 5 years. Let me repeat that. The average wait time on an appeal is 5 years. Nearly half a million veterans are caught in a quagmire--often a quicksand--of repeated consideration, unable to claim benefits because of the VA's existing backlog.  Between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2017, the number of pending appeals increased from about 380,000 to 470,000. That is an increase of more than 20 percent. The increase in those appeals was the ``bad news'' side of improvements in the process to consider the initial appeal. There were more appeals because more claims were disposed of, but that is no excuse for that kind of delay in appeals.  We worked with the VA and veterans groups to devise a new appeals system that allows veterans to choose an option that is right for them. The bill that passed yesterday will create three separate paths. They can choose among them for veterans seeking redress from a decision by the Veterans Benefits This reform is vitally important because it gives Secretary Shulkin the authority to test the new system before its full implementation.  I know it will take time to implement these changes. It should take less time than is predicted because the Veterans Administration owes it to our heroes--the men and women who have served and sacrificed for our My constituent caseworkers in Hartford have tried to assist many individual veterans with their claims, and these efforts must continue around the country in all of our offices even as these new reforms are implemented.  The second area where we joined together in a bipartisan way relates to the Choice We have agreed to continue funding by providing $2.1 billion and authorizing 28 new leases for medical facilities across the country to improve access to the high-quality care provided at VA hospitals. Make no mistake, this action is a down payment, not the final word. I am going to continue to champion further reforms to[[Page S4714]]make sure we improve VA healthcare and enhance access to VA medical facilities.  I am particularly concerned by recent findings made by the VA inspector general, Michael Missal, about a troubling lack of health information sharing between VA and non-VA providers relating to chronic pain treatment. To put it very simply and bluntly, the lack of information sharing makes opioid addiction far more likely than it should be, especially among veterans who seek care from private providers through the Choice system.  Connecticut was one of the first States in the country to have a statewide prescription drug monitoring program. I urged Secretary Shulkin at a hearing last year to make sure the VA prescription drug monitoring program exchanges information with the State system, which has data from private providers. The sharing of information is vital to prevent doctor shopping and excessive prescriptions. Without it, veterans potentially are susceptible to weaknesses and gaps that enable them to seek excessive prescriptions of opioid pain killer treatment that can lead to addiction and worse.  We cannot allow the Veterans Choice Program to exacerbate opioid addiction. We must do everything we can to stop the opioid epidemic that is ravaging our communities. As Senator Manchin of West Virginia and other colleagues have made clear, the VA must close the information gap on opioid prescriptions through improved opioid safety initiative guidelines and enhanced prescription drug monitoring programs. While we work in Congress to reform the Choice Program, I call on the VA to immediately take certain commonsense steps, none of them novel or original. They have been identified by the inspector general:  First, require all participating VA Purchased Care providers to receive and review evidence-based guidelines for prescribing opioids.  Second, implement a process to ensure all Purchased Care consults for non-VA care include a complete, up-to-date list of medications and medical history.  Third, require non-VA providers to submit opioid prescriptions directly to a VA pharmacy for dispensing and recording in the patient's VA electronic health record.  Fourth, ensure that if facility leaders determine that a non-VA provider's opioid prescribing practices conflict with the guidelines, immediate action is taken to ensure the safety of all veterans receiving care from that non-VA provider.  These are basic protections for our veterans. They are protections against overprescribing opioids or negligent misconduct--and worse--on the part of non-VA providers and others.  My hope is that we are beginning on a path to better information sharing between those prescription drug monitoring programs at the State level for non-VA providers and the VA facilities and providers who care for our veterans directly. That information sharing is not a luxury or convenience; it is a necessity.  We must help veterans of every era with their need for prompt appeals dispositions and effective healthcare that also protects them from opioid addiction. I am hopeful the Senate will quickly pass the Harry Walker Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, which has been unanimously approved by the House, to make comprehensive improvements to the GI bill. I helped to draft this measure and lead it, and I am proud the House has approved it.  We must also help veterans of all eras suffering from toxic exposure and make sure we award a Congressional Gold Medal to the American Legion and make USERRA protections for our servicemembers meaningful and enforceable. These steps are part of an unfinished agenda that we owe our veterans. We cannot shirk that duty. We cannot postpone it. It is an obligation, not a convenience.  I look forward to moving forward with these efforts, as we have done with Choice and with the appeals reform, and to learning what we know already--that we can work together across the aisle when it comes to keeping faith with our veterans and making sure that no veteran of any era is left behind.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                          Tribute to Bill Reed  ",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4700-3.txt,2076,PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS,2017.0,2.0,April
7669,topic-id,2223,"Mr.President, August is Rural Broadband Month at the Federal Communications The Commerce Committee just today put forward nominees for the Commission, and the Commission does matter. But I want to talk today specifically about highlighting the importance of broadband in rural America and rural  In January of this year, I joined a number of my Senate colleagues on a bipartisan letter to President Trump regarding the importance of broadband and expanding its access to all of the country and, particularly, the parts of our country that are not currently served.  As part of any infrastructure legislation that the Congress is talking about, I think we and the administration need to consider policies that advance infrastructure not just solely in terms of roads, bridges, and ports, which are important, particularly where the Presiding Officer and I live, in Arkansas and That transportation network means so much to us, but also important is how people are able to communicate and compete. High speed internet access cannot be overlooked as we consider what our infrastructure should look like going forward.  Broadband can be delivered by wireless or wireline technology. It can be brought to customers by traditional communications companies in rural areas. Often, now, rural electric co-ops show great interest and capacity to do this, as do others. Following the significant steps that Congress took to deregulate the market as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the broadband industry has really responded. They invested a lot of money. In fact, they invested $1.5 trillion of private money to deploy better and faster networks. If you have access to one of those networks, you know what a difference it makes.  In 2015 alone--that is the last number I have access to--the investment by traditional wireline companies, wireless companies, and cable providers was $76 billion. All of that is really good, except that there is a real divide between the rural areas of my State and the rural areas of the country and the other more populated areas.  Some people say: Oh, that is just a myth; there is no digital divide. I would have them look at any number of articles. One article in the Wall Street Journal in June made the point that 39 percent of the United States' rural population lacks access to broadband. That sounds like a pretty big divide to me--that 39 percent of the entire rural population of the country doesn't have broadband, and 61 percent of rural Missourians lack access to broadband. These numbers are not acceptable.  Most private investment has been directed, as you would assume it would be, toward high populations, highly populated and easily accessed areas, and future customers. This is like the same problem the country had 100 years ago transitioning to telephones. It was hard to get a telephone to a house that was 5 miles away from the nearest house, as opposed to a house that was in the same apartment building to the nearest apartment. It is a lot harder to do that. The government at that time said that there would be a universal service fee on phone bills, and then use that money to ensure that everybody would have equal access to what was obviously seen as a really important way to communicate. The concept of Universal Service was enshrined in the 1996 act. It said that rural households should have the same access to advanced telecommunications enjoyed by their urban counterparts. It is a good goal for a lot of reasons.  I saw some figures this week. When looking at the overdose deaths and the opioid problems in the country, they are much greater in rural counties than they are in urban centers. In our State, Kansas City, our biggest city by population and any of the five counties that touched it weren't anywhere close to the top list of other areas in our State that had this problem. It matters when you are not connected. It matters when opportunities that you otherwise would have simply aren't there because somehow a service that is essential to our society today isn't available to you in the same way it is available to others. I am not saying it should be free to some and cost other people something, but it should be available to you in the same way that it is available to others in our society, as the 1996 Telecommunications Act stated.  Broadband is necessary to attract and retain business for banks, factories, distribution centers, and small businesses. It is necessary to start and maintain a business, large or small. If business is going to compete outside the local marketplace, there has to be that connectivity. Frankly, in order to compete in the local marketplace and to have the ability to buy at the best price and to get the kind of products needed, the internet really matters.  Broadband is always there. We have to have it if we are going to compete in the world economy. Many people in rural America are able to do that in ways that nobody would have dreamed about 10 years ago, but not everybody has that same access.  Certainly, it is critical for schools and libraries. Just today, a parent was telling me that students can't do their homework anymore unless they can get internet access somewhere close to where they live. Students depend on the internet for education and opportunity where we live today.  A revolution has taken place in agriculture. The great food-producing economy that we have produces more food all the time. It actually produces more food with fewer people. So that creates some displaced people who otherwise would have had those jobs, but[[Page S4709]]it also uses wireless infrastructure, data, and GPS structures to decide what should happen in a field at a given time in that part of the field. There are data centers, autonomous systems, and fiber optics that are a part of agriculture today. If you are linked to broadband and you are in your combine and have a problem, sometimes that problem can be solved in a couple of minutes by quickly accessing your system, seeing where the problem is, resetting what you need to set and moving on, as opposed to the other option, which is calling the repair person, having the technologist come out with their computer, hook it up to your combine, and 5 or 6 hours later, at a time when you are in the critical moments of your annual livelihood, suddenly you are working again, when you could have been working 5 or 6 minutes later if you had been connected like many farmers are today.  Broadband is more than just economic opportunity. Rural hospitals and health clinics are able to use telemedicine to bring services at a level that otherwise would not be available. This is particularly important in mental and behavioral healthcare. A lot of people are every bit as comfortable or more comfortable with telehealth than they are with somebody in the room with them. Also, with intensive care, suddenly all of the resources that may be available 100 miles away can be right there at the point where questions are asked and that information is handled. Suddenly, somebody's life is saved because of the capacity to have that kind of communication.  For years I have tried to lead when I could, and joined my colleagues when they were leading, with numerous letters to the FCC urging it to reform the Universal Service Program for the digital era. Most people who don't have a line to their phone have a way to get a phone in their hand now, but they don't have a way to get this important way to communicate and to compete. It is frustrating, when we see the limited resources we have--the government resources--to put into something like this to see limited funds go to places where you are just creating another provider and more competition, except that the second provider has government money on its side to compete with the first provider that went in with its own money. There is a big difference between unserved and any level of underserved. If you are unserved, like 69 percent of rural Missourians, the idea that somebody else doesn't have enough competition in the place they live doesn't seem to make very much sense to you. If there is a competitive marketplace and somebody wants to go in there and compete and get the prices down, that is all fine, but I think the government focus should be just like it was with telephones 100 years ago--to see that people had the opportunity to have that phone the same as their neighbors in more densely populated areas.  The President recently designated Ajit Pai to be the Chairman of the We are finally seeing the Commission take actions to address rural broadband. In February, I wrote to the Chairman and urged him to act on the $2 billion available for rural broadband and open this money up to auction so new entrants into the field, like electric co-ops, can competitively bid alongside everybody else. The FCC has decided to do that.  Tomorrow the Commission will consider a notice to initiate the pre-auction process for this money to deploy fiber optics in parts of This will complement other initiatives underway, as the FCC looks at how to address rural broadband. They have launched a $4.5 billion auction for mobile wireless service in rural areas. They are suspending out-of-date rules that forced small carriers to raise telephone rates. They are launching a proceeding to reduce costs for companies upgrading from copper to fiber optic networks--another FCC initiative. They are launching a broadband advisory committee. These are all steps in the right direction, where you and I live. They will make a difference.  I look forward to continuing to work with the Chairman and others on the Commission on this issue. I think rural broadband is particularly leveling in creating the opportunities that we would like to see. The Commission will now be back up to its five-member intention of how many people are supposed to be there, making those decisions.  There is still work to be done. We need to reduce the digital divide. Connectivity is critical. We also need policies that support efficient network structures that allow people to not just connect to a network but to connect with a network that really works.  Let me talk about one other Missouri issue that relates here.  I said earlier that Kansas City is now our biggest city, our most populous city. Still, Louis, I think, by region, is the bigger region, but the city of Louis is not as big as Kansas In Kansas City, they have an internet exchange called It is a peering center that offers tremendous benefits to secondary educational institutions, to high schools, to vocational programs, and to others so they really maximize how they communicate with each other and have the availability of resources in one place much more equally available in others, and large amounts of bandwidth can be diverted by using this peering infrastructure.  Frankly, what is happening in Kansas City this fall is that the North Kansas City School District will establish connections to It is estimated that it may save the district almost $500,000 a year in bandwidth just by looking at peering. If peering helps there, maybe peering is one of the other things we can look at that will help solve the rural broadband challenge as well.  We are going to be working on this. There will be legislation. There will be continuing efforts to urge the FCC to stay on point. We need to do what we can to make communities in rural America productive and competitive and as healthy as they can be.  By the way, there are a lot of stories here to be told. I hope the next time I come to the floor on this topic that I will come to the floor with some things that are happening in my State that would not have happened if there had not been the access to broadband in not very big communities that are suddenly doing business all over the United States and all over the world.  How we do that is by not letting any of our country wither away, where we have existing infrastructure and schools and sidewalks and water systems and by being sure the people who want to live there can live there, just like we are being sure now, as we see a revitalization of some of our downtowns and inner cities. People will want to move back to them and will have reasons and desires to want to do that. We are seeing an upswing there.  I think we can see the same kind of thing happen in other parts of the country if we work to be sure we have an equity of opportunity. One of the major things that will provide that will be having access to broadband that works. I hope we can continue to fight that fight and see the progress we have made just in the last 6 months.

7662,topic-id,2314,"Madam President, during his campaign, President Trump made a lot of big promises to workers in Ohio and across the country. He told them he would look out for them.  In a letter I sent to the President 2 days after the election, on November 10 or 11, asking the President to work with me to renegotiate NAFTA, insisting on ``Buy American'' provisions and infrastructure, the President scrawled across the top of the letter: ``I will never let down workers.''  He said he would look out for them, but too often the people he puts in charge are along the lines of this latest nominee to the National Labor Relations Board, Marvin Mr.Kaplan has devoted his career--imagine such a thing--to working to strip workers of their rights and trying to undermine the workers' watchdog he is now seeking to join. I never question people's motives in this body. I just don't quite understand why somebody would devote his work life to trying to take away workers' rights and undermine labor protections. Someone who views unions and collective bargaining as a threat to be dealt with rather than as essential rights to be protected has no business serving on the National Labor Relations  The National Labor Relations Board was created, in part, at this desk. Then Senator Hugo Black of Alabama, in the early 1930s, sat at this desk. At this desk, one of the pieces of legislation he wrote was the minimum wage law. One of the other pieces of legislation he worked on with Senator Wagner was the National Labor Relations In those days, people understood that you had created the National Labor Relations Act to strengthen workers, to create workers' rights, and to protect those workers' rights.  Mr.Kaplan's nomination sets that on its head. It is the latest in a long, long line of evidence that we in this country[[Page S4705]]simply don't value work the way that we used to. Workers have continually seen their rights undermined. Workers' wages have been stagnant. People who work hard and play by the rules don't have the standard of living they had in our parents' generation or even half of a generation ago.  We see companies refusing to pay overtime to workers who have earned it. We see companies misclassify workers so that companies can pay them less. We see executive salaries and CEO compensation going up and up and up. Yet for the broad middle class in this country, for people who aspire to be middle class, for low-wage workers, they have simply not gotten a raise for the last 20 years. So then, are we going to appoint somebody to the National Labor Relations Board--the President says we are going to confirm somebody to the National Labor Relations Board--who has devoted his entire career to undermining workers, to taking away workers' rights, to scaling back workers' protections, and to scaling back wages--all these things we as a country never stood for?  I don't know what is happening in this country that we think it is right to deprive workers of their wages, to take away overtime, to basically hit workers day after day after day in their pocketbooks, all while productivity goes up, profits go up, and while executive compensation goes up.  When I was a kid, the average CEO-to-worker ratio of pay was about 35 to 1 or maybe even less than that. Today it is often 300 or 400 to 1. The CEO will make 300 times what the average worker in the same company makes. How much is enough? What moral principle says to pay a CEO 300 or 400 times what a worker makes? How much do they need? Why do they keep doing that?  They keep doing that in part because of people like Mr.Kaplan, who always sides with the CEOs against the workers. As we think about this, I think everybody in this body can learn something from Pope At the end of June, Pope Francis spoke to workers in Italy at the Italian Confederation of Trade He was talking about something we do not think about much in this town that really ought to be at the heart of everything we do. He talked about the value and the dignity of work. An employer--a CEO--cannot say that he--and it is usually a ``he''--values work when he takes away workers' rights. He cannot say he appreciates the dignity of work, when he scales back their wages or cheats them out of their overtime or takes away, by misclassification, the dollars she has earned.  When Pope Francis talked about the dignity and value of work, he meant all work. He meant looking out for the little guy whether she punches a time clock or fills out a timesheet or makes a salary or earns tips, whether she is a contract worker or a temporary worker, whether he works in a call center or in a bank or on a factory floor.  I went to my high school reunion in Mansfield, OH, about a year and a half ago. I sat across from a bank teller who works for one of the largest banks in the United She has worked at that bank for 30 years. She makes $30,000 a year, and she has worked at a bank, as a bank teller, for most of the last 30 years. That is not respecting the dignity of work. That is simply undermining the value of work.  Pope Francis said:       The person thrives in work. Labour is the most common form      of cooperation that humanity has generated in its history.       Work is a form of civil love . . . that makes the world      live and carry on.  Yet too often that work--the cooperation that gives life purpose and that powers our country--does not pay off for the people who are doing it. While corporate profits are up, the GDP is up, and executive salaries have exploded upward, wages have barely budged. Workers simply have not shared in the wealth they have created.  I went to an auto plant once after the passage of the North American Free Trade At my own expense, I flew to I was representing a congressional district in Northeast Ohio then. I rented a car with a friend, went across the border from New Mexico, and I visited an auto plant in It was an American company, but it was in  This auto plant looked just like an American auto plant. It was clean, and it was up-to-date. In fact, it was newer than most of our auto plants. The floors were clean, the workers were working hard, and the technology was up-to-date.  Do you know the difference between the American auto plant and the Mexican auto plant? The Mexican auto plant did not have a parking lot because the workers did not make enough. They were not paid enough by this American auto company. They were not paid enough in Mexico to buy the cars they make. The work was not respected, profits were going up, the GDP was going up, executive salaries were going up, and the workers were not sharing in the wealth they created.  This is a universal problem. It affects blue-collar workers, and it affects white-collar workers. It is in the industrial heartland of Ohio, and it is on the farmlands of It is a problem on both coasts. People earn less. People cannot save for retirement. People feel less stable--all while working harder, all while producing more for their employers, which feeds right into huge executive compensation, but they do not share in the wealth they create for their companies. They are also less likely to have a union card that protects them.  So the President's appointment to the National Labor Relations Board is pretty much a guy who has tried to make sure unions do not get a foothold in our economy and in our companies.  The Pope spoke about the labor group. He said it performs an ``essential role for the common good.''  He said:       It gives voice to those who have none . . . unmasks the      powerful who trample on the rights of the most vulnerable      workers, defends the cause of the foreigner, the least, the      discarded.  This is the Pope talking.  Think about airline baggage handlers. Airline baggage handlers used to make a good union wage. They used to work for They used to work for They used to work for Now they work for private companies that are contracted by United, American, and Airline baggage handlers' wages in the last 10 years have dropped 40 percent. They are working just as hard--they are probably working harder--but they are making 40 percent less than they used to.  Again, the Pope said:     . . . unmasks the powerful who trample on the rights of the      most vulnerable workers, defends the cause of the foreigner,      the least, the discarded.       The capitalism of our time does not understand the value of      the trade union because it has forgotten the social nature of      the economy, of the business. This is one of the greatest      sins.  We know from rightwing attacks on the labor movement, from so-called right-to-work bills to Mr.Kaplan's efforts to undercut rules that protect workers, that too many in this country do not understand the value of the trade union.  Right now, in Mississippi, autoworkers at Nissan are organizing and trying to form a union, and the corporation has responded. This foreign corporation has responded with despicable intimidation tactics. This is one of the most powerful, profitable companies in the world that is attacking workers one at a time in  One worker said: ``There is no atmosphere of free choice in the Canton plant--just fear--which is what Nissan intends.''  It is shameful the lengths that this corporation is going to--all to prevent workers from bargaining for fair pay. It is why we need a strong, not an undercut, weakened, emasculated National Labor Relations We need a strong National Labor Relations Board to defend these workers and defend our laws on the books because an attack on unions is an attack on all workers. It is an attack on our economy as a whole because it depresses wages.  There is the idea that you give tax cuts to the richest people in the country and that you make sure executive salaries are $5- and $10- and $15 million. You squeeze workers so they do not get increases. Is that a good economy? The money does not trickle down and build the economy. You build the economy from the middle out. We know that.  In the 1990s, we built the economy from the middle out, with 22 million private sector jobs during the Clinton years. In the Bush years, they had two[[Page S4706]]huge tax cuts for the rich under the Wall Street Journal theory that it would trickle down and everybody would be better. There was literally no net private sector job increase during the Bush years. There were 22 million private sector jobs in the Clinton years and zero net growth in the Bush years. That is because, during the Bush years, they believed the economy was built from the top down. It is not large businesses that drive the economy--it is the workers. That is how you grow the economy--from the middle class out. If work is not valued, Americans cannot earn their way to better lives for their families no matter how hard they work.  That is what I think of when I hear Pope Francis talk about the social nature of our economy. Work has to support families and communities. Today businesses seem to be more focused on cutting costs than on investing in their workforces. Workers are often nothing more than a line item in a budget, a cost to be minimized. More businesses use temp workers, more businesses use contractors--look at the airlines--and more businesses use subcontractors. They pay a lower wage. They provide less job security. They roll back their retirement benefits. They undercut their health benefits, and they take away legal protections. We have to change this.  This spring, I laid out a plan to make work pay off by raising wages and benefits, including retirement, giving workers more say and more power in the workplace, encouraging companies to invest in their greatest asset--the American worker. My plan to restore the value of work has to include the labor movement. Modernizing labor law means recognizing the right of all workers, even those in alternative work arrangements, to collectively bargain for higher pay and better wages.  Pope Francis concluded:       There is no good society without a good union, and there is      no good union that is not reborn every day in the peripheries      that does not transform the discarded stones of the economy      into its cornerstones.  We are a country of discarded stones--of people who rose from humble beginnings and joined together to build institutions that were greater than any one of us. We need laws that reflect that--that reflect the dignity of work and that reflect, as in the Pope's words, the dignity of every discarded stone, of each and every American who works too many hours for too little pay.  The last thing we need for the National Labor Relations Board is another nominee who does not value work, who demeans work, and who demeans the workers and the unions who do it. Everyone in this town ought to listen a little more to Pope Francis and a little less to corporate lobbyists, a little less to big banks, and a little less to Wall Maybe, then, we will start to make hard work pay off again for American workers. We can start today by rejecting this anti-worker nominee.  I yield the floor.  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)

Mr.Speaker, Ralph Hunt was also a native of my congressional district, having grown up in an adjoining county called Granville County, North He was the seventh of eight children born in 1932 to Johnnie and Amanda Harris  As a young student at Mary Potter High School in Oxford, North Carolina, which was the only high school for African Americans during those days, Ralph grew up during the period of legal and forced segregation in the South, which helped lay the foundation for Ralph and others like him to get an education.

He was drafted into the United States Army during his junior year in school, but he was honorably discharged 2 years later from the United States  He then returned to North Carolina to complete his college education, earning a degree in mathematics in 1956. After spending many years as an educator at Mary Potter High School and Hillside High School, Ralph was elected to the Durham City He was one of only two African Americans serving on the city council at that time. His fellow council members selected him to serve as mayor pro tempore.  Ralph was then elected to the North Carolina State Senate in 1985 and served many years. During his tenure, Senator Hunt was a true statesman who led with conviction. He served as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, served as majority whip, and a member of the Joint Legislative Commission on Government He introduced the legislation that changed the election law in North Carolina to allow a 40 percent threshold to avoid a runoff in a primary.  In 1993, Senator Hunt was appointed by then-Governor Jim Hunt to the prestigious North Carolina Utilities Commission, where he would serve as its chair. Ralph Hunt, Sr., retired from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in 2001 and returned to the State Senate very briefly from 2004 to 2005.  Ralph's career in public service should serve as a marker we can all strive to meet. He was a visionary who helped bring the Durham community to be the economic leader that it is today.  Ralph Hunt, Sr., achieved many great things in his life, but his greatest achievement, Mr.Speaker, was his loving family: his dear wife of more than 50 years, Rebecca; and his three children, Ralph, Jr., Reginald, and  Mr.Speaker, the city of Durham, the county of Durham, and the State of North Carolina all shine brighter because of the life and work of Senator Ralph Hunt, We will miss him dearly, but his legacy lives on.  Everything God gave to Ralph, he gave it back to his family and to his community. I said those words at his memorial service the other day, and I say it now from the well of the U.House of Representatives: Everything that God gave to Ralph Hunt, Sr., he gave it back to his family and to his community.  Mr.Speaker, in just a few moments, after the next Republican speaker, my dear friend and colleague, Congressman David Price, who was also a dear friend of Ralph Hunt, Sr., will give additional remarks in tribute to this great leader.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4509-2.txt,1761,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,24.0,May

I might point out that he received a favorable recommendation from the Judiciary Committee by a lopsided vote of 19-to-1.  Rod Rosenstein is the total package. He has committed his life to public service. Rod graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with a B.in economics, summa cum laude, in 1986. He earned his J.degree from Harvard Law School in 1989, where he was the editor of the Harvard Law He then served as a law clerk to Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the U.Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia After finishing his clerkship in 1990, he became a trial attorney in the Public Integrity Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of He has remained at the Justice Department for his entire career.  Mr.Rosenstein has devoted his life to public service. In Maryland, Rod was appointed in 2005 by President Bush and then held over by President Obama, with the strong support of his two home State Senators, which include myself and the senior Senator at that time, Senator Barbara Rod has now become the longest serving U.attorney in the country today.  I really want to underscore that point. I know my colleagues know the prerogatives we have when we come into office and there is an opening at the U.attorney's office because of an election of a President from your own party where the previous U.attorney was appointed by the other party. In this case, it was a Republican who appointed Mr.President Obama came into office, and the senior Senator and junior Senator had the opportunity to replace that U.attorney, which has been the tradition in the Senator Mikulski and I had no hesitation when asking Mr.Rosenstein to remain on as the U.attorney in We did that because we knew how valuable he was for law enforcement in our  As U.attorney for the District of Maryland, Rod has garnered broad bipartisan support from the State and local law enforcement officials across our great State as he has tackled problems of crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, gun and gang violence, civil rights enforcement, environmental crimes, intellectual property fraud, and corruption. I just mentioned a couple of those.  I sat down with the U.attorney to talk about gang violence in our State because I had been to Central America and I saw the exporting of gang violence from Central America to The U.attorney, Mr.Rosenstein, and I had a chance to talk about[[Page S2512]]the strategies we would use in Maryland to combat that. But he didn't just work by himself at the U.attorney level; he worked with local law enforcement to make sure we had a team approach.  In terms of his pro bono work, Rod wrote in his Judiciary Committee questionnaire:       My entire legal career has been devoted to public service,      and much of my work directly benefits disadvantaged persons.      In addition to my official duties and public speaking, I have      taught without compensation at area law schools, served as a      judge at law school moot court and mock trial competitions,      and counseled other lawyers who have devoted some or all of      their career to public service.  He has truly been a model for many others in public service, a real role model.  Let me share a few examples with my colleagues of how State and local officials in Maryland have viewed Rod's work over the past decade. Let me begin with the city of Baltimore, which has just entered into a consent decree with the U.Department of Justice to reform its police practices after the death of Freddie Gray in custody 2 years ago.  Baltimore police commissioner Kevin Davis wrote:       Mr.Rosenstein and the Baltimore Police Department have      collaborated on numerous large-scale investigations and      resulting indictments of violent criminal organizations      operating in Baltimore Under Mr.Rosenstein's      leadership, the U.Attorney's Office and its prosecutors      operate with the highest sense of justice and integrity in      the course of these investigations and trials.

There is an old saying, ``You make a living by what you get; you make a life by what you give.'' Ernie has given so much to so many for so long. It is why I feel privileged and proud to call him my friend.  Ernie became involved in the labor movement in 1962 while he was working at Calvert He was a member of Distillery Workers Union Local 34 and was elected shop steward. He served as shop steward until 1970, when he was elected secretary-treasurer of Local 34-He also served as trustee of the Distillery Workers International  In 1973, then-President Nick Fornaro of the Baltimore Central Labor Council hired Ernie as a job placement officer for the Institutional Training In this capacity, Ernie was responsible for helping find jobs for hundreds of men and women housed at the Jessup and Hagerstown Penal Institutions who were qualified for work-release status. In 1976, he became the director of the Metropolitan Baltimore AFL-CIO Council's Committee on Political Education, He served in this position until 1983 when he became the COP director for the Maryland State and District of Columbia AFL-He was elected to serve as president of the Metropolitan Baltimore AFL-CIO Council in 1987, and he also served as first vice president of the Maryland State and DC AFL- Ernie has held many other leadership positions over the course of his illustrious career. For instance, he chaired the Young Trade Unionists, which was created to bring younger people into the labor movement, and he served as president of the Union Label & Service Trades Council, which promoted the purchase of union services and products. Ernie has also served on the Baltimore Workforce Investment Board, the Maryland Transportation Commission, the Maryland Workers Compensation Commission, and the Maryland Racing  As president of the Metropolitan Baltimore Council, Ernie established monthly meetings with the mayor of Baltimore City to encourage better communications and collaboration between the city and the unions. The committee consists of all city unions and a representative from the building trades. Ernie also championed the council's community services division. The community services division provides assistance to working people through information and referral advocacy to help them solve personal and family crises. The services include education and training for union peer counselors; Baltimore Works, a job placement program for dislocated workers; and Project LEAP, an adult education literacy program.  It should come as no surprise that Ernie has received numerous awards for his indefatigable service to people. He has the distinction of receiving not one, but two, national awards for community service, the Samuel Gompers Award from the American Red Cross in 1991 and the Joseph Beirne Award from United Way of America in 1999. Last year, United Way of Central Maryland gave Ernie its Philip Van Gelder Award for Community In 1995, the Baltimore City Fire Fighters Local 734 and Baltimore City Fire Officers Local 964 created the Grecco Labor Award to be given to a firefighter who ``best exemplifies the continuing and complex efforts of the local union membership to build the relationship between labor and management.''  During Ernie's career, he has been much loved and respected not just in Baltimore, but in Annapolis and across the State of Maryland for his steadfast commitment to the labor movement and working people. He is, understandably, an avid Orioles, Ravens, and horse-racing fan. His retirement is bittersweet because his beloved wife Dorothy--``Dot''--recently passed away, but I know Ernie will spend much of his time with his daughter, Nina Grecco Dukes, and his son, Gary, and Gary's wife, Kelly, and his grandchildren, Ashley, Adam, Katy, and  I have relied on Ernie's sage counsel on labor matters and other issues over[[Page S4762]]the years, and I treasure our friendship. I have been a better and more effective legislator because of Ernie's friendship and advice for which I am truly grateful. On behalf of the entire U.Senate, I congratulate Ernie on his accomplishments and his well-deserved retirement, but knowing Ernie as I do, he will find new ways to be of service to others; it is simply at the core of who he is.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4761-2.txt,,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,2.0,June
7633,topic-id,1218,"Mr.President, I am pleased to be able to serve with the Presiding Officer on the Committee on Homeland Part of our responsibilities on homeland security is to make sure, to the extent that we can, that our borders are secure. We do that in a variety of ways. We do that, in some cases, with our Border Patrol officers. We have a lot of them. We appreciate the work they do.  We also have, in many places, particularly along the border of Mexico--as the Presiding Officer knows--a lot of fencing that is there. We have a lot of roads that our vehicles can travel along to have mobility on the ground. Our President has proposed, at least earlier this year, that we spend about $25 billion to build a wall, maybe 10-, 15-, 25-feet high along the 2,000 miles between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of  I have never been convinced that that is the best way--to put all of our money in the basket--that that is really the best way to better ensure the security of our border with As it turns out, most of the folks who are coming into the United States from that part of the world are not Actually, more Mexicans are going back into Mexico than Mexicans coming across the border into the United  Most of the illegal immigration--not all but most of it--is coming from three countries: Honduras, Guatemala, and El The reason why they come here is because their lives are miserable. They are miserable because we buy drugs. We have this insatiable appetite for illegal drugs. So a lot of them are trafficked through Honduras, Guatemala, and El  We send money down to those three countries for the drugs, and we send guns down to that part of the world. When we catch bad guys in this country from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, we send them back to those three countries.  So part of the security of our southern border involves actually trying to help those three countries figure out ways to keep their people home, rather than wanting to come to our country. Part of it is making sure that they have decent lives to live. Twenty years ago, as you all may remember, a bunch of gunmen rounded up the supreme court justices in Colombia, took them into a room, and shot and killed them--shot them all to death.  It was a time when the government was tottering and there was a question of whether they were going to survive in Some very brave people stood up in Colombia and said: No, no, we want to survive, we want to fend off the drug cartels, and we want to fend off the leftist guerillas. Ultimately, they were successful. It has taken 20 years.  They worked on something called Plan Colombia to help turn around their country. We came in, and we helped them. They did the heavy lifting, and we helped out as well. I like to say that it is sort of like at Home Depot: ``You'' can do it--using, in that case, Colombia--and ``we'' being the United  A similar kind of thing is going on in Honduras, Guatemala, and El They have come up with their own Plan You might call it ``Plan Central America.'' The three countries have come up with things they are responsible for doing to improve the quality of life for their folks and the ability to have economic growth and opportunity and hope. We are helping out as well. We have done[[Page S2507]]that in some appropriations bills for the last fiscal year. We are trying to spend a little bit more. Wisely invested, it will be a fraction of what they are actually spending on their own.  To the extent that those three countries can be more attractive to people who live there, that actually helps a whole lot in terms of the pressure on our own borders. Plus, it is the right thing to do. The other thing I would mention, as to our energy policy in this country, is that sometimes we have had an ``all of the above'' energy approach. It is not just coal, it is not just wind, it is not just solar, it is not just geothermal, it is not just nuclear, and it is not just natural gas. It is all of the above. It is conservation as well.  We need a similar approach to continuing to protect our borders, whether it is in the South or other places. But it should involve a variety of things. There are some places along the 2,000 miles where it will actually make some sense. There are a lot of places where a fence makes more sense. There are a lot of places where it makes more sense just to pave the roads alongside the border.  The Presiding Officer actually spent, as he said, his ``misspent youth''--but I will say his youth--earlier in his life where he and other kayakers were in boats along the Rio Grande Part of border security is boats along that stretch of the river, that stretch of the border because it is literally hundreds of miles where the border is defined by a river. So in some places, boats make sense. In other places, boat ramps make sense.  Sometimes it makes sense to have drones up in the air that can surveil up to 100 miles into Mexico for folks coming our way. Sometimes it makes sense to put helicopters, sometimes fixed-wing aircraft. But you can't just send them up with binoculars. You need to put the right kind of surveillance equipment on there. We have that equipment. The key is to put it on the aircraft.  Sometimes stationary towers going up 200, 300 feet makes sense. Sometimes it makes sense to make those mobile. Sometimes we can put those surveillance systems 5,000 feet up in the air to look literally 100 miles into Mexico to see what is coming our way. If we have the right surveillance system, they could see not just during daylight, sunny skies, but they could see at night. They can see in fog and dense fog. So the key is all of the above--it is not any one thing--and to find out what works. The other thing is, maybe to continue to support and ask our Border Patrol: What do you guys and gals think? What do you think makes sense? And listen to them.  No, I am not smart enough to figure out how much money we put exactly in each one of those, but I think it makes sense, depending on what the needs are and on the advice of the folks who really are the experts on the ground, what they suggest, and we can do an ``all of the above'' approach. But we also have to consider that the reason most of the illegals are coming to our country is that they live their lives in misery. If we don't do something to help them help themselves, we are going to be falling short of where we want to be.

7660,topic-id,785,"Thank you, Madam  I rise to speak in opposition to the nomination of Marvin Kaplan to serve as a member of the National Labor Relations Mr.Kaplan has spent much of his career as a staff member in Congress, where he worked to undermine unions and the rights of workers to bargain collectively.  A key role of the National Labor Relations Board is to preserve the right of workers to bargain collectively. The Board itself is charged with enforcing the National Labor Relations Act, which Congress passed in 1935 in the depths of the Great The act gave workers the right to join unions, and it encouraged and promoted collective bargaining as a way to set wages and settle disputes over working conditions.  This law that passed in the 1930s--and is still in effect today--is not simply a benefit to workers; it also benefits businesses, and it also benefits the economy. Section 1 of the act says, in pertinent part: ``The inequality of bargaining power between employees . . . and employers . . . substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners.''  There are a lot of important words there. When you have inequality of bargaining power, the findings of the Congress at the time said that would burden and affect the flow of commerce. So that tells you the impact on commerce. It also says that when you have inequality of bargaining power, that aggravates business depressions, and the result of that is depressing wages and depressing purchasing power.  Everyone here knows that when we are measuring the American economy today--I am sure this has been true for many generations but especially today--the consumer plays a substantial role in our economy. So if that consumer, that worker has lower wages, that is not good for anyone. So giving workers the right to both organize and collectively bargain allows them to demand higher wages, thereby increasing their incomes and that purchasing power which is so critically important. That, in turn, of course, increases consumption and demand for goods, which, of course, increases production and employment. So all of these are tied together. Wages and benefits affect the economy, not just the worker and his or her family.  I believe there is now a concerning trend to weaken the National Labor Relations Act and to tilt the Board against workers. Mr.Kaplan's nomination is another sign of this disconnect between the rhetoric of the administration claiming to be pro-worker and its actions that are of late anything but pro-worker. The administration claims it is here to support workers, but at every turn, we have nominees who have spent their careers working in the opposite direction.  We know that in the 1950s and 1960s, the economy worked well for working Americans because 35 percent of workers were in a labor union. The decline of unions, the decline of the workers' voice, and the decline of collective bargaining have helped to lead us where we are today--stagnant wages over a long period of time, as well as power, wealth, and income, of course, concentrated at the top.  So we know that unions helped workers to win higher wages, job security, and unprecedented benefits, including paid vacations, paid sick leave, and pensions that gave those workers and their families a measure of security, but it also increased their purchasing power, and it also, of course, strengthened the economy. American family incomes grew by an average of 2.8 percent per year from 1947 through 1973, with every sector of society seeing its income roughly double.  We know now that in the last number of years, it has been a different story. Families across Pennsylvania and the United States know that the story is much different. It is not a coincidence that union membership has declined from its peak of 35 percent of private sector employment in the 1950s to less than 7 percent of private sector employment today. This is all the more reason to stop this assault on workers and labor unions.  Nominees with a partisan history of working to undermine unions or undermine the National Labor Relations Act or undermine the National Labor Relations Board should not be confirmed to a position where they are supposed to act as an arbiter to protect the rights of workers to form a union and to bargain collectively.

7642,topic-id,2114,"Mr.President, I rise today to address President Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2018. My predecessor in this seat, my friend, former Vice President Joe Biden, once said to me years ago: Show me your budget and I will show you your values.  One of my concerns about the proposal we have received--the initial slimmed-down overview proposal we have received--is that it suggests values that I think are quite out of line with what my home State of Delaware would look for me to be doing in this body, what I think addresses the real needs and priorities of the American people.  Last month President Trump released an overview of his budget--what is called a skinny budget--and we haven't yet received a full and detailed budget proposal. Even though what we have received is just an overview, it indicates that the cuts President Trump is proposing will significantly weaken vital domestic programs, often with the goal of completely eliminating existing and valued initiatives.  This chart gives a rough summary of all the different Federal agencies that would take double-digit hits in order to be able to pay for the significant $54 billion increase to defense spending. Targeting only nondefense programs that millions of Americans and Delawareans rely on ignores commitments made over the last couple of budget cycles and years, as Republicans and Democrats have worked together to ensure placing equal priority on defense and nondefense spending.  Under sequestration, under the Budget Control Act, we have already made significant cuts to important domestic programs. After the difficult budgets of the last few years, in my view, we have already made too many cuts to some of the programs that helped build our  To be clear, I am as passionate as anyone in this body about supporting our Armed Forces, particularly when they are in harm's way and particularly as we continue to conduct operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.[[Page S2514]]But Democrats will not stand for cutting domestic programs simply to pay for a $54 billion military expansion that hasn't been explained or justified through a thorough review of what are the appropriate investments in defense that will respond to the challenges and threats we face in this world.  To pay for that $54 billion increase in defense by cutting investments in education, housing, job training, and more here at home strikes me as the wrong set of priorities and the wrong direction. If anything like these proposed Trump budget cuts are enacted, I know my home State of Delaware would lose millions and millions of dollars for valuable and effective Federal programs that help my constituents each and every day. Trump's budget proposal would cut research and health programs. It would cut job-creating infrastructure programs. It would cut grants for higher education. It would cut housing and so much more.  I wish to take a few minutes to focus on a few of many proposed budget cuts to give a sense of the impact it might have on our livelihood, our security, and our prosperity at home. Let me start with some cuts that would directly affect our national security, our safety.  In my view, the deep cuts made in the proposed Trump budget would simply make us less safe. For example, the U.Coast Guard, which has a station in Delaware, would be cut by more than $1.3 billion. The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, has just as high a cut. Ironically, even though these are the very agencies that protect our ports and other points of entry, Trump proposes cutting their funding so that a southern border wall can be built for an estimate well above $25 billion. This simply makes no sense. If you listen to the words of the Coast Guard Commandant, ADM Paul Zukunft, he warned that simply focusing all those resources on building a wall along the border with Mexico would make our ports and waterways even more appealing to smugglers and those who seek to bring illicit drugs or to bring people into the United States through unlawful entry.  That is not all. The Trump budget would make us less safe by depleting Federal protection from natural disasters, starting with a proposed $600 million cut to FEMA State and local grants. The budget also proposes restructuring fees for the National Flood Insurance Program, which would lead to raising rates for homeowners who get flood insurance.  My home State of Delaware is the lowest mean elevation State in America--literally the lowest lying State and ground zero for sea level rise. These cuts would have a significant impact on homeowners up and down my State, those at our seashore and those in my home community of Wilmington who face steadily rising flood insurance premiums.  It is not just our safety, though, that would be impacted by the President's budget; it also threatens job growth and economic security. As a President who ran a campaign on a middle-class jobs agenda, I am struck that his proposed budget would endanger Americans across the country financially by also undermining support for development in both rural areas and urban areas. Take the Department of Agriculture, which provides critical support through the Rural Development In Delaware, at least, Rural Development, or RDA, has played a critical role in supporting housing, businesses, and communities in the rural parts of Delmarva--Delaware and  The Trump budget would also eliminate the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, or RBS, which promotes economic development in distressed rural areas. That is a program which has supported things like Del Tech automotive technician training and architectural services for the Seaford Historical Society, among many other things.  Something I am much more familiar with and more passionate about is the Manufacturing Extension Across the State of Delaware, the MEP, as it is known, has helped small and medium manufacturing companies to be better at taking advantage of cutting-edge technology, understanding how to manage their inventory, how to invest more wisely in new capital equipment, and how to grow and compete around the world.  Since 2000, Delaware's Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program has used Federal support to help Delaware manufacturers increase sales by more than $120 million, helping create more than 1,600 good-paying jobs and finding over $100 million in cost savings in Delaware's small and medium manufacturers. These are great impacts for a fairly small program. Why that program specifically targeted at helping small and medium manufacturing companies would be a priority for elimination is beyond me.  Cuts to other areas that impact research and energy in our economy also strike me as unwise and ill-considered. It is not just our economy and national security; Trump's budget would also threaten our infrastructure, our transportation, and our housing.  As a Delawarean and someone who rides Amtrak between Wilmington and Washington almost every day we are in session, I know how important our passenger rail system is for the Northeast, as well as for connecting the rest of our country. Amtrak's long-distance routes are critically important to the Nation's economy and to sustaining passenger rail as a nationwide Federal service. Yet, as our competitors around the world are investing billions of dollars in high-speed rail and in efficient rail networks that connect whole countries, President Trump's proposal would eliminate all Federal funding for Amtrak's long-distance routes.  Another effective Federal program that has made a difference in my home State in infrastructure is the so-called TIGER Program, which invests in a whole range of infrastructure options--highway, transit, rail and port--by leveraging private capital and supporting competitive, innovative solutions to infrastructure challenges. The TIGER Program has supported projects like a new regional rail transportation center at the University of Delaware, taking advantage of the former Chrysler rail yard, and the significant new growth we are seeing at the University of Delaware's STAR campus. This is an investment that will have several multiples that will leverage private sector benefits by promoting economic development, accessible housing, and multimobile transportation choices in the area.  Many of my colleagues have similar experiences in their States about the impact of the TIGER Grant In the last year, it had a demand nearly 20 times the available funding. Yet the Trump budget would again eliminate all Federal funding to this vital transportation infrastructure program that creates jobs and helps to leverage private sector investment.  There are so many other programs on the chopping block, it is hard to even begin to touch on them: Community Development Block Grants, which I relied on in my previous job as county executive to provide support for low-income and disabled individuals to have access to high quality housing; the funds that support things like Meals on Wheels, that allow our low-income seniors to age in place rather than having to be moved to institutions; and many other programs through the Federal Department of Housing that have a positive impact in communities up and down my State, from Newark and Wilmington to Dover and  If you take the U.Department of Agriculture's rural water and wastewater loan and grant programs, these would be eliminated entirely. These programs are critical to ensuring that rural communities can access funds to support safe drinking water and sewer systems. Many communities in Southern Delaware rely on rural water funds to ensure safe drinking water supplies for the families that live there. As I have suggested, the list of potential cuts to programs goes on and on.  Let me move to some impacts on the environment, briefly. The Chesapeake Bay is one of the world's largest estuary systems, and Delaware is a State that borders on the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Economists insist that there is nearly $1 trillion worth of economic value to the Chesapeake Bay watershed, yet the Trump budget cuts nearly half of the funding for the EPA to allow States to get grants that will help improve air quality, clean up contaminated waste sites, and remove lead from drinking water. Delaware alone would lose $3 million in these vital initiatives.  There are millions of Americans who rely on many more programs listed[[Page S2515]]here--AmeriCorps, Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the African Development Foundation, and many more--all eliminated in this budget in order to prioritize a focus on our military and defense.  I don't think the President understands that we cannot maintain our status as a global leader with defense and military alone. We need to ensure that a complementary strength exists in our development and diplomacy programs, which are less than one-tenth of our spending on national defense.  I recently had the opportunity to see the impact that USAID and our programs to assist the hungry and needy around the world can make in stabilizing fragile states and preventing them from becoming failed states. We spent less than one percent of the Federal budget on these sorts of programs. They provide a critical connection to parts of the world where a positive understanding of America and our values would be a good thing.  The international affairs budget, which includes needed funding for USAID, the State Department, and other related programs, would be cut by one-third under the Trump budget--a 29 percent cut to the State Department alone.  If history is any indicator, the last 70 years show these investments in diplomacy and development are critical. Foreign assistance is not charity. It serves a humanitarian purpose, but it also makes us stronger by promoting American values around the world, building coalitions that isolate our adversaries, and helping make tens of millions less susceptible to terrorism and to extremism around the world.  This is a false choice between significantly increasing our defense spending and the need to sustain our investments in diplomacy and development. I hope my colleagues and constituents will take time to think about the many different Federal programs that I have briefly discussed in these remarks about the proposed budget and all the different ways that these Federal programs have invested in our quality of life, in our national security, and our economic prosperity. Many of them are scheduled for elimination under this budget.  As I have heard both Republicans and Democrats say in press interviews and on this floor: No President's budget is adopted without change. It is my hope that this budget will be set aside and that the folks who represent our States here will begin anew the process of building an appropriations path forward that actually protects our country, protects our livelihood, and invests significantly in sustaining and saving the very best of these programs that have benefited my home State and my constituents for so very long.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from               Reforming Finance for Local Economies Act  ",CREC-2017-04-25-pt1-PgS2506.txt,1984,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,25.0,July
7775,topic-id,1415,"Mr.President, I have come to the floor tonight to join my colleagues in opposing the Senate healthcare reform bill, what I will call the Senate TrumpCare bill. I am also here to thank the thousands of my constituents, the thousands of Delawareans who called and emailed my office to express their opposition to this bill that is about neither health nor care. It is because of your efforts, because of the efforts of thousands of Americans across the country who have made their voices heard, that today the Senate doesn't have enough votes to pass this TrumpCare bill.  I urge everyone watching and listening to remember that this fight is not over. The Senate will be back next month, and Republicans will be doing everything they can to make tweaks or shaves or changes or amendments to the bill to get it past this body. We need the engagement, the persistence, even the resistance of Delawareans and Americans to make sure the Senate TrumpCare bill never becomes law.  This is as urgent now as ever because of how fundamentally heartless this bill is. As many nonpartisan organizations, including the Congressional Budget Office, have pointed out, this bill is essentially a massive tax break for the wealthy paid for on the backs of some of America's most vulnerable citizens.  Many of my colleagues have already discussed the devastating impact this bill would have over time on millions of This Senate bill would make hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, it would slash tax credits that help Americans buy health insurance, and it would force 22 million Americans off their health insurance and drive up costs for many millions more.  If that is not bad enough, the Senate TrumpCare bill does all of this slashing and cutting in large part to give another tax break to our wealthiest citizens. If this bill becomes law, the very richest Americans would get an extra $700 billion in tax breaks over the next decade.  If it only affected the millions of Americans who depend on Medicaid or who purchase insurance on the individual market, it would be unconscionable, but it is even worse. Let me explain.  Many of our constituents don't realize that even Americans who get their health insurance through their employer--the 150 million Americans who get their health insurance through their employer--have benefited from the Affordable Care In fact, I think that in some ways, the consumer protections put in place by the ACA are the most important accomplishment of that bill.  A core requirement of the ACA was that all health insurance plans cover what are known as essential health benefits. These are basic services, such as emergency care, prescription drugs, pediatric services, maternity and newborn care, hospitalization, healthcare for the mentally ill, and substance[[Page S3796]]abuse treatment for the addicted. To put it more succinctly, these are all the reasons many people want health insurance in the first place. Thanks to the ACA, almost every insurance plan in the country today has to carry these core services, and that includes the more than 150 million Americans and the half a million Delawareans who get their health insurance through their jobs.  The Senate TrumpCare bill would allow States, through waivers over time, to gut these essential health benefit requirements, gradually making many Americans' health insurance less and less valuable and less and less protective of their and their families' health.  That provision of the Senate TrumpCare bill would also allow States to waive the ban on insurers imposing annual and lifetime limits on essential healthcare coverage. Even if you get good insurance through your employer, if you have an unexpected development--let's say the premature birth of a child, who develops serious medical challenges, or a terrible diagnosis that requires expensive and repeated surgery--you either have to come up with that money on your own or you are forced into bankruptcy once you hit the lifetime cap.  Let me demonstrate with an all-too-real example. About 1 in 10 newborns has to spend time in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU, after they are born. According to the American Medical Association, in the NICU, ``it is not unusual for costs to top $1 million for an extended stay.'' That means even a baby born to parents with great insurance coverage through their employer hit their lifetime insurance cap before they even leave the hospital for the first time.  As Americans are scrambling to find ways to pay for their astronomical out-of-pocket costs under the so-called Senate TrumpCare bill, wealthier Americans and corporations will be given big tax breaks.  Moreover, while Senate Republicans may claim their bill still covers preexisting conditions, insurance under this bill would be rendered meaningless if it doesn't cover what you need to treat your preexisting condition through these essential health benefits.  Let's briefly recap this Senate TrumpCare bill. Millions of Americans lose health insurance. Those who managed to keep it end up paying more but get less coverage. The wealthiest Americans get another big tax break. That is a painful, even cynical, political calculation.  Since I came to the Senate 7 years ago, I have said more times than I can count that I want to work with Republicans to fix the parts of the Affordable Care Act that need fixing. Let's simplify the reporting requirements that burden small businesses and increase the tax credits that help small business employers offer insurance to their employees. Let's find ways together to increase competition and expand the tax credits to bring down premiums and deductibles on the individual market. Let's explore new mechanisms that control healthcare costs by incentivizing reforms and producing healthier outcomes, rather than more tests and services. Sadly, this Senate TrumpCare bill does none of these things.  It is my hope that after today's developments, that after the next few weeks, that after hearing from their constituents and returning in the next month, that my colleagues will recognize that if we work together, we can address the broken parts of the ACA and sustain the best of what it has done to expand insurance and healthcare for millions of  Let me close with a story I shared earlier today on the steps of the This is Kerry Kerry is from my hometown of Wilmington, Kerry is a massage therapist and self-employed yoga instructor. Like many Americans, she considers the Affordable Care Act ``nothing short of miraculous.''  Kerry signed up for health insurance in 2014, thanks to a subsidy that made it available to her through the She had some nagging abdominal and lower back pain for years but didn't think much of it, considering she had no family history of disease and had never even had stitches before. But that next year, in January of 2015, a routine procedure covered by her new insurance--which she told me she wouldn't have even gone for if it hadn't been covered by this new health insurance--revealed that Kerry, in fact, had stage III colon cancer. She had surgery a week later. She had 6 months of chemotherapy, and she ultimately faced no out-of-pocket expenses and is fully in remission. Kerry's cancer has now been in remission since September 2015.  She wrote to me earlier this year:       The ACA came along at the last possible moment to save my      life. I am certain that without it, I would have continued to      live with the discomfort and try to self-treat until the      cancer was too advanced to be successfully treated.  I am opposing the Senate TrumpCare bill for Kerry and for the thousands of Delawareans and millions of Americans just like her. I have heard stories from Delawareans about things that need to be fixed in the Affordable Care Act, and I hope I get a chance to work across the aisle to do that, but I have also heard from hundreds of Delawareans whose lives have been improved or, in cases just like Kerry's, saved by the Affordable Care I will not yield on defending the best parts of the ACA that have saved the lives of Americans across this country.  In the days and the weeks to come, I hope all Americans will stay active, stay engaged, and stay the course so that we can push aside this cruel, cynical bill and find an opportunity to work together on a bill with real heart. That fight is not yet over, and I will not yet yield.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgS3795.txt,1984,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,27.0,July

7654,topic-id,1605,"Mr.President, I note in this morning's news that insurance companies that provide health insurance policies on the ObamaCare exchanges are projecting that insurance premiums will go up about 30 percent next year.  Since 2013, we have seen the nationwide average of premiums go up 105 percent. That was before this latest announcement. We know that in 2017, the national average increase in premiums was 25 percent, and in Arizona, for example, it was 145 percent.  So why did all of the Senate Democrats vote against making progress on a solution toward these runaway premiums I have talked about ad nauseam on the Senate floor?  We have almost become numb to the pain people across this country are experiencing because of the skyrocketing rate of their insurance premiums, and we know that 28 million, roughly, have dropped out and are uninsured. In my State alone, because of the individual mandate, which is the penalty the government imposes for one's failing to buy a government-approved health insurance plan--as the Presiding Officer knows because I got the figures from him--more than 400,000 Texans who earn less than $25,000 a year paid the penalty because they could not afford to buy the insurance. All in all, about a million Texans paid the penalty because of the individual mandate.  When we tried to do something about that last week, in working with our House colleagues, what was the response from the other side? It was crickets--silence. Unfortunately, the people who were hurt by ObamaCare are still being hurt by  Now, here is the narrative. I have already seen it on social media and have read about it in the paper and elsewhere. Some people are saying: Well, the reason insurance companies are saying that premiums are going to go up 30 percent next year is that President Trump will not commit to the subsidies for insurance companies, the so-called  That is utterly false. How do they explain the 105-percent increase from 2013 to currently? How do they explain last year's increase in insurance premiums, 25 percent, on average, and 145 percent in places like Arizona before President Trump even took office? It is a demonstrably false narrative, and I cannot tell you how disappointed I am that we were not able to make some progress toward a solution on behalf of the people whom I represent in my State but also on behalf of the people whom we all represent across the United  I dare say, as we search for a path forward, we ought to get our facts straight, and the idea that premiums are going to go up 30 percent next year, unless something changes, is a product of the failure of It is nothing that this administration has done or will do that has caused that. So let's get our facts straight because starting with the correct facts is absolutely essential to coming up with real solutions.                         Work Before the Senate  Mr.President, we sometimes are our own worst enemy in the U.We do something really important, really good, and really bipartisan, and then we do not tell anybody about it. We leave it to them to discover it for themselves. Last night, for example, we passed major, bipartisan, bicameral legislation to continue the Veterans Choice At a time when so much is polarized here in Washington and people are hungry for bipartisanship and solution-oriented leadership,[[Page S4702]]when they get it on something like the Veterans Choice Program, we do not talk about it. This is really important to our veterans--people to whom, I believe, we have a solemn commitment as a result of their service to our country.  Over the last few years, we have heard how the Veterans Health Administration has been plagued by inefficiency, unaccountability, and poor quality of care. The VA has been hindered too long by unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles, which have been incredibly frustrating and deadly, I am afraid, in some cases, for our veterans. We have heard stories about veterans having to travel hours to get medical care, sometimes causing them to accept lower quality care or to forgo that care entirely. Sadly, in some cases, veterans turn to coping mechanisms, self-destructive activity--self-medicating--with drugs or alcohol because they simply cannot get access to genuinely helpful medical care.  The Veterans Choice Program was designed to help address that by ensuring that veterans could receive timely appointments close to where they live. If they had to drive too far or if they had to wait too long for an appointment at a veterans facility, we said: You could show up at your local healthcare provider's, and we will pay for it through the Veterans Choice  The VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 continues that important program and guarantees veterans that they will have access to care without interruption.  This bill also strengthens the VA's ability to recruit, train, and retain its valuable workforce, which will help the VA continue to improve veterans' care. I am glad we were able to pass this legislation last night to ensure that this program can continue serving veterans. In moving forward, both Chambers should continue to work with the VA to get the agency back on track and right the years of poor quality of care and of service to our veterans for whom, I believe, we have a sacred obligation, a solemn commitment, based on their service to our country.  Next, we will focus on another important piece of legislation. This is authorizing the Food and Drug Administration's user fee program.  This is how the Food and Drug Administration actually considers and approves new drugs that can save lives and improve the quality of lives. These partnerships between the public and private sectors ensure that patients will have access to safe and effective drugs and medical devices while also maintaining America's position as a global leader in medical innovation. Faster approvals mean treatments and cures reach patients sooner. Increased competition leads to lower costs, and that, in turn, means more lives saved. This is another example of what, I believe, will be a bipartisan accomplishment of the current Senate and current  I heard one of our colleagues last week stand in front of the Nation and say nothing ever gets done. Well, we are doing some important things. The Veterans Choice Program and the FDA reauthorization bill are important, lifesaving bills that are being passed on a bipartisan basis.  Then, of course, there is the backlog of the President's nominees.  I have never seen anything quite like it. We had an election on November 8, but for many of our colleagues, the election remains undecided. They do not accept the verdict of the American people and the electoral college that President Trump won the election and that Hillary Clinton lost. That is how they, somehow, justify their consistent foot-dragging and obstruction when it comes to the President's nominees for important offices, including his  It is the President's prerogative to nominate whom he wants to serve in the executive branch, but it is our duty, our responsibility, to carefully consider their qualifications before coming together to confirm them. Now, we have had people who had been waiting months for their nominations to be confirmed and who were confirmed by almost unanimous votes of the Senate, which tells me we were delaying those votes unnecessarily. If they were truly controversial, I think it would be reflected in the votes for their confirmations, but they are not.  Let me just name one--our former colleague, Kay Bailey Hutchison, who has been nominated to serve as the Ambassador to I cannot think of a more qualified person than my good friend, the former Senator from Our country needs leadership in Brussels, at NATO, to help counter Russian aggression and threats and intimidation against our allies in the region, but that is just one example.  Last night, the Senate confirmed the FBI Director--I am grateful for that--but they also confirmed--again, in the dead of night when nobody was paying attention--eight other Department of Defense nominees. Now, if our Democratic colleagues had good reason to delay those confirmations because they felt like they were controversial, that is their right, but evidently they were willing to let those people who had been nominated to the Department of Defense be confirmed, basically, by consent after months and months of delay.  We have a lot of other nominations that are backlogged due to the unfortunate obstruction and foot-dragging of our Democratic colleagues, and I, for one, do not think we ought to leave in August--this month--without a big, robust package of the confirmations of these noncontroversial nominees.  It is time to get over the election. That was on November 8. We used to see a difference between elections and the responsibility of governing. Regardless of who wins the election, we still have the responsibility to govern. Some people seem to have forgotten that.  Again, I hope we have a big, robust package of noncontroversial nominations approved before we leave for the rest of the month of I think it is too important to leave town without that. We need our President to succeed so the country can succeed. This is what every American who voted for President Trump hoped for, and they trusted him to choose men and women for his Cabinet to lead and guide our country. I have to say, he has done a remarkably good job in the people whom he has chosen for his Cabinet so let's come together and confirm these appointees so the administration can better serve our Nation and all  I yield the floor.

7812,topic-id,1440,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                1338       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Dust Off Crews of the      Vietnam War Congressional Gold Medal Act''.     2.       The Congress finds that--       (1) a United States Army Dust Off crewman (pilot, crew      chief, and medic) is a helicopter crew member who served      honorably in the Vietnam War aboard a helicopter air      ambulance under the radio call sign ``Dust Off'';       (2) Dust Off crews performed aeromedical evacuation for      United States, Vietnamese, and allied forces inside South      Vietnam from May 1962 through March 1973.       (3) nearing the end of World War II, the United States Army      began using helicopters for medical evacuation and years      later, during the Korean War, these helicopter air ambulances      were responsible for transporting 17,700 United States      casualties;       (4) during the Vietnam War, with the use of helicopter air      ambulances, United States Army Dust Off crews pioneered the      concept of dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and rescued      almost 900,000 United States, South Vietnamese, and other      allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy forces;       (5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool to assist      those injured on the battlefield;       (6) highly skilled and intrepid, Dust Off crews were able      to operate the helicopters and land them on almost any      terrain in nearly any weather to pick up wounded, after which      the Dust Off crews could provide care to these patients while      transporting them to ready medical facilities;       (7) the vital work of the Dust Off crews required      consistent combat exposure and often proved to be the      difference between life and death for wounded personnel;       (8) the revolutionary concept of a dedicated combat life-     saving system was cultivated and refined by United States      Army Dust Off crews during 11 years of intense conflict in      and above the jungles of South Vietnam;       (9) innovative and resourceful Dust Off crews in Vietnam      were responsible for taking the new concept of helicopter      medical evacuation, born just a few years earlier, and      revolutionizing it to meet and surpass the previously      unattainable goal of delivering a battlefield casualty to an      operating table within the vaunted ``golden hour'';       (10) some Dust Off units in Vietnam operated so efficiently      that they were able to deliver a patient to a waiting medical      facility on an average of 33 minutes from the receipt of the      mission, which saved the lives of countless personnel in      Vietnam, and this legacy continues for modern-day Dust Off      crews;[[Page S3398]]       (11) the inherent danger of being a member of a Dust Off      crew in Vietnam meant that there was a 1 in 3 chance of being      wounded or killed;       (12) many battles during the Vietnam War raged at night,      and members of the Dust Off crews often found themselves      searching for a landing zone in complete darkness, in bad      weather, over mountainous terrain, and all while being the      target of intense enemy fire as they attempted to rescue the      wounded, which caused Dust Off crews to suffer a rate of      aircraft loss that was more than 3 times that of all other      types of combat helicopter missions in Vietnam;       (13) the 54th Medical Detachment typified the constant      heroism displayed by Dust Off crews in Vietnam, over the span      of a 10-month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters and 40      soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644      missions while being airborne for 4,832 hours;       (14) collectively, the members of the 54th Medical      Detachment earned 78 awards for valor, including 1 Medal of      Honor, 1 Distinguished Service Cross, 14 Silver Star Medals,      26 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Bronze Star Medals for      valor, 4 Air Medals for valor, 4 Soldier's Medals, and 26      Purple Heart Medals;       (15) the 54th Medical Detachment displayed heroism on a      daily basis and set the standard for all Dust Off crews in      Vietnam;       (16) 5 members of the 54th Medical Detachment are in the      Dust Off Hall of Fame, 3 are in the Army Aviation Hall of      Fame, and 1 is the only United States Army aviator in the      National Aviation Hall of Fame;       (17) Dust Off crew members are among the most highly      decorated soldiers in American military history;       (18) in early 1964, Major Charles Kelly was the      Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter      Ambulance), Provisional, in Soc Trang, South Vietnam;       (19) Major Kelly helped to forge the Dust Off call-sign      into history as one of the most welcomed phrases to be heard      over the radio by wounded soldiers in perilous and dire      situations;       (20) in 1964, Major Kelly was killed in action as he      gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a wounded American      soldier and several Vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied,      after being warned to stay away from the landing zone due to      the ferocity of enemy fire, ``When I have your wounded.'';       (21) General William Westmoreland, Commander, Military      Assistance Command, Vietnam (1964-1968), singled out Major      Kelly as an example of ``the greatness of the human spirit''      and highlighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in      combat;       (22) General Creighton Abrams, Westmoreland's successor      (1968-1972), and former Chief of Staff of the United States      Army, highlighted the heroism of Dust Off crews, ``A special      word about the Dust Offs . . . Courage above and beyond the      call of duty was sort of routine to them. It was a daily      thing, part of the way they lived. That's the great part, and      it meant so much to every last man who served there. Whether      he ever got hurt or not, he knew Dust Off was there.'';       (23) Dust Off crews possessed unique skills and traits that      made them highly successful in aeromedical evacuation in      Vietnam, including indomitable courage, extraordinary      aviation skill and sound judgment under fire, high-level      medical expertise, and an unequaled dedication to the      preservation of human life;       (24) members of the United States Armed Forces on the      ground in Vietnam had their confidence and battlefield      prowess reinforced knowing that there were heroic Dust Off      crews just a few minutes from the fight, which was      instrumental to their well-being, willingness to fight, and      morale;       (25) military families in the United States knew that their      loved ones would receive the quickest and best possible care      in the event of a war-time injury, thanks to the Dust Off      crews;       (26) the willingness of Dust Off crews to also risk their      lives to save helpless civilians left an immeasurably      positive impression on the people of Vietnam and exemplified      the finest American ideals of compassion and humanity; and       (27) Dust Off crews from the Vietnam War hailed from every      State in the United States and represented numerous ethnic,      religious, and cultural backgrounds.     3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of      Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate      shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on      behalf of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate      design in honor of the Dust Off crews of the Vietnam War,      collectively, in recognition of their heroic military      service, which saved countless lives and contributed directly      to the defense of our country.       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award      referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury      shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices,      and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary, in      consultation with the Secretary of       (c) Smithsonian Institution.--       (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in      honor of the Dust Off Crews of the Vietnam War, the gold      medal shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it      will be available for display as appropriate and available      for research.       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that      the Smithsonian Institution should also make the gold medal      awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere,      particularly at appropriate locations associated with the      Vietnam War, and that preference should be given to locations      affiliated with the Smithsonian     4. DUPLICATE       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of      the gold medal struck pursuant to section 3 under such      regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price      sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor,      materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and      the cost of the gold medal.     5. NATIONAL       The medal struck pursuant to this Act is a national medal      for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-06-12-pt1-PgS3397.txt,1692,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,12.0,July

7859,topic-id,729,"Mr.Speaker, all across America over the last 2 or 3 weeks has been an exciting time for a lot of young Americans and families as graduating seniors in 4-year programs and 2-year programs are receiving their degrees and beginning, obviously, a new, exciting stage in their life.  Unfortunately, there is still, though, a cloud over a lot of those folks in terms of what they face in the near future and the long-term future and many others who graduated in recent years, which is the high cost of student loan debt. The Federal Reserve has calculated that over $1 trillion of overhang exists in the U.economy because of student loan debt: an amount greater than credit card debt, an amount greater than auto debt, and at rates that far exceed any of those forms of consumer debt, including mortgages for homes.  The Federal Government, in the meantime, is out selling bonds as a borrower to people who buy Treasury bonds, 10-year notes. This morning's rate, which I checked before coming down here, the rate that the Federal Government is going to pay as borrower, is 2.3 percent. Well, as many, I think, listening here, Mr.Speaker, know, the fact is that student loans carry much higher rates of interest, particularly legacy debt that goes back 5, 6 years ago when, again, the rates for Stafford student loans, which are the publicly financed loans through the Federal Government, and certainly private loans that banks give to students that are on an unsecured rate can sometimes exceed 8, 9, 10 percent.  So tomorrow, I and many others are going to be introducing legislation called the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, which will allow folks who carry the student loan debt not to get their debt forgiven, but to allow them to actually refinance down to 3.76 percent, which was the interest rate last year that the Federal Government offered for Stafford student loans.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that that will put about $50 billion into the pockets of young people all across the country who, because of student loan debt, are being inhibited in terms of getting married, starting a family, starting a business, and getting out of their parents' house. There is just all kinds of, I think, inhibitors that student loan debt creates for young people, millennials, all across the country.  Again, I want to emphasize the bill that I will be introducing tomorrow with 61 cosponsors is not debt forgiveness. It just simply does what any middle class family does in a low-interest rate environment, whether it is with a home mortgage or credit cards, to just simply get their rates down to a proportionate level with, again, the rest of consumer debt that is out there in the economy.  Simultaneously tomorrow, Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts will be introducing exactly the same bill, so we will have bills in the House and in the Last year we had 182 cosponsors on a similar piece of legislation. Unfortunately, the Speaker never allowed the bill to be brought to the floor for debate. But it is a new Congress; it is the 115th Congress that was sworn in last  This problem, I will just submit, Mr.Speaker, exists in Republican districts and Democratic districts, rural districts, suburban districts, urban districts. This is an opportunity to lift a debt burden from, again, the very folks that we really want to assist and help as they begin a new phase, a new chapter, in their life, and they should not have the albatross of high student loan rates hung around their neck. Hopefully, this will be the year that we will move forward on this measure, which is fully paid for--it does not add to the Federal debt--and just, again, allows young people and families the opportunity to do what they do with all other forms of consumer debt.  So it is the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Hopefully, anyone listening to this will call their Members to tell them to get on this bill. And I would urge, Mr.Speaker, all of us on both sides of the aisle to deal with an issue that really is a bread-and-butter, kitchen-table issue[[Page H4202]]all across America, that, again, at this special time when students are graduating, we can do a really positive thing to help students and families all across                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-16-pt1-PgH4201-4.txt,1836,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,May

7675,topic-id,1121,"Mr.President, I stand here today to speak about the devastation befalling Venezuela--the people raging in the streets against unfair elections, the dissidents being seized from their homes and detained by security forces, and those starving without food and water.  Venezuela--once one of the most richly resourced countries in Latin America--is being dismantled by Nicolas Madura and his flailing Chavista regime. It is a human tragedy impacting more than 30 million people who are literally witnessing society collapse around them.  The numbers, sadly, speak for themselves. According to estimates from the International Monetary Fund, Venezuela's GDP contracted by almost 20 percent last year, with inflation reaching some 550 percent and unemployment spiking to more than 21 percent. The Pharmaceutical Federation of Venezuela estimates that the country suffers from an 85-percent shortage of medicine and a 90-percent deficit of medical supplies, including those needed to treat various types of cancer.  Men and women, young and old, are going hungry. Thanks to Maduro's destruction of the Venezuelan currency, flour, cooking oil, and other basic commodities have disappeared from store shelves. Students and teachers leave their classrooms for hours on end to stand in line, hoping to receive a loaf of bread as a week's meal. The most vulnerable are going on what are called Maduro diets--skipping meals and reducing their food consumption.  And Maduro's response? The would-be dictator is threatening to seize businesses that don't produce enough and has told Venezuelans that doing without makes them tougher. Thousands of Venezuelans have crossed borders in search of food and medicine, while Maduro and his cronies spin conspiracies and rail against phantom enemies on state media. The situation is so dire that the regime has begun ``rewarding'' some of its most loyal supporters with toilet paper.  Alongside the disintegration of Venezuela's economy is the specter of Maduro's growing dictatorship. We have just witnessed the sham election of a so-called constituent assembly, which Maduro intends to use to try to rewrite Venezuela's Constitution, to crush what is left of its free political institutions, and to consolidate his grip on power. His electoral commission lied about the turnout and downplayed the number of government workers whom the regime pressured to participate. While Maduro preached dialogue on television, his security forces were busy rounding up political opponents and murdering peaceful demonstrators.  This was not Maduro's first power grab. Earlier this year, his handpicked supreme court temporarily dissolved Venezuela's duly-elected National Assembly and stripped its members of immunity in what the head of Organization of American States called a ``self-coup.'' The regime backtracked only after ferocious pressure and condemnation.  But this week's actions make plain Maduro's intent to complete the process begun under his mentor, Hugo Chavez, to transform Venezuela into a full socialistic dictatorship. We have seen that socialism doesn't work. We have seen the ravages of government control of the economy. The Venezuelan people are suffering, and when combined with dictatorship, it is a toxic mix.  Maduro's actions must not continue unchallenged. I support the Treasury Department's sanctions against senior Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, placing him in the ignominious company of Kim Jong Un and Robert We must keep the pressure on and continue to isolate and delegitimize Maduro's regime, for behind Maduro can be found China, with its billions in infrastructure investments, and Russia, with its growing control over Venezuela's energy sector, and Iran, whose Hezbollah proxy launders money with Maduro's acquiescence.  Yet Maduro is not without opposition. Brave men and women in the tens of thousands have taken to the streets to demand a better future for themselves and their families. Many dozens have been killed by the regime's security forces, and hundreds have been detained. These freedom-loving people represent the best of Venezuela and fearlessly follow in the footsteps of generations of dissidents against Socialist repression.  Just yesterday, Maduro's security forces seized two prominent opposition leaders--Leopoldo Lopez and Antonio Ledezma--for daring to criticize his regime on social media. These two men were carted away in the middle of the night, leaving their loved ones traumatized and frantic without information.  To Lilian and Mitzi, the wives of these two extraordinary men, I want to say that you are two of the strongest people I have ever been blessed to meet. You inspire me. Your husbands' fight inspires me and millions of Americans and people across the globe. I urge you to continue to stand and fight on behalf of your husbands and the many others who are held captive by the Chavista government.  I look forward to welcoming Leopoldo and Antonio back to freedom and, I hope, they will play leading roles leading a free Venezuela, a post-Maduro  Members of my own family have lived through this sort of oppression in Cuba, where a lawless government can raid your home without warning, arbitrarily detain your relatives and neighbors, and ensure that you hardly, if ever, see them again.  To Lilian and Mitzi, I will continue to raise my voice and to call for action--real action--to help Leopoldo, Antonio, and every other Venezuelan willing to stand and risk everything to live in a free and prosperous and democratic country. It is well past time to consign Chavismo to the dustbin of history.  To the millions of Venezuelans waiting in lines for food, clothes, and medicine, struggling with galloping inflation, fearful of Maduro's henchmen detaining their friends and families or gunning them down in the streets, and[[Page S4712]]thinking themselves helpless in the face of their country's decay, you are not alone and should not be afraid.  America and our allies will help see you through this crisis and help you recover. Each new outrage from the Maduro regime only makes our solidarity with you grow. You are strong and Maduro is weak. You are Venezuela's future, and Maduro is its past. You will win, and Maduro will lose.  Venezuela is not the private preserve of a ``busdriver turned authoritarian thug in a tracksuit,'' but instead Venezuela is a proud and free nation with a glorious past and an even greater future.  Through its words and deeds, the Maduro regime has abandoned what little legitimacy it might have had. When this regime expires, Venezuela will restore its place at the forefront of Latin America and become a good friend and partner to America once again.  We stand with the Venezuelan people as your friend against this socialist oppression, and we tell you that there are brighter days ahead, brighter days of economic cooperation, of energy growth, of abundance of prosperity, of throwing off the shackles of totalitarianism.

7635,topic-id,3407,"Mr.President, I thank my friend and mentor, a great Illinoisan, Senator Durbin for being here today. I wouldn't be here without his guidance and friendship over the years.  It is truly an honor to stand at this desk, which was once held by another great Illinoisan by the name of Barack Obama, delivering my maiden speech from the floor of the U.Senate to the people of Illinois, the same State that has been represented in Washington by other impressive leaders like Paul Simon and Abraham And it is an honor to address the people of the United States of America, the greatest Nation in the world.  Though we have occasionally made choices as a society that do not reflect our best selves, we are today the greatest Nation on Earth because of the founding ideals that have anchored our Nation and because of the shared values that have guided the development and strength of our economy and our people--values like treating each other equally, showing strength and resilience in the face of hardship, and embracing the diversity that makes us who we are. They are shared values that have helped us to strive toward that more perfect Union the Constitution's Framers envisioned, a more perfect Union that offers everyone a chance to reach his or her potential, a more perfect Union that will not give up on its people, and a more perfect Union whose people don't give up on themselves either.  We face a great deal of challenges and threats, threats I know well, but we cannot allow today's hardships to change who we are as a people, to tear down the pillars that make this Nation great. Falling victim to fear and demagoguery will only ensure a weaker America for our children, and that is simply not the future I want for my  When we, as a society, think about the future we want for all of our children, I think it is important for us to remember how we got here. Our Nation wasn't founded as the dominant global economic and military force that it is today. We were not founded as the leader of the free world; our people built that. Americans understood that when we invest in ourselves, the fabric that holds our country together only grows stronger. A scrappy gang of patriots in the American Revolution--my own family included--won us our liberty, which we used to push for greater civil and human rights and to make investments in agricultural and educational systems that sparked our economy, allowing us to strengthen our military into the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen.  Success, however, was never guaranteed. From our founding, the United States of America was forged through fierce debates and stark divisions. Slavery led to bloodshed across the country, including in the Senate Chamber, and culminated in brothers killing brothers during our Civil Yet our Union made it through our greatest challenges and emerged even stronger. We emerged a more perfect  Our strength has been on display outside of our military as well: When heroes like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman risked everything to help bring an end to slavery; when Martin Luther King, Jr., had a dream; when the children of the Little Rock Nine braved harassment and abuse to bring an end to segregated schools and ensure educational opportunity for all; and when the backbreaking work of Asian and American laborers united our Nation from sea to shining sea with the completion of the transcontinental railroad.  America catalyzed the industrial revolution for the globe. We helped rescue the global community from fascism during World War We promoted civil and human rights around the globe. We explored space, launched the internet revolution, helped feed the world, built a world-class infrastructure network, developed a gold standard education system, and grew the strongest economy ever seen.  We were able to win World War II not because of the brave troops in our Armed Forces alone but also because our Nation's manufacturers and steel mills were able to produce the tanks and planes and firearms and other tools we needed to defeat the We were able to build those weapons, launch the internet revolution, and send a man to the Moon only because we had a well-educated workforce made of people from all around the globe, all of whom had an opportunity to attend world-class colleges and universities right here in the United States, universities we spent generations strengthening.  Our economy was able to grow to its current strength not only because of that well-educated workforce and those who came from distant lands but also all who came and stayed to contribute to our society. It was also able to grow because we had invested heavily in infrastructure and built an interstate system and air and rail networks that enabled our farmers, ranchers, and[[Page S2508]]other producers to get their goods to market inside and outside our country's borders.  We were able to feed the world not only because of our strong agricultural sector and infrastructure alone but also because of the scientific advances supported by those educational institutions that helped increase farm production and yields.  Throughout our history, we pushed to expand human and civil rights from the abolitionists to the suffragettes, learning from people like the Tuskegee Airmen, the Selma marchers, and the LGBTQ leaders today that being inclusive and enabling people to reach their full potential only strengthens the American core. We did all of these things as a result of our shared values, and we have reaped their rewards for generations.  We have seen our Nation's strength in our prouder moments, as when America chose to go to the Moon--not because it was easy but, in President Kennedy's words, because it was hard.  We have seen our strength in tragedy, reuniting under a common cause in the rubble of the Pentagon and Ground Zero on 9/11.  We might get knocked down, but the America that I know, the America that I fought for and love, does not give up. That is not a Democratic principle or a Republican principle; it is simply the American way.  America's greatness has never depended on the strength of any individual person, but on all of us working together toward a common goal. When we have failed to stay true to our core values, when we deny another person our Nation's promise of opportunity, our Nation's strength suffers. When a child can't access the tools to succeed in school, when a woman can't afford basic healthcare, when refugees fleeing terror see the door slammed shut in their face, when we deny civil rights on the basis of skin color or sexual orientation or religion, and when a working family can't put food on the table, our whole Nation suffers. At the end of the day, America's greatness depends on each of us remaining true to the common values of our  But we have lost sight of those values. The Nation that built an interstate highway system, that was a refuge for immigrants who became the foundation of our economy, this Nation that pushed humanity to new heights, first with planes and helicopters and then into space, that same Nation seems to have forgotten how to invest in itself.  Our country that ushered in the era of aviation is now home to aging airports that struggle to compete with their global competitors. Our country that took on the Herculean task of reversing the flow of the Chicago River to protect the city's drinking water can no longer muster the resources to modernize public water systems to prevent our children from being poisoned by lead. Our country that built the greatest military the world has ever seen, sending a signal that we will not cower in front of anyone, now finds itself with leaders who believe in the misguided notion that it is simply better to hide behind walls than to help lead with strength.  Make no mistake, America has not lost her greatness. Our Nation remains the dominant force on the global stage. But if we don't act, if we don't invest in ourselves, our adversaries are positioned to overtake us.  Though some may try to convince us the path forward is less engagement with the world, less acceptance of others, and less investment in ourselves, I know the path forward for our country cannot include--does not include--turning our backs on the shared values that built this  Perhaps more than any other State, Illinois knows this. We represent all the strengths of our Nation, from our dynamic cities to our strong rural and industrial communities and everything in between. We are the realization of the values that have created that robust American economy, bolstered by a strong agricultural community and manufacturing sector, both of which innovate and strengthen our Nation with the help of wise public policy and investments.  Those investments enabled Illinois steelworkers to help us develop our farmland, build our cities, and secure our military strength. American manufacturing built this Nation, but too many of the steel mills we relied on to win World War II have been idled or shuttered completely.  After years of illegal trade practices, like dumping of cheap foreign products and currency manipulation by our competitors, our manufacturing base has been weakened. That hurts not only American jobs but also our Nation's military strength as well as the resilience of our entire economy. We simply need to do a better job of keeping manufacturing jobs within our borders, and we need to make the investments necessary to ensure that we have a workforce trained for our 21st century jobs.  We can do better by Illinois' tens of thousands of farmers as well. These farmers, ranchers, and agricultural workers form the basis of our They all wake up with a purpose, each farm feeding nearly 170 people every year while supporting an industry that is developing cutting-edge biofuels and other technologies.  I have seen firsthand the painful price our Nation pays because of our overreliance on oil imported from our competitors. The simple fact is that American farmers are helping us improve our national security. They are helping to strengthen our Armed Forces and our entire country every day. They are already helping produce billions of gallons of clean fuel for our cars, our factories, and our military, and every single one of those gallons brings us closer to energy independence.  We cannot afford to leave our agricultural sector behind. We should be working to preserve policies like the Renewable Fuel Standard that support agricultural jobs and to open new markets, like Cuba, for their goods.  For generations, our manufacturers and agricultural sectors have relied on a strong infrastructure network, including roads, bridges, waterways, railways, and air transportation, to get their goods to market, both domestically and internationally. Illinois has often led the way. We built the Nation's first elevated electric rail line in the 1800s. But today, far too much of that infrastructure is crumbling. It is in dire need of the investments our society once understood the need for. The down payments previous generations made paid dividends to us all in the form of increased tourism, lower costs, more efficient shipments, easier travel, and so many other benefits.  If we fail to continue the investments past generations have made, we risk falling behind our global competitors, hurting not only our tourism industry but also our manufacturers and our hard-working ranchers, farmers, and producers who will find it harder and more expensive to get their products to market.  If we choose to disregard our infrastructure much longer, we simply will not be able to compete in the 21st century global economy. Improving our infrastructure isn't a partisan issue. It is common sense. It is an economic priority, a defense priority, and a national security imperative. This is something we can all work on together.  I am proud to say that the first bill I proposed after arriving here in the Senate passed unanimously with bipartisan support. It will cut redtape and help streamline efforts to modernize our infrastructure and allow our economy to continue growing for generations to come.  That is also true of supporting our schools, colleges, and universities. We have developed global gold standards for education that enable our manufacturers, agricultural workers, engineers, and brilliant Americans all across every sector to push our economy further.  There is a reason that wealthy elites across the globe--including world leaders from foreign lands--still send their children to be educated on our shores, in world class institutions like the University of Illinois and the University of Our education system is widely recognized as the best in the world. Our teachers and institutions continue to produce some of the best trained and most skilled professionals in every field imaginable--both American and international students. That is a good thing.  But more and more Americans are no longer able to access those same educational opportunities. We have priced too many of our own children out of the market for those colleges and universities that we have developed to ensure our Nation's workforce remains[[Page S2509]]more skilled than our competitors, or we have saddled them with crippling debt. We are failing to make the necessary investments in K-12 public institutions that, regardless of ZIP Code, should be preparing every single one of our children to lead our country into the future.  Quality primary education should not be a privilege only for the wealthy, and it should not depend on rolling the dice on receiving a voucher. In the greatest and wealthiest Nation in the world, a quality education should be a right for every single American child. Our Nation's promise of opportunity should be a reality for every child in America, not just for those whose parents can afford it. We already have some of the world's greatest teachers, the brightest students, and the best facilities within our own borders. All we have to do is ensure they have the resources they need to succeed. That means our kids should not have to worry about going to school hungry or getting the help they need after school or being able to pay for college when they graduate high school.  That is why I focus on commonsense solutions to increase access to educational opportunity, whether by helping to lead the charge to make college more affordable or doing well to ensure the education we are providing people actually helps them find good-paying jobs when they graduate.  In that vein, I am also disheartened by the recent erosion of civil rights protections in our The calls for bigger walls and closed doors are not only bad, costly policies, they run counter to our society's shared value for inclusion over exclusion. Too many of us seem to forget the immigrant roots within our own families. If we lose sight of our Nation's founding principles, as some in Washington would like us to do, we will lose out on the innovations we have seen from immigrants and immigrant families.  If we had rejected immigrants years ago, Apple Computers might never have been founded by the son of a Syrian man. I worry that at a time when we still have so much work to do to make our Union more perfect and to provide truly equal rights for all, under the current administration we are at risk of backtracking on hard-fought progress made by civil rights leaders who bled and even died for the rights of all Americans, regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, income or ZIP Code to have the right to vote, to have equal protection under the law, to have basic worker protections, and for the everyday rights and privileges so many of us take for granted. We still have so much progress left to make if we want the American dream to be accessible to all Americans--equal pay for equal work, a criminal justice system that truly provides justice for all, nationwide leave policies that enable anyone to take time to care for a sick family member or to start a family, a society that is accessible for all disabled Americans and truly equal for all LGBTQ  I worry that we are at risk of going backward instead of forward. Failing to continue our Nation's inclusive nature weakens our global standing as well as the rest of the world begins to look elsewhere for moral leadership. That would be a failure for us and a weakening of our Nation that I will fight to prevent.  Of course, I also know how much our military has contributed to our Nation's greatness throughout our history. We must do a better job of recognizing these contributions, not just by purchasing equipment and technology, though what our skilled workforce has done is the envy of the world, but also by ensuring that we recognize and respect the sacrifices made by our troops, our military families, and our veterans. Servicemembers embody our values of shared sacrifice and perseverance, of loyalty and selfless service, and they each make great sacrifices to protect us.  They deserve from their leaders in Washington a clear sense of mission and strategy, and they deserve to know we fully support them. So, yes, when the drums of war are beating in the White House or in Congress, you can bet I am going to be right here on the floor of the Senate, asking tough questions and making sure our leaders in Washington, especially those who have never worn the uniform, truly consider the true costs of war--not just in dollars and cents but in human lives--in the commitments we are making on behalf of the I will also be here to remind my colleagues that we are all dishonored when any veteran is forced to lay their head down to sleep on the same streets they defended. We must end veterans homelessness. When our troops come home, I will be working to see that the veterans receive the care and support they earned for the sacrifices they have made.  Each of these components of our society contribute to what has made our country great--our military, our values, our infrastructure, our agriculture, our manufacturers, and our world-class educational system. If we fall prey to our fears, to our worst demons, and allow any of these pillars to fall, we will lose our opportunity to remain the leader of the world. We can rebuild the foundation of our Nation's strength and revamp it for the 21st century, but we can't simply rest on our past successes and act like our greatness is guaranteed forever. It isn't. It will take work.  This is deeply personal for me. I wouldn't be here today without the public education that enabled me to serve in our military for more than two decades and allowed me to give back to my Nation, both in and out of uniform.  Our Nation would not be as strong as it is today without the millions of individuals who sacrificed to build it. Our Nation's strength--what truly makes America great--is rooted firmly in our shared sense of sacrifice. It comes from our single parents working multiple jobs just to make sure our kids don't go to school hungry; it comes from the farmer in Illinois waking long before dawn and working long after dusk to help power and feed our Nation; it comes from an immigrant family willing to put everything on the line to give their kids a chance at a better life than their own; it comes from the hard work and compassion, the sacrifice that Americans serving in our country in and out of the military demonstrate every single day.  We can all do a better job of remembering the shared values that have helped to build this Nation, but I want to make one thing clear: America is already great. We shouldn't let anyone tell us otherwise.  We know we still have a lot of work to do as a country, but let us not lose sight of the core values that make our improbable Union possible. We are still the greatest Nation on the face of the Earth, and if anyone has the capacity to overcome the challenges of today, it is this It is the American people.

The first speech given on the floor of the Senate is a memorable occasion for not only my colleague but for the staff, friends, and family who have followed this amazing story of Tammy Duckworth, a U.Senator from She didn't disappoint with this first speech.  If there was ever an inspirational speech speaking to who we are as a nation and what we can be, she encapsulated it in her comments on the floor of the U.It was an aspirational speech, too--a challenge to all of us to do a better job for this Nation, to make it stronger and to represent more effectively the people who have sent us here to serve them.

I thought to myself, this woman has really made history. I think she can even make more history, and she has, being elected to the U.House of Representatives as well as the U.Senate, an opportunity that fewer than 2,000 Americans have had in our Nation's history.  I think back on what she brings to the Senate, and it is something that is special and extraordinary. To come to this Senate after her service in the military is to follow in the path of Senator Bob Dole, a disabled veteran from[[Page S2510]]World War II, who led the Republican side of the aisle; Senator Daniel Inouye, a personal friend to both Senator Duckworth and me, who served in World War II; Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, who served as well; Strom Thurmond, from South Carolina, a Republican; and more recently, Max Cleland, a Vietnam veteran; Bob Kerrey, John Kerry--the list goes on and on, the great people who have served our Nation in the military and then came to serve in the  One of the points she made in that speech was one of the reasons I supported her so wholeheartedly. When we face the most difficult, trying, and challenging votes in a Senate career, the vote to go to war, having the voice of Tammy Duckworth on the floor is a reminder of the real cost of war and how we should avoid it at any cost, if we can, and what we are asking our men and women in America to do if we send them off to war. She will have more credibility, will have more confidence in her judgment, than virtually any colleague on the floor of the U.So she is going to play a special role.  Finally, let me say, in a short period of time serving as a U.Senator from the State of Illinois, she has shown that she is not going to be taking it easy. She has covered our State from one end to the other, most recently during the Easter recess, with town meetings and meetings with all sorts of people across our State, leaving a positive impression of her commitment to public service.  When I saw her and her mom and her little daughter Abigail get on the plane just the other day, yesterday, to come out here, I realized it is a family commitment which includes all of her family and her husband They are committed to this country, they are committed to our great State, and we are fortunate to have her service.

7653,topic-id,1751,"Mr.President, many times over the last 6 months, I have come to the Senate to speak out on issues and to disagree with President It is clear that we have very profound political differences when it comes to the issues that face us, but I come to the floor this morning in an unusual position to express my gratitude to President Trump for a position he has taken, which I think is the right position for  Let me explain. Five years ago, President Barack Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as It enabled approximately 790,000 talented young people to contribute more fully to this country. They are teachers, nurses, engineers, small business owners, and more. DACA, which was an Executive action by President Obama, provides a temporary legal status to immigrant students who arrived in the United States as infants, toddlers, and children. They have to come forward under this Executive action and register with our government. They have to pay a substantial fee for processing. Then they have to submit themselves to a criminal and national security background check. If they are successful, they are given 2 years of temporary relief from deportation.  This program is based on the Dream Act, a bill that I first introduced in the U.Senate 16 years ago--in 2001. That bill would give undocumented students who grew up in this country a chance to become legal and to earn their way to citizenship.  These young people have come to be known as They came to the United States under the age of 16, some of them 1 or 2 years old. They grew up in the United States, going to our public schools, singing the ``Star Spangled Banner,'' pledging allegiance to the only flag they have ever known, the American flag. They are American in every way except for their immigration status. We have already invested in them, as you can tell--invested in their education, bringing them up in American schools. I can't believe it makes any sense for the future of our country to squander their talents by deporting them to countries that many of them have never known.  A recent study by the Center for American Progress finds that ending DACA, President Obama's Executive action, would cost our economy at least $433 billion in gross domestic product over the next 10 years. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that the 1.3 million young people eligible for DACA pay $2 billion each year in State and local taxes.  As I said at the beginning, I have had many differences with President Trump, particularly on the issue of immigration in some of the speeches and statements he has made, but I do appreciate--personally appreciate--that this President has kept the DACA Program in place.  I have spoken directly to President Trump only two times--three times, perhaps. The first two times--one on Inauguration Day--I thanked him for the kind words he had said about Dreamers and the DACA students and those protected by the President's Executive action.  President Trump said to me: Don't worry about those kids.  Well, Mr.President, I continue to worry about those kids. I worry about them now more than ever, not because I have heard any change of heart or reversal from you but because of other circumstances that are bringing this issue to a head. The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, and nine other States have threatened to sue you, Mr.President, unless by September 5 you rescind the memorandum that established DACA by President Obama and announce that your administration will not renew or issue any new DACA permits. This direct, specific threat to the DACA Program has left hundreds of thousands of these Dreamers anxious, concerned, and worried about their future.  Last week I was joined by Senator Chuck Schumer, our Democratic leader, and 40 other Senate Democratic colleagues in writing a letter to President Trump, asking him to order his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, to use all legal options to defend DACA so that these young people can continue to contribute to a country they love.  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle oppose the DACA To them I say: If you don't support DACA, let's immediately pass the bipartisan Dream If you think President Obama went beyond his Presidential authority with this Executive action, then let's take up this matter where it should be taken up, here in the legislative branch of the government in the U. I recently reintroduced the Dream Act with my friend and colleague, Lindsey Graham of South Now that I am in the mood of thanking Republican leaders, including President Trump, let me thank Senator Lindsey Graham, as well as Senator Jeff Flake and Senator Lisa They have stepped forward to join me in cosponsoring this Dream  Our government should give these young people a chance to earn their way to citizenship. They were brought to this country as children. They didn't make the family decision to cross the border. They have been raised in this country. They have created no problems in terms of criminal background.[[Page S4701]]They have gone to our schools. All they are asking for is a chance.  When we introduced the Dream Act a week or so ago, Senator Graham said that the young people who have received DACA should be treated fairly and not have the rug pulled out from under them. Lindsey Graham is right.  Over the years, I have come to the floor nearly 100 times to tell the stories of these Dreamers and to make it personal so that we come to know who they are and why I have taken the time to make this a major part of my service in the These stories put a human face on the DACA Program and on the Dream They show what immigration actually means to our country in real terms.  This is Juan When he was less than 2 years old, Juan was brought to America from He grew up in Dallas, TX, with his parents and brothers. He was an honor student in high school. He graduated and was valedictorian of his class with a 3.9 GPA, a member of the National Honor Society, an active member of the debate team, and in student government.  He was an accomplished student, but he was also a very active community volunteer. Juan helped organize food drives at the local food banks, he cared for children at recreation centers while their parents worked, and he volunteered in soup kitchens.  In his senior year of high school, he applied to his dream school--once my dream school--Georgetown University, and he was accepted. As a college student, Juan has studied international politics, concentrating on security, minoring in the Arabic language. In his first year of college, Juan was elected as a student senator.  In his spare time here in Washington, he mentors disadvantaged high school students so that they can apply successfully for college. His dream one day is to work for our government, to help our country--the country that he calls home--and to make the world a safer place.  Juan sent me a letter, and this is what he said:       Thanks to DACA I can focus on my studies without worrying      that it may all be taken away from me any second. I have      always thought of myself as an American, but it is thanks to      DACA that I can begin to truly feel like one, too. And that      feeling is something I am thankful for every single day.  Juan and other Dreamers have so much to contribute to this country. But without DACA, without a similar protection, Juan could be deported back to Mexico, a country where he hasn't been since he was 2 years old.  Would we be a stronger nation if we lost Juan Martinez--if he were deported? I don't think so. I think the answer is clearly no.  When we introduced the Dream Act last week, Senator Lindsey Graham said: ``The moment of reckoning is coming.''  I would say to the President first: Again, thank you. Thank you for allowing DACA to continue under your administration. Thank you for keeping your word to me and so many others when you said that these young people don't have to worry. But we are reaching a moment, Mr.President, when we have to come together and do something. We need you and you need us so that we can pass important legislation and you can sign it--legislation that will give these young people the protection they deserve, the opportunity they seek, the chance to make America a greater nation.  I know the reality of this issue. I know it from both political sides. I witnessed it for over a decade. I know it is not popular, Mr.President, that you have taken this position, to stand behind the Dreamers and those protected by DACA, but you told me that you thought it was the right thing to do, and I am sure you still feel that way.  Your new Chief of Staff, General Kelly, and I have had many conversations about this, and I believe that he, too, thinks that legislation is necessary to protect these young people. I hope we can come together. I stand ready. Senator Graham stands ready. We have a bipartisan coalition prepared to work with you.  Let's not let this decision be made in a courtroom somewhere far from Let's take on our responsibility, yours as President and ours in the Senate, to address this critical issue that really cries out for justice. This is the time to do it. The concern, anxiety, and stress is higher than ever among these populations of people affected by DACA and the Dream Act and, of course, their families as well. I hope you will join us in creating a legal option that will defend the DACA Program and will work with us in Congress to make the Dream Act the law of the land so that we can say to young people like Juan Martinez and hundreds of thousands of others: Yes, we will give you your chance--give you your chance to prove that you can become a valuable part of America's future, give you a chance to make America a stronger nation. That is all they have asked for, and that is something we, on a bipartisan basis with the President, should give them.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Daines).

7736,topic-id,998,"Mr.President, I was necessarily absent for the votes on the motion to proceed and passage of a joint resolution disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor known as the State Automatic IRAs Rule, H.66.  On vote 119, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the motion to proceed to H.66.  On vote 120, had I been present, I would have voted nay on passage of H.66.  A few weeks ago, after their failed attempt to dismantle our Nation's healthcare system, Republicans launched a full-scaled attack on retirement savings by rolling back an important rule that would have allowed local governments, as well as small businesses, to expand access to a retirement savings plan. Rolling back that rule will make it nearly impossible for working-class families to save for retirement.  Today Republicans voted to roll back a similar rule that allows States, including Illinois, to provide access to a retirement savings account to millions of working American families. Their actions here today are misguided and will hurt, not help, many working class families.  We are facing a crisis. Tens of millions of Americans have very little savings for retirement. Half of households age 55 and older have little to no retirement savings, and some 55 million working Americans, including 1.5 million in Illinois, work for an employer that does not offer a retirement plan.  There was a time when Americans were able to depend on the proverbial ``three-legged stool'' to support them in their retirement: their pension, Social Security, and their personal savings. However, with the decline of pension plans and the inability of working-class Americans to personally save for retirement, that three-legged stool is now a pogo stick. Pensions once provided a promise of security in retirement, but they are becoming a thing of the past. Of those that remain, many are struggling to pay the benefits they promised, creating uncertainty and fear for those who have worked hard their entire lives.  Decades of stagnant wages, increasing income inequality, and job losses from the recession have made it difficult for workers to keep up with everyday costs such as housing and food, let alone save for retirement. Social Security is the only guaranteed source of retirement income most Americans have, and, sadly, this is nowhere near enough. Since there is no simple solution to addressing this crisis, we have to consider every option that will make saving for retirement easier.  In Illinois, 1.5 million workers do not have access to a retirement plan through their employer. These employees are more likely to earn less money and work for a smaller employer. To make it easier for employers to offer access to retirement savings plans and help workers save more easily, States began developing State-based individual retirement accounts or My home State of Illinois, under the leadership of Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, led the way by being the first State in the Nation to create a State-based IRA called the Secure Choice Savings Program, making retirement a financially viable option for Illinois families.  The Secure Choice program allows Illinois businesses that do not offer a retirement plan and have been in business for 2 or more years to either offer their own retirement plan or automatically enroll their employees in the Secure Choice program. Contrary to the false narrative offered by Republicans that this imposes a burden on businesses, businesses in Illinois are largely supportive and the administrative burden is small. This program gives businesses the opportunity to help their employees save for retirement without being subject to additional Federal regulations under ERISA and without being subject to the costs that are preventing them from offering a retirement plan in the first place. Under the program, all employers have to do is share information about the program that is provided by the State with their employees. Employers do not have to find plans or investment vehicles, and employers make no investment decisions. These State programs provides businesses with a no-worries, low-cost way to enable retirement savings.  There are also claims that imply that States will manage these funds like their State pension assets or other State funds. This is simply not true. Funds under the Secure Choice program will not be comingled with other State funds. These funds, which are owned by the employee, will be managed by a private investment company, they will be separate from the State's budget and pension funds, and they cannot be used for any other purpose.  Once an employee is enrolled, 3 percent of their paycheck is automatically deducted and placed into an The employee has complete control over how the money is invested. The employee can take the plan with them should they change jobs and they may choose to opt out at any time.  The Department of Labor's rule under attack gives State and local governments' certainty to develop these programs that make it easier for employers to provide access to retirement savings plans. This rule has allowed the States to step in where the private market has failed. By voting to strike this rule, Republicans have created uncertainty for retirement savings programs that could help the 55 million Americans otherwise without access the means to secure their financial future.  In Illinois, the consequences are great as this will make it unnecessarily difficult for 1.5 million working-class Illinoisans to access one of the only viable means they may have to save for retirement. With the country facing a retirement savings crisis, the last thing we need to do is stymie States' efforts to explore innovative policy solutions.  These resolutions are just the latest chapter in Republicans' assault on working families. I am afraid this story will continue before there is a happy ending in sight. What we should be doing is working together to remove[[Page S2718]]the fear of retirement and give workers the tools they need to retire with dignity. I am willing to do that, and I hope my colleagues will join me.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgS2717.txt,326,ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION,2017.0,3.0,August
7769,topic-id,651,"Mr.President, I have two words for Bill Dauster: Thank you.  Thank you, Bill Dauster, for your brilliant mind and unwearying service to the U.Senate, to the American people, and to America's most noble ideals.  Thank you for your good humor, and thank you for your endless supply of good ideas.  The Senate is going to miss you.  In Steven Spielberg's Movie ``Lincoln,'' with Daniel Day-Lewis, there is a scene in which President Lincoln is talking with Congressman Thaddeus Stephens of Pennsylvania, played by Tommy Lee Jones.[[Page S3203]]  Thaddeus Stephens was one of the most righteous, uncompromising abolitionists in all of American history--and thank goodness for him.  In the movie, he tells President Lincoln that there is no use in appealing to the moral decency of slaveholders and their allies to end slavery and racial discrimination.  The reason, he says, is that ``the inner compass that should direct the soul toward justice has ossified''--become utterly useless--``through tolerating the evil of slavery.''  President Lincoln's reply was so wise. He said, ``A compass, I learnt when I was surveying, . . . it'll point you True North from where you'e standing, but it's got no advice about the swamps and desert and chasm that you'll encounter along the way.''  He went on to say,``If in pursuit of your destination, you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp, what's the use of knowing True North?''  There is a lesson in that story for all of us.  Passing laws in our democracy requires more than passion and more than clever speeches.  Passing laws requires legislative skill. It requires mastery of parliamentary procedure and arcane rules. That is how we avoid the ``swamps and desert and chasms'' that President Lincoln spoke of.  Bill Dauster knows more about the rules of the Senate than probably anyone since Senator Robert That has made him something of a legend in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle.  But what makes him even more admirable is the reason that Bill Dauster has mastered the mechanics of lawmaking.  Bill has worked for a lot of big names in American politics, but it is dignity and justice and fairness for the little guy that has always driven him.  In 30-plus years, he left the Senate only twice, for brief stretches. Once was to be President Bill Clinton's deputy assistant for economic policy during the golden years of a budget surplus. The other time was in 1998 and 1999, to work on the Presidential exploratory committee of Senator Paul  Paul Wellstone used to say: ``I didn't come to the Senate to fight for the They have enough lobbyists. I'm here to fight for the little feller.''  That could be Bill Dauster's motto too.  Bill Dauster has the rare sort of vision in which no one is invisible, no one is so small that they are undeserving of respect.  Bill isn't the only dedicated public servant in his family. His equally brilliant wife, Ellen Weintraub, has served as a commissioner on the Federal Election Commission since 2002.  They are the parents of three grown children, Matthew, Natanya, and  We thank the entire Dauster-Weintraub family for sharing Bill with us.  Somehow, even with the obligations of work and family, Bill has found the time to be something of a Talmudic scholar.  So let me end with this thought, from the ancient Taludic sage, Rabbi Tarfon, who wrote, ``Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Do justly, now. Love mercy, now. Walk humbly, now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it.''  For 30 years, Bill Dauster has helped this Senate pass laws that have made life more just and more merciful for untold multitudes, in America and around the world. Although he is leaving the Senate, I know he wil never abandon that work.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3202.txt,326,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,25.0,August

Their families all have the same request: Remember their sacrifice. By telling the stories of these heroes here on the Senate floor, we honor the request of these Gold Star families.                   Specialist William ``Bill'' Bailey  Today, Mr.President, I honor the life and service of William ``Bill'' Bailey of Bellevue, Now, the name ``William'' comes from old It means ``determined protector''. Bill Bailey lived up to his name. His mother Margaret says he was a born protector. When Bill was very young, he lost his father to a car accident. Margaret recalls how Bill embraced his younger sister Jessy just after her birth. The word came to her at once: protective.  As he grew, Bill naturally looked to protect those outside his family too. Ron Budwig was matched with Bill through the Big Brothers Big Sisters program.  Ron recalled a simple but profound example of Bill looking out for Ron's family. Ron's mother was running late to one of the program's activities, and, meanwhile, the parking lot was filling up. Bill went and stood in a parking space, keeping it open until Ron's mother could come. It was a simple act, but it said a lot.  Bill attended Bellevue East, where the call to protect his country prompted him to enlist in the Nebraska Army National Guard in 1995. After graduating from high school in 1996, he served out his enlistment with distinction.  A few years later, in December 2000, Bill met Deanna, whom everyone calls She was a bank teller at Wells He drove an armored truck. They met through a service window. Now, Bill had left the service in 2001 when his enlistment ended. After 9/11, he felt the call to serve his country again--but first things first. Bill and Dee married in 2004. Dee's children, Cody and Maquala, took immediately to Bill and his children, Catlynn and Logan soon followed.  As you can expect, Bill's protective nature made him a great father. It also made him a great firefighter. Extending his protection beyond his family once again, he joined the Bellevue Volunteer Fire He was a natural fit. Whether there or working as a life flight dispatcher, Bill worked to keep Bellevue safe.  That deep desire to serve his country continued to tug at him. In 2005, Bill reenlisted in the Nebraska Army National Originally assigned to the 600th Transportation Company, he transferred to the 755th Chemical Why the transfer? Because he learned the 755th would soon deploy. In late 2006 it did. Bill Bailey went with it. The 755th Chemical Company was assigned to provide security escorts for truck convoys operating out of the Balad Air Base in Iraq at this time was increasingly unstable. It was dangerous, but Bill's good nature made it bearable.  SGT Timothy Ossowski remembers SPC Bill Bailey fondly: ``When I became his team leader, I thought I had struck the jackpot.'' By 2007, the insurgency in Iraq had erupted to new levels of violence. Increased American forces sought to seek out and destroy the al-Qaida network. Casualties ran high.  Despite the high operations tempo, Bill and Dee communicated almost every day through phone calls or texts. On May 24, they were able to talk by phone. In typical fashion, Bill mentioned he was excited to finish his dull watchtower duty and start a new security escort mission the next day. Bill was also excited for his upcoming leave in June, when the Bailey family planned to celebrate Bill's birthday.  The next day, May 25, 2007, Bill took part in that security escort mission. During it, his vehicle struck an improvised explosive device. Three Nebraska Army National Guard soldiers were wounded, and Bill Bailey was killed.  More than 1,000 people gathered in Bellevue to remember A Patriot Guard of more than 100 flag-flying motorcycles accompanied his funeral procession. Specialist Bailey earned several military awards, including the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Combat Action Bill's brother-in-law, Damian Kuzeppa, summarized Bill's life:       Bill was a wonderful husband, brother, son, father. He      dedicated quite a bit of his life to helping other people. He      was definitely a go-doer. He will definitely be missed.

7665,topic-id,1064,"Madam President, I rise to continue my tribute to Nebraska's heroes and the current generation of men and women who lost their lives defending our freedom in Iraq and Each of these Nebraskans has a special story to tell.                       Corporal Matthew Alexander  Madam President, today, I recall the life and the service of Army CPL Matthew Alexander, a native of Gretna,  Matthew was drawn to the military at a young age. His parents Mel and Monica and brother Marshall described him as always eager to be part of a team. He practiced martial arts, played the piano, and participated in band as a kid. As a member of the Gretna High School band, Matthew helped to organize the uniforms and shoes before concerts to ensure that all of the band members were ready to perform. He helped his band mates play at their best, and his caring and compassionate nature stood out among his classmates.  Matthew and his wife Kara had been friends since childhood. Kara described the teenage Matthew as somebody who could not sit still and who loved to learn. He took a keen interest in history and English classes in high school. He was also comfortable in talking with anyone and often referred to the mothers of his friends as ``Mom.'' Kara recalled how Matthew always had a grin or a smile on his face. Matthew also loved his church youth group, and he embraced his Lord and Savior, Jesus  Matthew always wanted to be a soldier, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks further solidified his desire to defend his country. He enlisted in the Army shortly before graduating from Gretna High School in May of 2004, and he shipped off to basic training that summer.  After he finished training, Matthew attended the Advanced Individual Training to become an infantry soldier. This was the first step toward his dream of joining the Army Special He was assigned to the 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Division, 2nd Infantry Division, and like both of his grandfathers, Corporal Alexander was stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington  When he first arrived, his unit had just returned to Fort Lewis from a deployment. Matthew had to wait until the next deployment cycle to go overseas. He did not like that delay. As a brave soldier, eager to defend his country, Matthew wanted to be in the fight. Several months later, Matthew's unit deployed to Mosul, They assisted with the training of the Iraqi militia.  From the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Mosul has been the center of battle. The fighting escalated in 2006 during the Sunni awakening. During the training of Iraqi forces and while conducting combat patrols, troops in Mosul encountered enemy attacks on a daily basis.  Matthew returned home on leave in February of 2007, and he proposed to They were married 2 weeks later, on February 14, Valentine's Regarding their very short engagement, Kara simply explained that Matthew felt strongly about being married before he returned to combat.  When Matthew returned to Iraq, he learned that his unit had moved to The Battle of Baqubah began in The enemy used hit-and-run tactics to harass Allied forces that were trying to control the city. During April and May, the fighting intensified, and casualties were high. Some likened the fierce fight to the close quarters of the combat of  It was in this heat of battle that CPL Alexander showed heroism and leadership when an IED hit a Bradley Fighting Vehicle on one of his missions. As Matthew's section rushed to the burning Bradley, the other vehicle commander told him to block off the southern approach and prevent the enemy from attacking up the road. While the Bradley continued to burn and take machine gun fire, Matthew acted without further instructions, and he saved lives. He set up his vehicle to prevent the attacking enemy forces from shooting accurate fire into those helping with that rescue operation. For his valor, Matthew received the Army Commendation  One of the members of Matthew's platoon, SSG Mark Grover, remembered Matthew feeling surprised to have been recommended for the honor. He said that he was just doing the right thing to protect his fellow soldiers.  Days before a mission on Sunday, May 6, Matthew called home to talk to his mother Monica and to Tragically, this was the last time he spoke to loved ones. While on the mission, an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle, killing him instantly.  Corporal Alexander was laid to rest on May 18, 2007, in a rural cemetery between Gretna and Elkhorn, Hundreds of Patriot Guard riders led the funeral procession and over 1,500 people filled Gretna High School to say their final goodbyes. Staff Sergeant Grover traveled to Gretna to represent the[[Page S4707]]Third Platoon, nicknamed the ``Gladiators,'' at the service. Grover was riding in the armored vehicle just in front of the one carrying Matthew at the time of the explosion. He said that the entire company loved Matthew and that he was one of the best soldiers in the platoon.  To honor Matthew's life, his family established Matt's Music The charity helps children interested in music but who can't afford an instrument, and they receive one from the local community. As Matthew's father Mel put it, Matthew had two passions: music and the military. However, you didn't need money to join the military.  CPL Matthew Alexander is truly a hero. He served with great compassion and respect.  I join Nebraskans and Americans across our country in saluting his willingness and his family's sacrifice to keep us free, and I am honored to tell his story.  Thank you, Madam  I yield the floor.

We asked him why American citizens were increasingly having their families broken up by deportation. We asked him about the 800,000 young people who signed up for DACA and the hundreds of thousands of long-term residents of the U.who have temporary protected status. He really had no answers.  We know he is on board with Trump's agenda to deport millions and millions of people or he would not have been appointed to his position. But, honestly, he seemed not to understand what his own agency does, the statutory powers he has as Secretary of Homeland Security under current law, or, for that matter, even how Congress works--so naive.  Let me give Members some examples.  Number one, Francisca Lino lives in Chicago, and her husband and six children are U.citizens. For nearly a decade, she stayed out of trouble and reported every year to immigration authorities.  Now people who work for the Secretary decided she must leave the country and leave her American citizen children and her American citizen husband this Why? What changed, Mr.Secretary? Absolutely nothing, except you.  The same goes for Jesus Lara in He has four American citizen children who have lived their entire lives here but their family is being broken up by their own government.  According to the Secretary, the courts are deporting them, not he or his agency. He denied any responsibility and said he can't do anything about it. But we all know the Secretary of Homeland Security has extraordinary powers to spare families from deportation, especially when doing so would not be in our national interest.

I want to join him in thanking our colleague, Brian I am not sure, Brian, that I adopt the sentiments of the majority leader with respect to what Mr.Thomas could and could not do. Apparently he chose not to, and that is good.  But, Brian Cooper, we want to thank you for three and a half decades of service to this House; three and a half decades of service to this House in a role that most people, including Members of this House, would not recognize, but that is critically important to the good management and flow of the people's business through this  As the majority leader referenced, he will continue to root for the Baltimore Orioles because he is from He is a Marylander, and we are very proud of him.

I now will go to the schedule.                              {time}  1200  By law, under the Budget Control Act, a budget is supposed to be brought to this floor on April 15. The majority leader would quickly observe that neither Democrats nor Republicans have always met that deadline. However, we are unusually late in the budget process, in my view, and despite months of promising to return to regular order, we have not yet done so as it relates to the budget, and the budget has not been marked up in committee, Mr. Monday marked the statutory date by which the Appropriations Committee no longer has to wait to bring bills to the floor of the House because the majority has failed to meet its obligation to pass a budget on time.  Now, again, I want to quickly note that both parties have failed to meet that deadline in times past, but I cannot remember us being as late in the session in getting to the appropriations process, because there really has been no direction from the administration as to what their budget priorities should be, would be, other than the so-called ``skinny budget'' that was sent down, which, in my view, almost every Member of Congress thought was a totally unrealistic, unadoptable, and unworthy budget priority document; and if it were to be adopted, the security of the United States, both abroad and at home, would be put at substantial risk.  So, Mr.Majority Leader, can you provide some indication? I know it is not on the floor next week.  And I want to say that I join with the majority leader. The issue of human trafficking is one of the critical issues that confronts us, as a country, and the global community. It puts millions of young women and young men at risk--and not so young men and women at risk--on a daily basis. It is appropriate that we deal with this issue. Hopefully, we will deal with it, as the majority leader said, in a bipartisan fashion and that we will produce more effective ways to stop and to hold accountable those who put human beings at risk by human slavery.  But can the gentleman tell me when the Budget Committee will mark up a budget and when we will have such a budget considered on the floor?  I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  As my friend knows, we do expect to receive the formal budget request from the President next week, which, as my friend also knows, is common for the first year of a new administration.  Now, as the gentleman said, maybe this is later, but this is the latest in the history of America that any President has had to wait for a Cabinet, which is always helpful. He still has many more positions to be filled and confirmed, and as that progresses, I think actions will be able to move forward even faster.  But, as is tradition, the Budget Committee has announced its intention to host OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, as the gentleman knows, a former colleague here, to answer questions Members may have about the President's budget request following its release. This will kick off the regular order process of the committee work on crafting an FY 2018 budget resolution.  Likewise, with appropriations, the committee is looking forward to marking up bills through regular order.

But, as the gentleman knows and I know from experience of serving on the appropriations process, frankly, it was at the beginning of this month, historically, that we would start to mark up appropriation bills, with the intent to use much of June and July for the purposes of passing appropriations bills so that we might send them to the Senate for consideration and have some chance of getting them done prior to the expiration of the fiscal year on September 30.

7711,topic-id,630,"Well, I hope that we do, in fact, get that done.  Now, Mr.Leader, I was shocked yesterday to learn that the process that, from my perspective and our side's perspective, was extraordinarily accelerated, undermining the opportunity for careful and thorough consideration, the bill that is known as the American Health Care Act, or otherwise known as the bill to attempt to repeal the Affordable Care That bill, as the gentleman knows, was introduced on March 6. It had not a single hearing and was marked up less than 2 full days later in the Ways and Means Committee, on March 8. It was marked up on March 8 and 9 in the Energy and Commerce Committee, in the Budget Committee on March 16, in the Rules Committee on March 22, and brought to the floor with a CBO score on March 23. In other words, in my view, Mr.Speaker, it moved so quickly that no one could have given it thoughtful consideration. In fact, Mr.Speaker, on March 24, that bill was brought to the floor, was subjected to some debate, and then was pulled. The judgment was made that, apparently, it was not ready for prime time.  That bill was then brought back to the floor some 2-plus weeks, about 2 weeks later, on Thursday, May 4 of this year. It was passed on a Thursday, notwithstanding the fact it had not been noted for consideration on Thursday at the beginning of the week or in the week prior. It passed on a vote of 217-213, with a significant number of Republicans voting against it and a significant number of Republicans who voted for it saying ``no, I haven't read the bill'' in response to inquiries from the press.  That afternoon, Mr.Speaker, there were buses out in front of the Capitol to take my Republican colleagues down to the White House to cheer its passage, an accomplishment of what our Republican colleagues had pledged for 6 years.  Mr.Speaker, you can imagine my shock, chagrin, and surprise when I learned yesterday that bill has not gone to the Apparently, it has gone from one chair to maybe the other chair in the desks before me. It has been held, Mr.It has been held because there was no CBO score to ensure that, in fact, it complied with the rules.  A lot of talk about regular order, Mr. So the bill that was cheered at the White House and the President saying ``I'm so glad this passed,'' apparently, may not have passed this House in a form that is consistent with the rules. And so, my colleagues, I want you to know that you may think you have passed the bill, but it is still here 2 weeks later.  I am not sure, Mr.Speaker, why we couldn't have waited for a CBO score, other than the political imperative of going home and having Members be able to say, ``We passed the bill.''  Well, it is still here, folks. It is still within the bosom of the House, warmly embraced, aging, unfortunately, not to perfection.  And so, Mr.Speaker, I would ask the majority leader: When might we pass this bill? Is the bill going to have another hearing? Are we going to wait for the CBO score? And will another vote be necessary to, again, confirm the 217-213 votes?  I will not ask you whether or not you think you still have 217 votes, but let me ask you: When might this bill be considered again on this floor?

I don't know why you were shocked. I thought you were going to say you were shocked that that exact same week, when you read the paper, 94 counties out of 99 in Iowa would have no healthcare if ObamaCare continued to go forward. I thought that would have shocked you.  Then, when you wanted to put dates down and talk about hearings, we had more than 113 hearings.

You shouldn't be shocked to know the rules of the House, that you do not move a bill until the CBO score of those eight pages is done. That will be done next week, and we will move it right along.  But let's go on further because I do want history to be written correctly.  We marked up this bill in three separate committees, with over 18 hours of debate in Ways and Means and over 27 hours of debate in Energy and We debated countless amendments in committees, from both Republicans and Democrats, even the ones where the Democrats asked that they change the name to have some hashtag. We spent hours on that, but we did that because we believed that was important to you.  Now, our bill eliminates the many taxes and mandates of It gives patients enhanced tools to take control of their own healthcare decisions, and it expands choice for  So, yes, I am shocked every day I read the paper that more Americans are going to lose their healthcare if ObamaCare stays where it is or that people will even pay more, because I remember the promise the President made that our premiums would go down or we could keep our own doctor, which so many thousands of Americans found out to be a lie.  So, Mr.Speaker, I understand politics. I understand the phrases and the adjectives people can use, but there is no reason to be shocked that we kept our word of what we would do for the last 6 years. There is no reason to be shocked that the American public put a majority in the House and the Senate and the Presidency which, I would argue for the main purpose, that they want greater choice in their healthcare system.  So, yes, if I go to Iowa, I go to Tennessee, those 16 counties there that will no longer have healthcare--or what about Aetna? You didn't even mention them pulling out of You weren't shocked by that either.  But you know what? Eight pages of amendments that stayed out there for everybody to read--not more than 2,000--yes, we will wait until the CBO finishes scoring the amendments and send it to the Yes, we know what is in those amendments, just as everybody else had the opportunity to read them, just as we went through the Rules                              {time}  1215  So there are lots of things to be shocked by, but don't ever be shocked by: We go by the rules of the I[[Page H4377]]think you should be shocked by the number of faces, the number of families that will not have healthcare if we did not act.

7713,topic-id,1482,"Mr.Speaker, we have had a similar conversation before, and the majority leader would love to rely on the hearings that were held before this bill that we passed was introduced. The 113 hearings were on the repeal. This bill, as surely the majority leader knows and Members who voted on it know, was not repealed. It does not repeal.  Now, it is said that the gentleman is correct that the insurance industry has been very badly roiled, and confidence in the marketplace has been very badly undermined by this administration since its first day in office, and badly undermined by the Republicans' continued attempts to repeal, and passage of repeal legislation that didn't become law, and so insurers have, in fact, lost confidence that the marketplace will be stable, an absolutely critical component of pricing their product correctly.  The administration continues, as does the House itself and the Republican leadership in the Senate, to undermine the confidence that there will be a market. So, yes, Mr.Speaker, the majority leader is correct. The insurance market is not as stable. But almost everybody who speaks to that--and there is a Los Angeles Times story today, relatively lengthy on that--in terms of what steps the administration has taken from the very beginning, starting with the IRS, don't worry about the mandate. Don't worry about the fact you have insurance.  It is like the automobile people saying, don't worry about having automobile insurance; there is going to be no penalty. Well, if that was the case, I bet you a lot of people would not have automobile insurance, and if they hit you, you would be exposed to the expense yourself.  Now, Mr.Speaker, the majority leader says he wants to follow the rules. They want to follow regular order, and, of course, they will do that. My, my, my.  Mr.Speaker, on May 4 of this month, why did we not have such a CBO score?  He says we didn't send it because the rule will not allow us unless we have a CBO score.  Frankly, I think there are some additional reasons because they are not sure that they are complying with the Byrd rule in the United States Senate, and they have got to see. So they may have to pass this again, to which the majority leader did not address himself.  But there was no reason not to wait other than politics, other than to have those buses go down to the Capitol and cheer one another. They had no idea what CBO is going to come up with next week. So they did not wait, consistent with the rules. We should have had a score when we passed the bill. But that was not convenient for the politics of repeal.  Now, the majority leader, Mr.Speaker, has not told me when we are going to consider that bill again or if we are going to need to consider that bill again. And perhaps the honest answer is the majority leader does not have that knowledge as to whether he is going to have to bring that bill to the floor again because he is going to need the CBO score to make that determination. I understand that. And we should have waited, Mr.Speaker, not rushed to judgment.  He talks about hearings. There were no hearings on this bill. One reason there were no hearings on these bills is because my Republican colleagues have been having town meetings, and they are hearing about the public's thoughts about their bill. And some of them are not having town meetings because they don't want to hear any more than they wanted to have hearings here in the House to hear what the public thought.  So, Mr.Speaker, I am hoping that the majority leader will be able to, perhaps at some point in time in the relatively near future, give us a clear picture as to when we may either consider this bill again or when we are going to send it to the United States Senate; flawed, though, it may be.  Mr.Speaker, I will be glad to yield to my friend, the majority leader, if he would like to say something further. If not, I will yield back.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I am actually shocked. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but did you actually make the argument that those 94 counties out of 99 in Iowa pulled out just because we were bringing a bill up?  Did you actually believe the 18 out of 23 CO-OPs that were given more than $2 billion pulled out because somehow they knew we would probably capture the White House, too, and keep the Senate and the House? So that is why it failed?  Or maybe those 16 counties in Tennessee that were told almost a year ago that they wouldn't have healthcare the next year; somehow people could look into the future, and just because a Republican took office, that is who we are going to blame?  I know President Bush is no longer here, but do we have to continue to put blame on others instead of having the facts?  So let's talk about a few things. Now, let's be clear of what you asked me earlier because, I apologize, I got off--you had a lot of adjectives out there. I wanted to make sure that I had answered them all. But I am very confident that this bill will hit the mark for reconciliation and it will move across the aisle over to the other  Now, you talk about the House, and you are going to blame us for everything. Let's go to facts. They are not my facts. There is a recent report from Quorum, which is a data analysis company in D.These are bright, young people; a lot of them are Stanford grads. Here are the facts, because they just went and analyzed the first 100 days:  In the first 100 days, President Trump signed 30 pieces of legislation into law. Now, that is more than President Obama, Bush, Clinton, or H.Bush signed in their first 100 days.  Only once before in history has a Congressional Review Act been signed into law, only one. Now we have 14 overturned regulations through the Congressional Review Act, saving Americans $3.7 billion in regulatory cost, and 4.2 million hours in filling out paperwork.  Now, my favorite quote of this report, this House, the one we stand in today, passed 103 bills out of this Chamber, edging out former Speaker Pelosi's House as the most productive during the first 100 days of a Presidency since H. Now, just this week we passed the Modernizing Government Technology Act, and I do thank my friend for his hard work on this. It is going to upgrade government IT to better serve our constituents. So if we are shocked, maybe that shocked you. Maybe we ought to stop playing politics. Maybe we ought to stop blaming things that just aren't even there. Maybe we ought to just take responsibility for where we currently are, understand that this is the greatest Nation on the face of the Earth, and it was ``. . . conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.''  No, we are not going to blame others for our problems. And if you want to go along that line, I can go into all of the things that were promised in the more than 2,000 pages of  But you know what?  Today I live currently, and what I currently see is that 18 of the 23 CO-OPs have collapsed. And the current law says we are going to penalize the people who actually paid the CO-OPs to get their healthcare, but they have no healthcare to get.  I want to read the facts where more Americans took the penalty or the exemption than actually signed up for ObamaCare; that prior to a bill even passing on this floor--something we promised for 6 years--that a number of companies pulled out because it was not working. But the biggest shock I had all week is that somehow it is our fault.  I could not look an American in the eye knowing the knowledge that we all have. I don't care what party you are in; you don't sit on a carpet that has red on one side and blue on the other. This is the American You know people are hurting. You know people have lost their doctors. You know they are pulling out of these counties. Don't make up some political spin to make yourself feel better for some vote.  We promised we would repeal ObamaCare and give people greater choice. That is what we did. You disagree with it, then disagree with it, but don't lay blame where it is not true.[[Page H4378]]  Mr.Speaker, I yield back.  ",CREC-2017-05-19-pt1-PgH4375.txt,566,VOTE EXPLANATION,2017.0,19.0,May
7714,topic-id,623,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I listened to his comments with interest. I want to touch on a number of comments he made, however.  First of all, in a very partisan vote from 3 a.m. in the morning until 6 a.m. in the morning, my Republican colleagues passed a bill in a partisan fashion--there were a few Democrats; not many--that passed part D prescription drugs for seniors.  We voted against that. And then we took the majority. And what did we do, Mr.Speaker? We acted in a way to ensure that the part D prescription drug package that the Republicans had passed in the previous Congress did, in fact, work; and it is a success today because we did that.  That is exactly the opposite of what our Republican colleagues did, Mr.Speaker, with respect to the Affordable Care In fact, the Affordable Care Act, as my friend knows and polling now shows that over 55 percent of Americans believe that the Affordable Care Act ought to be kept; and 75 percent of them, three out of four Americans, believe we ought to fix the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it.  That has not changed, however, the Republicans' attempt and rhetoric to repeal. Now, there were a number of things that the Republicans did, contrary to what we did with respect to the prescription drug bill for seniors, to undermine and create this situation of which the majority leader speaks where there are some insurance companies that have pulled out, that are not doing as well as they should have and we wanted them to have.  One thing, many Republican Governors refuse to join the Medicaid expansion program, adversely affecting millions of  Secondly, they did not find the risk corridors. We knew when we established this problem that there was going to be a very tough time in making valid judgments on what costs were going to be two years into this program. We did not fund it. The CO-OPs also did not receive the support that was contemplated by the statute.  The cost-sharing subsidies the administration has put at risk. Now, we were assured just before the bill passed that: Oh, no, we are going to pay for the cost-sharing subsidies.  But the Republicans, Mr.Speaker, filed suit, and the court said: Oh, no, you have to appropriate those moneys on the cost-sharing subsidies.  The majority leader knows--certainly everybody on the Energy and Commerce knows, and every Member ought to know--without those subsidies, the insurance companies will have mispriced their product, for deductibles and copays, in particular.                              {time}  1230  That, Mr.Speaker, is what I speak of, in terms of the actions that have been taken over the last 6 years to undermine the confidence of the marketplace. Everybody knows that confidence is an important factor in any marketplace.  I am sure we are going to debate this again. Mr.Speaker, again, I would simply ask: Is this bill coming back to the House? Will we expect another vote on it?  The CBO report is due next week. I believe that if, in fact, we are going to schedule that, we ought to at least be given notice that that either is or may be a piece of legislation that will be on the floor next week, prior to our break for Memorial  I yield to my friend.

7643,topic-id,1328,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss my bill, the Reforming Finance for Local Economies Act, which I introduced earlier this week. This bill is very simple and straightforward. It would exempt community banks and credit unions with assets of less than $10 billion from complying with the loan-killing, anti-jobs disaster that we commonly refer to as Dodd-Every reasonable person with a passing knowledge of our banking system knows the destabilizing effect that Dodd-Frank has had on local economies, community banks, and the Nation's credit unions.  Just last week, President Trump turned to the problems wrought by Dodd-Frank by signing two Presidential memorandums to take a look at the Orderly Liquidation Authority and the systemic risk designation process at the Financial Stability Oversight I applaud the President's efforts in that regard. I believe they are desperately needed. Reforming this flawed law is crucial to the future success of the American economy.  Some of my colleagues were here when Dodd-Frank was passed in 2010. As we all know, it was intended to prevent another 2008-like banking crisis by strengthening Federal Government regulation of financial services. But in the process, as so often happens, Congress actually crippled America's small community banks and credit unions that played absolutely no role--none, zero, nada--in instigating the 2008 meltdown. And that is not just my opinion. Our Federal Reserve Chair, Janet Yellen, appeared before the Senate Banking Committee earlier this year--actually, February 14. When it was my turn to ask her questions, I asked her the following simple question: ``What did community banks do wrong in 2008?''  This was the Chairwoman's answer: ``Well, community banks were not the reason for the financial crisis. It was larger institutions that took risks and risks that developed outside the banking system.''  Let me read that first sentence again. Chair Yellen: ``Well, community banks were not the reason for the financial crisis.''  I believe she is right. The fact is that our smaller banks and our credit unions are smothering under the weight of Dodd-I will give you an example of what I am talking about. The Truth in Lending Act passed by Congress is actually 22 pages long. The Federal Reserve Act, setting up our Federal Reserve System, is 32 pages long. Glass-Steagall, about which we heard a great deal, was 37 pages long. Dodd-Frank is a breathtaking 2,300 pages with 22,000 pages of regulations. You can stand on the thing and paint the ceiling.  That is why so many community banks no longer exist. Those that have managed to survive have seen their costs go up, their profits go down, and their ability to make small business and consumer loans curtailed--all as a result of the unnecessary, heavy hand of government. In fact, since Dodd-Frank was passed in 2010, this country has lost 1,700 small institutions. The reason is very simple. Dodd-Frank has forced community banks and credit unions to merge, consolidate, or to go out of business because of the heavy hand of regulation and because they can't make the loans that they normally would be able to make.  Nationwide, we have been losing an average of one community bank or credit union a day--every single day--since Dodd-Frank was passed because of its costs, which have driven our banks to sell or merge with larger banks. It is so ironic that this forced consolidation--forcing our smaller banks and credit unions to either merge with or be bought out by larger institutions--has caused even greater concentration of assets on the books of even larger and, in some cases, too-big-to-fail banks that Dodd-Frank was supposed to do something about.  My legislation will help 5,785 American credit unions. It will help 5,461 community banks in our country survive. Specifically, financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion--if you are a financial institution and you have less than $10 billion in assets, you will be exempt completely from Dodd-Frank, its 2,300 pages and its 22,000 pages of regulations. We are talking about a lot of banks.  Banks with less than $10 billion in assets make up 92 percent of our Nation's banks, according to the Banks with less than $10 billion in assets provide 48 percent of all small business loans, 16 percent of residential mortgages, 44 percent of lending to purchase farmland, 43 percent of lending for farm operations, and 35 percent of commercial real estate loans. If my bill passes, these institutions will no longer have to reduce their products and service offerings in order to divert resources to compliance, to interpretation, and to execution.  The expertise of our smaller banks and credit unions in America in evaluating risk will no longer be reduced to some algorithm--some mathematical exercise. Instead, our institutions will be able to deliver the desperately needed capital to the customers they know so well because that is what community banks and credit unions do. They take in local deposits, and they make loans to local borrowers whom they know and whose creditworthiness they can closely monitor because community bankers, as we all know, are relationship bankers. They don't participate in widespread subprime lending. They don't use derivatives to speculate, and they never did. Most of them have fewer than 100 employees.  The type of regulation they need--and I am not suggesting they don't need regulation. What I am suggesting is the type of regulation they need--because of the risks our small institutions take--is much different than the[[Page S2516]]regulation needed by a $700 billion or a trillion-dollar bank.  I am certain that the proponents of Dodd-Frank were well-intentioned when they wrote and passed it. But 150 years ago, doctors used to bleed their patients with the best of intentions. They stopped doing that because their patients died. That is why I suggest today that we eliminate Dodd-Frank for our smaller institutions. Making Dodd-Frank applicable to community banks and credit unions is a lot like using a sledgehammer to go after a gnat. It is way over the top.  Now, certainly our smaller institutions need regulation. Certainly, they need regulation to ensure that they are stable and secure. Our small institutions know that. They know they need it. They want it. They welcome it. But even after my bill becomes law, community banks are still going to be subject to a strict regulatory scheme established by dozens of applicable Federal statutes. I am talking about the Banking Secrecy Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and I could go on and on.  All of these statutes will still apply to our smaller banks and credit unions. Our smaller banks and credit unions--now exempt, if my bill passes, from Dodd-Frank--will still be under the supervision of the Federal They will still be under the supervision of the Comptroller of the They will still be regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and even the Department of  America's smaller lending institutions need some relief. What they need is relief from the destabilizing consequences of Dodd-The Reforming Finance for Local Economies Act, in my estimation, is a step in that direction. I would also like to say, in closing, that I am pleased that both President Trump and Senate Republicans are committed, as we are, to paving the way for new businesses and the jobs they create through regulatory reform as our actions have already proven this year.  However, I would also like to stress that helping our community banks and credit unions is a bipartisan issue and one that I hope will garner support from many of my colleagues, not only just on the Republican side of my aisle but by friends on the Democratic side of the aisle.  I welcome their support. I look forward to working with my fellow Senators on the Banking Committee to find some commonsense solutions that will help grow our local economies.  I yield the floor.

7640,topic-id,1007,"Mr.President, Rod Rosenstein's nomination to be Deputy Attorney General comes at a unique moment in history and critical juncture for the Department of Justice, as well as for this country. It has been 44 years since the Senate considered a Justice Department nominee who will be in charge of an active criminal investigation into a sitting President's[[Page S2513]]campaign and administration. Since the Judiciary Committee reported Mr.Rosenstein's nomination to the Senate earlier this month, further press reports underscore how important it is that we have an independent and impartial investigation into Russian interference in our elections and connections with the Trump campaign and administration.  In just the past 3 weeks, we learned that a notable Trump campaign adviser was reportedly the subject of a FISA warrant. CNN reported that this adviser was among those who ``Russian operatives tried to use . . . to infiltrate the Trump campaign.'' The AP reported that Paul Manafort, who worked for free as the Trump campaign chairman, previously received at least $1.2 million for consulting work on behalf of a Ukrainian ally of Russian President That is in addition to reports that Mr.Manafort earned $10 million per year for secret work on behalf of Vladimir We learned that President Trump's first National Security Advisor ``failed to list payments from Russia-linked entities'' on his financial disclosure forms. We also learned that the President's son-in-law and top adviser failed to disclose meetings with the Russian Ambassador and other officials on his application to obtain top secret security clearance--just like when the Attorney General provided false testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to questions from me and Senator Franken about his own Russian contacts.  If confirmed, Mr.Rosenstein will assume leadership of the sprawling investigation into Russia's multifaceted attempts to interfere with our elections, an investigation that embroils not only individuals in the Trump campaign, but also those who are now in the President's Cabinet and senior officials in the White Attorney General Sessions was forced to recuse himself from this investigation after the press revealed that he had misled the Judiciary Committee and the American people about his connections to Russian officials and agents. There is no question that the Attorney General's recusal was required--and should have happened on day 1 after assuming office. Justice Department regulations required him to recuse himself because of the integral role that then-Senator Sessions played in the Trump campaign and his continuing contacts with those directly under investigation. These Department of Justice regulations protect the impartiality of all Justice Department investigations.  The Justice Department's regulations regarding appointment of a special counsel are equally significant. These regulations direct appointment of a special counsel when there is ``a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances'' and ``it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.'' The current situation unquestionably meets that standard. Mr.Rosenstein acknowledged at his confirmation hearing that it would be an unusual challenge to lead an investigation that potentially includes the Attorney General, his direct supervisor. This investigation now not only includes Mr.Rosenstein's potential boss, but also several others inside the White Americans deserve an investigation that is independent and inspires public confidence, and that requires appointment of a special counsel who is free from political influence. This issue is too important for us to skew for partisan motivations. Country must come before party, and I hope and trust Mr.Rosenstein will understand that if he is confirmed.  We know that this administration and this President have already interfered with the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian activity and connections to the Trump campaign. Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, recused himself from his own committee's investigation after what Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker called a ``coordinated effort between the Trump Administration and [Chairman] Nunes . . . to manufacture a fake scandal'' in order to distract from, as well as obstruct, any real investigation. Earlier this month, President Trump even said that ``it's not too late'' to fire FBI Director This administration cannot be trusted to respect the independence of any investigation, which is why we need an outside special counsel. Whoever assumes the role of Deputy Attorney General in this administration will face extraordinary tests of integrity. Mr.Rosenstein has a reputation for integrity that is unusual for this administration's nominees, and I hope he is up to the challenge.  We already know from the intelligence community's public report that Russian President Putin waged a multifaceted influence campaign to delegitimize Secretary Clinton and help Donald Trump win the Worse, he intended to undermine public faith in our democratic process. This interference did not end on November 8th. It is ongoing and, according to the intelligence community, President Putin will continue using cyberattacks and propaganda campaigns to undermine our future elections--but there is still much we do not know.  We need a thorough, independent investigation. President Putin's goal last year was to undermine our democratic institutions--to corrode Americans' trust and faith in our government. If we do not get to the bottom of Russian interference, he will have been successful, and he will no doubt do it again. I hope that Mr.Rosenstein will do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to lead a truly independent investigation--one in which all Americans can have confidence.  If confirmed, Mr.Rosenstein will face other critical tests as well, including whether he will continue to support the Justice Department's Smart on Crime initiative, focusing the most serious criminal penalties on the most serious offenders. With his 27 years of experience in the Justice Department, I hope that Mr.Rosenstein will be an independent check on the excesses of this administration, which has already sought to undermine the principle of judicial review. He has served as U.Attorney under both Democratic and Republican administrations, so I hope that, as Deputy Attorney General and as Acting Attorney General in matters relating to the Trump campaign, he will remember that he is not the President's attorney, but the people's attorney.

On the back of it, it has a picture of a memorial that shows a pair of boots and a rifle and a hat and ``never forget.''  The Tribute to Fallen Soldiers is about never forgetting our fallen soldiers. We put them into situations of enormous stress and challenge and danger, and they are there for all of us. In those particular situations, time and again, one of our soldiers loses their life. So may we never forget our soldiers who have died, our soldiers who have been wounded, and may we continue to reach out to Gold Star families to provide a community of support to them.  I completely respect and appreciate the Tribute to Fallen Soldiers' motorcycle brigade that rides across the country visiting with Gold Star families, making sure they have that community of support and making sure they know that the sacrifices of their son or daughter are not forgotten.                        Transgender Military Ban  Mr.President, while focusing on the military, I want to shift to another aspect of military service, and I am going to start by thinking about the foundation of our country, our ``we the people'' ``We the People'' are the first three words of our Constitution, the mission statement of our We are not a nation that is founded of, by, and for the powerful, not a nation founded to govern of, by, and for the privileged, but for the people. It was a very deliberate strategy of our Founders not to repeat the type of structure in America that they saw in Europe, where government became beholden and in servitude to simply the powerful class.  Throughout our history, we have strived to live up to this vision of a nation where every individual has the opportunity to thrive. Time after time, we have broken down barriers, we have overcome discrimination, and we have thrown open the doors of opportunity for one group after another--for women, for Africa Americans, for indigenous peoples, for immigrants, for the disabled.  Freedom, said President Lyndon Baines Johnson, ``is the right to be treated, in every part of our national life, as a person equal in dignity and promise to all others.'' So we strive to reach that perspective, that point where our vision of the pursuit of happiness embraces freedom as Lyndon Baines Johnson described it--``the right to be treated, in every part of our national life, as a person equal in dignity and promise to all others.'' It has not been easy.  It was Martin Luther King who saw how challenging it was to progress toward that vision, and he noted that ``human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. . . . Every step towards the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.'' And it is with that tireless exertion, that passionate concern, that dedication, that we have made progress time and time again.  But last week, we did not make progress. Last week, we fell back from this vision of opportunity, the freedom to engage in our national life with the respect and promise accorded to all others. This step back came in the form of an attack by President Trump and Attorney General Sessions on our LGBTQ President Trump announced a ban on transgender Americans serving in the military, and Attorney General Sessions filed an amicus brief in Zarda v. Altitude Express arguing that discrimination is completely legal under the law, including the 1964 Civil Rights  Well, let's talk for a moment about our members of the military who have joined a Volunteer military, who have gone through significant training--and I am not just referring to boot camp but the ongoing training in specialty after specialty--so they can operate that radar effectively that provides warning to an entire ship, or that communication device to make sure that patrol is where it is supposed to be and able to follow instructions in the field, or any of the hundreds of specialties within the military that these individuals step forward and gain training on. Each one of them is significant to the overall success of the entire unit. Well, that is something President Trump didn't understand last week when he attacked and said that he is going to throw our transgender individuals out of the military.  What is important isn't whether you are gay or lesbian or transgender, it is whether you serve with your heart and soul and sinew the purpose of the security of the United States, and those individuals who do are respected within their units. They contribute to those units. The lives of each member depend on the success of the other team members. They are a team. And to reach in, in a cavalier fashion, as the President did, and say ``I am going to rip thousands of these team members out of their units'' is wrong in so many ways. It is disrespectful, of course, of those individuals and their dedicated service to our It is disrespectful and damaging to the units in which they serve and provide those various skills which they have worked so hard to acquire and which we have worked so hard to make sure they have the chance to acquire. And it certainly damages the security of the United States of America to eject individuals with those talents and that training from our military. Therefore, that should be reversed.[[Page S4708]]  By the way, it was done without consultation with our military leaders. A Commander in Chief proposing a policy through a tweet without consulting with the experts who have dedicated their lives to the national security of our Nation--that in and of itself is a real betrayal of responsibility.  Attorney General Sessions filed an amicus brief in Zarda v. Altitude Express, and this brief says that title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which provides protection against discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, does not provide protection against discrimination in terms of one's LGBT status. By the way, that is the opposite of what court after court has ruled.  What happened, one might ask, to the President Trump who, as Candidate Trump, said: ``Thank you to the LGBT community!'' As a candidate, he said: ``I will fight for you.'' What happened to the President who, after the attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, said in a tweet: ``Will fight for you.'' This last week, the President did not fight for you in that community; instead, he attacked that community, and he apparently approved of Attorney General Sessions attacking that community.  This is why we need the Equality The Equality Act would clarify that when we say no discrimination on the basis of sex, that is broadly applying to one's status of who they are or whom they love.  If we go back to President Johnson's presentation of the issue in America, where he said every individual--the matter of freedom is that you have the opportunity to be treated as having the same promise and be treated with the same respect as everyone else, that it is all about being able to thrive in the United States, or to put it quite simply, not having a door slammed in your face when you go to rent an apartment, not having a door slammed in your face when you go to a restaurant or a movie theater, not having a door slammed in your face when you seek to be part of a jury. That is what freedom is in this country. That is the freedom that Attorney General Sessions and President Trump are seeking to rip away from a sizable share of Americans, and that is simply wrong. That is why we need the Equality Act--to make sure that this is remedied. That is why we need the courts to stand up against discrimination on the basis of who you are and whom you love.  It has been a week in which the President attacked and damaged our military and Attorney General Sessions attacked and betrayed and attempted to steal freedom from a vast swath of That is a very sad week on both counts, and we in this Chamber should stand up and say: That is not We will fight for the security of the United States of America, and we will fight for opportunity for every single  Thank you, Mr. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cotton).

We are in a bind right now, finishing fiscal business that should have been completed last year, long before I came to  At this moment, the choice is stark and binary: We can vote to shut the government down, or we can vote for this massive funding bill. Neither is a good option, but shutting down the government is reckless. It would stall military pay and send a sign of weakness to the world. At a time when North Korea is becoming increasingly aggressive, Europe is unstable, and Russia is posturing, we cannot afford to shut down.  I have always said, and I believe, that effective leadership needs to say what you mean and do what you say. If I voted ``no'' on this legislation, it would be disingenuous because I know a shutdown would be disastrous. This is a hard vote to take, but it is unavoidable at this point.  We must continue to pay our troops and other uniformed personnel. We must fund critical programs included in this omnibus. Certainly, the legislation is not perfect and doesn't accomplish everything I want as a conservative, but it does achieve some objectives. It cuts 150 Federal programs. It reduces the EPA bureaucracy to the lowest level since 1989.  The legislation also funds critical programs Republicans have been fighting for: It strengthens our military with an increase in defense spending, enabling the purchase of new warships, aircraft, and weapons. It provides a meaningful increase in salary to our uniform personnel. It provides additional funds to thwart the global war on terror and fight  It is part of an overall $1.52 billion increase in resources for border security, meaning more agents, enhanced technology, updated infrastructure to stem the flow of illegal aliens and drug activity across our border. It includes funds to fight the opioid epidemic, funding grants, treatment, and prevention efforts. It also provides increased funds for the National Institutes of Health to continue disease research that impacts every family.  For Michigan, important programs such as the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative are fully funded. It appropriates $5.6 million to study the potential invasion of Asian carp into the Great  While there are beneficial components in this omnibus, I want to underscore that using an omnibus is not how this body should function.

Given that, it is unsurprising we find ourselves making this unfortunate choice yet again.  Madam Speaker, I stand here to say we can do better; we must do better. I urge this body to come together to address the shortcomings in our appropriations process and develop better solutions for the future.

7778,topic-id,2241,"Mr.President, I am on the floor today to talk about the CRA resolution pending before the Senate today.  I really can't keep track of when my colleagues on the Republican side are for State innovation and when they are against State innovation.  When it comes to Medicaid, the Republicans seem to be very willing to hand a bunch of money over to the States, no strings attached, and let them figure out what to do with it. That is the essence of the bill that cuts $800 billion from Medicaid that is pending before the House of Representatives today. When it comes to retirement, right now we are engaged in a debate that would rip away from States the ability to innovate on behalf of their constituents to try to get them access to retirement savings.  I can't figure out when my Republican friends want States to innovate and when they want to take away from States the ability to deliver results to their constituents.  Let's be honest. We have a retirement crisis in this country right now. The majority of Americans barely have enough money saved to last 2 or 3 years after they retire. Everybody knows this. And the people who are affected by this retirement crisis aren't exclusively They aren't exclusively They aren't just liberals. They aren't just conservatives. No matter where you live, today you are more likely than not to not have enough money in order to retire. So States have figured this out. My State is one of them.  Many States have recognized that one of the biggest barriers to retirement savings today is the fact that if you work for a small employer, you probably don't have an employer-sponsored retirement plan. In fact, there are over 50 million Americans today who do not have, through their employer, a retirement plan available to them.  Why is that a big deal? Well, it is a big deal because that is the most likely way you save today. In fact, for those 50 million Americans who don't have access to retirement through their employer, only 5 percent of them are going outside of their employer to set up a retirement plan. There are a variety of reasons for that. Sometimes,[[Page S2691]]people who are working for a company that doesn't offer retirement are making such a small amount of money, they simply don't have the means to save, but many more simply look at the private retirement savings industry as so convoluted and confusing, so opaque, that they don't even attempt to intersect with it.  So we know we have a problem on our hands. We know there are all these Americans who cannot get retirement through their employer, largely because they work for small employers. We know that if you don't get your retirement through your employer, you are unlikely to go out and get it on your own.  Employers would love to do more for their employees. This isn't about employers not wanting to provide a retirement plan for their employees. The problem is that for an employer who only has 3 or 4 or 5 or 10 or 15 employees, it is prohibitively expensive to provide a retirement plan.  A recent op-ed from an Oregon business owner showed that for him, it would cost about $1,100 per employee just in fees to establish a retirement plan. That is not even counting any possible contribution the employer would make. So you can see that for a small restaurant owner or a small retail grocer, they are not likely to provide a retirement plan to their six employees when it costs them $1,000 per employee to do it. Their employees are on their own. Again, very few of them are actually going and setting up their own retirement.  Why does this matter to us? Well, it matters to us first because I think we have a policy obligation to try to help people save for retirement, but it also matters to us here in Washington because to the extent people don't have retirement, they are going to be more likely dependent on the programs that are already busting our budget, like Social Security and Medicare and If you don't have any retirement savings, then you are going to go on Medicaid much earlier, meaning the Federal expenditure that we are all on the hook for, and all of our constituent taxpayers are on the hook for, starts getting spent earlier. So, just as a matter of fiscal prudence, we should be helping people pile up private retirement savings because it will result in less liability for public retirement programs. Yet we are not doing that.  We talk a lot about trying to help people save for retirement, but we are not passing any groundbreaking legislation that helps Americans to save for retirement. Senator Isakson and I have this small little bill that says on your retirement statement it should just tell you that if you continue to save at a current amount--this is for people who have employer-sponsored plans--this is how much you will get per year when you retire, just so there is some transparency, so that people can look at the amount they are putting away and be able to clearly and easily understand whether that is going to actually be able to pay for their expenses when they retire. We can't even get that piece of legislation passed through the That is just a transparency provision.  Let's be honest. The industry is not providing answers either. The industry has had decades to try to figure out how to be more relevant for individuals who don't have an employer-sponsored plan. That number is still at 5 percent. So the industry, maybe hamstrung by Federal rules or State rules, has not been able to fill this void.  So we have this massive number of people who don't have anywhere near the money necessary to retire. The Federal Government is not providing any answers and private industry is not providing enough answers, so States have begun to pick up the ball.  Here is what States are doing. I think there are about 12 States that have either adopted this kind of program that I am about to describe or are in the process of adopting it. States like Connecticut have said: Here is what we are going to do. For employees who don't have an employer-sponsored plan, we are going to allow for those employees to enroll in a private retirement plan, with the State as the conduit.  If the employer can't do it because the fees are too much, then we will give those employees the option to enroll in a private retirement plan, have a portion of their earnings withheld with the State as the conduit. States are deciding to do this. It is supported by constituents across the ideological spectrum. I looked at a survey the other day that said that amongst self-identified conservative voters, three-quarters of them wanted States to be able to have the ability to set up these conduit accounts for people who don't have retirement through their employer. Connecticut has done this; a handful of other States have done it.  The Federal Government needed to clarify, through regulation, how ERISA rules would apply to these State innovations. Why? Well, because ERISA is really designed to regulate the relationship between an employer and the plan they sponsor and the employee. But in the case of these State-backed retirement plans, there is no traditional employee-employer relationship between the person who is enrolled in the plan and the State of Connecticut, in this instance, which is providing the access to the private plan. So a regulation was proffered by the Obama administration that clarified that ERISA rules will not apply to these plans in the same way they apply to the traditional employer-sponsored retirement plans.  ERISA is just a mismatch for this State-based innovation. It seems like a pretty routine regulatory function--the Federal Government clarifying how ERISA rules should apply to those State-based innovations. Nobody had a problem with this, except for the big retirement companies--except for the big Wall Street companies that invented, in their minds, that they would be losing business to these State innovations whereby individuals would get enrolled in private accounts through a State-endorsed conduit.  There are two problems with that. First, the States are not running these retirement plans. All the State is doing is providing access for individuals to a privately run fund. Second, it is not taking any business away from these retirement plans because these people were not going to private retirement plans in the first place. Only 5 percent of people who did not have retirement through their employer were finding a way to a privately run plan themselves. So there was no risk that Wall Street or these big retirement funds were going to lose business.  We don't need to do this just because the big retirement companies have imagined in their minds that they are not going to have access to a set of business that they were not offering in a way that was relevant or cost-effective.  You know, Republicans are either for State-based innovation or they are not. You can't be for State-based innovation when it aligns with a special interest, and then be against it when it misaligns with a special interest. States are innovating to solve a problem that we are not solving. Connecticut--we are representative of other States that have done this.  The consequences of what we are about to do are real. You are talking about 600,000 people in my State who had access to retirement savings who will have it ripped away from them if this CRA passes. That is real. When you combine all of the States together that have passed these innovative retirement plan programs, the number is 12 million.  If your State does not want to do it, they don't have to. If Arkansas does not want to do it or Wyoming does not want to do it, if Tennessee does not want to do it, they don't have to. But why take away from the people of Connecticut the ability to set up a way for employees of very small businesses to save for retirement? Why do you care what we do in Connecticut if that is what my constituents want? Is it just because the big retirement companies told you that they were going to lose business? That is not true. But even if it is, it should be up to the people of Connecticut as to whether we innovate in a way to try to provide more retirement savings to the people of our It does not hurt Republican Members if Connecticut does it or California does it.  It feels as if we are scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to these It feels as if we are going out and asking every special interest group whether they have any remaining problems, minor as they may be, with regulations that were passed at the end of the administration and opening the floor to any and all.[[Page S2692]]  I know there are Republicans who are going to vote no. I know there are some Republicans who have a deep problem with the fact that the Congress is taking away from States the ability to innovate on the question of retirement.  I hope there are enough that this CRA goes down because the consequences to many of our States will be big. Frankly, it will chill any State's interest in trying to solve this problem because you are telegraphing that anytime a State tries to step in and deliver more access to retirement, if it slightly rubs the big retirement companies the wrong way, you are going to step in and take that power away from them. So why would a State step in ever again to try to do something for people who need access to retirement?  If my Republican friends are coming to this floor with a really sound plan to replace the plan that we developed in Connecticut--if Republicans said: Do you know what? I don't think that it makes sense to do this in a patchwork way, this State innovating this way, this State innovating that way; we are going to come in and pass a really comprehensive approach to giving people who work for small companies access to retirement. That is a reasonable conversation to have, but you are not.  Republicans are not offering the people of my State any alternative. All they are doing is robbing from 12 million Americans the ability to get access to retirement. This is a crisis. If we are not going to deal with it and the industry is not going to deal with it, let States deal with it.  This is a terrible, terrible thing that we are doing later today. I think it is going to be a really close vote because I think there are Republicans who know it. I hope there are a few more who think about the message being sent to the Think about the fact that on one day you are for State-based innovation, and the next day you are against it.  We have time to allow for States to continue these innovations. I hope we will take advantage of it.  I yield the floor.

7657,topic-id,699,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to stand up for the workers President Trump is failing. As a candidate running for President, Mr.Trump promised workers that he would put them first and that he would bring back good-paying, respectable jobs to their communities, but since day one, President Trump has done the exact opposite. He has rolled back worker protections and made it harder for families to be more secure.  Now, this doesn't come as a surprise to me, especially when I look at President Trump's record as a businessman. I have to say that he has refused to allow even his own hotel workers to organize or join a union, preventing them from having the opportunity to better advocate for safer working conditions and better pay.  We all know that strong unions have helped to create our middle class, and for many working families in the 20th century, a good union job, or the right to collective bargaining, helped them move up the economic ladder. But over the past few decades, we have seen a decline in unions and union membership across the country. As a result of that, our economy has started to favor corporations and those at the top. This paved the way for President Trump and billionaires like him to take advantage of their workers, with little recourse for everyday people who are the backbone of our country.  The National Labor Relations Board gives workers the opportunity to file charges against corporations when they are illegally fired or when corporations retaliate against workers for exercising their rights. President Trump should be familiar with the NLRB, as his own businesses have had complaints filed numerous times. That is precisely why it is so important that the Board is independent and is committed to advocating for workers and their right to organize.  The preamble of the National Labor Relations Act clearly states that it is the policy of the United States to encourage collective bargaining and to give workers a voice, allowing them to speak up for fair wages and safe working conditions. It is the responsibility of the NLRB to ensure that workers are being treated fairly and to resolve disputes between corporate management and workers.  So it is clear to me that Board members should believe in the core mission that I just stated of the NLRB and should be committed to standing up for workers and their right to collective bargaining, which is exactly why I have very serious concerns about Mr.Marvin Kaplan's record, which has largely been in opposition to the work and mission of the  As a labor staffer in the House of Representatives, Mr.Kaplan prepared and staffed hearings where Republicans consistently attacked the In fact, I would be hard-pressed to name a single example of Mr.Kaplan supporting the rights of workers and unions.  In addition to Mr.Kaplan's opposition to the core mission of the Board, I also have deep reservations about Mr.Kaplan's lack of legal experience practicing before the When I asked Mr.Kaplan about his lack of practical qualifications, his responses were telling: Have you ever represented a party, employer, or a union in an unfair labor practice case or representation case before the Board? Have you ever represented a worker in an employment matter?  What is more, when asked to speak on the pressing questions facing the Board at his confirmation hearing, he actually confused basic labor issues and decisions, further calling into question whether he has the experience and knowledge to serve on this critically important  This is not a difficult concept for workers across the country to grasp. If you are not qualified for a job that is this important or if you want to undermine the basic goals of the law, you shouldn't get the job.  So I will be voting no on Mr.Kaplan's confirmation. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle want to strengthen our economy and rebuild our middle class.

7853,topic-id,187,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to recognize National Charter Schools Week and the 25th anniversary of the opening of the very first charter school.  With nearly 3 million students attending public charter schools across the country, 43 States, and the District of Columbia, it is the fastest growing choice option in public education. Minnesota is a leader in developing new innovative ways to educate our students and was the very first State to allow charter schools. Today, Minnesota has 164 charter schools that serve about 57,000 students in kindergarten through the 12th grade. Our State usually ranks among the top in having charter school friendly laws and developing high quality and independent charter school options.  As co-chair of the Charter School Caucus, I believe it is important that we do continue to create and develop this educational option. America will continue to lead the world in innovation and ideas if our students receive the best education possible from early childhood all the way through graduate school, and that means ensuring a child's ZIP Code does not determine the outcome of their education and the quality of their education.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-01-pt1-PgH2990-5.txt,1930,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,1.0,May
7876,topic-id,751,"Mr.Speaker, let me first thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, who has demonstrated great leadership in leading these CBC Special Order hours. It is not an easy task, but she has done remarkable work in terms of finding topics that are important to our communities and our Nation.[[Page H6203]]  As the gentlewoman stated, Mr.Speaker, this month we marked 6 months of the Trump Presidency and 6 months of congressional Republican inaction.  Republicans made promise after promise to the American people. The President called himself the ultimate dealmaker. I wonder if we are witnessing the first Manchurian Instead of the promise of jobs, infrastructure, and a new and improved healthcare plan, we get chaos and seemingly never-ending controversies.  Where is the Republican agenda? Where are their accomplishments? Where are all those wins?  Let's take a look at the numbers. President Trump has a job approval rating of 36 percent, the lowest of any President ever at this point in their Republicans can point to zero legislative accomplishments. The President has no plan to lower healthcare costs, no jobs bills, no infrastructure bills, no tax reform, and no clean budget. These simply are the facts.  Instead of doing what is right for the American people, it appears that Republicans are more occupied with taking away healthcare from millions of our constituents to give tax cuts to the wealthy, or defending the administration's most recent controversy.  This week, we will vote on a dishonest security spending package that will force American taxpayers to pay for the President's border wall. Who is going to pay for it? It looks like the American people.  During his campaign and the rhetoric that we heard up until this point, Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Now, here we are, with our Republican colleagues supporting an effort that says that the American people will pay for the wall. Well, we will get the money from Mexico later. Yeah, all right.  As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am alarmed by President Trump's and the congressional Republicans' determination to further break down our alliances and ignorance of matters related to the security of this  Instead of funding the border wall, we should focus on building strong transportation and infrastructure systems that will create good-paying jobs and lay a foundation for a strong economy. Instead, we are weakening Let's build America with a strong infrastructure bill and adequate training and apprenticeship programs that will benefit our constituents.  Make it in America is something I heard last week, which sounds magnificent, if we could do it. But if you are going to be the leader of this country and make such pronouncements, you have to live by what you are talking about.  Make it in America is to strive to make sure that we do everything in We hear of two buildings Trump erected in Chicago that used Chinese steel or steel from outside the United If you look at his ties, his shirts, his suits, the soap in his hotels, nothing is made in Who are we trying to kid with this? There is nothing.  Maybe his daughter. Well, no, her shoes aren't made in Her dresses are not made in Who are we kidding? Who are we fooling?  The American people have to open their eyes and see the sham that is going on. How this President says one thing and does absolutely the opposite is an atrocity. Make it in America? He stood up there in front of the American people and said that, with the suit, shirt, and tie that he had on? Absolutely unconscionable.  Where are the jobs? I am going to be the best job creator you have ever seen. When? You are going to win so much, you are going to get tired of winning. When? The American people deserve better.  The American people deserve better than a Congress that cares more about pushing an agenda that puts wealthcare in front of healthcare. The American people deserve better than a Congress that will pass legislation that will harm our environment, contaminate our air, and pollute our waterways.  The American people deserve better than a Congress that continues to ignore important issues that disproportionately affect African-American communities, such as criminal justice reform, gun violence prevention, and voting rights.  While this administration and congressional Republicans turn their backs on the American workers, we will continue to demand real action to create jobs, raise wages, and create a brighter future for American families.

7671,topic-id,814,"Mr.President, as we head into the month of August, many Americans are planning to spend time along our beautiful coasts. Our country is fortunate to have such a wide variety of natural resources along the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii, and the east and west coasts. However, I am partial to America's best coast: The 4,500 miles of U.coastline along the Great  Our coastal resources make it possible to move cargo and goods around the world. They provide opportunities for outdoor recreation like fishing and boating and trips to the beach. Our coasts are not only beautiful, providing some of the most scenic vistas and picturesque landscapes our country has to offer; these ecosystems also provide many tangible benefits. They serve as flooding buffers, critical habitats for fish and wildlife, and locations for ports and other marine infrastructure.  In the Great Lakes, our freshwater coastline contains one-fifth of the entire world's fresh water and provides drinking water for over 40 million people. We must be stewards of these areas[[Page S4710]]so that future generations can also benefit from them. In order to do so, we must properly document and keep track of this precious resource.  That is why I partnered with Senator Young to introduce the bipartisan Great Lakes Environmental Sensitivity Index Act of 2017 to require NOAA to update environmental sensitivity index maps and map products. The bill passed unanimously out of the Commerce Committee this morning by a voice vote and now heads to the full Senate floor for consideration.  Environmental sensitive index--or ESI--maps provide an inventory of our valuable natural and human-use resources along our coasts. These maps chronicle sensitive ecosystems and the presence of various species as they migrate through regions and habitats for threatened and endangered species. They also document where we can access coastal resources from beaches and parks to docks, ferries, and boat ramps.  We must maintain an up-to-date inventory of these precious coastal resources so that we know exactly where we need to focus our response efforts in a worst-case scenario of a harmful oil or chemical spill. Accurate documentation of these resources and their vulnerabilities is critical to both deploying the right response effort when a spill or accident occurs and assessing the damage and restoration efforts needed after the fact.  In places like the Straits of Mackinac, where a 64-year-old oil pipeline sits at the bottom of the lake bed, it should be our top priority to have a current inventory of what shoreline resources could be impacted by a pipeline leak. Models have shown that a pipeline spill in the Straits of Mackinac could likely result in oil reaching the shores of Mackinac Island within hours, which would be an absolute catastrophe for Michigan's top tourist attraction.  ESI maps don't just help with oilspill response; they can also be used for coastal development activities, and they even have significant research applications. They provide a clear reference point prior to natural disasters or major storms that may damage, destroy, or significantly alter resources along our coasts. Decision makers at the local and State level may use them for restoration efforts or to make informed decisions about how to balance all of the various uses in that coastal zone.  ESI maps need regular updates in order for them to be truly effective. These updates are happening now for other areas of the country. Stretches of the west coast, along the Gulf of Mexico, and along the east coast have all received updates over the last 5 years.  One region is continually absent from these updates: my home region of the Great In fact, the most recent updates for some of the Great Lakes were completed over 20 years ago, but Lake Erie and parts of Lake Michigan haven't been updated for over 30 years. This bill gives the proper direction and resources to make sure these long overdue updates move forward.  Supporters of the bill so far include the Great Lakes Charter Boat Association, the Coastal States Organization, the Great Lakes Commission, the Alliance for the Great Lakes, the National Wildlife Federation, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, and the group For Love of With nearly 3,300 miles of coastline in Michigan, the second-most coastline of any State in the Nation, we need to update Great Lakes environmental sensitivity index products as soon as we can.  Modernizing these maps will provide a better picture of what resources could be at risk in the event of a disaster and will be an important tool to help us keep our Great Lakes safe and clean for future generations.  I look forward to working with Senator Young and the rest of my colleagues in the Senate to move this bill forward and make sure that we have the tools we need to make the best decisions for the Great Lakes, no matter the challenges and opportunities facing us.  Thank you.  ",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4700-3.txt,2113,CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS MEETS WITH SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY,2017.0,2.0,April

During National Police Week, we commemorate the conviction and compassion they bring to their jobs every day, as well as the difficult choices and the sacrifices they make. From members of local police departments, to rapid transit officers, to court bailiffs, public safety officers risk their lives to keep our families and communities safe. That is a fact that we can never forget and a reality that confronts public safety officers and their families every day. This is a time to reflect on what law enforcement officers do for our communities, to thank those who serve us, and to pay special recognition to those who have lost their lives in the line of duty.  It is in that spirit, and with a heavy heart, that I rise to honor seven Michigan law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2016. These men gave everything to their communities, their families, the State of Michigan, and their country. Across Michigan, our hearts have been shattered by their deaths, and our grief and gratitude go out to their families. Let us take one moment to honor their lifetimes of service: Myron Jarrett, Police Officer, Detroit Police Department; Ronald Kienzle, Court Officer, Berrien County Trial Court; Kevin Miller, Sergeant, Detroit Police Department; Collin Rose, Wayne State University Police Department; Kenneth Steil, Sergeant, Detroit Police Department; Michael Winter, Posse Deputy, Branch County Sheriff's Office; and Joseph Zangaro, Security Supervisor, Berrien County Trial  The deaths of these officers were only some of the devastating tragedies that have shaken communities in Michigan and across this country. In these difficult times, we must always acknowledge each other's sacrifices, walk in one another's shoes, and feel the compassion in each other's hearts. This is what our law enforcement officers strive to do for us, and what we can do for them.

For this Special Order hour, we will spend this time to talk about Failure to Govern: The First 6 Months Under Republican  President Trump's first 6 months have been defined by his often angry and personal tweets, his efforts to denigrate and undercut the multiple investigations into Russian influence in the 2016 election, and most importantly, the stalemated legislative battle to repeal and replace  President Trump has signed dozens of executive actions and Presidential proclamations. Some have fared better than others. His travel ban plan, for instance, first caused chaos and was effectively shut down by a series of legal challenges. But the second effort, which also faced a flurry of lawsuits, was ultimately allowed to take effect on a limited basis by the Supreme  In all, our President has signed 42 bills into law. But when it comes to big ticket items, like infrastructure, tax reform, and a repeal and/or replacement of ObamaCare, President Trump is sitting on zero. With healthcare seemingly on ice, tax reform is expected to be the big challenge next on our agenda.  Budgets are about priorities, and this President's priorities are clear. His budget hollows out our economy, endangers working families all across this country, in my district of the Virgin Islands, and the other districts that we all represent.  The $2.5 trillion in cuts to entitlement programs, which include $192 billion to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as SNAP, and the $800 billion to Medicaid, will devastate localities like the Virgin Islands and elsewhere, where one in five children are covered under Medicaid and one-fifth of our population receives SNAP benefits.  The President has a budget with massive cuts that would shred social safety nets and cripple longstanding governmental functions. This administration has created uncertainty in the Nation's healthcare system by sending inconsistent administrative signals and supporting legislation that could deprive millions of people of health insurance coverage, undermine Medicaid health support for low-income Americans, and give wealthy taxpayers a massive tax cut.  He has mismanaged the Federal Government by failing to fill top spots. He has expanded the policy of deporting dangerous and illegal aliens by including many people with minimal records, stable jobs, and American families.  Most recently, we saw this with the Secretary of Homeland Security ordering the 50,000-plus Haitians here under protective status, due to the devastating natural disasters in Haiti, to leave. These are decent, hardworking people who are sending money back home, supporting an economy which is faltering under collapse.  We have seen a reversal of decades of bipartisan cooperation in extending environmental preservation of national landmarks. He has hired foxes to watch the chicken coops by filling his administration with arch-conservatives, many with records opposing the very agencies with which they work, and curbing civil rights and environmental enforcement.  All of these things we have seen in these first 6 months, and we will hear more.

There is a better deal that is out there, and there is a better way that we all, as Members of Congress, need to demonstrate.  I was looking at a fact Street Sheet that was put together talking about the 200 days of the 115th Congress by the numbers. This is a Congress that is controlled by the Republicans in the House, the Republicans in the Senate, and the Republican administration. You would think that so much legislation could get done, and we are a stalled body at this time.  That is not what the American people brought us to Washington to do. We all represent people who are looking for a better deal, looking for an expansion of the American Dream, a realization of the American Dream in their own lives, and having security for their own children and their grandchildren to be able to realize that dream.  When I looked at these numbers, I was aghast at what has not been done in this Congress and flabbergasted at the things that have been done by this Zero number of bills to create jobs have been brought to the House floor by House Republican leadership. Zero number of bills that have been considered under an open rule so far this  The same open rule that, Mr.Speaker, you said that you would exact when you were a young gun coming to Washington, you said that you would use the open rule, but we have not seen that done in this 115th  Three times, House Republicans blocked a vote on H.685, Bring Jobs Home Act, which ends tax breaks for corporations sending jobs overseas and creates new incentives to create good-paying jobs here in the United  There have been zero times that Speaker Paul Ryan has spoken out in opposition to President Trump's dangerous and unconstitutional Muslim and refugee ban.

Twice, House Republicans voted against Made in America amendment requiring that specific infrastructure and construction projects use materials and equipment made in the  Mr.Speaker, 229 Republicans voted for a GOP antiworker, bait-and-switch bill that undermines the existing right to hard-earned overtime pay, giving employers the flexibility to substitute overtime pay with comp time while giving employees no guarantee that they can use their comp time when they need it.  Mr.Speaker, 217 Republicans voted for the disastrous TrumpCare bill, which would result in 23 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage, raises out-of-pocket healthcare costs for millions of American families, imposes a crushing age tax on those 50 to 64, shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund, and guts the protections for people with preexisting conditions.  Mr.Speaker, 233 Republicans voted to gut the Dodd-Frank Act, Wall Street reforms, rolling back key consumer protections, and take us back to pre-2008 era of unchecked risky financial market abuses that resulted in the worst financial crisis since the Great  There have been zero amount of funding in President Trump's budget for Social Services Block Grants, which provide States with funding for services such as childcare and adult care programs. And there are 1.6 million school-age children that would lose afterschool and summer programs as a result of the President's budget.  When we talk about the President's budget, we need to discuss exactly what those numbers mean and how it is going to affect the American people--people, Mr.Speaker, that we say we represent, but that we are not standing up for against this administration.  The budget would cut SNAP funding by over 190 billion--with a ``B''--over the next 10 years, jeopardizing benefits for an estimated 44 million Americans and reduce nutritional foods for women, infants, and children, the WIC program.  The budget also includes SNAP policy changes that would charge food stores using USDA approval to accept food stamps, which could drive smaller food retailers out of the program.  Why is this important?  Because many people in urban areas that are using food stamps are doing so in virtual food deserts. They do not have transportation to go to the large suppliers, the large grocery stores. They go to these smaller grocery stores. They go to these small places to use the food stamps to be able to provide food for their families. These changes would cap benefits, require localities to pay 25 percent of benefits, and limit local waivers for Federal work requirements that many communities are not appropriate because there are no jobs, because we also are not supplying individuals with the job skills, the work skills to be able to find employment in some of these areas.[[Page H6205]]  The budget would reduce Education Department investments by $9 billion, including through the elimination of preschool and afterschool programs, literacy grants, and funding to improve teacher and principal quality. It also proposes cuts to higher education programs, including elimination of grants for lower income students, low-interest Perkins loans, and cutting by half a program that helps students work to pay off their loans.  The budget also calls for the elimination of NASA Space Grant education programs that prepare students, such as in my district at the University of the Virgin Islands, for careers in science and technology industries.  The budget would reduce USDA Rural Development funding by $9.2 million, approximately 30 percent. This is vital in areas like my district in the Virgin Islands with the elimination of rural business cooperative services and rural water and wastewater disposal programs.  The budget would zero out important rural housing assistance, such as single-family housing direct loans; would slash funding for rural broadband, distance learning, telemedicine, and needed community facilities improvement.  Mr.Speaker, these are in rural areas that President Trump won in the election. You would think that he would want to support these rural communities in areas of housing, the most American of American ideals, home ownership.  In the Labor Department, the budget would reduce Labor Department investments by $2.4 billion, including large cuts to Job Job Corps, a place that would allow young people to have training for jobs, activities meant to prepare disadvantaged youth, the same youth that we say we are concerned about being on the streets in these urban areas that are so dangerous, those are the individuals going to Job Corps, looking to be prepared for the workplace, and we are going to reduce that by $2.4 billion? That doesn't make any sense.  The budget request for the Department of Energy would slash research funding and move away from investments in renewables, including a 70 percent cut to the Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and zeroing out its weatherization assistance in State energy programs that aid low-income families with reducing energy costs.                              {time}  2015  The Department's Office of Science would be cut by 17 percent. That budget slashing to NOAA coastal science programs includes eliminating NOAA's Sea Grants program, coastal research at our university, and the coastal zone management grants that aid with climate change mitigation--climate change mitigation--which is needed in areas that I live in, like the Virgin Islands, Florida, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and in coastal areas that are seeing a tremendous loss of economy and loss of homes because our environment is, in fact, changing.  The Environmental Protection Agency would be cut by approximately 30 percent, partly through elimination of all EPA climate change programs, lead control programs, the Energy Star program that encourages energy-efficient consumer products, and the environmental justice office that investigates the concentration of pollution in low-income communities.  Now we want people to be in communities where pollution is greatest, those inner cities that our President has said he wants to fight so strongly for. We are going to keep them in polluted areas because we are cutting out EPA funding in some of those places.  In transportation and housing, the budget would eliminate $500 million per year in TIGER grants, Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery, which has been important to ports and transshipment projects around this country, in the Virgin Islands, and the Community Development Block Grant program that provides grant funding to localities for economic development activities.  The Department of Housing would be cut nearly 20 percent, including elimination of several housing assistance grant programs and slashing its core rental housing program, Section 8 housing choice vouchers, which assists private rental housing, which is a win-win program. You allow individuals who have private homes, who are renting those out, to receive a voucher to support individuals who are looking to be placed in those homes.  An estimated 250,000 housing vouchers would be taken away over the next fiscal year, vouchers which primarily benefit seniors and individuals with disabilities. Support for local public housing authorities would also see cuts.  The budget would eliminate Commerce Department subdivisions that support businesses and entrepreneurship, such as the Economic Development Administration, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, and the Minority Business Development  Healthcare, of course we could go on for forever, but the budget calls for phasing out enhanced Federal matching funds for expanded Medicaid populations by 2020 for people living in territories and in other areas that are heavily relying on It would be far more expensive for those localities to cover individuals, and our hospitals would be faced with even more uncompensated care costs.  The budget also proposes cuts of $1.3 billion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, and more than $7 billion from the National Institutes of Health, In the alternative, stronger budgets for NIH and CDC would benefit in preparation for public health threats and pandemics.  These are the things that we, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are seeing that are happening in these first 6 months. We are concerned. We are not here just to bash the That is not the objective with bringing these issues out.  The objective is to make the American people aware, to call on our colleagues here in this House, in the House next door to us in the Senate, to be better stewards of what the American people have given us: the ability, the right, the job of legislating, the job of being a check and balance to an administration which has been caught in a morass of ineffectiveness and inaction to support the American people of this great country.  We are asking, Mr.Speaker, that we would wake up to what is happening, see with clear eyes, not with fake news, not with our own vision of what we would like things to be, but what things are and where this is taking us now, the people who are going to be left behind, that a better deal needs to be made for the American people who have sent us here to Washington to do what is right, to do what is good for them, to represent all the people, not the wealthy.

People will be losing that opportunity based on what we have seen in these last 6 months.  We, the Congressional Black Caucus, as the conscience of Congress, are relying and awakening the conscience of this Congress to wake up and see what is happening, to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves, and to do the right thing, to make a better deal with the American people--not with Pennsylvania Avenue, not among ourselves, not in our private little meetings, not with what can be done for us and for our small group, but for all Americans, those Americans that are going to be left behind by those billions and trillions in tax cuts that are coming to the social safety net of this country.  It cannot be relied on by many of the Many of the States do not have the wherewithal to pick up that slack. And there will be even greater--greater--demise to this country if we continue to allow it to work this way.

7883,topic-id,398,"Mr.Speaker, as Congress draws closer to the August recess, we are no closer to considering comprehensive legislation to shore up our nation's crumbling infrastructure remains than we were when Republicans took control of Republicans in Congress have had control over both chambers since January, yet the American people are still left waiting more for a plan to repair our roads and bridges, bolster funding for the Highway Trust Fund, and provide stable funding to local communities for transportation projects.  The costs of Congress' inability to act are staggering. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates that every American household will lose $3,400 each year between 2016 and 2025, due to infrastructure deficiencies. Our failure to act will cost the U.economy nearly $4 trillion in GDP by 2025 through diminished productivity, lost jobs, and the increased cost of goods. The longer we wait, the more expensive it will be to repair our roads, electricity grid, and water and wastewater infrastructure.[[Page H6207]]  The Republican House has been in session for 110 days. I am deeply disappointed that the Republican leadership has chosen to ignore important bills that I have supported, such as H.1664--the Investing in America: A Penny for Progress H.1664 would shore up the Highway Trust Fund through new Invest in America bonds and a modest increase in the fuel excise tax. Another bill, H.1265--the Rebuilding America's Airport Infrastructure Act, would eliminate the cap on passenger facility charges, allowing local airports the ability to raise additional funds in order to build up more airport infrastructure such as new terminals and runways. H.2510--the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017 would help bolster financing for new water and wastewater infrastructure projects all across the United These are real bills already introduced in Congress that we could consider today.  Mr.Speaker, we cannot afford to wait. There are a number of solutions already before us that this chamber could consider. It will take a display of political will by the Republican Party to consider these practical solutions to our nation's infrastructure woes. The American people are demanding that we act swiftly on these policies so that we can focus on what is most important--the efficient movement of the people, goods, and services which drive our economy forward. The time to act is now. I strongly urge my colleagues to support a comprehensive plan to shore up our nation's infrastructure.

The principle behind the Equality Act is simple: discrimination is wrong, no matter what form it takes, no matter who it targets.  This is a principle that Americans overwhelmingly choose to embrace and live by. We see it in the way we treat our LGBT employees, friends, neighbors, and family. It is apparent in the outpouring of joy and celebration we witnessed at the Supreme Court's historic marriage equality ruling 2 years ago.  But sadly, our laws have not yet caught up with our values. It is still legal in a majority of States to fire somebody just because they are gay. That is not just a theoretical concern. It means real harm and real hardship for countless  For LGBT Americans who are fired or turned away from a doctor's office or told they are not wanted in their neighborhood, many of them have nowhere to go for legal recourse. We are better than that as a nation. It is time we showed that.  We are a nation that prides ourselves on our commitment to equality under the law. So I call upon this Congress to pass the Equality Act and put an end to legal discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans once and for all.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgH3012-5.txt,1910,PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR,2017.0,2.0,August

7696,topic-id,2090,"Madam Speaker, today, America watched former FBI Director Comey offer his testimony before the Senate Select Committee on It was a dramatic and serious moment in the history of our country and in the unfolding of the crisis related to the investigation of Russia's involvement in the U.election and then the firing of General Flynn by President                              {time}  1745  This was the first time that Director Comey spoke publicly about his firing by President Trump and the investigation since he left the FBI, and his testimony confirmed much of what has been reported about the matter.  Now, what any reasonable-minded observer would have to conclude after watching the testimony today, after reading Mr.Comey's testimony, is that President Trump was trying mightily to use his office and his influence to get Director Comey to drop the investigation of General Flynn, his former National Security Indeed, President Trump as much as said so when he said that he had fired Director Comey because he was unhappy about the Russian investigation and, presumably, the Russian investigation into General  Now, Madam Speaker, distinguished colleagues, look how far we have come over the last several months. The President of the United States hired a National Security Advisor after being warned not to by the former President of the United States, by then-President That National Security Advisor lasted a total of 24 days in office, when it was determined that he had lied to Vice President Pence about his dealings with And then later we learned that he was a registered foreign agent, or he registered retroactively as a foreign agent, an agent for a foreign government. Now, think how dramatic this sequence of events is.  Imagine, if you will, if President Barack Obama had met with Attorney General Eric Holder and Vice President Joe Biden and FBI Director Comey in his office and then asked Vice President Biden and Attorney General Holder to leave his office, saying that he wanted to speak alone to the FBI Director, and then proceeded, essentially, to tell FBI Director Comey that he wanted him to drop the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails, saying, you know, ``Hillary Clinton's a good woman. She's a good person, and I hope you can just let the investigation into her emails go. Just let it go,'' and to demand repeatedly for absolute personal loyalty.  Now, as it happened, Director Comey refused to take a vow of absolute loyalty to the After all, he takes an oath of office to the Constitution of the United States and the people of the country, so he couldn't say that he would give absolute loyalty to the President of the United That is not consistent with our constitutional form of government.  But imagine that this had happened under the Obama administration. Obama had made a similar demand of FBI Director Comey who was investigating, after all, Hillary Clinton's emails, had dismissed the Vice President and the Attorney General to have a one-on-one conversation, and then said, ``I really hope that you let this go,'' using the full trappings of his office and his influence to try to get the FBI Director to drop the investigation.[[Page H4810]]  If that happened, I dare say that every Member of this body, every Member would have recognized that as an attempt to obstruct justice by the President of the United States, and lots of Members certainly would have been calling for impeachment of President Obama for interfering with an ongoing investigation by the  Well, what is happening now in Congress?  Well, lots of our colleagues are murmuring a defense of President Trump saying: Well, it doesn't look good and maybe he shouldn't have done it, but he is new to government. Trump is new to He is not schooled in the ways of Washington, it is being said. He is actually a breath of fresh air that he doesn't know how Washington operates.  I think that that completely confuses the question. Dear colleagues, Madam Speaker, the law against obstruction of justice in the United States, which is a felony criminal offense, 18 U.S.1503, applies against experienced government officials and inexperienced government officials. It applies to all citizens of the United It applies to people who have worked in Washington their whole life and people who have worked in Washington for several months. In fact, it applies to people across the country.  It is not a law that applies just in the District of It applies in New It applies in Mar-a-It applies in It applies everywhere.  No American citizen can interfere with the due administration of justice, whether it is trying to persuade a juror to do a certain thing, whether it is trying to influence a judge in a particular case, or whether it is trying to get a prosecutor to drop an investigation into a particular person or into an entire subject matter.  No one has the right to interfere with the due administration of justice in That is both a criminal statutory principle in 18 U.It is also a constitutional principle, which is well recognized because democracy, our constitutional democracy, depends upon the rule of law; and there is no rule of law if there is no evenhandedness and no impartiality in the administration of justice. No one has the right to interfere with justice.  Now what should be done about this?  Nobody quite knows what to do at this point. We do have a special counsel, Mr.Mueller, who has been appointed, and that is good, but what he is looking for is counterintelligence information, and he is looking for possible criminal activity.  But if we take a step back, what is all of this really about?  I was very pleased that former Director Comey talked about this in his testimony today. What this is about was a concerted, deliberate, comprehensive effort, orchestrated from the very top of the Russian Government, to interfere with the U.election. That is something now that former FBI Director Comey has spoken about publicly, and it is something that 18 of our intelligence agencies have reported to Congress and the American people in a public report with a high degree of certainty that there was an orchestrated campaign to undermine and subvert our campaign, starting at the highest levels of the Russian That took place, okay?  So the criminal or counterintelligence investigation doesn't go to the question that has got to concern us in Congress, which is the threat to our democratic form of government. As FBI Director Comey restated today, 2016 could just be a dress rehearsal for what is coming at us in 2018 and 2020. The intelligence agencies said that they would try to do it again.  Russia is no match for the military might of the United States of Russia is no match for the economic might of the United States of Russia's autocratic, kleptocratic, dictatorial-style government is no match for the constitutional democracy that we have built up in the United States of But the Russians have figured out a way to use the internet to try to penetrate the democracies of the world on the cheap. It is not that expensive to have paid trolls to orchestrate fake news and propaganda and to try to distort the electoral process in the United States of America--or in the Netherlands, or in France, or in other countries around the world.  Now, we don't have all of the facts. That is why what we need is an independent, outside investigation by a commission that we set up outside of Congress--no Democratic Members of Congress, no Republican Members of Congress, no elected officials. What we will put on there are statesmen and stateswomen who are experienced in questions of democracy and foreign policy, who are trusted, and we will ask them to give us the kind of report that the 9/11 Commission gave to us but about what happened in the 2016 election and how do we prepare to stop it from happening again to us in the future.  Now, notice that you can support this, and I think you should support this, whether or not there was any collusion by anybody within the Trump administration. You can be completely convinced that there was collusion between particular members of the Trump administration or Trump campaign and Russia or you could be completely convinced that there was no collusion at all, that they knew nothing about those efforts. It doesn't make any difference. There was still a massive assault on American democracy, and we have got to respond to it.  That is why I think the pathway forward for us now is for both sides in Congress, both parties, to come together and to act in a patriotic way, not in a partisan way, to say let's create an objective, disinterested, outside commission to get to the bottom of what happened to us in this election. And we will let, for the time being, the Department of Justice and Special Counselor Mueller deal with the question of criminal culpability and criminal deeds, but that is of less importance, in truth, than the integrity of our political institution and the future of American democracy.  There is the question which remains unresolved and, at this point, still relatively untouched, about what is so special about Michael  We have a President who is unafraid to offend anybody. He told our best allies in the world in NATO that NATO is obsolete. I think he has changed course on that, but he was very willing to basically wave off the importance of  He was willing to tell one of our biggest trade partners in the world, Mexico, that he was going to force them to build a wall on the border, force them to pay for it. And again, I think he seems to have backtracked from that. I don't know where he stands on that now.  He was willing to insult and affront the Government of Australia, which has been a great ally of  He had a TV show called ``You're Fired,'' so he is not afraid of offending people, and we see him offend people all of the time and pick fights with people all of the time. He picked a fight with Meryl He is willing to tweet at anybody.  But suddenly, with Michael Flynn, this disgraced National Security Advisor whom he fired, President Trump goes to great lengths to try to interfere in an ongoing investigation which I think everybody can recognize is obstruction or attempted an obstruction of justice. He interferes with the FBI Director in a really astonishing and unprecedented way to try to get Flynn carved out of the investigation.  Why? What does Flynn know? What is the nature of their relationship such that the President goes to such extraordinary lengths to carve him out from the investigation?  That is something that we are going to need to get to the bottom of because democracies operate on the truth. Truth is built into our system. That is why we have judges and we have juries. That is why we have due process. That is why we have congressional oversight over the President of the United That is why all of us in public service swear an oath to the The truth means something in a democracy, so we are going to have to get to the bottom of that.  But, in the meantime, Congress can act effectively and in a unified way. And I was encouraged by what both Republican and Democratic Senators on the Senate committee today were saying, which is that everybody agreed, or at least a lot of them agreed, that there had been this unacceptable assault on the electoral institution of our political democracy in 2016, and we have got to prevent it from happening again.[[Page H4811]]  We need to have a bipartisan, or nonpartisan, independent commission outside of Congress to study exactly what happened and to report back to us about what we need to do to build up our defenses so our democracy is as strong as our economy and as our military. So our democratic institutions need to be fortified against subversion, against hacking, against cyber propaganda and fake news and so on.

7658,topic-id,568,"Mr.President, there are two reasons why every Member of the Senate should vote against confirming Marvin Kaplan to the The first is that he is just not qualified.  The NLRB is the Federal agency that enforces our labor laws. It protects the rights of workers and the private sector to organize for better wages and better working conditions. It is up to them to make sure that their employers follow the law and that when there is an issue between employers and employees, everyone acts reasonably.  Democrats and Republicans who have served on the NLRB have been the top labor and employment attorneys in their fields. They have had long careers working on labor issues, either as lawyers or as law professors. Many of them have spent time as staffers on the NLRB board. In other words, they understand the labor issues better than anyone. They may have a unique perspective on it one way or the other--sort of pro-management or pro-labor--but there is no question that previous nominees and previous members of the Board know labor law.  Marvin Kaplan doesn't fit this profile. He is not a lawyer with any relevant labor experience. He has no record and no public positions on relevant labor law. What he is is a well-connected Capitol Hill staffer. His only qualification, that I can find, is that he has drafted some legislation for a committee in the House of That does not stack up against the resumes of any other member who has served on the Board--Democrat or  This lack of experience is dangerous. It means he will not know the intricacies and the historical development of labor law. He will simply be a rubberstamp who brings a political agenda to the Board, because he has no on-the-record opinions on these issues of his own.  That was clear from the hearing on his nomination, when he would not properly commit to recuse himself from any issues he had worked on and to approach issues with an open mind, which brings me to the second reason. If somehow Senators can make an excuse for his lack of experience, we can't[[Page S4704]]deny that this is the opposite of the message that Congress should have received during the 2016 election.  In November, Americans made clear that Washington had failed working families and that we have not done enough to stand up for American workers.  Now here we are about to confirm a nominee to the NLRB, and the only experience he has is that he has drafted legislation to hurt American workers.  The Board is about to face some important decisions. They could reverse a decision that holds big companies accountable for how their contractors treat workers. The future of American workers and their ability to organize will be influenced by this Board, which includes any members confirmed by the  If Mr.Kaplan is appointed, it will further silence workers who already feel that they aren't being heard in Washington,  A vote for Mr.Kaplan is a vote that ignores the voices of American workers.

The administration requested that the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees help them beat back reports in the press about the Russia probe.

We in Congress, in both parties, should have one overarching goal: to get the full unvarnished truth.

Here in Congress, the Senate Intelligence Committee is doing its investigation in a bipartisan way, but the executive branch investigation has been compromised.

This Attorney General shouldn't be anywhere near the hiring process of the next FBI His role will jaundice the entire process, if it hasn't already.

I thank my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, for speaking so eloquently on this proposal.  In addition, there are several things that should happen here on Capitol Hill that will help get us to the bottom of the events this week.  First, Mr.Comey should testify before There are so many questions that only Mr.Comey can answer. So I applaud Senators Burr and Warner for inviting him to appear before the Intelligence Committee next week. It was the right thing to do. We ought to hear from Mr.Comey, and I urge Mr.Comey to come and tell the whole story.  Second, Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should make themselves available to I am renewing my request of the majority leader to call an all-Senators briefing where they can answer the questions swirling about from Tuesday night's firing. Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should appear separately and partially in a classified setting if necessary, but they must come.  Mr.Rosenstein has played a central role in all of these events. He could help clear up questions about where the decision to fire Mr.Comey originated. So later today, separate and apart from my request that he come before the Senate, I will be sending Mr.Rosenstein a letter with a list of questions for him to answer publicly. America needs to hear them. Many Democrats voted for Mr.Rosenstein a few weeks ago because he had a reputation for integrity. He assured us he would be an independent force inside the Department of Justice, and 94 Senators voted for him, but the events of last week have made many of us question that belief. He owes it to the He owes it to the people he supervises in the Justice Department and in the FBI, and he owes it to the American people to provide some answers.  In sum, we demand the appointment of a special prosecutor by a nonpolitical appointee at the Department of We want to hear from Mr.We are asking the majority leader to hold separate all-Senators briefings with the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney This would help us get a hold on what happened, would explain why, and would help guide us in what to do next because this investigation will not die no matter who wants it to. I sincerely hope we will get an answer from the majority leader by the end of the day. This is a very serious matter.  Right now, there are two different stories coming out of the White Some are saying the decision to fire Mr.Comey came directly from the White House; others, including the Vice President, have said it came from the Department of Justice--specifically, Mr.Rosenstein and Mr.We need to resolve these two story lines on something as important as this.

7771,topic-id,990,"Mr.President, on the budget, yesterday morning the Trump administration released their 2018 budget. The document is stunning in its cruelty. It takes a sledgehammer to the middle class, the working poor, while lavishing tax breaks on the very wealthy.  They may not have intended it, but the Trump budget is a compilation of all the broken promises this President made to working In his budget, President Trump has broken promise after promise after promise to working people without any shame, without any remorse, without any explanation.  The President promised to increase infrastructure investment, but his budget actually cuts more money from infrastructure programs than the new money it puts in. The President's proposal to slash American infrastructure investments is a job-killing 180-degree turn away from his repeated promise of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  President Trump's campaign promises on infrastructure are crumbling faster than our roads and bridges. I want to ask the Trump administration: How can we expect that you are going to be real about a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan when your budget cuts infrastructure dramatically--right now? Don't you think it adds up? To us, it does. It makes us very dubious of any attempt to do infrastructure by this administration. We hope we are wrong, but the budget is a document that tells where the real truth is in terms of administration beliefs. They sure as heck, by this budget, don't like infrastructure.  The President has said that education is the civil rights issue of our time, but the Trump budget calls for over $3.2 billion in cuts to higher education, eliminates programs that forgive loans for public service jobs like teachers and doctors, and eliminates subsidized loan programs that help lower the cost of college. College students of America, look at the President's budget and see if he is on your side. He sure as heck isn't.  The President said he would ``save Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid without cuts. Have to do it.'' Those are his words. But the Trump budget slashes Social Security by $72 billion and cuts Medicaid by hundreds of billions, in addition to the more than $800 billion TrumpCare cuts took from Medicaid already in the House bill. All in all, it is a $1 trillion broken promise on  Remember, America, Medicaid is a program that affects the poor. That is a good thing. But much of the money goes to help the middle class, elderly people in nursing homes, and families fighting opioid addiction. So the bottom line is this is another broken promise to the middle class that Trump made in the campaign.  The budget breaks promise after promise after promise the President made to what he called the forgotten America, the working men and women of Well, this budget forgot the forgotten  In addition, the Trump budget depends on fantasy math to make all the numbers work. Most budgets make assumptions, and they all stretch the math a little bit, but the Trump budget takes a quantum leap into a new dimension of budgetary fairy tale.  Not only does the Trump budget assume unrealistic growth as a way to balance the budget in 10 years--no economist, liberal or conservative, thinks we can achieve 3 percent growth in the near term--but the Trump budget double counts and double dips in a way we have never seen in any budget before. The Trump budget includes the assumption they will pass ``deficit-neutral tax reform.'' In order for their massive tax cut to be deficit-neutral, they need to assume the economy grows fast enough to make up for lost revenues. But at the same time, the Trump budget assumes that growth will pay for tax cuts and help pay down the deficit--both.  Take the estate tax as an example. President Trump has proposed eliminating the estate tax in tax reform. Yet the Trump budget assumes that the government will take in more than $300 billion in estate taxes over the next 10 years. In other words, part of the budget says that we are getting rid of the estate tax, and part of the budget says that $300 billion the estate tax brings in is counted toward balancing the budget. I have never seen anything like it. If an accountant did this, my guess is--I don't know accounting standards in detail--they would be kicked out of the accounting profession.  In short, as Benjamin Applebaum in the New York Times points out: ``President Trump is proposing to balance the federal budget in part by simultaneously increasing estate taxation and eliminating estate taxation.''  Let me read that again. This is a reporter for the New York Times, not some politician of a political party: ``President Trump is proposing to balance the federal budget in part by simultaneously increasing estate taxation and eliminating estate taxation.''  The gall, the nerve, and the facts-be-darned attitude in this budget are appalling. What they said on the estate tax is a complete contradiction. The government cannot take in money from a tax that no longer exists. Where are our fiscal watchdogs on the other side of the aisle when they do stuff like this?  Everyone knows Presidential budgets contain some degree of flexibility, but what the Trump budget does is a quantum leap that would make an accountant blush, if they could stay in their profession after doing this. The budget is a total fantasy, a deeply unserious proposal to Members of both parties are right to reject it, and I applaud many of my Republican colleagues for speaking out against this proposal.  Again, what will happen--my guess--is that Democrats and Republicans will ignore the Trump budget because it is so harsh on the middle class and because it is such an accounting nightmare. We will do our own budget, and we will probably produce something pretty good for the American people, as we did in 2017--as long as Donald Trump and the White House stay out of it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3105.txt,1036,1945,2017.0,24.0,July

The President and administration officials have demonstrated they are willing to consider lifting sanctions on Russia in exchange for vague, yet-to-be-articulated concessions, if any concessions at all. Congress ought to have the power to review any decision made by this administration before sanctions on Russia are lifted.  Senator McCain has also introduced an amendment, along with Senator Cardin, which would impose new sanctions on Given the revelations of Russian interference in our elections, new sanctions are warranted in addition to the existing sanctions. In addition to the Graham-Cardin bill,[[Page S3347]]which should definitely be included, I hope Senator McCain's proposal is part of our consideration of Russia-related sanctions as well.  Chairman Corker, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and Ranking Member Cardin are in ongoing discussions, as are the majority leader and I, about the content of the Russia sanctions and amendment. I am hopeful that we can resolve this issue and vote to advance both measures.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-08-pt1-PgS3346-3.txt,1036,1945,2017.0,8.0,August
7837,topic-id,614,"Now, on another matter, Mr.President, criminal justice reform. Last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered Federal prosecutors to ``charge and pursue the most serious readily provable offense,'' even for low-level drug crimes. Functionally, this means Federal prosecutors[[Page S3025]]will seek the harshest possible penalty even for nonviolent, low-level drug crimes.  This is a significant reversal from the Obama-era Smart on Crime Initiative, in which Federal prosecutors were instructed to focus on more dangerous drug traffickers and avoid charging less-serious offenders with crimes that required long, mandatory minimum sentences. As a result of the Obama policies, Federal drug cases dropped by more than 19 percent between 2012 and 2016, according to the U.Sentencing Cases with charges carrying longer, mandatory minimum sentences fell precipitously, from nearly 60 percent in 2012 to 45 percent last year. Thanks in part to this initiative, President Obama became the first President since Carter to leave the White House with a smaller Federal prison population than when he took office.  Meanwhile, prosecutions of the more serious crimes--the evil drug dealers, those who run the drugs, often from out of this country to here, they are the ones we can really go after and need to go after--increased by 17 percent and 14 percent, which makes it the way we can stop these evil drugs from coming into this country.  So that policy was tough on crime and smart on crime. Our law enforcement agencies have finite resources. They should be focused on combating violent crimes. When a prosecutor is spending hours in court, days, for a low-level possession charge and not having the resources to go after the drug runners, the drug dealers who poison our kids, that is misplaced priorities.  What Attorney General Sessions has just ordered is the exact opposite approach of what we need. Instead of giving judges and juries the discretion to use their judgment in sentencing, it compels prosecutors to seek as much jail time as they can get for every single offense, treating low level and high level the same. It is a blunt instrument that will result in more unnecessary, punitive sentences, overcrowding of our prisons, and will be less effective in our fight on crime. It runs completely counter to a bipartisan consensus here in  Many Members of this body, Democrats and Republicans, agree that mandatory minimum sentences have led to bloated, costly prisons, and disproportionately ravaged minority communities.  In the last Congress, a bipartisan group of Senators sought to make meaningful progress with a sentencing reform proposal that had, among its cosponsors, a diverse group of Senators, ranging from Senators Durbin and Booker on the Democratic side to Senators Lee and Paul on the conservative side. Unfortunately, those efforts to strike a compromise to bring much needed reform to our Nation's criminal justice system were derailed by the obstruction of, guess who--then-Senator Sessions, with the cooperation of the Republican leadership. Now, after making progress under President Obama and Attorney General Holder, Attorney General Sessions has chosen to simply revert back to the one-size-fits-all approach that criminologists, police leaders, and bipartisan lawmakers have determined is not the right answer.  In order to truly be tough on crime, we must be smart on crime. This approach is dumb on crime. Congress, of course, still has the power to legislate this issue. We have the power to override the Attorney General's decision. So I hope this misguided change in the Department of Justice's policy revives a bipartisan desire to pursue sentencing reform. When we look for areas where there can be significant bipartisan cooperation, this is one of them. I hope Leader McConnell will choose to pursue it.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgS3024-3.txt,1036,1945,2017.0,18.0,August

7649,topic-id,7489,"Mr.Speaker, we have a whole hour here, and we may actually use the whole hour. This is an opportunity to actually walk through three areas that I care an awful lot about.  One, I actually want to walk through something called math, and math in regards to health care. Some of this is actually to deal with--and I don't want to be mean, because I am going to try to do this in as nonpartisan a way as possible, but some of the things that we have just heard moments ago that lack just sort of basic roots in math and facts.[[Page H3312]]                                {time}  1700  Let me move this easel back just a little bit so we can get this. We are going to do a little bit of show-and-tell here to sort of help.  First off, a conceptual problem, since, I believe, it is 1986, we in the United States have had statutes that say, if a sick person walks into a hospital and they have cancer, they are bleeding, they are going to get health services.  This is a really important concept for us all to get our heads around. There is no such thing as not receiving care in this country. It may not be the care you want at the place you want, but it is the law. It has been the law for 30 years.  If we are going to be brutally honest, much of the debate and discussion we are having here, whether it be the ACA or prior to the ACA where it was uncompensated care, where it was disproportionate share within our hospitals, or our reform legislation, it is not whether someone gets coverage or doesn't get coverage; it is who and how it is paid for and where is it paid for.  Remember, these costs are already in the system. Does it go as a loss on a hospital balance sheet? Does it get pushed over to other populations within an insurance pool? That is the math we are actually working on.  A couple of moments ago, you had a handful of Members come up and talk about preexisting conditions. If you hear someone use the term ``preexisting conditions,'' they basically are years out of date. There functionally is no such thing anymore. There is guaranteed issuance of insurance.  We are going to go through this in more depth.  Someone like myself, I am a severe asthmatic. I walk around with an inhaler in my pocket. I can grab any insurance today and I get guaranteed issue.  Whether it be in the current ACA--ObamaCare, as many know it--there are variations in what we refer to as community rating. There are age levels. If you are a smoker, you get a different pricing.  Some of those same mechanics we are doing in our reform bill. We are going to walk through why the way we are doing it we think actually will ultimately lower prices. We are trying to get that efficiency of the young and healthy to participate in the insurance pool, because they are not participating today.  We are going to keep this board close by because this is important for everyone to understand conceptually. I know the chart is hard to see, but 5 percent of the population is 50 percent of the healthcare cost.  Think about this. Of our brothers and sisters who have chronic conditions, they are 50 percent of the healthcare costs, even though they are only 5 percent of the population. That is why we did the risk-sharing model that is being attached to our legislation. We are going to walk more through that.  If you start to think about this curve--for those who want to do some math--it looks like a hockey stick. The healthiest 50 percent only use 3 percent of healthcare dollars. So 50 percent of the population only use 3 percent of the healthcare dollars. Then it comes along and explodes up like a hockey stick. The top part of this hockey stick, this 3 percent of the population up here, whether it be because they are hemophiliacs or uncontrolled diabetics or have other types of great difficulties, that population is 50 percent of the entire cost.  What happened in the current ACA is, let's face it, the model did not work. You remember the whole discussion: keep your doctor; $2,500 savings; fewer visits to emergency rooms, which, actually, emergency room visits have skyrocketed or gone up substantially.  Their model did not work, and mathematically it is imploding. We are going to go through some data, particularly from my home State of Arizona, on how much trouble we are in.  One of the reasons it has not worked is less than half the population of those buying in that individual market are buying. Particularly, if you look at our healthy 20-year-olds, our 30-year-olds, that 50 percent of the population that only uses 3 percent of health care, they are not participating in the insurance pool.  Well, how do you spread risk when you have millions and millions and millions and millions of Americans who are choosing not to purchase because it is too darned expensive or, because the contribution before you receive health care is so expensive and the number of waivers, it is just cheaper to pay the penalty?  So what happens when you are trying to do the math and you have your brothers and sisters here in this body on the other side who either make up facts or just say, ``Well, just keep it as it is''? I am going to make the argument that the cruelty of that is just stunning.  We are going to start to walk through a little bit more of these so we can actually help folks sort of understand this is the underlying math, this is why we must have a substantial change.  Let's go back prerecession, just before the recession. Let's go back here to 2007. We had about 14.6 percent of our population going uninsured. That is unacceptable. Today after having spent almost--as some data says, as much as $1 trillion, but we will stick with a half trillion because that I can absolutely document--$500 billion of subsidies, losses, if you actually add up the losses insurance companies have had, if you add up the copays individuals had, if you actually add up the money that has been spent through the bureaucracies, we have dropped, say, a half-trillion dollars, today we are at 10.9 percent.  If you are on the left, this is the grand success of The grand success of the ACA is that you have gone from 14.6 percent of the population is uninsured, and today it is 10.9? Where is some of the intellectual credibility around this place to at least tell the truth of the math?  If you start to divide up how much we have spent--and we were just doing this on the back of a napkin a little while ago. If you add up the population that has now gained insurance through the exchanges that did not have insurance or access to insurance before, some of the math comes to around only 6 million people.  If you divide that by a half-trillion dollars, that is $84,000 per life for 3 years of coverage. We could have bought them their health insurance and a really nice car. You understand how absurd the current model is.  I am not questioning the good intentions of wanting to help our brothers and sisters have access to health coverage. Now let's make the math actually work.  This chart is really important. This is actually not coming from me. This one, I think, is from Most of the other data we are going to get is going to come from Kaiser or the Congressional Budget  I want you to understand I am going to be Arizona-centric because that is my home I am blessed to represent the Phoenix-Scottsdale area. But let's take a look at my little State down here. We are going to burn through these fairly quickly.  I have about 6.7 million residents in There are 6.7 million residents in This is from  Let's switch to the next board. Of that 6.7 million residents in Arizona, my citizens, how many buy their health care on that individual market? That is what we are talking about.  When you keep hearing the grandiose ``the world is coming to an end,'' how many of my brothers and sisters buy on the individual market? About 278,000 people. That is a lot of people. But if you divide it by our population, it is 4 percent of my population. In my congressional district, it is somewhere around 2 percent of my population.  The elegance of actually being honest about that piece of math is that it helps you understand we can fix this. This is the individual purchasing market.  Let's take one step backwards.  The majority of Americans receive our health care from our employers. Then we come over here: Medicare, VA, Indian Health Service, TRICARE, a number of these things. What we are talking about in the ACA and our replacement is that sliver of our population that is in the individual market and how to reform That is all.  But often when something is complicated, it comes ripe for political hyperbolic language, acting like the world is on fire, instead of being honest and making the math work so we can[[Page H3313]]serve our brothers and sisters with the health coverage we want.  Remember, we have just come back here to Only 4 percent of my population is in the individual market. In my congressional district, it is only 2 percent of the population.  Now, you need to understand that when you hear many of us get behind these microphones and we talk about the system, the current ACA--ObamaCare, as it is known; but I think that is unfair, so let's just call it the ACA--is imploding. For my State, it is. We are going to show you how few choices happen in my This is only between 2016 and 2017.  Do you see this blue right here? If you were in that county, if you were in that individual market, you would have three or more choices.  Do remember that, when this law went into effect, we were promised dozen of choices. Should we hold the left to their own promises? It hasn't happened.  What is happening now, if you take a look all over the country, when you see this chart, county after county after county now has one choice. I want you to see what has happened in my home  First off, statewide in my State, if you were buying the mean exchange plan, that Silver plan, statewide, last year, a 116 percent price hike. That is if you are in Maricopa County and you are buying the mean Silver plan.  Maricopa County is the fourth most populated county in the United States, so it is not just a little outlier. It is the fourth most populated county. It is 64 percent of my State's population in one county.  If there were ever an example of a county that should have had health care efficiency and pricing, it is Maricopa It is a large population. If you were in that mean Silver plan, you had a 145 percent price hike last year.  How can I see people get behind these microphones and act like this system is working? Do you understand the crushing you are doing to people in my State, hardworking people who just want to say: I am the neighborhood plumber; I would like to buy health care?  Either the deductibles have gotten so huge or the underlying price has gone up so high, we are actually seeing something fascinating in the uninsured curve. The uninsured population has now moved into our hardworking middle class because of the number of them that work for themselves that can no longer afford to participate.  We will just say it was one of the unintended consequences of the current But it is one of those occasions we all see the data, and yet how many people get behind these microphones and tell the truth about how many people we are crushing from these deductibles to the current pricing?  You saw the previous chart. We have gone from 14.6 percent of our population uninsured before the ACA to, now, 10.9 percent. We dropped about a half-trillion dollars. That is $500 billion. That is not counting Medicaid expansion. That is just the numbers over here.  We have had testimony in the Ways and Means Committee that we believe only about 6 million Americans were newly insured, newly covered for that half-trillion dollars. Look, it is great they have coverage, but the math doesn't make sense. We could have done this so much more elegantly.  So let's actually take a look at This is 2014. If you go before that, it was even bigger, but take a look at my county. See all those little squares? Those were health insurance providers that were available to you in 2014.  If you go a couple years before that, we had counties that had 15, 18 different possible insurance choices, companies who would provide; today, 2017, you see one little blue square.  We are being told that we are going to have entire counties in my State--and Arizona is unique in that we have only 15 counties in the entire We are going to have entire counties with no insurance provider to that individual market. This is a system that is working?  Take a look at my This is one of the reasons we have been working so hard, why we did the risk-sharing model. This is reality. This is This is my home. My folks have had these massive, triple-digit price hikes. Now they have a single choice, and they are being told next year they may have no choice. This is the reality we are at.                              {time}  1715  So let's actually talk about solutions. How do you deal with this? How do you actually help our brothers and sisters be able to afford insurance? How do you encourage providers to come in and actually participate in providing coverage to that individual market so there are options, there is competition, there is choice?  If you actually think about what drives that price, so why the explosion in price? Well, the current ACA, because of the way it has these three tiers within, we will call it, the community rating--that is where you take all the people in your community who are participating in this insurance population, and say: You don't all get the same price. There are certain adjustments, and some of the adjustments were for age.  So the ACA, ObamaCare, the current law, had three adjustments plus adjustments for smoking and a couple other externalities, and it made the concentration of cost and risk so expensive that--remember our 50 percent of the population who only use 3 percent of health care--they have chosen not to buy, which, in some ways, is a perfectly economically logical reaction to the current cost, to a world where it is so expensive it is cheaper to pay the penalty, so we have to find a way to drive down that cost for that population so they participate.  When you were in school and you would hear the story in your economics class of there are occasions where by lowering the price you make more profit because you sell more units? The concept is pretty much the same here in insurance. If we can lower the price for our healthy population, more participate; we spread the risk over a larger, healthier population; we lower the price for that 5 percent of our brothers and sisters who are in that chronic category; plus we are going to overlay a couple other things to help mitigate that cost to get the price efficiency for everyone. It is important.  I know some of these slides are a little hard to get our heads around, but we have put together something called an invisible risk pool. If you are that American who has bought, who is participating in this individual market but has a chronic condition, you never do a traditional risk pool today because what we learned from the data over the last 30, 40 years of risk pools, there have been a couple successes, but most risk pools, hey, the cost goes up, you hit that sort of threshold, and you dump that person, saying: Hey, you are now the risk pool's problem, or you are the State's problem.  We wanted a continuity of care. We wanted the sick person to receive services where the medical provider, the insurer, and the patient themselves all have skin in the game. They all have a need to participate, to manage, whether it be the individual's diabetes or some other ailments. That is the beauty of sort of this risk-sharing model, that for the population that is our sickest brothers and sisters, as their cost graduates up, there will be participation from this risk-sharing pool.  Why is this absolutely fair? Remember how we talked about how most Americans receive their health care in the employer market? Well, your employer gets a fairly substantial tax deduction for providing that health care. They get to take it off their taxes. Well, we don't do that for when you are in that individual market. When you are in that individual market, for you to be able to take it off your taxes, so we have tried to come up with this methodology to make it fair, so we have come up with this tax credit. But we want you to have the money to help purchase your policy in the beginning, so there is this whole term, sort of this made-up new language that says a prefundable tax credit so you can buy your health insurance in that individual market. So that is on the front end. On the back end, to make sure the premiums, what we call premium efficiency, have stayed low and affordable, we are actually doing this risk sharing up here to help mitigate that spiking of cost so we can lower the prices for everyone so we maximize participation.  There is some elegance in the math, and I think actually there is a great[[Page H3314]]love for our brothers and sisters who have preexisting conditions up here because it is an invisible risk pool. They never know whether their cost is being subsidized by this pool, nor should they. We made a societal decision 30 years ago that someone walks into an emergency room, someone walks into a hospital with a condition, they get services, so the cost is already in the population.  What we have been debating now for years is how do we pay, how do we move the chairs around? But if we are going to get efficiency in lowering premiums for everyone, remember, we need our healthy population over here to participate in this, and then there is a couple other things we are going to talk about.  So functionally what we have done with the risk sharing, it actually accomplishes a couple really great things. One is the obvious part, if you are the insurer, and let's say you are the actuary at the insurer, and you are doing your math, you actually know what your risk exposure is on each life. Why that is important is you don't have to build what is often referred to as a shock absorber in your rates, saying: Dear heaven, what happens if tomorrow I get a handful of folks with a very difficult chronic condition that blows the cost off the charts? I have to build cushion into my rates.  Well, with the risk-sharing model, they no longer have to have the rates padded for that externality that might happen. It becomes this multiplier effect where if I don't have to put that in the rates, I have lower costs over here. If I have lower costs over here, the model says I get a lot more participation in the health care pool, and everyone benefits. That is what we are trying here.  So what do you actually do, if the argument I am making, whether it be the ACA, whether it be our replacement, in many ways what we are discussing is how to pay for the health care that is already in our society. Remember, as we have been talking, there is no such thing, if you are going to be completely honest, as a preexisting condition denying you coverage. There are some cost stratas, but that is in the current ObamaCare ACA, just as in our replacement, but some of that is by age or if you smoke or other things.  How do you actually lower costs? Some of that comes in the next piece of legislation because, as you all know, in the bill we are trying to move now, we have to deal with the rules of we have no one on the left in the Senate who is going to work with us. We are on our own. So we have to find a way to do this with 52 votes in the We don't have eight Democrats who are going to work with us. That means we have to do it through reconciliation. Probably those of you who are interested in this stuff, you have read how reconciliation limits the things we can put into a piece of legislation. If you would like us to have more things, go find us eight votes on the Democratic side in the U. So what do you do to lower costs? We all know information. How many of you can grab your supercomputer you carry in your pocket right now, log into the hospital surgery center--your doctor--and immediately hit a button and say, Hey, the retina detachment, the cataract, the kidney problems I have, here is my cost for the services, here is my cost for the procedure?  We need information. That is going to come, I believe, later this year.  The next thing is, with that information, you create competition. That is incredibly important. Competition in health care comes as much from the price as it does the quality. We have done some great things in collecting quality data. With quality data and price information, we are hoping there becomes now this incentive to actually compare and move around. But what is the next revolution? I am going to make you the argument--and this is one of the elegant things I believe that is also now happening on the Medicaid side of our piece of legislation, and that is to allow creativity at our State levels.  Arizona may have one of the most creative Medicaid systems, we call it AHCCCS in We buy functionally capitated HMO policies for our indigent population. But every time we want to make a change, every time we want to try something new to service our brothers and sisters in Arizona, we have to march over to the Federal Government and get a waiver. We have to get permission from the Federal Well, here is my question to you: Does a poor person--as a matter of fact, anyone, if you are in the individual market, if you are on Medicare, Medicaid, do you have the right to talk to your primary care physician on this? Of course you do. Do you have the right to wear the sensor on your body that helps you manage your high blood pressure? How about this contact lens that is going to be out probably next year that will actually sit in your eye and manage your blood glucose? No more punching a hole in your finger and doing a blood test to check for your blood sugars, your blood glucose. It will be constant, talking to your phone, talking to your pump. If that keeps some of our brothers and sisters with diabetes from crashing, it is great for all of us. It is great for society. It is great for them. It is great for healthcare costs.  There is a revolution coming technologywise. One of the things I found fascinating is they actually have a little thing now where you can put your fingers on it and it does a full There is disruptive technology that is now available and is rolling out. How many of us now wear a Fitbit that helps you manage parts of your health care? This right here is about to bring a revolution in health care.  A simple example, just a thought experiment for anyone who actually cares about these things: In Arizona, the majority of babies are born in our Medicaid system. Even my little girl who we adopted a year and a half ago, I believe she was born in my State's Medicaid system. Most perfect little girl ever.  We know we have a problem in this country and in Arizona, a substantial number of the moms don't show up for their prenatal visits. When we have surveyed them, we get information back that says: It is hard waiting for the bus. It is hot out. Dial-a-Ride makes me wait. Why wouldn't you allow that poor person to hit a button on their phone and have ridesharing pick them up? There are solutions. If we could get our brothers and sisters on the right and the left here to actually talk to each other about solutions, but instead right now health care is such a potent political issue, I can show you article after article after article where the facts that are being disseminated to the American public are completely wrong. We heard some of that just minutes ago behind these microphones where the facts are absolutely made up. It is just incredibly cruel.  Let me explain the cruelty. A couple weeks ago, we were doing just coffees with residents. A group of my constituents who are on the left brought a woman, and she has tears running down her face. She is standing in front of me wanting to know why we are about to take the health care away from her husband who is across the street in the hospital. How cruel does the left have to be to lie, to say something like that to someone because none of that was true. Our bill, their bill, that just can't happen in the language that if you are already in the hospital, if you have a preexisting condition, these things are covered, whether it be from the right or the left's language. But to manipulate someone who is already suffering like that, what sort of cruelty is in someone's soul to get a political advantage to manipulate a wonderful woman who is already suffering with the difficulties of her husband in the hospital?  I beg of you, whether you be on the right or the left, actually read the amendments, actually read the language, understand what reality is, understand we live in a society now where all preexisting conditions have coverage. We already live under a law that has age brackets, if you smoke, variances, but very small variances. Even in the latest amendments, the discussion is, if your State wanted to do a statewide prenatal program, or my State where we have a disproportionate share of our population with diabetes, particularly with my Native-American population, if my State wanted to get everyone together, whether it be Indian Health Service, the VA, private insurers, our Medicare, Medicaid system wanted to try to put together a statewide program to reach out to our brothers and sisters with diabetes, that[[Page H3315]]would be--if the actuaries and the math works--maybe wonderful. That would be an occasion where my State would reach over to the HHS Director and say: Can we have a waiver? We no longer need to have this type of coverage mandated in these individual policies because we are going to do it at the statewide level. I beg of you, think creatively.  How do we cover our brothers and sisters? How do we deal with the reality that a huge number of our population right now is choosing not to buy because of price or have been able to receive waivers substantially because of price?                              {time}  1730  And if we succeed here at driving the price down by our actuarial efficiency, the risk sharing up here, and spreading out, a couple of years from now, we are going to be standing behind these microphones and saying math won out over hyperbolic rhetoric.  So can we talk about a couple of other things that are really, really important?  I am blessed to be on the Ways and Means So why is tax reform so incredibly important to all of us?  Understand, those of you who want to see Medicare, those of you who want to see Social Security stay solvent, do you understand what is happening with economic growth and the pressures right now and what is going on?  So this little pie chart up here is functioning 9 years from now. You have got to understand, in 9 years, only 22 percent of the spending will be what we call discretionary, stuff I really get to vote on, stuff that is not in the formula. Eleven percent will be nondefense. Everything you sort of think of as government--the Park Service, FDA, Education--those things where moneys come to the Federal Government that go to these things is only going to be 11 percent of our spending. Another 11 percent will be defense. Everything else is either Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, or some of the other unearned entitlement programs.  This is substantial because we are graying. You all heard of baby boomers. But the reality of it is, in less than 9 years, every dime of Federal revenues--and we are going to be taking in $1 trillion more. We are going to go from $4 trillion to $5 trillion of revenue. Every dime of Federal revenue will be consumed by what we call mandatory spending, entitlements. Military and every other part of government is going to exist on borrowed money.  So if you are someone who really likes education, if you are someone who really thinks drug research is important, if you are someone who thinks NASA is important, if you are someone who thinks the parks are important, you should care about this.  The reality of it is the math curve, even with a substantial growth in the economy, we are going to have to look at entitlement reform. And I know that sets people off because they are fearful, but it is a lot better than hiding from it.  The thing that makes it less painful is a growing economy. Tax reform, we know, is the single greatest engine, the single greatest lever we have here as Members of Congress to get the economy growing. Fixing the healthcare issue will go a long way to help. Dealing with regulatory, dealing with immigration, dealing with embracing technology into our society and government can all be very powerful for economic growth, because our future does not have to be one buried in debt.  But without a revolution in the way we think around here and a willingness to do tough things--and tax reform is going to be hard, but without it, you are basically sentencing my little 18-month-old girl to a future buried in debt, buried in slow growth.  For those of you who may be my age, who are hoping to receive Medicare and Social Security, you are putting those programs at financial risk, and it doesn't need to happen. We can fix this, but you have got to move it away from the hyperbolic politics and actually start to be willing to own a calculator and start looking at the math.  Why this is so important, right here on this chart, is start to understand, as you get down here--remember, 2027 is functioning 9 years from now, and, actually, only 8 budget years from now. One more time, every dime is consumed by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, and the other handful of mandatory, what we call, entitlements. This is your future. It happens in less than a decade. It is here.  Please, big, bold, dynamic tax reform is the first thing we can do this year, and then we are going to have to continue to move on to technology and everything else to sort of do whatever is necessary to get this economy growing.  This one is a little more difficult, but we wanted to actually hold it up just so that there is an understanding of how fast we move from right now. Today, in 2017, about 7 percent of our total spending is interest. In a couple of decades, we start getting up to where it is 20 percent, a quarter of all of our spending.  And this chart, think of this. In 9 years, interest is 19 percent of the budget. In 9 years, Medicare is 22 percent of our budget, of all of our spending; Social Security is 29. Just add that up. Think of that. Interest, Medicare, Social Security, the three of those start to consume the majority of this institution's spending.  And then you add in what we call mandatory spending, other entitlements, and you start to see, in 9 years, it consumes every dollar of tax revenues. That is really, really important to understand why we need to have this two-phase approach.  Right now we do everything that we can to maximize economic growth and opportunity. And when we talk about economic growth, this isn't just for the top line, big corporations. We need that economic growth of those people that pay the FICA tax. Our brothers and sisters that pay Social Security, our brothers and sisters that pay the unemployment tax, our brothers and sisters that pay into Medicare, we need their jobs to pay more. We need more of them. We need them to have more options in the workplace.  So this is a tax design of how you maximize economic growth not just for big corporations, but for everyone. That concept of: Remember when we were all in school, that sort of velocity of economic opportunity, that mobility? We have been stagnant for a decade. We must, must, must bring it back.  And why these numbers become so difficult--and this chart is a little hard to understand at first. These are the predictions of what economic growth was going to be this year, to understand how much trouble we are really in.  In 2013, the brilliant--excuse me. Yes, let's just make fun of them. The economists around this town were saying: Hey, it is 2013; but by the time you hit 2017, all this stimulus, all this spending, all this debt, you are going to get a 4 percent GDP growth.  You all saw what we had last quarter. What was it, 0.7?  Now, honestly, first quarters the last couple of years have had a distortion, I think, in the seasonally adjusted numbers. But do you think we are going to hit 4 percent GDP this year? Because that is actually what a lot of the budgets were projected on.  So sometimes we will be here in a debate with my brothers and sisters on the left, and they are holding up these charts saying: Well, it is 2013; we are going to be just fine over the next 10 years. And you get into those next 10 years, and you start to realize we are going to be lucky to hit 2 percent.  So much of what we have shared with the American people in the previous decade, the numbers were blatantly wrong, and not to the good side, to a much more difficult side. So when we start to look at this chart--and, once again, 2026 isn't that long from now--you start to realize we are going to be approaching $30 trillion of debt. Why this becomes incredibly important, once again, for all my Keynesian economists out there who think we should just go more into debt, spend and we will get stimulus, now we have built up so much debt that the ratcheting effect you get if you start to raise interest rates and half your debt needs to be refinanced within a 5-year period--they call it a weighted daily average--all of a sudden any new revenues you may be getting from that Keynesian stimulus are being consumed by interest.  Every day we wait to deal with this we lose options on how we can protect Medicare, on how we can protect Social[[Page H3316]]Security, and on how we can protect our economic future. The sooner we do what is necessary in tax reform and all the other reforms and stop some of the crazy squabbling--I am sorry the left lost; well, actually, I am not, but I am sorry it hurt their feelings so much--and maybe come to the table and prove to the American people you actually care about them in a fashion where you are being honest with the math, hold up a calculator and demonstrate that we actually are going to do what is right.  Back to the last part. We are going to do this slide over again because this is really important. Remember, we said part of this is just math.  The economic growth. The part of our society that uses 50 percent of the healthcare dollars is 5 percent of our population. It is all fixable.  So there are two themes here on the first parts of this. In health care, the expense, the cost is already in the system. Whether it be our reform, whether it be the ACA, whether it be before the ACA, the total cost is already there.  What we have been working on are two things. How do you move the cost around so that we can actually lower the cost for that 50 percent that only uses 3 percent so they will actually participate in the insurance market, lowering everyone's rate, instead of what is happening today where they just don't participate?  Remember, you saw the slide. 10.9 percent of the population is not buying health insurance today. They don't have coverage. They are uninsured. Some of that is because of the cost; some of that is because of the waivers. The only way you get them in is that thing we call premium efficiency. We have got to drive down that cost. But if we do that, I am actually pretty optimistic good things are going to happen.  Now, I want to actually take you to something that there really are bipartisan solutions. I am going to make you this argument that technology is the great optionality around this, it is the great unifying thing. I am going to walk you through something, and later I want you to tell me whether this is Republican, Democratic, right, or left. I am going to make the argument it is data.  I live in Maricopa County, the fourth most populous county in the United It is what we call a nonattainment county. It means certain types of pollutants are in excess, and on occasion it spikes up. In the past, we would get a phone call from EPA saying: Hey, one of our monitors shut off. We think we are going to shut down your building permits.  Well, remember how we were just talking about we live in a society where we must have economic growth if we are going to be able to finance and pay for our promises? So I came to you and said there is a much more elegant way to keep the air clean and actually have economic growth: reward those who are following the rules and catch those who are breaking the rules when it comes to polluting our air quality. And it is data.  So right now, here is how we regulate.  You want to open a business. Let's say you want to do a powder coating business in You have to go out and get a bunch of permits from the county, from the State You also submit to the Depending on the types of volatile organics and other things you are using, you may have to file reports every quarter. You have to do a major audit every year.  Does filling up file cabinets full of paper make the air quality cleaner in your community? Seriously, because this is our regulatory model. We basically have a 1938 regulatory model where we make people fill out lots and lots of pieces of paper. We send them in. We hire lawyers and auditors, and we hire consultants to help us fill out this paper, and we shove it in file cabinets down at the air quality regulator or environmental quality regulator. Do full file cabinets make the air quality cleaner in your community?  It is an absurd model when we are all walking around with supercomputers in our pocket. There is now technology coming on the market where you, through Bluetooth, through an actual plug-in, you can actually be walking around with your own air quality monitoring system.  Well, think about my community. If I could have a couple thousand people driving around, traveling around, walking around, hiking around my community getting air quality samples every 5 minutes, at the end of the week I have a couple hundred thousand data points. You put it up on a GIS map, and you catch those who are sinning.  Think about it. It basically is a combination of crowdsourcing citizen science. And the tradeoff is don't make that company fill out lots and lots of pieces of paper or that organization over here fill out lots and lots of pieces of paper and fill up a file cabinet, because if I have enough monitors and sensors moving around the community, if they screw up, you catch them instantly.  It is not like today's world where a couple of years later maybe an auditor catches them; you go to the file cabinet and use the file cabinet as a tool to sue them, but yet you have had 2 years of pollutants in your air. Let's catch the bad guys immediately and leave the good guys alone.  We can do that by this sort of crowdsource data model, the idea that the entire community gets to participate in the collecting of the data. You get to look on the GIS map. The air quality regulator gets to look and say: Hey, we have a hot point over here. Let's go find out what it is. Hey, we found some clowns painting cars in the back of a lot.  Are those clowns out there getting air quality permits to do it? The folks down the street that are using the filters and are in the booth, if they are following the rules, they get left alone, but you catch the ones that have been escaping. It is a use of crowdsource data. We actually have a whole video of this on our website.  We now have introduced a piece of legislation that is over at Energy and This should be a bipartisan piece of legislation because that Republican or Democrat--it uses data to let you know what is happening in the air quality in your community. It uses data to catch bad actors, and it uses data to let you know you can leave good actors alone so they can grow their businesses, so they can pay people more, so there are more job opportunities, instead of spending the money filling up file cabinets and hiring consultants. It is an elegant solution.                              {time}  1745  Is that Republican or Democrat? I will make the argument it is data. There are solutions that both sides around here can use.  So the next time you have someone getting behind these microphones and saying, well, we are deregulating this--no. It is time for a revolution in the way we think.  We are all walking around with these. With the new sensors, you can manage your health care, you can test your water, you can test your soil, you can check the ambient sound, but you can also do the air quality in your community.  I am going to make you an argument there are actually solutions moving around here, and if I can get beyond the hyperbolic rhetoric, maybe we can start to move some of these solutions forward.

7638,topic-id,1926,"Mr.President, it is no surprise that the economy continues to be one of the top issues on the minds of The 8 years of the Obama administration were characterized by weak economic growth, a dearth of jobs and opportunities, and almost nonexistent wage growth. The Obama administration ushered in long-term economic stagnation.  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the economy will grow at a rate of just 1.9 percent over the next 30 years--a full percentage point lower than the average growth rate over the past 50 years. We cannot resign ourselves to that. Resigning ourselves to long-term growth of 1.9 percent would mean resigning ourselves to decades of fewer jobs and opportunities, low wage growth, and a reduced standard of living. Fortunately, there are a lot of things we can do to get our economy thriving again and to spur economic growth.  A recent report from the Economic Innovation Group identified one important problem with our economy today, and that is a lack of what the EIG calls economic dynamism. Economic dynamism, as the Economic Innovation Group defines it, refers to the rate at which new businesses are born and die.  In a dynamic economy, the rate of new business creation is high and significantly outstrips the rate of business death, but that has not been the case in the United States lately. New business creation has significantly dropped over the past several years. Between 2009 and 2011, business death outstripped business birth, and while the numbers have since improved slightly, the recovery has been poor and far from historical norms.  The Economic Innovation Group notes that in 2012--which, by the way, was the economy's best year for business creation since the recession--it still ``fell far short of its worst year prior to 2008.'' This is deeply concerning because new businesses have historically been responsible for a substantial part of the job creation in this country, not to mention a key source of innovation. When new businesses are not being created at a strong rate, workers face a whole host of problems. ``A less dynamic economy,'' the Economic Innovation Group notes, ``is one likely to feature fewer jobs, lower labor force participation, slack wage growth, and rising inequality--exactly what we see today.''  Restoring economic dynamism would go a long way toward boosting economic growth and providing new jobs and opportunities for American workers. One big thing we can do to achieve this is to relieve the burden of excessive government regulations. Obviously, some government regulations are important and necessary, but too many others are unnecessary and do nothing but load businesses with compliance costs and paperwork hours. The more resources businesses spend on complying with regulations, the less they have available for growth and innovation. Excessive regulations also prevent many new businesses from ever getting off the ground. Small startups simply do not have the resources to hire individuals--let alone consultants and lawyers--to do the costly work of complying with scores of government regulations.  Unfortunately, over the past 8 years, the Obama administration spent a lot of time on imposing burdensome and unnecessary regulations on American businesses. According to the American Action Forum, the Obama administration was responsible for implementing more than 675 major regulations that cost the economy more than $800 billion. Given those numbers, it is no surprise that the Obama economy left businesses with few resources to dedicate to growing and creating jobs or that new business creation seriously dropped off during the Obama administration.  Since the new Congress began in January, Republicans in Congress and the President have been focused on repealing burdensome Obama-era regulations. So far, we have saved individuals and businesses approximately $67 billion and freed them from 56 million hours of paperwork. Eliminating burdensome regulations will continue to be a priority for both Republicans in Congress and for the White  In addition to removing burdensome regulations, we need to focus on reforming our Tax Our current Tax Code is strangling businesses, both large and small. Some corporations escape with paying very little in taxes, but others end up paying the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. Meanwhile, small businesses and family farms face high tax rates, at times exceeding those paid by large corporations.  Tax reform needs to address these obstacles to growth. We need to trim our excessive corporate tax rate to make U.businesses competitive in the global economy, and we need to reduce taxes for small businesses so that we do not choke off these sources of growth and innovation. Measures like allowing new businesses to deduct their startup costs and expense more of their investments in machinery and equipment would spur new business creation and help small businesses thrive.  Our goal is to take up tax reform this year, and I am looking forward to that debate. Reforming our Tax Code will go a long way toward restoring dynamism to our economy and encouraging growth, job creation, and better wages.  There are other growth-boosting measures we can take as well, like removing unnecessary barriers that restrict access to capital. Both new and existing businesses rely on capital to help them innovate and expand.  The last 8 years were discouraging years for American workers, but the stagnation of the Obama years does not have to be the new normal. American workers and job creators are as dynamic and creative as ever; we just need to clear the obstacles from their paths. I look forward to working with my colleagues this year as we make putting our economy on the path to long-term health and vitality a top priority for the U. I yield the floor.

Tribute to Brian McGuire  Mr.Mr.President, this is one of those days I never look forward to. In my time in the Senate, I have had a lot of outstanding chiefs of staff. It is a pretty impressive group of men and women who have been in that position with me over the years--none more impressive than the person who, unfortunately, I have to say goodbye to today.  I am here today to pay tribute to Brian McGuire, the chief of staff in my personal office, who is going to be leaving after well over 10 years of service in several different capacities but over the last few years as my personal office chief of staff. He is really a uniquely gifted person. He is one of the most skilled writers I have ever encountered and, in fact, in my career, the most skilled writer I ever encountered. But in addition to that, he is good at a whole lot of other things, too, as I will subsequently describe in my remarks.  As I think back about the chiefs of staff I have fortunately been lucky enough to have, none has been better at so many different things than Brian I always hate to see these talented people go, but we know the best way for each of us to operate is to do what is in our own best interests. Of course, he has reached the point where he has a big family. There are more lucrative alternatives out there--maybe not as much fun and not as meaningful as daily life around here but important to making sure our families are taken care of.  It is hard to know really where to begin with He came to my office in 2007. It was a critical time. I had just been elected Senate Republican leader. We were not in the majority, but I had just been elected to this position. There was a lot of pressure to get things right.  Obviously, I was setting up a new staff in the leadership office. I wanted the best I could find. When we set out to hire a speechwriter, I certainly wasn't envisioning an upstate New Yorker with a master's in philosophy and a resume that included stints at HUD and the Schenectady Daily From HUD to the Schenectady Daily Gazette and a guy from Albany, NY--not exactly what I had envisioned, but that was Brian McGuire, and he quickly proved himself in that role. That wouldn't surprise anyone who knows He is, as I said earlier, a skilled writer. He is bright. He is talented. He is guided by faith and his family. He is also the consummate professional, going above and beyond each and every time, no matter what the challenge, and we have plenty of them. As the years went by, there would be many different challenging situations--communications challenges, policy challenges, political challenges--but whatever the issue, Brian always rose to the moment.  After the 2014 election, when I became majority leader, I asked Brian to leave speechwriting behind and become the chief of staff in my personal office. He agreed, fortunately. He took to his new opportunity to serve the people of Kentucky with similar skill and always good humor.  These days, you would be forgiven for thinking Brian had spent his formative years in Albany, KY, rather than Albany, He is an adaptable guy. He led my office in pressing the Commonwealth's priorities on issues as diverse as industrial hemp, clean coal technology, and the fight against heroin and opioid abuse. So we can see the versatility, from a skilled writer from New York, of all places, to an effective advocate for Kentucky and Kentucky's interests.  Brian will be ably succeeded by another impressive individual, Phil Maxson, a Kentucky native who I know will continue Brian's legacy of service to Kentucky and who will serve with similar distinction.  Brian McGuire probably never imagined he would find himself here. Like me, he grew up dreaming of a career in the Major As he put it, though, you can either hit the fastball or you can't. And since neither of us could, we ended up here. But Brian is more than just another power hitter; he, like his idol growing up, the Mets' Keith Hernandez, is an all-star. Brian is an indispensable utility player who can play every position, and I am not sure what I would have done without him. He is also one of the most interesting guys you will meet. Brian has a great sense of humor and a rather infamous reputation for spot-on impressions. He is probably the only one around here who holds Keith Hernandez and Aristotle in similar reverence and can reference each with similar ease.  At his core, though, Brian is incredibly grounded. He is all about the things that really matter--his Catholic faith, his two beautiful children, Stella and Max, and his wonderful wife Ashley, I am happy to say, is due with their third child next month--just in time for Mother's So Brian has a lot to look forward to as he climbs the next mountain. I hope he takes some time to look back and reflect on all he has accomplished here in his time with us.  Let me say again that Brian McGuire, on so many different occasions, has made me look so much better than I am. I could never thank him enough for the enormous contribution he made not only to my career but to Kentucky and to the So it won't surprise my colleagues to know I am going to miss Brian McGuire a lot.

7676,topic-id,1794,"Mr.President, this May, a spray of pesticide from a nearby orchard drifted over to a field, exposing nearly 50 farmworkers in They soon became sick with nausea and vomiting. Several were hospitalized. The workers described it as a living nightmare.  The chemical they were exposed to is called chlorpyrifos, a neurotoxic pesticide related to sarin gas. It has been in use since it was developed by Dow Chemical over 50 years ago. Today, it is most often used on fruits and nuts, including strawberries, citrus, apples, and pecans from my home State of New It is also used on grains and vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower.  A few years ago, Bonnie Wirtz also experienced the effects of chlorpyrifos. Bonnie is a farmer in She was exposed when spray drift came into her home through the air-conditioner. Her heart started racing, almost to the point of cardiac arrest, and she couldn't breathe. At the hospital, her nurse practitioner told her she wasn't surprised. She had seen others with similar reactions.  About 10 years ago, Claudia Angulo--a farmworker in California's San Joaquin Valley--was exposed to chlorpyrifos when she was pregnant. Claudia worked sorting oranges, apples, broccoli, and other produce treated with the chemical. When her son Isaac was born with a mental disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, she suspected the pesticides she was exposed to.  A few years ago, European scientists tested some of Isaac's hair. He had traces of over 50 pesticides in his body, and the highest concentration was chlorpyrifos. It has long been known that exposure to chlorpyrifos can be deadly. After years of study, researchers in the United States and a number of other countries now believe there is a strong connection between chlorpyrifos exposure and mental disability, ADHD, and memory deficit in children. They believe the chemical damages children's developing brains, even if they are exposed before birth. Latino children, whose parents are exposed to the pesticide, and grow up near fields treated with it, are at the greatest risk.  Scientists believe the pesticide poses a threat even to children exposed to it from produce from the grocery store or through drinking water. The connection is so strong that scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency recommended that the EPA ban all uses of the pesticide in 2015. The agency had already negotiated a ban on household use 15 years ago.  This March, the EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt ignored his own scientists and the body of scientific evidence that chlorpyrifos is dangerous. Instead, he reversed course and refused to ban chlorpyrifos. That is why I rise to talk about this danger to our children.  When moms and dads feed fruits and vegetables to their children, they are trying to do the right thing. They shouldn't have to worry that these foods are laced with dangerous nerve agents. They shouldn't have to worry that the farmworkers who picked that produce or the farmers living near it were exposed.  I have been part of the fight to protect public health and the environment from toxic chemicals most of my life. I remember when Rachel Carson published ``Silent Spring'' in 1962. My father, Stewart Udall, was her champion when she was fiercely attacked by the chemical industry.  Just over a year ago, I led the bipartisan effort to reform the broken Toxic Substances Control I spent several years working to reform how the EPA regulates chemicals, fighting to stand up a credible program that could be respected, that could restore confidence in the EPA on chemical safety.  I am very disappointed to have to do this, to introduce a bill on a related matter, pesticide regulation. Normally, I would argue that Congress should stay out of the business of regulating individual chemicals. That is why the EPA was created, to make thoughtful, science-based decisions on issues that affect public health and the economy.  In his first decision at the EPA, the administrator has shown his hand. He did not respect the science, not even his own scientific team, and not even when the science is overwhelmingly decisive. If the EPA and this administration will not act to protect the public, to protect children, then Congress must.  I have studied the case for banning chlorpyrifos. There is no question it needs to come off the market. In this situation, I believe Congress must step in to protect children's health. That is why I have introduced the Protect Children, Farmers, and Farmworkers from Nerve Agent Pesticides Act--to do what the EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt refuses to do: ban chlorpyrifos.  Let's look at the reasons for banning chlorpyrifos. There are three very good ones. There are three reasons, I believe, this bill is necessary. First, Administrator Pruitt is wrong. The science is established that chlorpyrifos is a threat to health in its current use. The EPA has studied and studied the toxicity of chlorpyrifos for over a decade. I have talked to the scientists who have been studying it for over 30 years.  In a December 2014 risk assessment, the EPA found chlorpyrifos caused unsafe drinking water contamination. Based on that assessment, the EPA formally proposed, in November 2015, to revoke the use of chlorpyrifos on food. As recently as December 2016, the EPA reaffirmed its determination.  The pesticide is intended to act on the nervous system of insects, but it can act on the human nervous system as well. It can cause immediate symptoms like nausea, vomiting, convulsions, respiratory paralysis--as Bonnie Wirtz and farmworkers in California experienced. In extreme cases, it can kill.  More worrisome, even low-level exposure of chlorpyrifos to developing fetuses in young children can interrupt the development processes of the nervous system. Exposure during gestation or childhood is linked with lower birth weight, slower motor development, and attention problems.  Long-lasting effects on child brain development from in utero exposure also include impaired perceptual reasoning and working memory and undermined intellectual development by age 7. Exposure to organophosphate pesticides like chlorpyrifos is associated with changes in children's cognitive, behavioral, and motor performance. In plain English, chlorpyrifos damages children's brains.  Second, chlorpyrifos was one of the most widely used household insecticides until the EPA raised concerns in 2000--17 years ago. Household use was phased out. That same year, the EPA discontinued use of chlorpyrifos on tomatoes altogether and restricted its uses on apples and grapes. Currently, chlorpyrifos is still widely used in agriculture, but its use is on the decline.  In 2012, EPA required no-spray buffers around schools, homes, play fields, daycare centers, hospitals, and other public places. Growers are already working to find alternatives.[[Page S4713]]  The third reason is, scientists, doctors, advocates, I, and many of our colleagues were shocked when Administrator Pruitt changed course on chlorpyrifos in March, choosing to wait until 2022--5 years from now.  The American Academy of Pediatrics wrote a letter to Administrator Pruitt in June telling him that ``EPA has no new evidence indicating that chlorpyrifos exposures are safe.'' As a result, EPA has no basis to allow continued use of chlorpyrifos, and its insistence on doing so puts all children at risk.  The science hasn't changed since the EPA proposed to ban chlorpyrifos in 2015 and in 2016. Only the politics have.  The law should protect Americans from unsafe pesticides. Under the Food Quality Protection Act, the EPA Administrator ``may establish or leave in effect a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on food only if the Administrator determines that the tolerance is safe.''  ``'Safe' means . . . that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will [come] from aggregate exposure.''  If the Administrator can't determine that a pesticide is safe, the Administrator must revoke or modify the tolerance.  In the case of chlorpyrifos, Administrator Pruitt did not determine the pesticide is safe with reasonable certainty, nor could he. Instead, he hid behind his claim that the issue requires years more study.  This issue has been the subject of litigation for many years. When the EPA asked the Federal court overseeing the lawsuit for a mere 6-month extension for more study, the court gave a resounding no. It called the request ``another variation on the theme of `partial reports, missed deadlines, and vague promises of future action' that has been repeated for the last nine years.''  The EPA Administrator has now given himself a 5-year extension. He is failing to follow the Food Quality Protection Act, and he is tying up the Federal Government in more unnecessary and wasteful taxpayer-funded litigation. In the meantime, children, farmers, and farmworkers are at risk because the Administrator refuses to follow the law.  It doesn't stop there. Administrator Pruitt wants to dismantle protections for farmworkers. The EPA is proposing to delay two rules vital to protecting our Nation's farmworkers: The agricultural worker protection standard and the certificate of pesticide applicators rule. Farmworkers have one of the highest rates of chemical exposure among U.workers. They are regularly exposed to pesticides. Despite the urgent need to protect them and their families, they actually are less protected than other workers.  We don't know exactly why Administrator Pruitt is choosing to believe a chemical company over respected scientists at his own Agency and around the world, but we can follow the money and guess one reason. While the President and the Administrator ignore science and the law, they have not ignored Dow Chemical Dow gave the President $1 million for his inauguration. Its CEO attended the signing ceremony when the President issued his Executive order requiring agencies to roll back what he called unnecessary regulations. The CEO even got the signing pen. And the CEO met with Administrator Pruitt shortly before the order not to ban one of Dow's big moneymakers.  Administrator Pruitt may choose to put aside science, public health, and environmental protection in favor of big chemical profits, but Congress should not. I urge all of my colleagues, especially those across the aisle, to stand with me and pass this protection for children, families, farmers, and farmworkers.  I thank my cosponsors and the cosponsors who are coming aboard every day: Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Durbin, Gillibrand, Harris, Markey, Merkley, and  There have been many public health and labor groups that have stood up on this issue--just to name some of them today: National Hispanic Medical Association, Learning Disabilities Association of America, Farmworker Justice, Project TENDR, United Farm Workers, Earthjustice, GreenLatinos, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, LULAC, National Resources Defense Council, Environmental Working Group, Pesticide Action Network, Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, Mana, and others.

7869,topic-id,1133,"Mr.President, for months the American people have been gripped by the sideshow surrounding President It seems like every day another shoe drops on the Russia investigation, another White House staffer is fired, and President Trump tweets something that upends the government and causes our allies to move even further away from us.  Despite all of this commotion, all of the drama, and all of the disorganization, there is one thing that Trump and the Republicans in Congress have carried out since day one with complete precision. They have carried out a comprehensive all-out assault on American workers. Day by day, week by week, month by month, President Trump and congressional Republicans have acted to undermine the safety and economic security of hardworking  Just observe what they have done. On December 8, President Trump nominated Andrew Puzder, who was then CEO of fast food giants Hardee's and Carl's Jr., to lead the Department of That is right. His first major announcement affecting workers was to nominate a man who made his fortune on the backs of hard-working Americans to the top position in government charged with protecting American workers.  On February 1, just days after he was inaugurated, President Trump delayed a rule protecting workers from workplace exposure to a lethal cancer-causing substance called beryllium. On February 3, President Trump stood with big bank CEOs to announce an Executive order to make it easier for investment advisers to cheat hard-working Americans out of $17 billion a year in retirement savings. On March 1, the Trump administration delayed the rule protecting workers from lethal cancer-causing beryllium a second time. On March 6, congressional Republicans followed the directive of big business lobbyists and voted to make it easier for government contractors to steal wages from their employees. On March 16, President Trump released his budget blueprint, proposing to slash funding for the Labor Department, whose job is to stand for American workers, by 21 percent. On March 22, congressional Republicans voted to make it easier for employers to hide injuries and deaths that their workers suffer on the job. On March 24, the Trump administration delayed a rule that required mine operators to conduct safety inspections and tell miners about any hazardous conditions they discovered before the workers go into the mines. On March 30, congressional Republicans voted to block cities from offering retirement accounts to more than 2 million employees who don't have access to a retirement account at work. On April 4, President Trump delayed the rule preventing investment advisers from cheating hard-working Americans out of their retirement savings. This 60-day delay alone cost Americans an estimated $3.7 billion. On April 6, the Trump administration delayed a rule protecting construction workers from deadly silica poisonings. On May 3, Republicans in Congress voted to keep State governments from offering retirement accounts to employees who don't have access to accounts at work, yanking access away from 15 million On May 23, President Trump called for massive budget cuts to the Department of Labor, including the complete elimination of workers' safety training programs, programs for older workers, and funding for workers with disabilities. And on June 23, President Trump proposed exempting the construction and shipbuilding industries from the rule to protect workers from lethal cancer-causing beryllium, a move that could prove fatal to workers in these industries.  That is a pretty despicable record--despicable but consistent. Workers get slammed over and over. Today, Senator McConnell has brought us down to the floor to sock it to American workers one more time before he sends us home for summer recess. Today, we are voting on the nomination of Marvin Kaplan to serve on the National Labor Relations  Pause here for just a second. The NLRB is probably the most important independent Federal agency that you have never heard of. They are responsible for protecting the legal rights of workers to come together and bargain with their bosses for higher wages and better working conditions.  Starting a union is not easy. Large employers fight union organizing campaigns tooth and nail. They hire armies of union-busting lawyers to run smear campaigns against the unions or to delay or kill organizing efforts.  That is why the NLRB is so very important--to serve as a referee that ensures employers play by the rules and workers get a chance to exercise their legal rights. It is the NLRB's job to stand up for workers--workers like the nearly 4,000 workers at the Nissan plant in Canton, MS, who, beginning tomorrow, will vote on whether to elect a union to represent them. That is what the NLRB has traditionally done--stood up for workers. Just last week, they filed a complaint against Nissan, alleging that the corporation has violated the law by running a union-busting drive, warning workers that they would lose wages and benefits if they took the step of joining a union.  It is also the NLRB's job to do the routine but important work of overseeing the elections. Just last month, the NLRB conducted a secret ballot election at Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton, MA, where nearly 300 service workers elected to be represented by SEIU 1199.  With a Republican Congress and President determined to deliver the knockout blow to the middle class, hard-working Americans need an NLRB that is on their side. President Trump's nominee to the NLRB, Marvin Kaplan, has no experience practicing labor law, but we actually know where he stands on protecting workers.  As a Republican House staffer, here is what he has done. He spent years actively working to strip workers of their right to organize under the law. He spent years working to overturn rulings by the NLRB that would protect workers' rights. He worked on the legislation to delay union elections by at least 35 days, giving employers and their armies of lawyers and lobbyists more time to fight off organizing efforts. He worked on legislation to make some workers ineligible to join unions at their workplaces. He even fought efforts to ensure that Americans get paid the overtime they deserve.  So after 8 months, the Republicans are about to go on vacation, but not before they jam the NLRB with a new anti-worker nominee. The biggest problem in Washington is that this place works great for giant employers and for giant corporations with armies of lawyers and lobbyists. But workers and their families just get ignored. President Trump doesn't seem to have any problem turning his back on millions of hard-working people, but that is not what we are here for.  I will be voting against Marvin Kaplan, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4717.txt,2182,VETERANS' ACCESS TO CHILD CARE ACT,2017.0,2.0,May
