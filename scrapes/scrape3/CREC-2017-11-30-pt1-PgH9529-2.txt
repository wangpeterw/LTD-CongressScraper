                          WE NEED LOWER TAXES

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, it has been proven all over the 
world that the most wasteful, least economical, least efficient way to 
spend money is to turn it over to the Federal Government. If this was 
not true, then places like Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela would be 
heavens on Earth. Socialism simply does not work.
  Money left in the private sector does much more to create jobs and 
hold down prices than does any money turned over to government. A 
business that continually wastes money and operates inefficiently will 
eventually go out of business.
  A government agency that wastes money or operates inefficiently just 
uses that as an excuse to ask for higher appropriations. This is what 
the tax cut bill is all about: an effort to leave more money in the 
private sector, where it will create jobs and hold down prices.
  Wealthy elitists come out ahead, even under our socialist, Big 
Government systems. Lower income people come out better when more money 
is left in private hands to create jobs and hold prices down.
  College graduates often wonder why they can't find good jobs. In 
large part, it is because our Federal, State, and local corporate taxes 
are too high, and this has caused us to lose millions of good jobs to 
other countries.
  Mr. Speaker, we need lower taxes.
