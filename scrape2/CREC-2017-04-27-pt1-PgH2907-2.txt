                      HONORING COACH DON DAVIDSON

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Don Davidson for 50 
years of teaching and coaching at Yorkville High School, Aurora 
Christian, and Parkview Christian Academy.
  Coach Davidson's ability to inspire and energize his students of all 
ages has led them to hundreds of victories on the basketball court, 
earning him a place in the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall 
of Fame. Not only does Don hold the second longest home winning streak 
in Illinois history, with 80 wins from February 1988 until February 
1997, but his exceptional coaching has secured 677 career varsity wins, 
10 IHSA regional titles, 5 IHSA sectional titles, and 3 ACSI Great 
Lakes championships.
  More importantly, Don is a generous, compassionate mentor who cares 
deeply about the lives of his students off the court.
  Don, thank you for your 50 years of service to our community and, 
most importantly, for embodying the life of Christ to your students and 
to their parents, like me.
