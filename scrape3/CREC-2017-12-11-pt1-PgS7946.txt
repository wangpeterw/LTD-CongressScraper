SENATE RESOLUTION 356--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT MEMBERS 
OF CONGRESS SHOULD SUBSTITUTE TEACH AT LEAST 1 DAY PER YEAR IN A PUBLIC 
  SCHOOL TO GAIN FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE PREVAILING 
CHALLENGES FACING EDUCATORS AND HOW TO REMOVE OBSTACLES TO LEARNING FOR 
                                STUDENTS

  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 356

       Whereas teachers play a critical role in shaping the minds 
     and lives of children;
       Whereas there were 3,100,000 full-time public school 
     teachers in 2016;
       Whereas approximately 200,000 teachers leave the profession 
     each year;
       Whereas in the 114th Congress, there were more than 3 times 
     as many Members of Congress that had backgrounds in public 
     service or politics than Members of Congress that had 
     backgrounds in education; and
       Whereas Members of Congress should be on the ground in 
     public schools to understand the challenges that educators 
     and students face, including--
       (1) a growing shortage of teachers;
       (2) issues of teacher pay;
       (3) a lack of resources, in both urban and rural areas;
       (4) teacher preparedness;
       (5) chronic absenteeism among students;
       (6) poverty; and
       (7) parental involvement: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes the contributions of teachers to the United 
     States;
       (2) thanks teachers for their service; and
       (3) recommends that each Member of Congress spend at least 
     1 day per year serving as a substitute teacher in a public 
     school.
