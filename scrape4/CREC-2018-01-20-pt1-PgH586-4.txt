                      THE TRUMP TRAVESTY CONTINUES

  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the Trump travesty continues, as it has for 
the last 12 months. We have heard our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle talk about the Children's Health Insurance Program. They are 
very concerned about its passage. Bring it to the floor. It will pass. 
And I guarantee you it will pass in the Senate.
  Your Speaker, our Speaker, said: ``We will advance major legislation 
one issue at a time.''
  Mr. Speaker, that is not what the bill you put on this floor did. It 
is not what the bill that is on the Senate floor did.
  You are right. There is no controversy. Government should not be 
shutting down. It is the Trump confrontation and chaos that continues. 
That is why this government is shut down, and the American people are 
rightfully upset with every one of us; not just Republicans, not just 
Democrats. They are upset that their government is not working.
  Mr. Speaker, bring these issues one at a time to this floor, and some 
will pass and some will not.
  My time has expired, but the people's time is expiring. Let us do our 
work one issue at a time.
