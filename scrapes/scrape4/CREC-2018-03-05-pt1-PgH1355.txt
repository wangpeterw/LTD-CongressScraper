                         COMBATING GUN VIOLENCE

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, since the tragic events at Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, leading American 
companies, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, Walmart, L.L.Bean, and 
Kroger, have taken a leadership role in combating gun violence.
  Last week, all four companies announced that they would no longer 
sell guns to anyone under 21.
  DICK'S Sporting Goods has demonstrated singular courage as the first 
company to establish a minimum age for gun sales and also by announcing 
that it would no longer sell assault-style rifles or high-capacity 
magazines.
  When DICK'S announced these policies, it also challenged Congress to 
show the same commitment to commonsense gun reform. In his open letter, 
DICK'S Sporting Goods' CEO Ed Stack implored Congress to ban assault 
weapons and high-capacity magazines, establish the age of 21 as the new 
minimum age to buy a firearm, and secure an effective universal 
background check system.
  The American business community is already acting to combat gun 
violence. The private sector is ahead of us. Congress must follow suit.
