                     WELCOMING CHAPLAIN ROBERT VICK

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
Bilirakis) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a constituent, 
a true American hero. What an honor it is to introduce Chaplain Robert 
Vick, who currently serves as the American Legion National Chaplain.
  Chaplain Vick lives in New Port Richey, Florida, with his wife of 62 
years. She is present today as well. Together they have 4 sons, 10 
grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.
  In addition to his commitment to his family, the chaplain has a great 
love for our country and a passion for service. A Korean war-era 
veteran of the U.S. Navy, Chaplain Vick has a distinguished record of 
service. He also has been a proud Legionnaire since 1983. I am also 
proud to say that he is a family friend.
  Saying that he feels called to use his ministerial training to serve 
the spiritual needs of other veterans and their families, Chaplain Vick 
was appointed National Chaplain of the 2 million-member American Legion 
last year.
  Even as the U.S. Capitol prepares in honoring another humble servant 
of God tomorrow, the Reverend Billy Graham, I am proud that Chaplain 
Vick offered this morning's prayer in the U.S. House.
