                    TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS POPULAR

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a recent poll shows that the 
American people agree with all of President Trump's major executive 
orders, though they are not likely to learn about it from the liberal 
media.
  Fifty-five percent approve of revoking Federal funding for sanctuary 
cities. Only 33 percent disapprove. Fifty-five percent approve of 
prohibiting refugees from seven countries from entering the U.S. Only 
38 percent disapprove.
  By wide margins, the American people side with the President on 
freezing regulations and Federal hiring, building pipelines, and 
constructing a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.
  As favorable to the President as this poll is, think how much more 
favorable it would have been if the media had not incessantly 
criticized his executive orders.
